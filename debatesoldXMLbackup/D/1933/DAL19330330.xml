    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the Killaloe quarries cannot deliver slates of any size sooner than three or four months from date of order and the same applies to the Carrick-on-Suir slate quarries, and if he is prepared to indicate other sources of supply for Irish slates or waive the provisions requiring persons to use Irish slates in order to qualify for benefits under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to develop slate quarries to the maximum extent.  The present output of the slate quarries does not, however, meet fully the requirements of persons constructing houses.  Every effort to increase the output is being made.  Concrete tile manufacturers are accelerating production of this alternative and quite satisfactory form of roofing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not, perhaps, had his attention directed to my question.  My question was to the effect that in view of the inability of certain quarries to deliver slates, is he prepared to indicate other sources of supply for Irish slates or else waive the provisions requiring persons to use Irish slates in order to qualify for benefits under the Housing Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where it is shown that <i>bona fide</i> steps have been taken to secure roofing material of Saorstát manufacture and it is found that such cannot be procured, while I am not anxious to be over-generous in facilitating such people, I will have to do so.  I will have to give some facilities in cases where it is definitely shown Irish slates cannot be got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Minister that there is no anxiety here to depart from the provisions of the Act.  May I enquire whether the Minister is aware that builders' providers have been informed by the agents for the Killaloe and the Carrick-on-Suir slate quarries that no order can be entertained for fulfilment for less than four months?  It is stated that the Killaloe quarry has orders which will test its capacity for at least three or four years.  In view of that fact, and in order to expedite the construction of houses through the country, will the Minister give some general indication that people may safely go forward with the building of their houses without any apprehension that the grant will be withheld from them if they are unable to procure Irish slates?  Is the Minister aware&mdash;he ought to know it through his officials&mdash; that it is absolutely impossible to get supplies of Irish roofing materials?  I am aware that those interested in the building industry have done all that possibly could be done to get Irish roofing material and they have not been successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite satisfied that it is absolutely impossible to get Irish roofing materials.  I know there is great difficulty in getting Irish slates.  The Deputy mentioned only two slate quarries.  There are quite a number of others.  There is one, for instance in his own constituency and I am told that in that slate quarry there is a large quantity of slates of a smaller size that could be used.  I am anxious to have every available article of Saorstát manufacture used up first before I give anybody facilities to use foreign manufactured articles.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I brought a number of persons, prominent in the financial world, to the slate quarry to which he has referred with a view to getting it developed by private enterprise?  I may assure the Minister we are at present endeavouring to have that development carried out.  I am quite well aware of the existence of that particular quarry and I am doing all I can to have the resources there developed.  In the meantime, in order to serve the paramount interests of housing, it might be advisable if the Minister would waive the provisions requiring persons to use Irish slates in order to qualify for the grant.  He might do so temporarily and later on, if he thought it desirable, he could impose them rigorously.  Otherwise he is going to hold up housing construction considerably and I am sure that is not the policy of the Minister or the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not anxious to do anything that will hold up housing.  I am not anxious, either, to facilitate anybody in the getting of foreign manufactured articles so long as I feel there is any chance of getting articles of Irish manufacture.  Where it is definitely shown to me that suitable roofing material of Saorstát manufacture is not available, there will be no obstacles put in the way of people anxious to complete their houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of numbers of houses where the timber work on the roof has been completed for months and the builders cannot get any Irish slates.  The completion of these houses is consequently held up. Are there not several contracts under the auspices of the Board of Works being held up in a like fashion?</P>

It is not possible at this stage to forecast whether, or when, the scheme can be carried out.</P>

Ochtó a trí (83%) faoi'n gcéad de aos scoile na tíre ar fad atá ag dul ar scoil agus is maith an cothrom é sin i dtír a bhfuil oiread fairsinge tuaithe inntí agus atá i dtír s' againne.  Tá níos mó ná an cothrom sin ag dul ar scoil ins na cathaireacha.  Tá sin so-thuigthe.  Sé'n rud is fearr a bhaineas leis an tinnreamh sin an méadú atá tagtha ar an líon scoláirí atá ins na hárd-ranganna.

Den céad is cúig (105) mic léighinn a chríochnuigh a gcúrsa sa mbliain naoi déag triochad a dó (1932), d'éirigh le 'chuile dhuine aca agus fuair nocha a dó (92) onóireacha ar an scrúdú go léir.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> I dteannta réamh-scrúduithe, uí mor, freisin, do na scoláirí a thagann isteach tré chomórtaisí puiblí Ard-Teistiméaracht na Meán-Scoile a dhéanamh ionnus go mbeidh cúrsa iomlán na Meán-Scoile déanta aca freisin.  Is tré chomórtaisí puiblí a líonadh thimcheall 's fiche (20) folúntas i gColáistí Oiliúna na gCailíní agus seascadh a se (66) folúntaisí i gColáistí Oiliúna na mBuachaillí anuraidh agus bhí dá céad ochtó a dó (282) buachaillí agus dá chéad seachtó a trí (273) cailíní istigh ar an gComórtas.</P>
    <P>Thárla cúrsa iomlán Meán-Scoile bheith déanta ag furmhór na mac léighinn atá á leigint isteach ins na Coláistí Oiliúna anois is féidir níos mó aire a thabhairt do theagasc céird na Múinteoireachta ná do b'fhéidir a dhéanamh roimhe seo.  Chuige sin tugadh clár nuadh isteach go sealadach i gcóir an tséisiuin a thosuigh Meán Fomhair seo caithte.</P>
    <P>Seo íad na buadhanna is mó atá ag an gclár seo:</P>
    <P>(1)  tugtar níos mó aire do oiliuint an mhúinteora;</P>
    <P>(2)  tá socrú déanta i gcóir roinnt speisialtachta;</P>
    <P>(3)  feileann an clár dóibh seo a chuirfeadh cúrsa ollscoile rómpa.</P>
    <P>Tá níos mó úsáide dá baint as an nGaedhilg mar ghnáth-theangain ins na Coláistí Oiliúna i n-aghaidh an lae. Is tríd an nGaedhilg a ghnítear beagnach an obair go léir ins na Coláistí Oiliúna do bhuachaillí Caitiliceacha agus is tríd an nGaedhilg a rinne ó nochad a dó (92%) go céad fé'n gcéad (100%) de na mic léighinn a gcuid oibre go léir sa scrúdú deiridh sa mbliain naoi déag triochad a dó (1932).</P>
    <P>Níl an scéal chó sásúil ins na Coláistí Oiliúna do scoláirí Protastúnacha i ngeall ar an mbeagán Gaedhilge a bhíonn ag cuid de na h-iarrathóirí agus i ngeall ar dheacrachtaí eile, ach tá feabhas maith le tabhairt faoi deara ó bhliain go bliain ar na scoláirí maidir le labhairt na Gaedhilge agus a húsáid. Tá 'chuile chosúlacht go leanfar den fheabhasú.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil an scéal sásúil chó fada is bhaineas sé le tinnreamh agus líon <Col N="1656" /> múinteoirí ní féidir a rádh go bhfuil sin amhlaidh maidir le cóir scoile.  Le linn réim na Sasanach sa tír seo ba dhoicheall leo deontaisí a thabhairt i gcóir tighthe scoile a thóigeál.  Ba mhór leo deontaisí a thabhairt chor ar bith.  Is cosúil nach ró-maith a thaithnigh le Rialtas Shasana airgead do thabhairt as an bPríomh-Chiste&mdash; rud nach ndeárnadar i Sasana féin mar a raibh na Scoltacha faoi stiúradh na ndaoine féin.  Is ro-mhinic nár tugadh na deontaisí chor ar bith&mdash;níor tugadh le linn an Chogaidh Mhóir iad. Ar an abhar sin tá riaráistí ag baint le Tóigeál Teach Scoile nach nglanfar ar níos lugha ná milliún punt.  Táthar ag súil leis an scéal seo a leigheas tré shreath de dheontaisí speisialta a thabhairt i rith na ndeich mblian seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Cé go mbeidh gadh le suim mhaith mhór airgid a chaitheamh leis an gcóir sin a chur ar na tighthe scoile a theastuigheas uatha indiu ba chóir a thabhairt faoi deara go mbeidh cabhair agus cumaoin na mbainisteoirí ag teastáil má táthar le somplaí a dhéanamh de na foirgintí sin&mdash;rud ba cheart a dhéanamh&mdash;do lucht na tuaithe maidir le glaineacht agus slacht.</P>
    <P>Coinnighítear deis réasúnta maith ar an gcuid is mó de na tighthe scoile ach tá uimhir mhaith bainisteoirí nach gcólíonann a ndualgaisí maidir leis na foirigintí atá faoi n-a gcúram a dheisiú in am agus a choinneál i dtreo.  Séard a thagas as seo go dtosuigheann na tighthe scoile ag tuitim as a chéile cheal deisithe i bhfad sul ba cheart dhóibh agus is giorra dá bhrí sin an achar a sheasfaidh siad.</P>
    <P>Maidir le glaineacht gearánann na Cigirí go minic nach nglantar agus nach scuabtar na tighthe scoile 'chuile lá mar ba cheart a dhéanamh cé go gcoinnighítear uimhir bheag scol&mdash; scoltacha clochair agus roinnt áithrid de na scoltacha atá faoi chúram ban &mdash;go glan slachtmhar.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an obair a déantar ins na scoltacha is áthas liom a rádh go gcólíonann an chuid is mó de na múinteoirí a gcuid dualgaisí go sásúil. Tá thimcheall's triochad fé'n gcéad <Col N="1657" /> (30%) de na múinteoirí &ldquo;sáréifeachtach&rdquo;, seascad a cúig fé'n gcéad (65%) &ldquo;éifeachtach&rdquo; agus thimcheall's cúig fé'n gcéad (5%) &ldquo;nea-éifeachtach&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Dá dtuibharfadh cuid mhaith de na múinteoirí níos mó aire, ámh, do scéimeanna cúramacha oibre a leagadh amach agus dá gceachta a ullamhú roimh-ré 'chuile lá bheadh toradh níos fearr ar a gcuid saothair.  Tá go leor múinteoirí ann freisin agus, toise nach leanann siad sin den stuidéar, níl an toradh a mbeadh súil ag duine leis ar a gcuid oibre, cé gur áthas liom a rádh go bhfuil feabhas éigin togtha ar an scéal seo.</P>
    <P>Rinne múinteoirí gearán go bhfuil an iomarca abhar ar an gclár i ngeall ar go bhfuil dhá theanga ann i dteannta gnáth-abhar chláir na Bun-Scoile.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí Có-dháil chláir na Bun-Scoile ag leagadh amach an chláir cuireadh teora le méid na n-abhar mar gur ceapadh go mb' fhéidir go bhfuil an iomarca abhar ar an gClár i gceimidheacht le fad an lae do obair Bun-scoile.  Tá fúm Coiste beag de mhúinteoiri agus de chigirí a chur ag scrúdú na ceiste seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cúrsaí Meán-Oideachais is áthas liom a rádh go bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar an scéal ar gach bealach.  Tá an méid Meán-Scoil agus an líon scoláirí ag dul i méid ó ló gó ló agus níl aon chosúlacht go bhfuil deire fós curtha leis an méadú sin.  I gcomparáid leis an mblian roimhe seo bhí sé scoltacha ceaduithe ann thar mar bhí agus bhí beagán os cionn míle scoláire sa mbreis ag dul ar scoil.  Sé scoltacha agus trí céad (306) agus triocha míle agus a ceathair (3004) scoláirí na humhreacha a bhí ann don bhliain scoile 1931-32.</P>
    <P>On gcaoi a bhfuil uimhir na Meán-Scoil agus líon na scoláirí ag dul i méid in aghaidh an lae le deich mbliana anuas is léir go bhfuil níos mó measa i bhfad ar mheán-oideachas thar mar bhíodh.  Séard ba bhun, ar bealach, leis seo an soláthar a rinne na Comhairlí Contae i gcóir scoláireachtaí ó Bhun-scoltacha go dtí Méan-scoltacha, ach thárla nach bhfuil aon scoláireacht d'aon chineál ach ag cothrom beag de <Col N="1658" /> na scoláirí, is follus go bhfuil cuid mhaith daoine sásta go leor a fhuilingt iad féin i dtreo go mbeadh siad in ann meán-oideachas a thabhairt dá gclainn.</P>
    <P>Maidir le teagasc tríd an nGaedhilg is féidir a rádh go bhfuil sé ag dul ar aghaidh go maith.  Tháinig méadú ar uimhir na scol 'na rabhthas ag múineadh gach adhbhar leighinn (ach amháin Béarla) tríd an nGaedhilg, ó ceathair fichead sa bhliadhain Naoideag guocad-guocad a haon (1930-31) go ceathair déag ar fhichid sa bhliadhain Triocad a haon-tri a dó (1931-32).  Is é sin an méadú is mó dá raibh ortha aon bhliadhain ó deineadh idirdhealbhadh ar na scoltaibh Gaedhealacha agus ar na scoltaibh Dhá-Theangacha sa bhliadhain 1924-25. Ní raibh an Ghaedhilg 'na gnáthádhbhar teagaisc an bhliadhain úd ach i poinne a seact (0.7) fén gcéad de na scoltaibh, ach bhí sí ag breis agus 11 fén gcéad díobh sa bhliadhain (1931-32).  Tháinig méadú beag ar uimhir na scol 'na ndéantar cuid den teagasc tríd an nGaedhilg.  Táthar ag dul ar aghaidh go h-an-mhaith le múineadh trí Ghaedhilg i scoltaibh na gcailíní, ach níl an dul ar aghaidh céadna déanta i scoltaibh na mbuachaillí.  Cé gur léan le luadh é níl ach cúig cinn de scoltaibh na mbuachaillí ag déanamh teagaisc iomláin tríd an nGaedhilg, ach táthar á dhéanamh i naoi scoltaibh fichead do scoltaibh na gcailíní.  Tuigtear go bhfuil deacracha móra sa slighe; agus fuarthas faisnéis faoi leith ó gach scoíl i dtaobh na ceiste sin, i gcaoi agus go mbeadh an scéal uilig faoi ár mbrághaid chun é bhreathnú le chéile.  Tá eolas tairbheach ar fagháil de bhárr na faisnéise sin, agus tuilleann roinnt mhaith de na bainisteoirí ár mbuidheachas mar gheall ar an gcongnamh a thugadar dúinn.  Do réir na bhfreagraí a fuarthas deallruigheann an scéal go bhfuil sé ar cumas do mhórán de na múinteoirí na hádhbhair léighinn do mhúineadh tríd an nGaedhilg.  Ní mar a chéile na deacracha uile dá ndearnadh tagairt; tá éagsamhlacht aca le n-a chéile do réir chineáil agus ionaid na scol, agus a leithéid sin eile.  Ach seo iad na connstaicí is minicí atá luaidhte i sna faisnéiseacha: neamhchumas na scoláirí an tairbhe is mó do <Col N="1659" /> bhaint as an dteagasc trí Ghaedhilg; ganntanas leabhar oireamhnach do gach ádhbhar léighinn; neamh-chás na ndaoine sa cheanntar, agus neamhshuim nó námhadas na dtuismidtheoirí. Tá na neithe sin 'á meadhadh go cúramach faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Tá obair na meadhon-scol ag dul chun cinn go maith.  Tá éadtromú ar an gclár léighinn ó cuireadh ÁrdChúrsaí agus Bun-Chúrsaí ar bun do na hádhbharaibh éagsamhla; agus táthar ag súil, ó tá breis chaoitheamhlachta ar fagháil dá bharr sin, go bhféadfar tuille ádhbhar do mhúineadh feasta do réir riachtanaisí na scoláirí.</P>
    <P>Ní fada go mbeidh tortha an chéad sheasúin a hoibrigheadh faoi Acht an Ghairm-Oidis ar fagháil i bhFaisnéis Bhliadhantamhail na Roinne.  Do réir faisnéise, do freastaladh na scolta go maith&mdash;bhí a haon seascad míle ocht gcéad agus seisear déag ionnramh sna rangaibh&mdash;tá níos mó fagháil ar oideachas; tá feabhas ar na cláraibh léighinn agus ar fheisteas na scol, agus samhluightear ón dtuairisc go bfhuil tosú maith déanta chun an tAcht do chur i bhfeidhm.  Ní féidir, dar ndóigh, breith do thabhairt ar oireamhnacht chlár-léighinn i gceann aoin-bhliadhna; ach is féidir a rádh go ndearadh an tionnscnamh go prapamhail agus go slachtmhar.</P>
    <P>Is i gcás an oideachais leanamhnaigh, dar ndóigh, a rinneadh an t-atharrú ba mhó; agus is oideachas é sin atá ceaptha do dhaoinibh óga tar éis an bhun-scoil d'fhágáil dóibh agus le linn iad do bheith 'á n-ullmhú féin d'obair gharma.  Do chuir na Cómhairleacha uilig, beagnach, ranga lán-chúrsa leanamhnacha lae ar bun, agus meastar go raibh idir seacht míle agus ocht mile scoláire 'á bhfreastal.  Do cheap an Roinn bun-riaghalacha áirithe chun na cúrsaí sin do stiúrú, ach ní dearnadh aon iarracht ar chlár oideachais do cheapadh dhóibh.  B'é ár dtuairim nach mbeadh de thoradh ar a leithéid sin de chlar léighinn, a cuirfí i bhfeidhm go dlúth, ach mar bheadh sórt caighdeáin, agus nach mbeadh sé so-fhorbartha a dhóthain i gcómhair gach riachtanais agus gach saghas <Col N="1660" /> gnótha.  Bhí gnáth-chúrsaí ar siubhal i ngach baile mór, 'nar leanadh de bhun-teagasc an scoláire agus 'na ndearnadh fairsingiú eolais dó; do múineadh obair stuamdha láimhe dhó, agus do rinneadh iarracht ar a aigne do dhíriú i dtreo tráchtála nó siopadóireachta nó tigheasachta.  Do bhí cúrsai speisialta ar siubhal, freisin, i gcómhair ceárdachta airithe; cuir i gcás, an cúrsa dhá-bhliadhan i nAth Cliath chun daoine d'ullmhú i gcómhair cluig agus uaireadóirí do dhéanamh; ach ní féidir a leithéidí sin do chur i n-órd agus i n-oireamhaint i gceart do bhrigh nach féidir cora do dhéanamh le máighistrí na gceárd go nglacfaidís na foghlaimeoirí ar tuarastal.  An rud is oireamhnaighe do na bailte móra, b'fhéidir, gnáth-chúrsa blaidhna i dtosach, agus bliadhain nó dhó d'oideachas speisialta 'na dhiaidh sin.</P>
    <P>B'iongantach an dúil a bhí ag lucht na tuaithe san ghnáth-oideachas lae, agus bhí na hiarrthóirí chómh iomadamhail sin i gceanntaraibh áirithe go mba dheacair ionad do thabhairt dóibh uilig.  Do hoscladh tuille árus dóibh le linn an tseasúin seo, ach mar sin féin is ar éigin is féidir do na Cómhairleacha eisteas do thabhairt dá bhfuil d'iarrthóirí ag lorg ionad sna rangaibh.  Is ró riachtanach go stiúróchthaí aigne na ndaoine óg ag scoltaibh leanamhna na tuaithe chun obair le n-a mbeidís sásta do ghlacadh ag baile, agus gabháil le curadóireacht nó le céird éigin, i n-ionad deifir do bheith ortha ag teicheadh leo chuig an baile mór. Ceaptar go bhfuil tuigsint mhaith ag na Cómhairleacha ar an méid sin. Pé lucht atá ar na cláir léighinn ar leithligh bhíodar oireamhnach a ndóthain don ghnó dár ceapadh iad. Sampla ar na scoltaibh leanamhna is eadh ceann áirithe 'na bhfuil dó fichead buachaill agus sé fichead cailín.  Tugtar oileamhaint do na cailíní i gcúrsaí Tighis agus Sláinte agus Banaltranais Othar ar feadh trí huaire déag de sheachtain seacht n-uaire fichead teagaisc; agus caitheann na buachaillí cheithre h-uaire déag de sheachtain ocht n-uaire fichead ag gabháil d'Obair Adhmaid, do Chéimseata Ealadhanta Curadóireachta, do Límidheacht, agus do <Col N="1661" /> Chúntasaidheacht.  Ní féidir a cheilt go rachadh a leithéid sin de chúrsa go mór chun leasa d'aosóga na tuaithe, ach an mhúinteoireacht do dhéanamh go maith.</P>
    <P>Níl borradh chómh mór ag teacht ar na Scoileannaibh Leanamhna Páirtaimsire, agus atá ar na Scoileannaibh Lán-aimsire, cé go bhfuil éirighthe leó thar bárr in áit nó dhó Nuair a cuimhnightear ar a fheabhas agus a éirigheann le scoileanna leanamhna páirt-aimsire i dtíorthaibh eile, is deacair a thuigsint cad 'na thaobh ná glactar níos fonnmhaire leó i nEirinn. Bh'fhéidir gurab' amhlaidh bhíonn follamhntasaí i gcóir oibre Páirtaimsire níos líonmhaire i dtíorthaibh eile ná mar a bhíonn i nEirinn, do dhaoinibh óga idir a ceathair déag agus a sé déag de bhlianaibh.  Má is mar seo atá, ní foláir nó gur mó an claonadh atá i nEirinn, i dtreó tinnrimh ar scoileannaibh lán-aimsire.  Fairis sin, is deacair scoileanna leanamhna páirt-aimsire do chur ar bun i gceanntaraibh tuaithe; is deacair clár-oibre a bheadh iomlán go leór do chur i bhfeidhm; is deacair árus oireamhnach d'fhagháil, agus caithtear cur suas le sna deacarachtaí a leanann síor-athrrú ar mhúinteóiríbh.  Ach gheibhtear an ceann-smách ar na deacarachtaibh seo, le taithighe.  Tá aon-aragóint amháin go láidir ar thaobh na scoile páirtaimsire, mar thosnughadh ar ré Scéime ar bith.  Cabhruigheann scoil de'n tsórt san leis an gComhaltas, chun a fhagáil amach gan ró-chostas, cia aca an féidir an ceanntar san do chur chun cinn agus arbh' fhiú scoil lán-aimsire do chur ar bun ann.</P>
    <P>Cé nách ionann an Cheárd-scoil agus Scoil Leanamhna maidir le h-aidhm ná le clár, cuirfear ranganna ceárdamhla agus ranganna leanamhna ar bun in san árus céadna.  Ba chiallmhaire iad do bheith i dtighthibh fé leith, ach ní bheadh so tionnscalach sa tSaorstát.  Soláthruightear árus fé leith, de ghnáth, i dtíorthaibh eile, do'n Scoil Leanamhna i gcóir an duine óig, 'á ullmhúghadh féin do chum oibre; do'n Cheárd-scoil i gcóir na bpríntíseach, agus do'n Cheárd-scoil Oidhche i gcóir na máistrí.  Ach níor bha tionnscalach a leithéid sin a dhéanamh annso, de bhrígh gur <Col N="1662" /> scáinte é líon ár ndaoine.  Caithfidh na ranganna leanamhna agus roinnt bhuidhean do Phríntíseachaibh, feidhm a bhaint as foirgneamh na Ceárdscoile as-ló, agus na ceárd-bhuidheanta i gcóir daoine ar ceal-oibre, as t-oidhche.</P>
    <P>Tá luigheadú coitcheann ar an uimhir de dhaoinibh óga a bheadh díreach tar éis cur suas de'n bhunscoil, a dhéineann tinnreamh ar na rangannaibh oidhche, agus táthar ag tnúth nách fada go mbeidh cosán déanta ó'n mBun-scoil go dti an Scoil Leanamhna as-ló, agus annsan, tar éis tosgnuighthe ar obair, ó'n Scoil Leanamhna as-ló go san Scoil Príntíseach as-ló, nó go sna Rangannaibh Ceárdamhla as t-oidhche.  Ar an gcuma so, beidh scoláirí a chaith dhá bhliain ag déanamh stuidéir ag na scoileanna leanamhna lán-aimsire, ag tinnreamh ar na rangannaibh oidhche, agus cuirfidh san feabhas nách suarach ar oilteacht na Scoiloidhche.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cómh-oibriú na bhFostathóirí ar Riaghlachaibh Tráchtála, caithfar glacadh go fóirleathadamhail le bun-riaghlachaibh áirithe sul is féidir an dul-chun-cinn is riachtanach a dhéanamh i gcúrsaí Ceárd-Oideachais sa tír seo.  Caithfidh lucht gnótha glacadh le h-éigean-tinnreamh Príntiseach ar na rangannaibh; caithfidh siad a bheith toiltheannach ar a chur d'fhiachaibh ar na príntísigh tinnreamh ar na rangannaibh ar feadh tréimhse áirithe, agus gan leigint dóibh leanamhaist in a bpríntíseachaibh mara nglacfaidís le sin mar choingheall bhunúdhsach; caithfidh gach príntiseach le céird fé leith, i gceanntar, teacht ar tinnreamh; ní fágfar aon lúb-ar-lár maidir le príntíseachaibh an tighe seo ná an tighe úd, agus caithfar oilteacht agus dul-chun-cinn na bpríntíseach do fhionnadh ó am go h-am.  Is féidir é seo go léir, agus a lán eile, do dhéanamh, tré bhíthin Achta na Príntíseachta, ach níor dhein lucht gnótha aon iarracht, go n-uige seo, ar aon-fheidhnn a bhaint as coingheallacha an Achta san.</P>
    <P>Tuigeann an Roinn a riachtanaighe agus atá sé, oileamhaint a dhéanamh ar an lucht oibre i dTionnscal nua, ach ní fuirist é a dhéanamh i <Col N="1663" /> gcómhnaidhe, go mór mór ó bhíonn a lán de sna tionnscalaibh nuadha so, ag bhraith ar ghléiseanna costusamhla nárbh' fhéidir leis na Cómhaltasáibh Gairm-Oideachais a cheannach leis an méid airgid a bhíonn fé n-a riar. Ach tá Scéim ag an Roinn, le n-a bhféadfar tri ceathramhna de chostus oileamhna Príntíseach agus lucht foghluma sa ghnó san, d'íoc leis an lucht gnótha.  Is ceaduighthe an oileamhaint do dhéanamh in árus na monarchan, agus beidh an Roinn toiltheannach ar chabhrú i gcómhnaidhe chun múinteóirí oilte oireamhnacha do sholáthar, muna an féidir leis an lucht gnótha a léithéidí d'fhagháil.  Tríd a's tríd, is beag an fheidhm a baintear as an Scéim seo, cé gur minic a dhein an Roinn é a chur fé bhrághaid lucht gnótha.</P>
    <P>Ní fada ó ritheadh an tAcht Oideachais Gairme Beatha ach is mór an dul-chun-cinn atá déanta cheana chun cóiríocht scol do sholáthar do ranganna leanúna agus do cheárdranganna. I gCathair Bhaile Atha Cliath, áit a raibh dian-ghá le breis seomraí ranga, cuireadh seomraí nua le Ceárd-Scoil Shráid Bolton; ceannuigheadh Halla-Bhaile Pembróc le haghaidh Scoil Leanúna agus Scoil Tráchtála lae; agus tógadh Halla Bhaile Ráth O Máine ar léas le haghaidh scoil lae agus scoil thráthnóna do Bhanachas Tighe.  Tá pleananna i gcomhair na Scoile Tráchtála nua i gCathair Chorcaighe beagnach réidh.  Na foirgintí nua a cuireadh le Ceárd-Scoil Luimnighe tá said réidh anois agus daoine ag obair ionta. Táthar tar éis píosa talmhan a cheannach le hais Scoil Phort Lairge chun cur leis an scoil sin, cuireadh na pleananna fé bhrághaid na Roinne agus glacadh leo.</P>
    <P>Maidir le bailte eile tá scoil nua Bhrí Chualann beagnach réidh agus féadfar obair na scoil-bhliana nua a chur ar siubhal ann i Meadhan-Foghmhair. Áth Luain, Caiseal na Mumhan, Droichead na Banndan, Maghchromtha, Caisleán an Bharraigh, Béal an Átha, Cathair na Mart agus Guaire áiteanna eile a bhfuil tógáil na scoil nua ag dul ar aghaidh go maith ionta.  Glacadh le pleananna i gcóir <Col N="1664" /> scol nua i mBaile an Chábháin, in Ospuidéal Ghleanna Áine, sa Chaisleán Nua, sa Teampall Mór agus i mbailte eile agus is gearr go dtosnóchthar á dtógáil.  Tá go leor scéimeanna eile á gcur i bhfeidhm nó á mbeartú chun seanfhoirgintí d'atharú nó d'fhairsingiú.</P>
    <P>Is fiú tagairt a dhéanamh do scéim inspéise eile&mdash;scéim le scoileanna beaga is gan ach trí seomraí ionta do sholathar do cheanntair tuaithe atá líonmhar fé dhaoine.  Táthar ag iarraidh a leithéid de scoltacha cheana féin do Bhuidheachar (Co. Mhuineacháin), don Cheathramhain Rua, agus do Rosmuc (Co. na Gaillimhe) agus d'áiteannaibh eile.

    <P>Sul a gcríochnuighidh mé mo chuid cainnte fá na mór-phoinntí a bhaineas le leathanú agus tabhairt i dtreis na Scéim seo, tá comhairle speisealta agam le cur i láthair Lucht na gCoistí féin.  Ba mhaith liom a chur ar a súile dóibh gur fíor-riachtanach an rud do gach Coiste a choiméad go bhfuighidh siad i gcomhnuidhe an té is fearr le fagháil mar Phríomh-Oifigeach Feidhmiúcháin.  Is ceart do Phríomh-Oifigeach Feidhmiúcháin oideachas maith comthrom bheith aige i ngnótha coitchianta an tsaoghail; agus, le n-a chois sin, caithfidh tréineáil speisialta bheith fáighte aige le h-aghaidh a chuid oibre féin.  Mur' mbéadh sin aige, ba deacair dó na cúrsaí oideachais a chur i n-eagar agus i n-oireamhain a chéile, idir chúrsaí i bpríomh-ádhbhair léighinn agus chúrsaí i dtráchtáil agus i dtalmhaidheacht.  Rud eile: caithfidh sé bheith comh h-eólach ar scoileanna agus ar mhic léighinn agus nach mbéadh moill air gach deacracht dá mbaineann leó a réidhteach go ciallmhair tuigseach.  Tá fir de'n chinéal sin tearc go mhaith; ach ní misde a leithéidí a chuartú agus a mhealladh chun na h-oibre ins na <Col N="1665" /> postaí tábhachtacha sin faoi na Coistí, má's linn obair an Ghairm-Oidis a chur chun cinn mar is cheart.</P>
    <P>Faoi fhó-mhír B (2), táthar ag cur míle ocht gcéad is seachtmho púint (£1,870) ar fagháil le n-a roinnt i n-a dheóntais speisialta ar Choistí Gairm-Oidis le h-aghaidh Oideachais Leanamhnaigh nó Ceárd-Oideachais ins an Ghaedealtacht.  Tá sin dá dhéanamh de réir Alt 103 (2) den Acht Oideachais Ghairme Beahta, 1930, agus, ins an am i láthair, táthar ag brath na deóntais a chur i n-úsáid mar leanas:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Foirgneamh nuadh a dhéanamh le h-aghaidh Ceárd-Scoile i nGaillimh.</P>
    <P>(2)  Páighe breise a thabhairt do mhúinteóirí a bhéas ag obair ins an Ghaedhealtacht agus a dhéenfas an teagasc fríd Ghaedhilgh.</P>

    <P>(4)  Scoláireachta a thabhairt do mhic léighinn as an Ghaedhealtacht.</P>
    <P>Ins an Mheastachán seo an Cheárd-Oideachais tá dá míle naoi gcéad seachtmhó a trí punt (£2,973) leagtha amach do chúrsaí áirithe de Thréináil speisialta le h-aghaidh múinteóir a bhéas ag obair faoi Scéimeanna Áiteamhla Gairm-Oidis.  Tá Mile ceithre céad is fice punt (£1,420) de'n tsuim sin ag teastáil le haghaidh an chúrsa tréineála do Ádhbhar Múinteóir i n-Obair Láimhe a cuireadh ar bun i Scoil na gCeárd i bPortláirge le gairid. Cuireadh an cúrsa seo ar bun le múinteóirí maithe oilte i n-Obair Láimhe a chur ar fagháil do cheanntracha na Gaedhealtachta&mdash;múinteóirí a bhéadh i n-innimh a gcuid teagaisc a thabhairt uatha fríd an Ghaedhilg.  Tá an Roinn an-tsásta le toradh na h-oibre a rinneadh faoi'n chúrsa go dtí seo; agus is é a mbaramhail go n-éireóchaidh leis na múinteóirí atáthar a thréineáil amhlaidh, go n-éireóchaidh leó teagase i n-Obair Láimhe a thabhairt uatha i gceart i gceanntracha na Gaedhealtachta. I dtaoibh an chuid eile de'n Dá míle, naoi gcéad seachtmhó a trí <Col N="1666" /> punt (£2,973), tá sé ag teastáil le h-aghaidh cúrsaí samhraidh do mhúinteóirí atá ag obair san am i láthair faoi Choistí Gairm-Oidis.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh Coiste ar bun le h-atheagar a chur ar an ghléas a bhí i bhféidhm le h-aghaidh na Scrúduighthe i gCéard-Scoltacha do dhaoine a ghníodh freastal ar ranganna an tráthnóna; agus táthar ag súil go mbéidh an Tuarasgabháil réidh ag an Choiste seo sar a bhfad.  Ar feadh m'eólais ar a gcuid oibre, rinneadh mion-scrúdú cúramach ar an ghléas a bhí i bhféidhm go n-uige seo agus molfaidh an Coiste athruigheacha tábhachtacha a dhéanamh ar an ghléas sin&mdash;go h-áithrid sa mhéid go mbaineann sé le scrúduighthe do ranganna Lucht Ceirde.</P>
    <P>I dtaca leis na ranganna atá ar siubhal faoi stiúradh na gCoistí Gairm-Oidis cuireadh ath-eagar ar an módh a bhí i bhféidhm go dtí seo chun cunntaisí do chur isteach fá lucht na rang agus fá n-a gcuid oibre; agus táthar ag súil go mbainfear eólas a bhéas fíor-úsáideach as an méid atá le rádh fá na gnaithe sa chéad Tuairise eile Chinn Bliadhna a fhoillseóchar ag an Roinn.</P>
    <P>Comh fada a's is féidir é, ní leigfear cailín ar bith isteach feasta sa Scoil Tighis i gCill Áirne ach amháin Gaedhilgeóirí óga atá i n-a gCainnteóirí Dúthchais.  De thairbhe an teagaisc a bhéarfar sa scoil sin táthar ag súil go mbéidh neart cailíní tighe agus cailíní aimsire eile le fagháil a mbéidh an Ghaedhilg go líomhtha beacht aca.</P>
    <P>An bhliadhain seo a chuaidh thart, tháinig laghadú ar an méid páiste atáthar a choinneáil ins na Scoltacha Ceartúcháin agus ins na Scoltacha Saothair, rud nar thárla le dornán maith bliadhanta go dtí seo.  Ar an 31adh de Mhí Iúil, 1932, bhí na páistí seo 6,768 ann, agus bhí siad 6,806 ann, ar an dáta chéadna de'n bhliadhain roimh ré.  12 dhuine an laghadú a tháinig ar lucht na Scoltacha Ceartúcháin, agus tháinig lucht na Scoltacha Saothair anuas fá 26 dhuine. Ach ní ar siocair níos lugha páiste bheith dá gcur chuig na scoltacha seo <Col N="1667" /> a tháinig an t-athrú.  Tháinig sé ann ar an ádhbhar gur leigeadh a gceann le níos mó ná mar ba ghnáthach.  I mliadhain a 1931-32, cuireadh 16 dhuine chuig na scoltacha seo de bharraidheacht ar an méid a cuireadh chuca an bhliadhain roimh ré.  981 a bhí siad ann go h-iomlán, agus chuaidh 954 aca chuig na Scoltacha Saothair agus 27 chuig na Scoltacha Ceartúcháin.</P>
    <P>Tá an-chuid páiste ins na Scoltacha Saothair&mdash;barraidheacht, dá mbéadh neart air.  Ach, ós a choinne sin, is cóir cuimhneamh ar seo: go dtáinig athrú, le tamall, ar an úsáid atáthar a bhaínt as na scoltacha seo.  I n-áit bheith i n-a gcinéal de phríosúin ag páistí a gheibhthear cionntach i gcortha, is é an rud atá siad anois i n-a n-áruis ag páistí fíor-bhochta atá fágtha gan bhaile, gan mhuinntir. De'n méid páiste a cuireadh chuig na scoltacha seo i mbliadhain a 1931-2, rinneadh sin le beagnach a leath (48%) de thairbhe boichtíneachta, de réir mar cheaduigh Acht Leasúcháin bhliadhain a 1929.  Ní tháinig ach 6% aca de thairbhe an Acht Freastail Scoile, agus ní tháinig 4% féin aca ar siocair earráideach a bhféadfaidhe cortha a thaibhairt ortha go fíor.</P>
    <P>Le bliadhain thart, rinneadh iarracht le gléas níos fearr a chur ar fagháil ins na Scoltacha Saothair le h-aighaidh gnáth-oideachais na bpáiste atá ionnta.  Na bainisteóirí atá ar scoltacha na ngirseach, thoiligh siad uilig leis an chomhairle a tugadh dóibh i n-a thaoibh seo, agus, amach ó thriúr, rinne bainisteóirí scoltacha na ngasúr mar an gcéadna.  Tháinig de sin nach bhfuil oiread de obair láimhe agus bhíodh le déanamh ag na páistí, agus go bhfuil níos mó faille aca le h-aghaidh an ghnáthoideachais atá riachtanach.</P>

Ní raibh colas cruinn agam ar na rudaí a bhí an t-Aire ag tagairt dóibh agus ní raibh <Col N="1668" /> aon caoi agam an colas sin d'fhághail ach léigheamh an páipéar seo a thug an t-Aire duinn agus é ag labhairt.  Ní fheadair cioca a thuig mé is fearr. Cheapas gur thuig mé an Ghaedhilge cuibheasach maith ach admuighim nár thuig mé a leath de'n méid a dubhairt an t-Aire.  B'fhéidir nach ar an t-Aire atá an locht.  B'fhéidir gur easba taithighe ar mo thaobh-se é.  Bhéadh sé ar mo chumas aistriuchán do dheanamh ar chuid a léigh sé ach más é sin an Ghaedhilge atá á mhúineadh ins na scoileanna ba mhaith liom cloisint o'n dTeachta Cormac Breathnach má tá sé ar aon aigne leis.</P>
      <P>Do dhein an t-Aire tagairt ar chuid de na figúirí atá annso 'sa chéad leathanach agus dubhairt sé &ldquo;triocha a seacht&rdquo;, agus &ldquo;seachtmadh a tri&rdquo;.

Níor chuala mé riamh duine a labhrann an Ghaedhilge a dubhairt &ldquo;fiche do&rdquo;, &ldquo;triocha a seacht&rdquo; nó &ldquo;seachtamhadh a tri&rdquo;. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an tsórt san de Gaedhilge á labhairt in aon áit 'sa tír.  Bhí áthas orm a chloisint go raibh iarracht áirithe á dhéanamh 'sa Ghaeltacht i dtaobh na &ldquo;Extension or Continuation Schools&rdquo;.  Níl a fhios agam ar an nóimeat seo cad é an ainm ceart a cuirtear orra ach deintear tagairt dóibh ar leathanach a dó dhéag.  Is maith an rud go gcuirtear ar bun scoileanna de'n tsórt san, go mór mór in áiteanna ná fuil puinn oibre á dhéanamh ag na mbuachaillí ionnta.  Má tá aon seans aca í dtaobh oideachais, gheobhaidís an seans sin í slighe oideachais.

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I was entirely unprepared to take any part in this debate.  Professor <Col N="1669" /> O'Sullivan would have done so had he been here but it was by the sheerest accident that I happened to come into the House when this Vote was being moved.  I have, therefore, made no close study at all of the Estimates in connection with this matter and the only opportunity we had of understanding what the Minister was saying was from this document he handed to us when making his speech.  It is probably my own fault. I found it rather difficult to follow the Minister during his speech and, at the same time, it was extremely difficult to grasp all that there is in this memorandum in such a way as to be able intelligently to criticise the Estimate. I know, of course, that the Minister has come in as a stop-gap to fill in the time before the Minister for Industry and Commerce came back to deal with the Road Transport Bill, but I think that Deputies should be given an opportunity of digesting the memorandum which he has circulated to some members of the House and the details in connection with the programme and policy of his Department. Naturally, the debate will not conclude before four o'clock and it is just as well, because from a cursory glance at this document, I notice that there is a great deal in it of very considerable interest from the point of view of the policy of the Department and a great deal of matter which I was very surprised to hear, as it was quite new to me.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear of some of the things that are being done and we would probably express the hope that these would be extended more widely.  I refer especially to the programme of building small continuation schools in country areas &mdash;three-roomed schools, I think they are called.  I notice that they are not to be confined to the Gaeltacht. One of them is in County Monaghan and, certainly, from the Gaeltacht point of view, I think that some extension in that direction would be extremely advisable.  The lack of employment there, mainly in recent times, leaves them in the position that they have to depend very largely on whatever education they can get in <Col N="1670" /> order to have any hopes of making a decent livelihood for themselves and the extension of education in the Gaeltacht in any direction in which it could be extended would be extremely advisable.  As I said, I have given only the most cursory glance at this document and it would be rather ridiculous to attempt to criticise the Estimate merely on a cursory reading of it or on the half understanding I had of the Minister's statement together with a lack of study of the Estimate previously.</P>

      <P>I take it that the functions of the Minister for Education extend generally to the education of the public of this country and, on that assumption, I take this occasion to remonstrate with him for being a party, as he is a party, to one of the greatest outrages against the artistic education of the people of this city that has been perpetrated in my memory.  I refer to the outrage that has been done on the Municipal Gallery of Art on the north side of the City of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear the Minister when winding up give us his views and the views of the Department on the position of the junior assistant mistresses whose pension rights at present seem to be very anomalous.  I recognise that the question is one of considerable difficulty, but I think it would be of assistance to us all if the Minister would review the situation as it at present is and give us some indication of what his intentions are with reference to these public servants. Twelve months ago I took this occasion to refer to the general condition of primary education in this country, and on that occasion I said I considered the principal objective which the Minister should have before him was the preservation and the spread of the Irish language.  I suggested to him that the existing system of compelling people to use Irish as a medium for instruction without reference to the capacity of the children to understand the language is calculated to do great injury to the language movement.  The Minister on that occasion seemed to understand me to say that in a very large percentage of the schools all subjects were being taught through the medium of Irish and that in many of these schools the children did not understand the language.  I did not say that then and I do not say it now. I do say that in a very large number of schools certain subjects are being taught through the medium of Irish and it is manifest to anybody that the <Col N="1672" /> children are not capable of understanding the language fully.</P>
      <P>There are many schools where one subject is taught through the medium of Irish and all the other subjects through the medium of English.  There are many schools where two subjects are taught through the medium of Irish and all the other subjects through the medium of English.  I am putting it to the Minister that there are schools in which subjects are being taught through the medium of Irish where the children have not sufficient grasp of the language to derive the maximum benefit from the instruction.  I am putting that to him because I share with him anxiety to promote the language, to spread the language, and I recognise that if you stir up public opinion against the language you are going to kill all hopes of effectively restoring it. If the people of the country get it into their heads that their childrens' ordinary primary education is being interfered with by compulsory Irish as a medium of instruction in one or more subjects, you will build up a public opinion that will add greatly to the difficulty of the task which we both hope to see carried to completion.  I remember on that occasion I asked the Minister not to take my view as the true view, not to take the view of his own officials as the true view, but to set up a small impartial and independent committee to inquire generally into the whole situation of the Irish language and primary education with a view to getting recommendations made to him which would make his policy and my policy more effective.</P>

I suggest that it is most unfair to the House, especially to Deputies like myself who do not understand the language.  In any case, very few Deputies at present in the House understood one word of what the Minister was saying.  I suggest that the Minister's speech should be translated into English and copies circulated to Deputies, so that we may know what it is about.  A whole lot of money is being expended, most of which I believe is wasted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 27:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 6, before paragraph (c) to insert two new paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1674" /> (c)  whether such merchandise road transport business was at the critical date his principal business or a business ancillary thereto;</P>
    <P>(d)  if such merchandise road transport business was then an ancillary business, the prescribed particulars to distinguish such ancillary business from his said principal business; and.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes to add to the particulars which the section already requires to be submitted by an applicant for a licence the particulars mentioned.  The object of this, of course, is clear, and effect will be given to the purpose for which these particulars are requested later.  I raised this point on the Second Stage and I raise it on this amendment again.  As far as the most recent Commission's report in England is evidence, the ancillary business has been discovered to be the main trouble and difficulty, and the method here of dealing with the ancillary user is apparently to make him a common carrier and so to drive him into a business into which he had no intention of going at the beginning.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to have it that if these distinguishing particulars can be got, and I think they can, then they should be insisted on and when got, and when a licence is afterwards given on foot of them, that that licence would be one of a limited nature.  In other words, if it is possible to get sufficient such particulars to distinguish a man in the transport business who wants to continue from a man who is simply carrying goods in a casual way, carrying mainly his own goods and then taking back loads, that it should be limited clearly and distinctly; not merely limited in regard to the class of goods which he will haul himself as a common carrier, but not allowed to become a common carrier even for the purpose of such traffic.  I am pretty certain that the argument that is going to be used against this is the inevitable one of administrative difficulties.  If it is possible to allow people to apply for <Col N="1675" /> a licence and describe themselves as common carriers for a limited class of traffic and thereafter to enforce whatever obligations they take upon themselves in regard to this limited or extensive class of merchandise, this does not add any special difficulty, and certainly none that is insuperable. The matter is important enough at any rate to have it attempted with a view to limiting to their whole usage the people who are, as I say, not in the business properly, but only in the business as an aside.  This is only a preliminary amendment; the operative section is a later one, but it is obvious that if there is to be any distinction as between proper use and ancillary use you must get those particulars. I do not think it is a proper way of meeting the difficulties to drive everybody, whether he is an ancillary user or a proper user, into the traffic business as such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three types of people engaged in the road haulage business.  First, there are those who are in that business and no other business, that is, the bona fide hauler who is dependent upon his earnings from that business for his livelihood; secondly, there is the person who conducts a haulage business and also another business, but who is openly and avowedly in the haulage business, even though he may occasionally use the lorries available for that business for some purpose in connection with his other business; and thirdly, there is the person who is engaged in some other business, but uses his lorries on fairly rare occasions&mdash;when it happens to be convenient to himself&mdash;to carry goods for reward for a neighbour or townsman.  In so far as the first class is concerned, that is, those who are road haulage contractors and nothing else, no question arises.  They are entitled to get and will get their licence under the Bill, and it is mainly those people who will be of interest to the railway company when considering their policy in relation to the acquisition clause.  In the second class there are, of course, people who vary from being at the stage where they are almost in the first class, to being at <Col N="1676" /> the stage where they are almost in the third class.  Most of those people are, however, very definitely engaged in the road motor transport business.  As such, they are entitled to apply for a licence and get a licence, and many of them are in that business to a large extent, even though they may have other business associations too.  It is undoubtedly true that some person within that clause might apply for his licence, get transferred to his transport business all the lorries he had in connection with both businesses, replace them in connection with his other business, and thus become in the future a transport operator on a somewhat larger scale than he was in the past.  That may happen.  I submit, however, that the number of cases in which that is likely to happen is very small, and that in order to deal with them it is unnecessary to complicate the Bill with the number of additional provisions which the Deputy suggests, and which, by themselves, are not even sufficient to give effect to his intention. If those persons are genuinely in the road transport business, and conducting services which have been doing damage to the railway organisation, and if the railway companies desire to acquire control of these services they may do so, but if, on the other hand, their intention in acting in that matter was merely to enhance the price which would have to be paid for acquisition by the railway company, then, I think there is sufficient safeguard in the provisions of the Bill, which lay down that a Ministerial order becomes necessary before they can put themselves into the position that they must be acquired by the railway company.  In such circumstances, unless their business was of definite value, such order would not be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the third class, that is, those people who are mainly engaged in some other business, but very occasionally and only when convenient engage in the road transport business.  I think there are fairly few who will be able to bring themselves within the definition in Section 2 of the Bill, that is &ldquo;people who have been carrying on a merchandise road transport business.&rdquo;  That phrase, I <Col N="1677" /> think, has a meaning sufficiently clear to exclude from it the person who only on rare occasions and when convenient to himself carries goods for reward.  Such person is not in the road transport business; ordinarily he does not hold himself out as being in the business, but only takes advantage of it on particular occasions, for the purpose of earning money which he would not regard as part of his ordinary income at all. I do not think it is necessary that there should be anything additional in the Bill in order to deal with that class.  In so far as they have been engaged in the road transport business, and held themselves out as such, then they are entitled to a licence, and&mdash;if their services are of sufficient value to the railway company&mdash;to be acquired by the railway company.</P>
    <P>In the second class there is, undoubtedly, a possibility of some such development taking place as the Deputy is endeavouring to provide against in this section, but I do not think that the number is large, and I do not think that the difficulty raised is considerable.  Certainly I do not think that the number is large enough or the difficulty considerable enough to justify the very many additional and complicated sections which would have to be inserted in the Bill.  I do not like pleading administrative difficulty in connection with all these matters, but it must be realised that this is probably a type of Bill which creates more administrative difficulty than any other.  In fact it is the very considerable administrative difficulty which is associated with measures of this kind that has, I think, delayed their introduction, and certainly that has made it such a highly contentious matter to deal with.  We must try to minimise the administrative difficulties as much as possible.  I think we have done so in the Bill as drafted, and if we were to try to provide against all possible developments that could be foreseen in connection with the road transport business then we could not succeed. We would produce a very complicated measure, which would be difficult to <Col N="1678" /> understand and difficult to operate, and would not fundamentally alter the position at all.  I think we can afford to take whatever little risk is involved in the matter of which the Deputy speaks.  It would be preferable to take that risk than to complicate the measure in the manner he suggests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like further to argue this matter.  The Minister's answer divides itself really into two points; one, that the chances of development of the type of business to which I refer are rather small; and secondly that the administrative difficulties of dealing with a section such as I have suggested would be very great.  On the first point, the Minister says that the definition of merchandise road transport business would tend to cut out the more extensive use of his lorries by a man who has only had lorries ancillary to his main business.  I wonder on what is that argument founded.  The definition on page 3 is that merchandise road transport means the carriage of merchandise for reward by road in merchanically propelled vehicles.  A man, therefore, can prove that he has carried for reward merchandise in mechanically propelled vehicles if he has a merchandise road transport business.  Does he then qualify for an existing carrier's licence? He does, under the latter definition, if he carried on at some time between certain named dates a merchandise road transport business as previously defined.</P>
      <P>Later, in Section 8 the applicant for a licence has to give particulars, and the relevant particulars to this amendment are that he must set out the number of mechanically propelled vehicles which, at any specified date between certain named dates selected by him, complied with the following conditions.  What are the conditions? That he had lorries licensed, in use and available for the purposes of business?  That is the definition that is supposed to catch out the ancillary user.  Does it?  If that is the only grip that the Minister has on the person that I speak of, then I think he evades his grip and gets in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1679" /> I think the statistics are unquestioned that out of the 8,000 lorries which were on the road at one time, only 2,000 were owned by the professional haulier; that 6,000 out of the 8,000 were owned by private persons, so that the danger to which I refer is not a small thing.  In dealing with the 6,000 out of the 8,000 lorries it has, of course, to be borne in mind that some of the 6,000 lorries were in the transport business.  In the main, they were not as professional road hauliers, but some fraction of them was used by people who were in the transport business.  If we imagine the conditions here being in any way comparable to what has been disclosed in the Salter Report in England a very large proportion of these 6,000 lorries will be engaged only as ancillary to another business, and our scheme for dealing with these is under Section 12, by making all of them common carriers.  Last night the Minister used an argument in response to an amendment of mine that it was putting an inducement on certain people to take out licences, and that his aim was to lessen the number of licences that would be applied for. Surely this section is an inducement to people to become common carriers for as much as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 12 states that &ldquo;Every licensee under a merchandise licence shall in relation to all the merchandise specified in such licence and in the area stated in such licence be a common carrier.&rdquo;  Who is to be the judge of that, the judge of the merchandise specified in the licence?  If that was going to be limited to previous user, and it was clear that the applicant could not get beyond that, then, of course, my point would be met, but I do not think that that is the situation. If it is not the situation, then I say that in relation to some proportion, I think the greater proportion of the 6,000 vehicles out of the 8,000 ordinarily operating on the roads, we are going to substitute a common carrier position for a specified class or classes of merchandise, instead of the class of business which was ancillary to business other than that of a road transport concern.  I think that is aggravating <Col N="1680" /> instead of simplifying the problem. The danger is apparent and is great. If there were tremendous administrative difficulties it might still be necessary to look at this danger in the face and see what would happen.  What are the administrative difficulties?</P>
    <P>The amendment asks that a man should send in particulars which would show whether or not transport was the main concern of the applicant or whether it was only ancillary and to what degree it was ancillary.  A later amendment of mine, No. 49, would limit the licence to whatever was the class of business the applicant carried on or had prior to making the application. It may be that that could be met in another way.  I do not see it being met by anything I can find in the Bill unless it be something hidden somewhere in Section 12.  If it is, then in so far as it is going to operate properly it meets the amendment, but I do not see it there.</P>
    <P>What is the administrative difficulty under the new system?  We are going to have a variety of licences going out to the 8,000 owners of lorries, and probably to a great many more.  Assuming that the 8,000 are allowed to divide themselves according to the applicants' wishes into common carriers for various classes of goods, what is the difference between that and saying that, according to the particulars they send in they will be scheduled and classified and made common carriers only for the type of goods previously carried?  I do not see any difference at all, nor do I see any administrative difficulties in the way.  As I have said, I think that under the section as it is there is a considerable danger of an enlargement of the road transport business rather than a lessening of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with what the Deputy has said I merely want to say this: that the expression &ldquo;existing carrier&rdquo; means someone who is carrying on a merchandise road transport business.  The mere carrying of goods for reward on an occasion does not constitute a road transport business.</P>

      <P>I think a person must have been ordinarily engaged in the business and have held himself out as being so engaged.  Otherwise, I do not think he is entitled to come within the definition of an existing carrier unless he was so known to be engaged in the business of carrying goods on the road for reward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no definition in the Bill.  It is clear that the applicant for a licence under sub-section (2) Section 8 must specify the merchandise road transport business in respect of which he claims to be an existing carrier.  He must state that he was during a specified period engaged in the business&mdash;not merely that on a particular date he simply carried home a load of merchandise some distance for reward.  That interpretation of the section would obviously include a fairly large number of those whom the Deputy has in mind.  I admit there is a section to be covered, but my argument is that it is so small that it is not likely to constitute a difficulty.  There is no need, I think, to complicate the Bill with a number of provisions to deal with it.  It would be unwise to undertake the administrative responsibility involved in dealing with that section as the problem there is so small.  The administrative work which the Deputy asks us to undertake under his amendment is, by no means, inconsiderable. Under the amendment if we were to licence a person for a road transport business that was ancillary to some other business, then we would have to keep that person in that position.  We would have to undertake responsibly to supervise his acts and operations and all the rest in order to ensure that the conditions of the licence were being observed. There would be no sense in putting conditions in a licence unless it was intended to enforce them.  These conditions would require us to ensure that the road transport business remains subsidiary to the main business, that the person did not cease to operate the main business, and that the merchandise <Col N="1682" /> road transport business was carried on in the same manner as it was carried on during the specified period. I presume that that means that if it was carried on in a haphazard manner and just for occasional loads it should still be carried on in that manner under the licence.  The supervisional examination that would be involved by this would be considerable and it would also involve a lot of trouble for applicants for licences who, under any circumstances, are entitled to carry on their business under the Bill unless and until required by the railway company.  I am not arguing this merely for the sake of argument.  If I felt that these people carrying on two businesses in that way might possibly act in the manner in which the Deputy fears they would act, then I feel that something should be done; but I feel that they will not act in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think they will not.  I am talking of the man who, because he has a lorry, occasionally carries goods for a reward.  I do not think that the majority of people coming under that category will be able to establish that they have been able to carry on a road transport business at all and they will not be liable for a licence.</P>
      <P>There is another class of people in the road transport business who also engage in some other business.  The argument has been advanced that these people may transfer to the road business all the vehicles used in both businesses and thus represent the road transport side of the business as being larger than it has been, consequently putting themselves in the position of being able to demand a higher price in the event of the compulsory clause coming into operation.  That is the only danger&mdash;that that might happen &mdash;but the number of people who are likely to do that is very few, and those who do that are likely to find themselves disappointed when their application under the compulsory clause is refused.</P>

      <P>If the Minister will tighten up his Bill so as to make sure that those people cannot get licences, then a certain part of my objection is gone, but I do not think that that is there.  The Minister refers me to the definition of existing carriers and he is going to found, apparently, a lot on the class of business.  Was it in an actual business the man has been carrying on, if it is even for himself, and two others ancillary to a main business, such as a grocery business?  Supposing it does not fit in under the very large definition, if that is to be described as a business I do not think anybody can get in.  If it is meant to exclude him, then tighten up the Bill to that extent and it will meet some part of the difficulty. I do not think it meets it at all. All the man has got to prove is that he was carrying for a reward between certain dates in such a way that it emerges as a business.  It might be a very small business, but it is a business. That is the beginning and the end of it.  Thereafter, he has got to choose for himself the number of lorries he had, either in use or available for use, in such very small business, and then he gets the unladen weight of those fixed and then afterwards he becomes a common carrier on such unladen weight of lorries.  That, I think, is the danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of administrative difficulty, what is the difference between these two positions?  Take a street in Dublin, hereafter, which contains five people who are going to get licences.  I do not know what the classification of licences is going to be on these&mdash;whether it is going to be the very simple classification established by the Railway Tribunal or the more numerous classification established since the activities of the Railway Tribunal took place.  Let us suppose that it is the more numerous classification. You will have these people in Dublin certified as common carriers for some portion of these numerous <Col N="1684" /> classifications and criss-crossed in and out as between the different uses, and there is to be supervision to see that one man does not carry something that he has not held himself out as a common carrier for the purpose of carrying, and to see that another man is complying with the conditions of a common carrier.  That is the one situation for which the Minister is heading. That is the particular thing which he is facing, not with equanimity, but because he thinks he can get over it in some way.  I suggest to the Minister to simplify it.  In my amendment No. 49, once the main business fails the ancillary business is also wiped out.  The second point is that the man will not carry on in any line other than the ancillary line as long as the business continues.  Let the Minister think of that in terms of classification of merchandise.  I do not see any difficulty in it.  In this amendment, I have taken the (c) part of the amendment as being very much the same as the (b) part, and I would interpret the phrase &ldquo;in the same manner&rdquo; as meaning the same number of lorries used in regard to the business in the same ancillary fashion. Let us cut out that phrase if it causes difficulty and keep the other two. First of all, the ancillary business goes once the main business goes, and consequently as long as it is going to be used it is going to be used in an ancillary way.  It is not going to be any more difficult to do that than what he is doing.  As far as the administrative difficulty is concerned I do not think there is any answer.  I think there is a problem, and I do not think the problem is met by what the Minister has said.  If the Minister will move later on to amend it so as to enable him to cut out the man who has not been in the transport business at all, then I would support it; but the ancillary use has been the whole blot and difficulty throughout.  I think it is a blot on the Bill by saying that every ancillary, hereafter, becomes a common carrier.  I think that the Minister is causing more congestion by this.</P>

      <P>There is one question I should like to ask the Minister. Deputy McGilligan has been more or <Col N="1685" /> less skirting around the question but I do not think the position has been cleared up.  I should like to ask the Minister to say what is the position of a trader who could not be classified, by any stretch of the imagination, as a carrier, who merely delivers his own goods but occasionally is asked by the customer, either for a consideration or very possibly for no consideration, to carry some parcel of goods to a place for this customer&mdash;is that merchant liable to prosecution under this Bill for what I call doing a casual&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Take the position of a trader who is asked to do casual jobs for customers, such as bringing a bed to the seaside or a sack of potatoes back from the country.  Is he liable to a prosecution? If his employee does it <i>sub rosa</i> will the employer be held to be the guilty party?</P>

A man sometimes buys a lorry with the intention of going into the carrying business.  He then finds that the only way to make the lorry a paying proposition is to add a public garage so as to get trade terms for the motor goods he is using.  In the other case a man starts a garage and finds that there is not a living in it, hence he adds a lorry and engages in haulage business.  These two are interdependent.  Take away one and the other will go.  It would take a very wise judge to decide which in that case was the ancillary business.</P>

      <P>No.  If the Deputy proposes regulations which are designed to deal with the small group they must apply to everyone.  The regulations apply in respect to other applicants and to everyone who gets a licence. That is precisely my case, that it is unnecessary to put in these conditions to apply to everyone in order to bring in a small number.  I think we can afford to take the risk, and that it is necessary to put a very small number of people into a more favourable position than they would otherwise get under the Bill, in return for the comparative simplicity that the Bill provides as it stands without amendment.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister admit this as a likelihood, that if he gets an applicant to convince him that he is in the road transport business, and after that gets a variety of particulars of the unladen weight of the lorry, which was assigned to him, he can load any goods he cares to become the common carrier of at that weight? He goes into the business and can become the common carrier of one thousand articles that he never carried before.</P>

      <P>The Deputy thinks that in making these people common carriers we are conferring some advantage on them.  It is the reverse. We are conferring a responsibility upon them.  The railway company are not common carriers for live stock because of the responsibility attached to the term.  We say that everyone who proposes to carry merchandise on the roads shall be common carriers. That is an additional responsibility.</P>

I think it is fairly reasonable to assume also that, if that be so, it would be unnecessary as well as unwise to amend the Bill as the Deputy suggests, because the introduction of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; does not make the Minister any more reasonable but it does introduce the possibility of an appeal to the courts, which it is not intended to provide.  I think the Deputy may be reasonably certain that under any circumstances the Bill is going to be administered in a reasonable manner and that consequently an amendment of this kind is not necessary.</P>

      <P>The introduction of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; does astonishingly give a citizen the right to appeal to a court of law.  That course of procedure is, of course, very unpopular with the Minister.  He likes to be a dictator and that is his sole purpose <Col N="1690" /> in refusing to accept this amendment. The Minister is constantly coming in here and saying: &ldquo;I shall have to answer to the House for any wrongful action.&rdquo;  That is one of his favourite clichés.  Then when he is asked to answer for some action, he says that it is not in accordance with public policy to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is his reply as a reasonable man.  Surely, if the Minister is as reasonable as he believes himself to be, he need not have any fear of an appeal to the court.  People are not fools.  They do not go to court for the mere sake of going there.  They only go to court when it is manifest that the Minister has done an injustice.  The only remedy available here would be a very expensive Chancery remedy.  If the Minister admits the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; here, he does not make the administration of the Bill a bit more difficult, but he does preserve an enormously important principle and that is the right of the humblest citizen in the country to appeal to the courts against an action of the most exalted Minister of State.  That is a terrific safeguard.  An appeal of this kind may never arise, but the House should always insist, in every Bill where the Minister's right to make regulations is involved, on certain minimum requirements. The Minister's powers should be limited by the right of a person to appeal to a court for a declaration that what the Minister wants cannot be reasonably asked for, and that he is deliberately using a section of the Act for a purpose for which it was never intended.  That would be the only reason why the court would cross the Minister, if this word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; were introduced.  The person would have to go into court to prove that the Minister had deliberately used the sub-section for purposes that the Legislature never intended, and until and unless he proved that, the court would provide no remedy.  If he were able to prove that the court would intervene and would issue a writ of mandamus or some other form of writ to the Minister to compel him to do <Col N="1691" /> whatever the statute required.  Surely the Minister will make this gesture.  It does not make any great difference. An appeal will probably never arise, but it does protect an enormously important principle that is very valuable to the man in the street or the humble citizen of the State.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is going to persist in his attitude he has erred slightly, because he has let in the phrase &ldquo;for the consideration of such application.&rdquo;  Why does he not stop short at &ldquo;as the Minister may require&rdquo;?

      <P>The Minister is in very good humour this evening.  As a matter of fact under some of the legislation pushed through the Dáil by Deputy McGilligan in connection with the Electricity Supply Bill he got powers of that kind under which he could make all sorts of extravagant regulations.  These regulations worked grave hardship but when people went into court they were told that, because that word was omitted, the courts could not interfere even though they felt that grave hardship was being inflicted. Because Deputy McGilligan succeeded in pushing the Act through the Dáil without these words the court was impotent and could not interfere.  There is one section of the Electricity Supply Act under which I believe the Minister could plant an electric lighting pole in your drawing room.</P>

      <P>If the Dáil gives a Minister powers of this kind it is necessary to have an appeal against his decision. This is what the Minister wants to do here.  He wants the required information and that is the end.  You cannot ask him why.  You cannot say it is quite unreasonable or you cannot say &ldquo;you are simply asking for the information with a view to blocking my legitimate application.&rdquo;  You have to give it because if you do not give it, he will turn down your application. By refusing to accept the word &ldquo;reasonably,&rdquo; the Minister refuses to restore the right to appeal to a court in the matter.  Why?  Because Deputy McGilligan did it three years ago.  That answer was all right once or twice but I think we have had enough of it.  I have described it once or twice before. I think the less flag wagging that is done the better.  There is no use in trying to step up on Deputy McGilligan's shoulders.  When the Minister has done as much as Deputy McGilligan in the public service he may have certain rights but he should make up his mind for himself now and not be dragging in Deputy McGilligan's name so frequently.  The thing is right or wrong and I hold it is wrong.</P>

      <P>The Minister in defending the sub-section as it now stands has, not for the first time since he came here, quoted the example set up by his predecessor under the 1932 Act.  He would be well advised to stick to the example of the Minister whom he replaced, in so far as it applies to other aspects of the Bill.  His predecessor, in asking for the powers set out in the 1932 Act, did not ask for the dictatorial powers which the Minister is looking for here, and which I hope he will not get from the House under this Bill.  He is certainly setting himself up as a transport dictator, in effect, and I think there is a good case in favour of the amendment proposed by Deputy McGilligan.  He talks about creating new difficulties and new administrative responsibilities.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has referred to the Electricity Supply Board.  There is no necessity to go so <Col N="1694" /> far back as that.  Deputy Dillon was, I think, in this House when the present Minister wept over the hardship he had to inflict on certain people who applied to him under the 1932 Act. He regretted that he had not been given power to grant licences. Although I pointed out to him that the particular section he said he was operating contained the phrase &ldquo;without prejudice to his absolute discretion,&rdquo; the Minister apparently thought that because there was not some word definitely and clearly giving him responsibility, he could not give the licences.  He was quite annoyed to think of the number of people from whom he had to take licences and whose applications he had to refuse when, if words of this modifying type had been in, he might have acted differently.</P>
      <P>Let us leave aside this question of whether another Act has this word or not.  If the Minister is affected by reason of the contrast between the Act passed in 1932, which had not the word &ldquo;reasonably,&rdquo; and the insertion of the word here, if he thinks that there is any idea that there is a likelihood of unreasonable conduct, then, so far as I am entitled to say it, I may say that I do not believe there is going to be unreasonable conduct.  But because there may be an odd case, an exceptional case, a very improbable case of the unreasonable use of this power, the word ought to be put in.  To go back to what I said at the beginning, if the Minister has the belief that there is going to be no misconduct by himself or anybody who succeeds him, then it is absolutely certain that there will never be an appeal to the court.  But this will keep us more in line with what we all profess to admire&mdash;liberty &mdash;and it will be for impartial judges to decide if that liberty has been encroached upon.  I ask the Minister to forget what happened in connection with other measures.  If only as a gesture to the impartial judges who will be the people to safeguard rights if encroached upon, he should admit the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; in this and other sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in saying that in so far as any action by <Col N="1695" /> the Minister is concerned, it is unlikely to give rise to &ldquo;unreasonable conduct&rdquo; but if we are going to put in words like this here and there we will find that the administration of the statute will be held up by frivolous appeals to the court.</P>

      <P>I shall refer to two cases which will illustrate the position further.  The Shannon Electricity Board came into the town in which I live, and the work of erecting electric light poles was proceeded with.  One of these poles required to be stayed and, to my mind, wholly unreasonably, they proposed to put a stay-wire into a very high wall for which I was liable.  I took the view that if they did that they would imperil the structure of the wall, and might involve me in heavy damages and in great inconvenience.  I said that I would not allow them to put it in. They informed me that they did not ask me for leave, that they were going to do it.  They went down the street to a neighbour and proceeded to act in the same way in connection with his window sill.  When he protested that the premises would be disfigured, they said that they were not interested to <Col N="1696" /> hear his observations, that they were going ahead and that they only dropped in to tell him.  When I consulted my legal advisers and he consulted his, we were informed that we had no remedy, that the Shannon Electricity Board had the right to do these things if, in their judgment, they were deemed necessary.  We had no right to go to the court and ask to have them restrained on the ground that we did not think their action was reasonable.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Local Government was putting through the Road Traffic Bill, Deputy Moore raised the point that a Guard ought not to be given power to ask a man's name and address unless he had reason to suspect the commission of a crime.  The Minister for Local Government agreed with that, said that he had noticed the omission and promised that he would have the section re-drafted to provide that before either a Minister of State or a Guard makes a requisition on a common citizen, he must have reasonable grounds for so acting, and be prepared to prove to the court that he was acting reasonably in requiring the information.  The moment that was put to the Minister for Local Government, he undertook to have the section re-drafted and to make the necessary provision.</P>
      <P>I put these two points before the Minister.  They are not exactly parallel but they enshrine the same principle.  I felt that I should have a right to go to the courts, let the E.S.B. put their case against mine and let a fair judgment be given between us.  I should be quite content with that.  But I resent, and everybody resents, the position in which a public Department can hold a pistol to your head while you have no remedy&mdash;no right of appeal.  That may never arise here. But if the Minister will yield this trivial point&mdash;it would not cost him much to do it&mdash;it would place on record the resolve of the Dáil to protect the right of the citizen to go to the courts and seek redress for any infringement of his liberties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it rules amendments 32, 33, 34 and 35.  All these go together.  I do not move this amendment with any enthusiasm.  It is more in order to get clarification than anything else.  The Minister must grant a merchandise licence to an existing carrier if the existing carrier applies before the appointed day.  That is the provision in sub-section (2).  Under sub-section (1) he must grant it to any authorised (merchandise carrying) company or shipping company which applies for it at any time.  Subsections (3) and (4) lay down that if an application is made after the appointed day by a person who is neither an authorised merchandise carrying company nor a shipping company, the Minister may grant such licence if he is satisfied that no authorised (merchandise carrying) company is willing to undertake the supply of adequate merchandise road transport facilities in such area.  Of course the over-riding consideration always is that the granting of a licence is desirable in the public interest.  It is open to the Minister to grant such a licence either to an existing carrier or to an authorised (merchandise carrying) company, whether they apply before or after the appointed day.  I want afterwards to rule out as one of the items set out as terms of reference to the Minister, &ldquo;that no authorised (merchandise carrying) company is <Col N="1701" /> willing to undertake the supply of adequate merchandise road transport facilities in such area.&rdquo;  If my amendment were accepted I think that the Minister, on application made to him by an existing carrier after the appointed day, would find out whether the authorised company was willing to undertake the carriage of the traffic in a particular area.  If that company were willing to undertake it, he would grant it to that company in the first instance.  I think that is provided for in the scheme, but I do not see why it should be tied up with other circumstances warranting a change in policy when that change in policy would involve a change in legislation.  My amendment will allow the Minister to carry out his policy, but it will prevent him from carrying out another policy. I do not think that in the future somebody else having charge of this measure should be put to the trouble of having to amend it at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on that point that I disagree with the Deputy.  There is a very definite policy involved in this Bill.  It is a policy which has the approval of the great majority of the members of the Dáil.  If at a later time the Executive Council decides that that policy should be changed, then they should come to the Dáil for the purpose of changing it.  The Bill, as it stands, envisages a situation that after the appointed day road transport operators will be limited in their numbers, and also limited in the extent to which they are engaged in the business.  After that no new road transport developments will take place except on the initiative of a railway company, the tramway company, or a shipping company, or in the circumstances envisaged in Section 3&mdash;where a service is required and no railway company is willing to undertake it.  In such case the licence would be given to an independent operator who would have his licence secured to him so long as he complied with the conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is contemplated on the face of this sub-section is an independent operator coming to the Department of Industry and Commerce and applying for a licence to run a service in a particular <Col N="1702" /> district.  The Department of Industry and Commerce would then go to the railway company or to the shipping company and say to them &ldquo;are you willing to run this service?&rdquo; Only in the event of a refusal on the part of the railway or shipping company would the licence be granted to the original applicant.  A much more likely event would be that representations would be made from some area that a road service was required for the convenience of trade or the convenience of the public in a particular district.  If the Department of Industry and Commerce on examining the matter became convinced that a service was required they would make representations to the particular railway company and in the event of their refusing to undertake it, let it be known that an application for a licence from some independent operator would be likely to be favourably considered. That is the more likely course of events.</P>
    <P>I think the section as it stands in the Bill should continue to stand and not be amended as suggested by the Deputy, so that it will be quite clear and definite in everybody's mind that after the appointed day any increase in the road transport organisation of this country is going to be undertaken by the railway company or the other persons who may be authorised under various conditions, as set out in the Bill.  If there is power to grant a licence to an individual on grounds of public interest, then applications are going to be made, pressure of one kind or another is going to be brought for the purpose of getting the licence granted, and although every such application may be refused, nevertheless, a considerable amount of difficulty may arise out of the refusal.  It is much better that we should be able to say to such people that we have no power to give a licence, rather than that we should have to say that having considered the matter we have decided not to give a licence.  The Deputy, I am sure, will remember from his own experience in administration that it is always preferable to be able to point to a definite barrier of that kind than to have to set forth facts and reasons why descretion should be exercised in <Col N="1703" /> a particular manner.  In so far as that is the definite policy, the declared policy of the Executive, the policy approved not merely by the Government Party but the other Parties in the Dáil, I think it should be clearly stated in the Bill, so that nobody would have any idea that by any of the devices usually adopted on these occasions he could get a licence in a manner which would be contrary to that policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is right in this matter.  I did not gather from Deputy McGilligan's remarks what he proposes to gain by his amendment. It seems to me definitely to have the effect of cutting away the chance of development of merchandise traffic in new areas from the established merchandise carrying companies.  If he thinks there is any advantage to be gained he should explain it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat confused as to what is the purpose of the amendment. As far as I can see, sub-section (1) gives an authorised undertaker within the meaning of the Act a mandatory right to demand from the Minister a licence at any time to operate the merchandise traction business in any area at any time.  An existing carrier has only up to the appointed day to exercise that right and after that he shall not have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Cannot get it after the appointed day.  Sub-section (2) reads: &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of the immediately preceding section, the Minister shall grant a merchandise licence to every existing carrier who before the appointed day applies to him for such licence in accordance with the said section.&rdquo;  There is nothing in that which says that the Minister may not grant it after the appointed day.  He is bound to grant it before the appointed day, but he may grant it, so far as this section goes, after the appointed day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Read sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we come to the sub-section which provides that where an <Col N="1704" /> authorised undertaking will not fill the gap, where the Minister can find no one to fill the gap in an area which is not properly served, he can give a licence for that area.  The only effect of the amendment seems to me to be to withdraw from the railway company and the authorised undertakers within the meaning of the Act a certain privilege they have to take any new route that turns up, or any new area that it seems to be right and proper to develop. They have that right under the Bill. It is only when they fail in that, when the Minister has nobody else to turn to, and there is a necessity for a transport service&mdash;in these unthinkable circumstances that he can give a licence to somebody else.  It seems to me that if we are to aim at unification it would be folly to withdraw this privilege from the railway company and it is a privilege, taking everything into consideration, that they are entitled to; not only the railway company but the other authorised undertakers, tramway companies and shipping companies.  I have not heard from Deputy McGilligan so far&mdash;perhaps he has something more to say&mdash;anything which would encourage one to withdraw that privilege from the authorised undertakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the beginning that I moved the amendment with very little enthusiasm because I did not think there was a very big point to be made.  There is a point, however, and I want to explain it. To simplify the matter, let us speak of the railway company instead of the merchandise carrying companies, because there is only the railway company in it.  As the section stands, the scheme is this: A railway company applies for a licence, and the Minister must grant it whether that application is made before or after the appointed day.  If an existing carrier applies before the appointed day the Minister must grant a licence.  If the application is made after the appointed day by a person, not the railway company, the Minister then may grant the licence, but only if he is satisfied about certain things.  The important thing is that the railway company is <Col N="1705" /> not willing to supply adequate transport facilities in the area.  That is the present scheme.  I approve of that policy.  I want the railway company given the first chance to develop new routes, to cover any route that is not covered by an existing carrier, or where they think they can cover an area better.  The Minister is only bound to grant a licence either to the railway company or to an existing carrier if the application is made before the appointed day.  If it is made after that the Minister, in furtherance of his present policy and in present circumstances, ought to grant the licence to the railway company, and he can do that without my amendment.  I simply say, is it possible that circumstances will develop to the point that the railway company, although professing to supply an adequate service, will not supply it?  The Minister operating this Bill has, in fact, to supply it, and to stir the railway company into better activity he has this threat that he will give somebody else the licence for that area.  I say that the circumstances do not appear to me likely or probable at the moment, but they might occur.  Supposing there are new circumstances and that in fact, the railway company finds itself hampered so that it is not able to undertake this; that it might profess itself willing but not able to undertake it. Is it right to throw upon any Minister, or the same Minister wanting to operate a different policy, the necessity of coming to the Dáil to get legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section says that the Minister may grant a licence if he is satisfied that the existing merchandise road transport facilities in such area are inadequate, and that the granting of such a licence to such a person is desirable in the public interest.  The third is, that no railway company is willing to undertake the supply of adequate road transport facilities in the area.  There is on that a point as to interpretation, and I think the amendment clears the ground, leaving more freedom to the <Col N="1706" /> Minister.  I do not want him to change the policy.  I want the policy to be kept so as to give the railway company every chance, but I do not want to tie ourselves to the railway company. There is not a great deal in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point which the Minister made which certainly carried conviction to me, and that is, influential local people coming forward and saying that Pat Williams is an awfully decent man, that he has seven small children, and that he will run a suitable vehicle if he is let do it; that the railway directors are all fat, rich men and he is a poor innocent man.  As the Bill stands, the Minister is in a position to say that he has no power to grant a licence. We know the power of the Fianna Fáil Clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against Deputy McGilligan for the same reason that I was against the Minister in this matter, that this would give the Minister greater discretion than the Bill means to give.  It would enable him to change his whole policy.  If the railway company, or the carrying company, does not want a particular licence, it will not apply for it, and the necessity for getting a licence will not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>If the railway company fails to supply a service that is required in the public interest a licence can be given to somebody else.  That is the definite intention&mdash;only if the railway company is unwilling.  I am including in &ldquo;unwilling&rdquo; the term &ldquo;unable.&rdquo; I may say that I am not willing to buy the railway company to-morrow, <Col N="1707" /> merely because I am unable to do so.

The purpose of this amendment is that an applicant could say &ldquo;I will be a common carrier of everything except the following articles.&rdquo;  I imagine the Minister is going to have amazing <Col N="1712" /> administrative difficulties if he is going to require that they shall accurately set out in their application the types of merchandise that they propose to carry.  On the other hand, I think it is going to create a very undesirable situation if they can go carefully through all the most perishable and delicate merchandise and specifically exclude them, saying: &ldquo;we will carry everything else.&rdquo;  Take metal castings; they can carefully exclude those and so transfer them to the railway company.  That is what will happen.  They will exclude all the fragile and perishable traffic, and constitute themselves carriers only of that traffic which cannot be damaged. I just give that case in point.  Take for example metal castings and hardware as distinct from other forms of steel and iron.  Castings are notoriously dangerous to carry.  Under Deputy McGilligan's amendment they could exclude castings, and still hold themselves out as free to carry every other form of hardware.</P>

If he has any difficulty in that connection he can get plenty of assistance from the officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce who will be dealing with him.  At any rate, they will have to translate his application into a licence and put on it a clear classification of the goods that he has contracted to carry.  But the responsibility is definitely on the applicant himself to declare the classes of goods that he wishes to become a common carrier for.  I do not think any difficulty will arise in defining the classes of goods.  In any event, if such a difficulty should arise it can very easily be met in the manner in which the licence is prepared.</P>

Perhaps Deputy Davin would tell us why that is so.  At any rate, the classifications of the Railway Tribunal are very peculiar. There is the other classification to which I have referred.  I submit to the Minister that he ought to consider providing some sort of classification of that kind, and of saying to a common carrier who applies to him for a licence: &ldquo;You must hold yourself out as a common carrier of classes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and take anything that is offered within their scope.&rdquo;  Otherwise it is going to be administratively impossible to ensure that the applicant will, in fact, be a common carrier of all the classes of goods that he says he is going to be a common carrier for because, so far as I know, the only remedy the public have against him is an action for damages.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this provision not based on the assumption that there will be competition over every route: that it will be possible to restrict the private carrier to the classes of merchandise that he can carry because there will be a big company operating in the same district to take all the other traffic offered?  Is not the Minister assuming too much when he thinks that there will be competition in every district? Take such an out of the way place as Garristown, or perhaps a better example would be Glencree or Glencullen. It may be years before the Great Southern Railway people decide to send a vehicle to these districts. Meantime, the carriers licensed will only be licensed for certain classes of goods.  Take the case of a carrier licensed for the Glencree district.  He is restricted to the carrying of the things named in his licence.  There is a monastery at Glencree, and it may be necessary to get a wireless set taken there.  If there is no wireless apparatus named in the carrier's licence, then he cannot convey the set.  In such an out of the way place as that, there may be much more useful and necessary articles required than a wireless set, and simply because they are not named in the carrier's licence he cannot convey them though they may be urgently required.  Difficulties of that kind are, I think, likely to arise in out of the way places because some considerable <Col N="1715" /> time may elapse before the Great Southern Company decide whether or not it would pay them to go to these districts.  The result will be that the adoption of this principle of a restricted licence will act as a great barrier to the trade and development of out of the way places.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what he means when he says that in applying for a merchandise licence the carrier will have to specify the classes of goods which he intends to carry.  Would the Minister say in what sense he uses the word &ldquo;classes&rdquo;?  I do so because the ordinary carrier has no idea of railway classification.  Is it the Minister's idea that he is going to, more or less, beat everybody into a standard process with a railway rates book in his hands? If it is, then I can tell him he is facing some job.  I suggest to the Minister that there are several other very important points that he will have to consider.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would press again on the Minister that sub-section (2) of Section 8 is the sub-section in the light of which we are discussing Section 11.  That sub-section says that the applicant shall state the class or classes of merchandise proposed to be carried by him.  Had the Minister or his officials in their mind any established meaning for the word &ldquo;classes&rdquo;?  Is there any statutory meaning for the word, or is there any <Col N="1716" /> procedure for attaching a meaning to it?  I have had considerable experience of general business extending into many spheres, and I can assure the Minister that the difficulty of attaching a meaning to that word is going to be very great indeed. Take cereals, for instance.  Suppose a man tenders a load of beans, which are very perishable.  The carrier rejects it on the ground that it is not a cereal but a cattle food. Impossible situations of that kind will arise.  A man undertakes to carry hardware.  He is tendered a load of castings.  He says no, that he will not take it: that it is not hardware within the meaning of his definition.  The Department may come down on him and say: &ldquo;It is.  You have been constituted a common carrier to carry these castings.&rdquo;  The Department may put a liability on the man that he never thought he was undertaking and did not mean to undertake.</P>
      <P>Therefore, that is why I ask the Minister between this and the Report Stage to look into that question and to consider whether the classification in the Schedules of the Patent Office and the Trade Marks Office might not be a much more adaptable one for the purposes of this Bill than the railways classifications, which have become exceedingly complicated.  In these offices, the Minister will find a large volume of precedents to guide him in any question that may arise in connection with this, because every person who applies for a trade mark or patent tries to get in as many classifications of commodities as he can.  The Minister will have a great many precedents there to guide him in advising a person who makes application to be made a common carrier, as to the certain classes of commodities he may carry, and what liabilities he has as a carrier.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister, in drafting this classification for common carriers, that he should pay particular attention to inserting livestock into some particular category? In view of the statement which he made that the railway companies are not common carriers in the matter of the carriage of livestock, I think that there <Col N="1717" /> is a grave possibility that we will have nobody with a liability as common carriers for what is one of the biggest and most important items in our transport. I hope that the Minister will ensure that live stock will be a liability for some carriers whether the existing carriers or not.  The Minister made that statement this evening, and I think it is a very serious matter.</P>

      <P>There is another point about which I would like to speak.  I am afraid that the hare which Deputy Dillon has started will require a lot of coursing.  The point I wish to raise is how is the licence to be amended, what change can be made in it, and how offences can be prosecuted. These are very important points.  It is quite clear that Deputy Dillon is right when he says that there is no clause under this Bill which gives any power to the Minister to do anything to a licensee, in relation to the common carrier provision, before a prosecution. He may operate on foot of a prosecution. That may be considered a breach as a result of the prosecution, and then, on the renewal, there may be a stoppage, but as far as the breach itself is concerned, that is left to a court, and there is no other way out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to query that.  The Minister has power to revoke a licence or to refuse the renewal of a licence.  His power of revocation is equated to his power to refuse, and his power to refuse is only that of an existing carrier, or else on the same ground that is adverted to on this matter.  I am speaking of revocation. Revocation is co-extensive with the refusal of a licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, whether under this or any other Act; but at any rate, as long as it is under this Act the conviction for an offence takes place, surely that includes anything that might come under Section 12, that is to say, breach of the common carrier obligation.  It is hardly likely that the draftsman or the Minister intended that these clauses would overlap.  I am taking it that paragraph (c) of Section 18 is the one that refers to the common carrier obligation, and the Minister's powers with regard to that are limited by whether or not there has been a prosecution and a conviction for an offence. If there is overlapping, then we will have to have that explained, because, if this Act is left as it is and it is subject to a different interpretation, that might be a matter to be looked into.  Outside that, there is the question of whether or not the Minister may refuse an application because the applicant is not a common carrier or is not a railway company, or in accordance with sub-section (6) of Section 8 for failing to supply certain information.</P>
      <P>That is the first point.  But there is a bigger point to be considered.  Supposing a person applies under this Section 11 and describes himself as a common carrier for certain named classes of goods, and then afterwards finds that some one of the classes embraces many more articles than he is either willing or capable of carrying, can he ever get that condition cut down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Section 15 applies to the amendment of conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1719" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am referring to the class of goods he carries and the conditions under which he will carry them.  Section 14 says: &ldquo;Whenever the Minister grants a merchandise licence he may attach to such licence certain conditions&rdquo;; and then, in particular, the following conditions are specified: &ldquo;the wages and conditions of employees engaged in the operation of the vehicles; the notification to and approval by the Minister of agreements or arrangements made in relation to the business by the licensee with other persons engaged in the transport of merchandise; and the use, either exclusively or to a specified extent, of vehicles manufactured in whole or in part in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  I think that there is a distinction clearly in the Bill between the conditions attached to a licence which a man gets to carry certain classes of articles and a variation of the classes.  It seems to me that there is that gap in the Bill that once a person has landed himself, so to speak, with being a common carrier for certain named categories of articles, he cannot ever afterwards get out of those.  That is a very serious matter, particularly at the beginning when, undoubtedly, applicants will not know very much about this whole business or about what classification really means; and they will probably be blundering about the classifications and interpreting them in a way which they do not really mean.  I am acknowledging that a classification is only valuable from the angle of an offence from the point of view of the obligations of the common carrier.  As a matter of fact, I do not think that the classification for the purpose of fixing of a maximum charge is going to be of any value for a year or two to come and I think it could be left out. We can deal with the railway companies and the existing carriers and the others on the same footing.  I think that there should be some more precise phrase put in allowing for amendment by the variation in the different categories of the articles to be carried.  I think the other thing is still, if not in some considerable doubt, in some doubt as to whether or not the <Col N="1720" /> Minister can take action for a breach of any carrier obligation, or whether he must leave it in the first instance to the court.  If it is found that there is a breach of the law he can say: &ldquo;I am going to refuse the licence.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not see how that arises in this connection.  The railways are common carriers for those classes of merchandise that they profess to carry.  They are not common carriers of all classes of merchandise.  Similarly in respect to road services, a licensee would be a common carrier in respect of the class of merchandise he is licensed to carry.  Assuming we get the position that Deputy Good contemplates, that there are certain commodities to be carried to a particular district that nobody wants to carry, and that no one has applied for a licence to carry, we have provided for that contingency in Section 9 (3), which permits of the issue of a licence to someone willing to carry.</P>

The fact that arises out of the amendment which we are getting away from is that existing carriers must deliberately make up their minds when applying for licences about the restrictions or the facilities they want imposed upon them in relation to the carrying of goods.  Having made up their minds they are anchored there.  The intention in each case is, so far as we can, to get them into the office and to make them understand the liability they are undertaking, and to get them restricted to the class of goods in respect of which they are willing to undertake common carrier liability.</P>

      <P>I am thinking of the position in such places as Glendalough and Laragh.  It is by no means certain that the Great Southern Railways will cover them.  There is a carrier in Laragh who does the main carrying business of the district.  He is only able to do the work because he is free to choose the conditions under which he works.  He can negotiate loads with people there and with people in Dublin with whom he trades. Now that he will be restricted in his licence he will have to be very careful that he does not exceed it in any way.  I am wondering if it will be practical for him to serve completely that district at all.  The Bill should have provisions for dealing with particular districts like the ones I have mentioned, where there is unlikely to be any competition from the big companies which it is intended to benefit under the Bill.  There should be a provision to give such a man a general licence.</P>

The Minister mentioned that the railway companies would make application for licences for certain districts.  How many districts of the kind would there be? Will the railway companies in one district contract to carry an elephant while in another district they will not do so?

The position of the railway company as a railway company is quite distinct and different from the position of the railway company as a road user. That is the point I want to get quite clear.  As I understand the situation, the railway company, as a railway company, is bound to carry all goods tendered to them with certain of what are called statutory exceptions.</P>

On those certificates will be endorsed the schedules of items which they are licensed to carry.  They will be limited to those particular items which are endorsed on the schedules. Suppose there are some items which they are anxious to carry&mdash;of course the difficulty will be that there may be some items which they are not anxious to carry&mdash;which are not included in the schedules on the licence, what is the position?  Would they have to apply for a new licence to carry these commodities?</P>

If there are <Col N="1725" /> any commodities which they wish to carry, they can apply for a licence if they are not already licensed to carry them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on the road.  They are going to be handed over the whole transport of the country.  When they were first getting the privilege of building the railways they were told &ldquo;you are going to get great privileges in getting this concession and you must become common carriers, with these reservations that in regard to certain classes of merchandise you can make certain restrictions,&rdquo; but they had the obligation to carry everything that was <Col N="1726" /> tendered.  In this Bill, the ultimate aim of which is to restore the monopoly which they had 50 years ago, you are not putting the same obligation on them.  They were prepared to pay that price when they first got the concession. You are not asking them to pay the same price, when you are giving them a monopoly of the road as well as of rail.  I say the railway company should be put under that obligation.  If this legislation is going to hand over to them the right of monopoly, they should have been put under the old obligation to provide a means of transport for every class of merchandise one way or another.  The present situation is that they can say &ldquo;we will carry this class and that class by road.&rdquo;  I may have something I want to send down the country.  They can say: &ldquo;Take it up to the Broadstone and we will deliver it to the station at Kells,&rdquo; whereas if the old obligation were extended to the road I could insist on their carrying it from my door to the door of the person to whom I want it delivered.  If we are going to give them a monopoly, why not impose upon them the obligation to carry everything with all the reservations and safeguards which the Railways Acts gave them? If they were willing to do it when they got the Railways Act they should be compelled to do it now.</P>

It appears to me that there is going to be an extraordinary difference between the railway road transport services and the ordinary carrier.  The ordinary carrier takes naked goods&mdash;I mean without packing&mdash;going from door to door. Are the railway company going to look at the road transport services through railway eyes and say: &ldquo;These goods before being tendered to us must be packed in cases,&rdquo; as if they were going to be transported by rail?  Possibly in some cases they will have to be transported by rail.  At the same time I think the general public, and the Minister in safeguarding the general public, should be very clear and should know where they are.  In other words, are they going to do away with the carrier and have a railway running on the road?  I now move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amending Bill changes the general levy under the Principal Act passed last year.  Under Section 6 of <Col N="1728" /> the Principal Act, there was a general levy which applied to all classes of butter.  If one levy were prescribed, say, for creamery butter, the same levy would apply to all classes of butter.  The object of the amending Bill is to give an option to put one levy on creamery butter and another on non-creamery butter.  If the rate, say, on creamery butter should require to be raised during the coming year&mdash; as we think it will&mdash;there would be no advantage, in our opinion, in raising the rate on non-creamery butter.  The Principal Act, passed last year, operated from 21st April to 31st July and during that period there was a levy of 2d. per lb.  In the case of creamery butter, the bounty was 4d. and in the case of non-creamery butter it was 2½d.  As Deputies know, the export price of creamery butter&mdash;taking that as an example&mdash;would be the price that could be got free on rail, plus whatever bounty or subsidy would be payable.  The price on the home market would be the same as the export price because, where there is an exportable surplus of any article, the home price is always ruled by the export price.  The value, therefore, would be the free-on-rail price, plus bounties or subsidies.  When the price of creamery butter is pushed up artificially in that way on the home market, the price of farmers' butter and factory butter for home consumption also goes up, more or less, in a corresponding way.  That is to say, if people are prepared to pay 3d. per lb. more for creamery butter than for factory butter, the price of factory butter would go up automatically if the price of creamery butter went up. On the other hand, the creameries get the biggest advantage from this scheme.  The factories do not get the same advantage because the proportion of factory butter exported out of the total production is much higher than in the case of creamery butter. Under present conditions, when world prices are changing so rapidly, it may be necessary during the year, if those changes go on, from time to time to change the levy and the bounty and try to maintain some sort of stability in butter prices.  It is not very difficult <Col N="1729" /> for the Department of Agriculture to change the price of creamery butter because we are very closely in touch with the creameries all over the country and it is very easy for us, on a few days' notice, to get in touch with every creamery and explain the circumstances. It is also very easy to convince them of the advantage of changing the rates of bounty or subsidy. We are not at all in such close touch with the makers of farm butter and we are not even in as close touch with the factories as we are with the creameries.  Taking everything into consideration, it would be well to have the power to fix a levy on factory butter and to try to have the same levy for the whole year on factory butter if at all possible.  It may be necessary to change, but we would go as far as possible during the year without making any change in the levy on non-creamery butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall probably be asked why we put any levy on factory and non-creamery butter.  The position is that, under the Principal Act, the price of creamery butter on the home market is raised artificially and, as I said already, the prices of factory and farmers' butter would be raised also, so that the suppliers to the creameries would naturally complain if they were to pay&mdash;as they have to pay by way of levy&mdash;for the whole advantage of raising the price of butter on the home markets and if the makers of factory and farmers' butter were not asked to contribute anything.  We think it fair, therefore, that the makers of factory and farmers' butter should contribute something, though not as much as the creameries, towards the scheme for the coming year.  To raise the levy, it will be necessary to increase the import duty.  Under Section 6 of the Principal Act, it is laid down that the levy cannot be more than half the prevailing import duty.  The import duty is 4d. per lb.  We want to raise that and we are in the position, as it happens, of being able to announce that before doing it, as there is no possibility of forestalling.  Under the Act, we have also the power to prevent the import of butter altogether.  It is merely to fulfil the legal formality of <Col N="1730" /> Section 6 that it is necessary to raise the import duty.</P>
    <P>I may be asked with regard to the special levy.  There are Deputies interested in the creameries scheduled under the Act.  The position with regard to scheduled creameries is that the special levy cannot for this year be less than 50 per cent. of the ordinary levy or more than the general levy.  If we were, therefore, to raise the general levy on creamery butter to 3d. per lb. for this year, we could make the special levy 1½d. or go anywhere between 1½d. and 3d.  It is our present intention to make it 1½d.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I should mention.  Deputies may have fears that the price of butter on the home market will be raised out of all proportion this year to make up for export prices.  There is also a provision in the Principal Act which safeguards the consumer.  Section 30 of the Principal Act limits the price to 144/8 at the creamery.  We cannot operate this Act so as to raise the price of butter at the creamery to more than 144/8.  That was considered, when the Bill was going through, to be a sufficient safeguard to the consumer. I think that is all that can be said about this amending Bill.  It merely amends the general levy and gives us power to prescribe one levy for creamery and another levy for non-creamery butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we pass the Second Reading, there are a few things I should like to ask the Minister. The Minister told us more or less what he proposed to do about the levy, but I do not think he gave any information as to what the bounty is to be this year nor did he say whether it was to be a greatly increased bounty or not.  Some of us would like some information as to the working of this Act during the last year.  We know that it did operate for a period but whether it operated successfully, so far as the Minister's expectations were concerned, we have no information and I think it is due to the House that some information should be given as to whether the proposals in the original Bill, if its operation was not interrupted by <Col N="1731" /> other events, would have realised all the Minister's expectations and whether the levy, last year, of 2d. a lb. would, in fact, have sufficed to give the farmers the 4d. per lb. extra that was promised to them.  The Minister, I think, proposes to continue the special levy to scheduled creameries.  Some of us were very much opposed to that on the last occasion and we feel the same opposition still.  In these days of very close trading and of difficulties in selling, I think that extra favourable consideration should not be given to any creamery.  I do not know whether the Minister would accept an amendment to that effect later on, but, at any rate, I do hope that he will bring the ordinary creameries more into line with one another and that the difference in the levy per lb. will be something less than 1½d. as the Minister proposes.  Three-halfpence per lb. difference in the levy would place those creameries in a much more favourable position as compared with creameries operating on the ordinary levy of 2d., or 3d., whichever the Minister proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as it is here presented to us, does not, as the Minister said, contain very much with the exception of a few amendments as to the levy and the power of the Minister to raise or lower the levy as occasion demands, but what I am particularly concerned about is what the Minister left unsaid as to what prospect there is of the levy, whatever it is, producing the amount in the way of bounty that the Minister expects.  In that respect, his experience of last year's working of the measure, short as it was, ought to have given him sufficient data, and I am sure it has, and, perhaps, the Minister would pass on some of that information to the House.  Most of us are in the dark in discussing this measure and most of the various creamery managers whom I questioned last year as to the working of the Act were completely in the dark as to what the eventual results to their creameries would be, and I am not quite sure, even at the present moment, that the ordinary creamery manager could tell definitely <Col N="1732" /> what the actual results in the way of benefits derived from this Act to an individual creamery were.  Unless one goes into a criticism of the other Act, there is very little further to say by way of criticism of this Bill.  I do not think there will be any great opposition to it.  The Minister seeks power to vary the levy, and that is a power which I am sure the House will give him on the understanding that the bounty will be proportionate.  I did not hear the Minister saying anything about the proposed bounty or whether it is to be increased or not, but, if the levy is going to be considerably increased, we shall all expect that the bounty will be proportionately increased.  I think the House will give the Minister the powers he seeks, and I do not think there is any more to be said on the Bill.</P>

      <P>As I said before in this House, this is one of the commodities in respect of which the effect of the bounty is passed on to the producer. The creamery with which I am connected held its annual meeting on last Friday night and it was evident from the balance sheet that, in the circumstances in which we found ourselves, the bounty was useful in that the suppliers of milk got an increased price.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that in the regulation of the price, he might so arrange it that there would be a greater price in the winter months.  The feeling was that in last year's working of the Act there was not sufficient inducement to encourage winter dairying.  As the Minister very well knows, the cost of winter dairying is out of all proportion to that of summer dairying and I would suggest that, in the arrangement of the price, he would see to it that there would be some inducement for winter dairying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite realise that it is necessary for the Minister to take somewhat greater power than that given to him in the original Act for the purpose of making regulations to cope with the situation that has arisen on account of the drop in butter prices, but, at the moment, it does not appear as if the prospects for this year are very bright. I read recently in a paper that Australia <Col N="1733" /> had agreed to the British suggestion to reduce exports of butter to that country by six per cent., provided as a <i>quid pro quo</i> that the British Government reduced imports of foreign butters by 12 per cent.  That is interesting in view of recent developments in the relationship between this country and Great Britain and it will be interesting to see whether the Irish Free State might not be treated as a foreign country in view of such an arrangement coming into effect.  At all events, it seems perfectly clear that, in time, there will be a curtailment of the exports of butter into the British market, probably by mutual arrangement so far as the Dominions are concerned, and it will be interesting to note how we will fare under an arrangement of that kind.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the object of this amending Bill is to vary the amount of levy and the amount of the bounty as circumstances dictate.  I hope that, in any alterations or changes that the Minister may consider it necessary to make, a proper relationship will always be preserved between the amount of the levy and the amount of the bounty.  I saw it stated in a paper during the last two days that it was the intention of the Minister to increase the levy by 1d. per lb. and increase the bounty slightly also but that the same proportion between the bounty and the levy that was provided for in the parent Act was not to be maintained.  I think the Minister will realise perfectly well that if the levy is to be reduced, as that paper suggests&mdash;I do not know whether that paper was speaking with the authority of the Minister or any of his officials&mdash; it will reduce the price of milk and any reduction in the price of milk at the present time, as the Minister realises perfectly well, will have a very serious effect on the creamery industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was during the debate on the parent Act that the Minister stated the farmers required to receive at least 4¾d. a gallon in order to produce milk economically in this country.  Last year the average price was less than 4d. a gallon.  Any proportionate reduction in the levy which would have the effect of reducing the price of milk would have a serious <Col N="1734" /> reaction on the creamery industry, and it would also result in reducing the cow population.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister would have made some reference to the butter position since the Dairy Produce Act became law.  I do not know whether I am in order in referring to this matter at the moment, but I think I am, because it bears, if not directly, certainly indirectly, on this Bill. Within recent months large quantities of butter were exported to Belgium and France.  Some days ago, in the course of a reply to me, the Minister said that they realised higher prices by selling on the Continent than on the British market.  I would be interested to hear if the Minister is satisfied that the export of butter to the Belgian and the French markets was a more profitable proposition than if that butter were sold in the British market.  I would also like to hear to what extent it will be possible during the coming twelve months, if present prices prevail in those markets, to sell butter there.  The people in the country are, I am sure, interested to know the result of the experiment, and I hope the Minister will deal with the matter in some detail.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know from the Minister what is the amount of money that has actually been realised so far as a result of the levy. The major portion of the levy was utilised for the purpose of paying a bounty on the butter exported, but I have not seen any figures which would indicate the amount of money actually realised on the levy.  I think that when he was dealing with the parent Act the Minister indicated the operation of the Act would cost the taxpayers approximately three-quarters of a million pounds.  According to my calculation up to date, something slightly in excess of half a million pounds has been spent on the operation of the Act.  The figure must be very much higher than that, judging by the published statistics relating to the export of butter from this country, including the exports to Belgium and France.</P>
    <P>A further point arises if not direclty, certainly indirectly, out of <Col N="1735" /> the Bill.  The Minister has had under consideration the reorganisation of certain creameries.  The Minister is aware that many creameries are carrying on although they are not receiving anything like an economic milk supply.  The Minister has been engaged on this work of reorganisation for the last twelve months, and some creamery societies were given to understand that the scheme would be in operation this year.  No intimation has been given them so far in that connection, and they do not know whether the scheme will operate this year.  That places many creamery societies in a very unfair position. If the Minister is not in a position to go ahead with the reorganisation scheme he might let the societies know that, because they probably would be in a position to make other arrangements in order to carry on for this season.  I am sure the Minister recognises that it is necessary, in order to ensure for the creameries an economic milk supply, to reorganise many of the existing creamery areas.</P>
    <P>When the Minister makes regulations under this Bill I assume these regulations will be placed on the Table of the Dáil so that members may be made acquainted with the nature of the regulations and thereby kept in touch with the development of the creamery industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked questions regarding the bounty.  As Deputies know, the principle of the Bill is that whatever is put into the pool by way of a levy is drawn out by way of a bounty.  I think it was stated in some of the daily papers that the bounty would not be twice the levy this year as it was last year. I have no control over that, of course, because it all depends on the amount of production as compared with the amount exported.  Last year when we were bringing in the Bill we estimated that half the butter produced would be exported.  If half the butter is exported the levy would be half the bounty because for every 2 lbs. that the levy is collected upon&mdash; 2d. per lb.&mdash;there is only 1 lb. exported. If the export is down to half <Col N="1736" /> the production the bounty is twice the levy.</P>
      <P>There has been a tendency to increase butter production.  We assume that the home consumption will remain the same.  It has been rather constant for the last six or seven years. Production is tending to increase.  It is estimated that production will increase during the coming year, while home consumption will remain the same.  Exports, therefore, will be up; they will represent more than half the production and then the bounty will not be twice the levy.  If the levy is 3d. the bounty may not be 6d.; it may be down as low as 5d.  It all depends on the amount of export. We would probably start off with a bounty of 5d. and a levy of 3d. If we found our estimate was wrong with regard to production, then the bounty would be increased.  It may be taken, however, that whatever the creameries put into the pool they will get back from the pool.  That is as far as the working of the Stabilisation Act is concerned.  There may have been some confusion by reason of the subsidies out of public funds that were afterwards introduced.</P>
      <P>I was asked by Deputy Bennett if the scheme was successful last year. We had a test only from 1st April until 31st July.  Working on the basis of a 2d. levy and a 4d. bounty we found after three months working that we had a deficit of only £400, so that we did estimate the thing fairly well on the whole.  If the scheme had been carried on for a period of twelve months it is possible it would have worked out rather accurately.  Of course, there were no tariffs, no Government subsidies or Government interference on the other side.  There was no interference on the British side by way of tariffs or on this side by way of subsidies.  When the scheme was working on its own the price of butter was artificially raised by 2d. a lb. and the creameries got the advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bennett objects to favourable treatment for the central creameries.  It does not amount to very much.  I can quite appreciate all Deputy Bennett says&mdash;that the <Col N="1737" /> other creameries cannot afford to carry anybody on their backs this year as they have enough to do to look after themselves.  The amount involved is very small.  It would not amount to more than one per cent. of the contributions made by the stronger creameries.  In fact it would be less than one per cent.</P>
    <P>The production of the large creameries is going up; production in the others is not going up.  We had several of these last year and we had to put them in a schedule.  There were two or three of them that have turned the corner since and are fairly safe now.  The remainder are still in low water.  Deputy Haslett asked could we not have more advantage given to the producers during the winter. There is an advantage under this Bill.  We did not collect the levy during the winter.  The pool is there for twelve months and whatever money is put in up to 1st December must carry the costs by way of bounty for the whole twelve months.  The districts that go on producing milk from 1st December to 31st March have had an advantage that they need not pay any levy during those months so that they have a definite advantage of 2d. in the lb. during those four months. They are in that position in the future schemes.</P>
    <P>I do not say that it was due to the Stabilisation Act that butter production was up last year.  It was up by practically 50 per cent. in the winter months.  That was due more to the tendency to increase in general in the butter industry.  It was due also perhaps to the favourable weather conditions, not only favourable conditions during the winter months but also favourable weather conditions during the summer when the hay crop was being saved.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Roddy as to getting a proper relationship between the levy and the bounty, that depends altogether on the production and export.  Of course if the production remains as it was last year there will be the same relationship remaining this year.  It looks as if there would be more butter this coming year.  I do not agree with <Col N="1738" /> Deputy Roddy that the average price at the creameries last year was 4d. As far as I remember, the Department figures showed that it averaged 4.5 pence during the year.  We had an important conference of creameries yesterday and the representative of one creamery stated that a large creamery in Limerick, I think, paid 4.75d.  That was certainly high and much above the average all round. With regard to the other point raised by Deputy Roddy that I stated here it might cost £750,000 to the taxpayer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, to the consumer. There was the question of the taxpayer afterwards, because on 31st July we took the burden off the consumer and put it on the taxpayer.  From 31st July onwards the cost was £500,000. That is what it will cost the taxpayer on subsidies on butter during the 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, eight months.  In these eight months we paid roughly £500,000.  With regard to the regulations, of course, these will be laid on the Table as arranged under the Act. Now in reference to the reorganisation scheme to which Deputy Roddy refers, we did get the creameries to reorganise in the area in which I am afraid we are going to fail.  I think we will have to proceed with a little bit of persuasion amongst those creameries.  I think, however, that Deputy Roddy will find that there will be some progress shown in the coming week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Roddy and Deputy Bennett thought that I should make a general statement on the butter situation.  In the first place, I do not know whether on this Bill I would be in order in doing so, and in the second place that matter is more or less sub judice at present.  Yesterday there was a conference of all interested in the butter industry held in the Department of Agriculture.  After long deliberation they appointed a sub-committee which will confer again with me on the matter.  Our deliberations did not <Col N="1739" /> conclude yesterday and therefore, I could not give any details as to what might be expected during the coming year.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy knows that the world prices of butter, again leaving out the tariffs and subsidies, is very low compared with the prices last year.  The world price now would be about 74/-for Colonial butter.  Our butter would be about the same price as Australian or New Zealand butter, that is 74/-When I was bringing in the Principal Act last year I remember saying that the Bill was necessary owing to the appalling price to which butter had come down.  The price then was 110/-Now the comparative price is 74/-</P>
    <P>This Act will go some way towards dealing with the position, but a Government subsidy will be necessary also in order to make the position right in the coming year.  The thing is being considered between this committee appointed by the interests concerned and the Department of Agriculture and we may be able to announce next week what, possibly, may be done for the butter industry next year.  Even with a bounty or Government subsidy, prices will not be as good to the creameries as they were last year.  With regard to the markets, we did get a fairly substantial footing for a few months during the winter on the French market but it is about this time of the year, as in Ireland, that the French produce sufficient for their own requirements, so that there is no market in France now until we come to October again.  In Belgium there is a market to be got the whole year round.  It should be possible to maintain the quota that we have got in Belgium during the whole twelve months,</P>

We have done our best to establish ourselves in these markets.  We have got a certain quota.  In the Belgian market it is not a Government quota.  It is a merchant gets the quota, not the country.  A merchant is not bound to take his whole quota from the Free State, but he has taken fairly large quantities from us up to this.  I can supply particulars of the quantity to Belgium.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to enable compensation to be paid to persons who suffered property losses during the period from 21st January, 1919, to 12th May, 1923, and who either did not apply for compensation or, having so applied, were debarred, and are debarred, under existing legislation from receiving compensation.  In its general scheme the Bill follows the lines of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, and the subsequent analogous legislation.  It might be mentioned here that the burden of compensation for malicious injuries to property sustained prior to the 21st January, 1919, was borne by the local authorities.  The reason why we have taken the 21st January, 1919, <Col N="1745" /> as the commencing date for the period in respect of which the Bill is to apply is that the First Dáil sat on that date, and that date is regarded as marking the opening of hostilities with the British Forces.  It is also the date which the Act of 1923 recognised for the purpose of assuming responsibility for compensation for property losses sustained from that time up to the 12th May, 1923, when the civil war ended.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation, particularly under the Act of 1923, claims for compensation for damage to property were dealt with in the following way: Claims in respect of damage in the post-truce period, that is from the 12th July, 1921, to the 12th May, 1923, were heard and determined under the Act of 1923 by the County or Circuit Court. Pre-truce damage to property was under a different category.  Claims in respect of such damage were determined by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission, a body which was set up by agreement between the Irish Free State Government and the British Government.  This Commission confined itself to the consideration of claims for compensation for damage to property <i>per se.</i>  The taking away of chattels was not, for instance, a proper subject for a compensation claim under the Criminal Injuries Code, and the Compensation (Ireland) Commission accordingly were precluded by their terms of reference from awarding compensation in respect of such chattels.  This particular Commission ceased to function in March, 1926.  All claims which did not properly come within the terms of reference of that Commission were dealt with, as to one part, by the Act of 1923 to which I have referred, and as to another part, particularly as to the pre-truce damage&mdash;chattels taken away and such injuries done&mdash;by a Commission or Committee which was set up under the Indemnity Act of 1924.</P>
    <P>Claims, as I have already said, for post-truce damage to property were heard and determined by the County or Circuit Court.  Under the Act of 1923 a time limit for making claims was enforced, and this time limit expired in September, 1923.  Except <Col N="1746" /> where the damage was sustained in the course of a conflict the court was empowered to make a decree&mdash;a decree as distinct from a report.  Payments under such decrees were mandatory on the Minister for Finance, while payments under reports were not mandatory, subject, however, so far as decrees were concerned, to the right of the Minister for Finance to appeal to a higher court.  The court was also empowered, in connection with claims for damage to property, to attach a reinstatement condition to any award in respect of injured buildings. One of the disabilities which this Bill is designed to remove is that the Statute specifically disentitles to compensation any person who, in the opinion of the court, connived at, assisted in, or actively facilitated the committal of an injury, or was a member or helper or active sympathiser with any organisation engaged in armed opposition to the late Provisional Government or the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  The section of the Statute which specifically imposed this disability in relation to claims for compensation for damage to property was Section 9.  A somewhat similar disability was imposed under Section 15 in relation to claims for chattels taken away.  As I have already indicated, claims in respect of chattels taken away during the post-truce period were also referable to the County or Circuit Court.  In such cases, and also in cases where damage to property was sustained during the course of the actual fighting, the court could only make a report&mdash;a report as distinct and contrasted with a decree. I have already pointed out that decrees were mandatory upon the Minister for Finance, subject, of course, to his right to appeal to a higher court.  Reports were not so mandatory.  In regard to reports the Minister had complete discretion. Generally, the reports were discharged in full, but in some instances a reduced payment was made, where it was ascertained that the amount specified in the report was excessive. Billeting claims were outside the scope of the Statute, and the disability imposed by Section 9 applied also, as I have already said, to chattels taken <Col N="1747" /> away.  In this case it was provided that reports could only be made when the goods were taken without the consent of the owner, and when in effect the goods were taken by persons engaged in armed opposition to the Government of the time.  I may say that, on the ground that one or both of those conditions applied, payments on foot of reports, aggregating £52,000, were refused by the former Administration.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the Indemnity Act of 1924, and I pointed out that it dealt with certain pre-truce claims.  Under this Act, a Committee was established to assess and recommend payment of compensation in respect of direct loss for damage arising through interference with property in the period from the 21st January, 1919, to the 28th June, 1922.  In the words of the Statute: &ldquo;By any person holding office under the first Dáil Eireann or second Dáil Eireann or any person employed in any military or civil service established or maintained by or under the authority of the first Dáil Eireann or second Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  For all practical purposes this might be construed as meaning, by members of the Irish Volunteers or pre-split I.R.A.</P>
    <P>This Committee dealt mainly with claims in respect of property, including guns, motors, cycles, groceries, taken by or supplied to the Volunteers in the pre-truce period, these claims as I have already pointed out being outside the purview of the Compensation (Ireland) Commission.  It also dealt with similar losses sustained during the further period down to the beginning of the civil war on the 28th June, 1922.  It is to be noted in this connection that there was no stipulation in the Indemnity Act as to property taken without the owner's consent. The Statute of 1923 specifically debarred the Committee from taking into consideration any loss or damage arising from the quartering or billeting of troops.  Payment was authorised by the Minister for Finance on foot of the Committee's recommendations in every case.  In a small number of cases where the amounts recommended were regarded as excessive <Col N="1748" /> reduced payments were made. This Committee ceased to function in March, 1928.  To complete the picture it is necessary to point out that claims in respect of damage to property commandeered by the National Army and in respect to goods supplied to or taken by the Army were investigated departmentally, and payment made in approved cases by the Office of Public Works and the Department of Defence, respectively.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is not concerned in any way with claims of this class.  If any such claims remain outstanding or if claimants are dissatisfied with the amount of compensation already paid, the matter is one for direct negotiation with the Department concerned. I should like to emphasise that, because judging by some claims which have already come into the Department, it is presumed that they will all come within the provisions of this Bill, whereas quite a considerable number of them may be settled outside the Bill, as I have said, by direct negotiations with the Departments concerned.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned to Friday, 31st March, 1933.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister adverted to this point that under a section of the Railway Bill the railway company can suspend a service on a branch line with the Minister's approval?  The Minister said very bluntly that his policy was to get rid of these uneconomic branch lines; that it would not take much to convince him to do so.  If you relieve the railway company of its obligations to carry all goods tendered to it at the moment you suspend a branch line, you put in its place an adequate road service under the Road Transport Bill which carries no such obligation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but you are providing in the Railway Bill for the closing down of these branch lines if the railway company provide an adequate road service.  The adequate road service that is defined in this Bill is not a road service carrying with it the obligation imposed on the railway companies in their capacity as common carriers.  To avoid confusion let it go on record that the obligation of a common carrier is of a dual character: (1) to accept all classes of merchandise; and (2) to carry all merchandise on certain terms.  Now the first part of a common carrier's liability applies to a railway company which must take anything that is offered and carry it to its destination. So long as you have a branch railway line going into a town the people there have a knowledge of the terms on which they can get everything they want carried.  You close down that branch line under the Railways Act and put in its place an adequate road service under this Bill, whereupon the people in the towns concerned will discover that for certain classes of merchandise there is no transport service.</P>

      <P>That is a consideration that will have to be taken into account when the Order for the closing down of the branch line is applied for. Consideration would have to be given to the classes of merchandise carried on that branch line over a period, as well as to the adequacy of the road service to be substituted for the railway service to carry these classes of merchandise in the volume in which they had been carried heretofore. That is a consideration that will have to be taken into account, whether the road service substituted for the railway service is adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get this clear.  I desire to mention at this juncture so as to have it placed clearly on record that the obligation of a railway company over a railway system at the present time is to accept from a consignor any merchandise or goods that the consignor brings and tenders to it, provided the consignor complies with the regulations stipulated by the railway company.  That is the present obligation on a railway company.  It can refuse no class of merchandise or live stock.  If you close down a branch railway line then, so far as the people served by that branch line are concerned, there is going to be, according to the Minister's attitude this afternoon, no similar service substituted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

I emphasise that, because an hour ago the Minister stoutly denied that the obligation which I have just described rested on the railway companies at all.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring the Minister back to the three questions that I asked.  He was unfortunate in the one that he selected to answer.  I asked him to define a common carrier's obligations in respect of three classes of goods: (1) goods that the common carrier was bound to carry under certain laid down conditions&mdash;conditions which were onerous to the company; (2) goods which the common carrier was not bound to accept under the conditions; and (3) was there any class of goods which the railway company could refuse&mdash;and the Minister said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ought to think twice before saying that.  It is quite right to say that if someone were to ask the railway company to carry the Eiffel Tower from Paris they could not refuse to carry it but they could impose certain conditions, which would make it impossible for them to carry it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot refuse. The Minister is mistaken and he will find that he has misstated it.  He cannot say categorically what he did <Col N="1752" /> say previously&mdash;that there are certain things which the railway can refuse to carry absolutely.  I think that this whole matter of a common carrier should be clearly defined for the edification of the House.  A classification according to the company's risk and the owner's risk would be the easiest; then there could be a classification as to animals and the different classes and categories of goods.  You will never get to the point where the railway company will say: &ldquo;We will not carry that.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>However, the main point which I wanted to urge was this: I should like to agree with the Minister that it is quite a fair proposition that an applicant for a licence, in the main, should be requested to say what he proposes to carry.  I think that the applicant has got to be enlightened as to what his obligations are going to be. Supposing he can be so enlightened, and having obtained full knowledge of all the circumstances and after the excogitation of the whole circumstances which he can make for himself, he may then apply for a licence for the carriage of certain classes of goods and finds afterwards that it has put obligations on him to carry certain goods which he never counted on having to carry, is there any way in which that man can amend his licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not under the Bill. Well, I think that there should be some means of doing so.  Say that this man is prepared to enter into business for a certain named number of articles or classes or categories of articles, still we must allow for the unforeseen event.  I think that it is only right that there should be some allowance made where it should be easy for such a man, subject to a very definite control, to enlarge his licence.  If the control he is under is going to limit his obligation to certain classes or categories of goods he never intended to carry, and which he has inadvertently included, there ought to be some means to meet that. I think that it is not in the Bill as it stands.  I am still inclined to think that in this amendment of mine, allowing <Col N="1753" /> the man to carry either the merchandise he would specify or be able to carry, it would be covered.  I think that there is no harm in having that allowance there and it may turn out more convenient to have it there.  I admit that I have not definite cases before me to make my points stronger but I suggest that it does not lessen or weaken the Minister's control.  It allows for a little more elasticity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I move amendment 39:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 35, after the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; to insert the words following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;granted in any case where the public interest imperatively requires that the weight of merchandise to be carried on the main roads of any area covered by such licence should be so restricted or where the licensee himself requests that such licence may be so restricted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a different matter altogether. A request was made to me about it and I said I would put it before the House, but I am not entirely enthusiastic about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is to insert after the word &ldquo;licence,&rdquo; in line 35 of <Col N="1754" /> Section 11, the phrase which follows, so that sub-section (2) should read with this included.  Sub-section (2) is a section which limits the licence by the unladen weight condition.  It ties up the licence which is applied for to whatever is the unladen weight of the vehicles which the person has specified, at a critical moment indicated by him, as his fleet.  I want to say that this is to operate if the public interest imperatively requires &ldquo;that the weight of merchandise to be carried on the main roads of any area covered by such licence should be so restricted or where the licensee himself requests that such licence may be so restricted.&rdquo;  In other words, instead of having it that every licence is subject to this condition about the laden weight, it limits him to the extent that that limitation should only apply in either of two contingencies&mdash;when the licensee so requests, or when the public interest demands that the weight carried on the main roads of the area should be restricted.  It is a limitation of one of the main conditions of the licence. The argument is that if the licensee requests it, it should be done; but the main point is in the first phrase, and that is, that the limitation to such a fleet would only be made where it seemed that the roads could not stand up to it.  In other words, that the overriding condition would be where the roads are fit to bear the traffic.  I admit, and I have urged it on those people who suggested this, that the only limitation which it would have on traffic for the future would be on the number of owners or licensees, but would enable the licensee, once he got his licence, to extend his fleet only subject to this limitation&mdash;that the roads would not stand up to the traffic, not alone in the case of his own vehicles but in that of other vehicles operating there. It makes the standard rather the condition of the road than the amount of traffic to be carried by particular vehicles.  I admit that that is not dealing with the transport problem at all.  The answer came to me that that would commend itself in so far as competing vehicles are there concerned.</P>

      <P>So far as the problem of the weight of merchandise carried over the roads is concerned there are provisions in the Road Traffic Bill, which was before the Dáil, which give certain wide powers to local authorities and to the Minister for Local Government in that regard.  It is mainly a traffic problem and not a transport problem.  In so far as the Deputy's amendment seeks to modify the proposals in the Bill it is cutting right across them.  There might be a case for doing that.  This is what would happen.  The effect of allowing each licensee to increase a fleet would be to permit road transport services, other than the railway owned transport services, without limit, and to intensify competition which would make more difficult the general aim of the Bill.  Definitely the intention in this Bill is that on the &ldquo;Appointed Day&rdquo; the road transport position will be fixed.  In so far as road transport services are operated by private individuals they will remain at that point; they cannot go beyond it. They may be bought out or they may get out themselves.  The size of their services may be reduced; they cannot be increased.  The only increase in road transport after that date will be such increases as are effected by the railway companies.  That is the main scheme of the Bill.  The amendment would cut right across it.  Consequently I must oppose the amendment.</P>

The point was raised as to whether the roads would not stand up to the traffic, <Col N="1756" /> as it grew, or whether it was a limitation, a cutting down of the weight of the lorries in the owner's possession.</P>

      <P>The Minister very properly said there is provision in Section 16 of the Traffic Bill under which regulations are made prescribing the maximum weight of unladen locomotives and mechanically propelled vehicles.  There are other matters that do not appear to me to be included.  A case occurs to me where wooden framework of considerable size which was too wide to go on the railways was delivered by motor transport.  Owing to its size it would be almost the width of many of the narrow roads that we know in this country.  In addition to the weight restriction, surely it is necessary to prescribe the size of commodities that can be carried.</P>

Deputy McGilligan gave those privileges and he seemed anxious to get them at the time.  I am not so sure that he is not anxious now to withdraw some of them.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The section requires that a person shall indicate the area in which he proposes to carry on business as a common carrier. &ldquo;Area&rdquo; seems to be such a wide term that there is need for some kind of definition as to what the word actually means.  The Minister, this evening, when asked as to the significance of &ldquo;area&rdquo; in another connection, said it might mean the province of Munster or the province of Connaught.  That seems to suggest that a carrier could <Col N="1760" /> make application for a licence and indicate that he proposed to carry on business in the province of Munster. Suppose 20 or 30 people did likewise, it might be found, if they did not indicate the routes, that they might all confine themselves to the north, south or west of the province.  They might all concentrate on one area, thus, perhaps, leaving some areas under-served and others over-served.  It might be that in the beginning they might distribute their services so that all areas in the province would be served, but it might be found after a while that the best kind of traffic was to be found in the eastern area.  They would then all concentrate on the east, so that there would be inadequate services in other places. I suggest that something more than the name of a wide geographical area might be inserted so that a carrying company would be required to be more precise.  They should not have the right to perambulate into any portion of the province that suited them without carrying on a regular service in any portion.  I think the Minister will see that under this section, if &ldquo;area&rdquo; has the wide definition that I fancy it has, it is possible for a carrier to give any service he likes.  It is possible for him to say: &ldquo;The lorry is not going in that direction,&rdquo; or it is possible for him to refuse to convey goods in a particular direction if it is not worth while doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is that when a licensee defines the area he undertakes, he faces the liability that he will not unreasonably refuse to carry merchandise to any part of that area, If he does unreasonably refuse to do so, there is an action against him.  When he selects an area, he undertakes in that area a common carrier's liability in respect of the classes of goods he professes to carry. He must carry them and he cannot unreasonably refuse to carry merchandise to any part of the area.  The main consideration, however, is that it is impossible to regulate the carriage of merchandise in relation to routes in the same way as the carriage of passengers can be regulated.  When <Col N="1761" /> somebody applies for a licence for a passenger service he is required to state exactly the routes along which he proposes to run from one end to the other, but a merchandise service cannot be operated in that way.  The carrier must be allowed to deviate from routes in order to carry merchandise from one point to another.  That is why we are obliged to have areas instead of routes in relation to merchandise services.  The position is that when a carrier applies for a licence he will be asked in what area he is willing to take a common carrier's responsibility.  The wider the area the greater the liability he is undertaking. Consequently the greater the chance, if his equipment is inadequate, of his being involved in a breach of the obligation imposed on him by Section 12.  The tendency therefore will be on the part of the carrier to restrict his area to the size in which he can undertake to act as common carrier, that is to carry the goods he professes to carry to any part on demand if it does not impose unreasonable conditions on him,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there would be considerable difficulty in imposing a route obligation on a carrier of merchandise as distinct from a carrier of passengers but I think it would be desirable if at all possible to impose that obligation.  However, it does not seem possible.  I do not think the fact that one can take an action against a carrier, if he fails unreasonably to carry goods within the area, is any kind of remedy if one is dealing with a small company or if one is a humble citizen.  It is no satisfaction to say that one has got certain rights against him because these rights may be so troublesome to assert that a person simply is content to put up with an inadequate service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give the Deputy an idea of the safeguards.  Say there are two flour merchants in a town, the town of Kanturk for instance, and that the person who is carrying out a road merchandise service in that area delivered flour to one merchant and refused to deliver it to the other.  Then the other merchant <Col N="1762" /> can take an action against the carrier to recover damages for having refused to deliver particular consignments either for him or to him.  The carrier himself puts himself in the position that he has departed from the obligation imposed on him by the Act. There is a very definite protection for the public by imposing that obligation on anyone who has a licence to carry merchandise by road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose instead of a flour merchant, John Murphy, a humble citizen with very little means, wants to send a commodity from Kanturk to Castletownbere over a sparsely populated area, is John Murphy in the same position as the flour merchant to ensure that his rights are respected?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question is: is John Murphy in a position to get his remedy against the carrier?  I want to establish that so far as possible, where the carrier is in a position to do so, that he will indicate the routes he intends to serve in an area rather than that he should be given a permit to operate over the whole Province of Munster, accepting goods for a portion of the province and refusing them for another, and generally carrying on such an unsatisfactory service that, in fact, although he is licensed for the whole province, he is operating only over a portion of it and neglecting the other portions.</P>

Suppose that a man at an out of the way point in a big area covered by an existing carrier's licence wants, on one or two occasions, to send goods to an equally inaccessible point further on.

      <P>There was another point to which I thought Deputy Norton might have been directing attention.  I recognise the tremendous difficulties in all this.  Whereas, with regard to passengers, you can say that a bus must ply between certain points, you cannot say that with regard to a goods lorry, because the particular virtue of a goods lorry is its mobility&mdash; that it can go anywhere.  Goods cannot walk part of the distance, as passengers can to meet a bus at a certain point.  I should like to have this matter inquired into; it is not by any means completely clear but I think it is fairly clear that the obligations of common carriers are, in the Common Carriers Acts, attached to routes and not to areas.  If you bring in this clause it will simply mean that in relation to an area a man shall be a common carrier.  I think you will have to embody the whole provisions of the Common Carriers Act and specify the routes eventually.  A general declaration may mean every possible road connection as between any one point and another.  It seems to me that this is putting a very big obligation on the carrier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A query has been raised as to whether or not the common carrier's liability attaches to routes and I am having that examined. I should not like to have to express an <Col N="1764" /> opinion on that point, because some amendment of the section may be necessary if this very involved legal point is found to be as the Deputy states.

People who live off the main road fear that they will not be in a position to command the service of a lorry to bring their live stock or other produce to market.  I take it that the section is being passed on the assumption that they will be in such a position &mdash;that anybody getting a licence will be compelled, on order from the farmer, to go to the farmer's house, irrespective of what sort of roadway or laneway leads to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister has studiously avoided up to the present the task of defining clearly to the House what a common carrier is.  I do not think that at this moment the House is aware of the liability which the description of the licensee as a common carrier by statute involves.  So far as I am aware&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;the liability of a common carrier is to accept such merchandise as he holds himself out to carry and, secondly, safely to deliver that merchandise except prevented from <Col N="1765" /> doing so by acts of the King's enemies, by an act of God, or by an inherent defect in the goods.  While the railway companies are common carriers at rates prescribed by the Railway Tribunal, with all the liabilities I have mentioned, by accepting a lower rate they can contract out and carry at owner's risk.  Here you have a statute which says &ldquo;Every licensee under a merchandise licence shall in relation to all the merchandise specified in such licence and in the area stated in such licence be a common carrier.&rdquo;  To my mind, that absolutely precludes the possibility of these licensees contracting out.  They cannot contract out.  In any event, there are no rates provided to enable them to contract out by the acceptance of a lower rate.  You have on every licensed carrier the obligation safely to deliver these goods unless he can prove there was an outbreak of some sort, that the King's enemies, foreign or domestic, waylaid him, or that there was an inherent defect in the goods.  Whether we could find any King's enemies in this country is open to question.  Is it the intention of the Government to place that very exhaustive liability on these people?  I am entitled to assume that it is, from the form of the Bill.  I looked for information to the Attorney-General, but he is not here, nor is Deputy Costello on the benches opposite.  I would, however, remind the Minister that the whole trend of the law is against the definition of &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo; as laid down in the Blackburn decision.  It is generally held that the obligations that that decision has laid upon common carriers are altogether too unreasonable. I think the Minister will find that it is altogether an unreasonable standard to prescribe for road transport. I ask the Minister to bear in mind that the railway company is going to acquire all this road transport in the end.  They will not be able to do that judging by what the Minister said to-day.  Their road licence operations are not going to come under the Railway Tribunal at all.  They are only going to be common carriers for what they undertake to carry under this statute.  They will have that liability laid upon them on the roads, although it will not lie upon them on the rails. <Col N="1766" /> I suggest to the Minister that he ought to consider the question of limiting the section.  I was going to put down an amendment, but I thought it was better to leave it to the Minister, who has the assistance of experts.  I was going to suggest that they should be common carriers, but not so as to impose the liability of insurer upon them.  I think the statutory term for that liability is &ldquo;insurer.&rdquo;  An amendment along those lines would be desirable.</P>

Having heard the Deputy, I think I shall proceed with that intention, firstly, because of the trouble it has given the Deputy and, secondly, because, if we state clearly what we intend, the Deputy will get a definition of the conditions, regulations and restrictions to be imposed upon licensees.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out this and I thought that Deputy Dillon was coming to the point.  I have asked, two or three times, what the reason is for having these maximum charges and the classification of merchandise clauses in.  I did not get an answer and I thought it was intended to hide the real answer.  I thought it was because the Minister had been apprised of what is really in process of being established as the law now&mdash; it has not really emerged yet, but it is in process of coming out&mdash;that, if you have a maximum charge established and you charge anything less than that, you can contract out of all liability and, I gather, even to the point of contracting against liability for the misconduct of your servant.  The maximum charge under this Bill is imposed only on the railway company in relation to their road vehicles and, therefore, they would be the only people who could contract out.  I thought that was the intention, that this, in other words, was another hardship on the ordinary owner who was going to have all the disadvantages, because there was no statutory charge for him and, therefore, he cannot contract out, and that he was going to be subject to all the disabilities of the old rigid rule with regard to the carrier, whereas the railway company had a very easy way out.  They get a maximum charge established, which, of course, they could not possibly think of charging at the moment, and, therefore, by offering to carry at less than that, they could easily, by reference to some condition contained somewhere, get out of that obligation.  I think that if the Minister intends to meet it, <Col N="1768" /> instead of proceeding to set out any other thing which would be subject to the new set of cases built on it and, therefore, subject, possibly, to a changed interpretation every half year, he should rather think of Deputy Dillon's suggestion of keeping the term &ldquo;common carrier,&rdquo; but limited in a particular way.  The common carrier phrase is good as an envelope.</P>

      <P>I raised a point yesterday and I should like an answer to it.  The section is the section which, I suppose, is intended to take the place of all the old regulations governing port preferences.  Does it meet the actual situation in relation to the ports of Cork or Waterford? I am not sure that it can be very clearly stated where the preference lies but I think that, at the moment, some of these ports are actually in a preferred position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I think if we are going to think of railroad traffic as being somewhat divided out in future as between road and rail wagons, the fears of some of these ports that, if road traffic grows, they are going to be deprived of the preferential position they now have in relation to traffic which ordinarily was carried by rail, are going to be justified.</P>

      <P>The situation might arise at some stage when they would have to be considered but it has not arisen yet.  These ports enjoy certain preferential treatment in respect of through traffic carried by rail at the present time.  That preferential treatment is not being taken from them under this Bill.  It is being preserved for them.  There is no preferential treatment in respect of road-borne traffic and I do not contemplate that a situation will arise for a considerable time in which they will find that the volume of traffic transferred from rail to road is going to be so considerable as to wipe out the preference.  It might arise some time but, when it does, we will have an entirely new transport problem to deal with.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 45 and 46.</P>
      <P>45.  Before Section 14, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The maximum hours of duty worked by persons employed by the holder of any merchandise licence shall not be in excess of forty-four in any one week.</P>
      <P>(2)  Any holder of a merchandise licence who causes or permits any person employed by him or subject to his orders in the operation of his business of merchandise road transport to work in excess of the time specified in the next preceding sub-section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> 46.  Before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The wages paid by the holder of any merchandise licence to persons employed by him in the operation of his business of merchandise road transport and the conditions of their employment shall not be less favourable to them than the wages and conditions generally recognised by trade unions and employers as the wages and conditions applicable to employees in the business of merchandise road transport.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any trade union representative of persons engaged in merchandise road transport may make representations to the Minister to the effect that the wages paid to, or the conditions of employment of, any persons employed by the holder of any merchandise licence are not in accordance with the requirements of the preceding sub-section, and the Minister shall, after a review of the facts, take such action thereon as he may deem appropriate, including the revocation of such merchandise licence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These amendments seek to establish a maximum working week of 44 hours for persons employed by the holder of a merchandise licence.  I think it will be agreed by everybody that the initiation and development of road transport has, in a very large measure, ousted the older method of horse transport and we have got a position, therefore, in which this new mechanisation of transport is causing unemployment amongst people who formerly followed the old method of transport.  If there is any justification, any social justification, whatever for the mechanisation of road transport or any other industry, the only justification, surely, is that the community as a whole are given the benefits of mechanisation.  In this case, it is sought to give a section of the community, the workers engaged in the industry, some of the benefits of mechanisation by fixing a maximum working week of 44 hours.  It is not infrequently urged&mdash;and I think Deputy Good is the pioneer of this particular form of argument in this House&mdash;that you must work long <Col N="1771" /> hours here because somebody else in some other part of the world also works long hours.  I suggest to Deputy Good that that argument of his, which I am rather suspicious he will use if I do not point out the weakness of it beforehand, does not apply in this case.  Irish road transport, even of a mechanised character, is not in competition with British or German or Japanese transport and, consequently, it cannot be urged that it is necessary for the Irish worker employed by a merchandise licence holder to work more than 44 hours in order to enable him to compete with a rival in some other part of the world.  Road transport is an internal industry.  Irish road transport will not be in competition with external industry and, consequently, that point so often urged by Deputy Good is completely invalid on an occasion like this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, to some extent, and if the Deputy is going to develop that point, I would point out the obvious difference between the two classes of employment.  The fact that the railway companies employ their staff for 48 hours per week does not mean that that gives any more religious or social righteousness to 48 hours as a working week.  There is a difference, of course, between the employee of the merchandise licence holder, driving a big heavy lorry which is controlled by hand and working at high pressure for 48 hours as compared with the railway employee who might, for instance, be working at a station in Connemara.  There is an obvious difference there which everybody realises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obvious difference in this case and the difference, I suggest, is well in favour of the employee of the merchandise holder. The employee under this section, if it is carried, will be working on a 44-hour <Col N="1772" /> week basis.  That means an eight hours net day with a weekly half-holiday, and I suggest to Deputy Good that that is not a leisurely working week. There is another consideration, that, in many cases of outside industry, ordinary private industry, the employees work not more than 44 hours per week.  The Dublin Corporation works its employees for not more than 44 hours per week.  The Electricity Supply Board works its employees for not more than 44 hours per week and some of Deputy Good's own employees work for not more than 44 hours per week.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy Good and to the House that if, in undertakings of the kind I have quoted, craftsmen of the type I have referred to work not more than 44 hours a week on a class of work which does not tend seriously to imperil the lives of people, then there is a very strong reason why a person in charge of a heavy motor lorry should not be asked to work more than a 44 hours week.  These people are engaged in road transport.  Their physical condition and their skill determine in a large measure the safety of many people using the roads.  I maintain that it is not good for the physical or the moral well-being of an employee if he is worked long hours.  It is highly dangerous to the users of roads if the drivers of these vehicles are asked to work beyond their physical powers of endurance.  I think a 44 hours week is very desirable both in the interests of the employees and from the point of view of public safety.  The employees should not be driving motor lorries when they ought to be resting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to speak in opposition to this amendment. To get the thing in proper perspective, it should be remembered that the amendment seeks to insert a new section in front of Section 14. Section 14 gives the Minister power, when granting a licence, to prescribe conditions.  He has to have regard to the wages and conditions of employment of the employees engaged in the operation of these vehicles.  The Minister is to have the power to impose reasonable conditions, and he is to <Col N="1773" /> limit the hours of employment.  The Deputy suggests that outside of all that there is to be a maximum of 44 hours in any one week, with no distinction or definition as to periods of rest&mdash;no division of the 44 hours into so many hours per day.  He does not specify a maximum of so many hours a day with a definite rest period.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to have the impact on the lorry owner of this Act, this new clause and Section 167 of the Road Traffic Act, then there is a peculiar situation.  Under this proposal the Minister may impose reasonable conditions.  The Deputy says that the Minister shall not, however, consider anything reasonable if it is beyond 44 hours; in fact, he cannot allow anything beyond 44 hours. The section in the Road Traffic Act says that the Minister cannot allow any continuous period of driving exceeding 5½ hours or any series of continuous periods which would extend beyond 11 hours in the 24.  Add to that the Minister's power to make an order varying that period up or down and where are we?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I even expressed myself in relation to the 44 hour week when that matter was under consideration. Deputy Norton said two things, with one of which I would like vehemently to disagree.  I would like to agree with the other to some degree. I do not know how far I should express my agreement, whether I should do so enthusiastically or tepidly.  Deputy Norton said that road transport is an internal industry.  Surely the transport of the country affects everything that is exported from the country, and to that extent road transport, as a contributing item, cannot be regarded as purely internal.  It is taking a very limited view of transport to say that it is an internal matter.  I do agree with the Deputy to the extent that if this age is going to become progressively mechanised and if mechanisation is <Col N="1774" /> going to mean the production of more wealth at the expense of less human toil, then the result should be shown in more leisure for the worker.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the view that in a country like this we should try to stop the progress of mechanisation. I think the better idea by far is to agree to and further by every means an increase in mechanisation and the use of the machine instead of using man's labour and to allow that to be worked out in better terms of human leisure for the man whose labour is replaced by the machine.  I am not so sure that in the matter of transport this country is in the position where we can say that mechanisation has definitely brought about any very big increase, any apparent increase, in wealth.  I think at the moment people are getting goods transported at very cheap rates and that is because they are being transported uneconomically.  When the situation rights itself, I think we will find that the road vehicle has no great advantage so far as cheapness of transport is concerned.  I think road transport is of considerable advantage from another angle.  It is an advantage from the point of view of convenience&mdash;door to door carriers.  There is, however, a certain handling of traffic which, if it does include labour, involves the introduction of a rather useless type.  I do not use the word &ldquo;useless&rdquo; in a degrading sense.  I mean by it a use that we would be better without.  It involves really an interference in the carriage of traffic more than anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see a limitation put on the hours of work, a better limitation than is contained in Section 167 of the Road Traffic Act. I am forced to recognise this since the last occasion on which Section 167 was discussed here.  We may not have even the data upon which to form a very clear view as to what the maximum period ought to be, but I see that in England at this moment, where they have a section corresponding to our Section 167, there is an application at hearing for the increase of the period of continuous driving.  It seems to me that in <Col N="1775" /> England, where they have a larger experience of the conveyance of goods by road than we have, they are still at the point where they cannot set an overriding maximum with regard to the hours of continuous work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not a whole lot of evidence either way.  The fact is, however, that there they have not reached the point where they can impose an overriding maximum.  I have no doubt there was evidence tendered against the application and there are people who would like to see the application turned down, but the fact is that that application has been pushed and it shows that they have not been able to determine the overriding maximum in England.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what is the best thing to do with this.  I do not think we can say that a 44-hour week is what we should establish as a maximum.  We are not at that point.  If we did so I would look upon it as a rather subtle railway move, because it would mean that road transport would not be used to the same extent as heretofore.  The road transporters would have to submit to this maximum week, and the railway people would not; they would have some other conditions.  I think this will operate harshly on the road users if it is adopted.  If you are to impose definite conditions in regard to road transport such, for instance, as a maximum 44-hour week, it will have a certain reaction on the employees in the road transport service; it will mean that many of them will be put out of work.  Merely to introduce a propagandist phrase largely urged against by Deputy Good by way of innuendo does not carry the argument very much further.  I do not want to tie myself at this stage to a 44-hour week.  There might be some section like Section 167, starting off at a lower level than the possibility of there being an 11-hour day, but still keeping within the regulation which would permit an excessive period to be modified.</P>

It is to meet that angle, but it is a narrow way of taking it, because it is going to impose hardships on people now employed in road transport.  This is the first time that I have found myself able to agree on a philosophy of labour with Deputy Norton.  That philosophy is this: That if this mechanisation is going to improve the conditions of labour it should be passed on.  I thoroughly agree with that view, but I do not go too far.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to Deputy Norton that in proposing this amendment there are, I think, a couple of points on which he has rather failed to touch.  Here in the City of Dublin much shorter hours are worked than in other parts of the country.  I do not see how it would be possible to standardise the very short working week in Dublin with parts of the country where they work very much longer hours.  There is another, and to my mind, a still greater defect in his amendment.  He has allowed nothing for co-ordination.  He has described the driver of a heavy lorry working 44 hours per week and I do not suppose he has forgotten that his amendment covers all employees.  I do not suppose it would be an exaggeration to say that in the delivery of goods by a heavy motor lorry, during the week, at least 25 per cent. of the time is occupied in loading and unloading. That would leave about 33 hours in the week for the driver at the wheel. When you come back to the garage a still greater anomaly exists.  You have the case of a mechanic, or the person who is engaged in washing, or the person who is engaged in loading a <Col N="1778" /> vehicle.  There could be no such thing as asking the driver on account, say, of his trucks being out of order, to work an hour or two overtime, or of asking a mechanic, whichever of them does it, to repair the machine so that it may be in order to go out next day at the appointed hour that has been set out.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose that under this Bill when it has been in force for some time you will find that there would be any surplus of transport in the carrier's business.  He will have to keep as many of his vehicles as possible going on the road to get the greatest possible efficiency out of them.  Is it to be contended that when a motor car that has been out for 7½ or 8 hours a day, comes into the garage there cannot be somebody told off to spend an hour in adjusting the truck or in loading it to have it ready for the next day.  I do not see how Deputy Norton could contend that a person who was engaged in loading motor vehicles in a garage or some other place like that, is a menace to the community, if asked to work an hour or two overtime, one day or possibly two days in the week.  There is nobody better aware than Deputy Norton that in most of the transport companies it is either a feast or a famine.  At times they have a difficulty in carrying out their orders and at other times, there is leisure.  What I really want to point out in his amendment is that there is really no flexibility to provide for keeping the car loaded and in efficient condition.</P>

      <P>I want at this stage to say that I think a very brief examination of this amendment will convince the Dáil that it could not possibly be passed in the form in which it is now on the Order Paper.  I am in full sympathy with the idea of imposing upon owners of merchandise road services, the obligation of giving satisfactory conditions of work and satisfactory wages to their employees. I think most Deputies will agree that when a person gets a licence of that kind that obligation should be imposed upon him.  That obligation was imposed upon those who got <Col N="1779" /> licences under the Road Transport Act, 1932.  It was imposed by a section similar in effect to Section 14 in this Bill, a section which has worked, or is being worked, in a manner to the satisfaction of all concerned.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that people who got licences under that Act were not paying rates of wages that were too low, or imposing conditions of employment which were unsatisfactory.  I am saying that the powers given to the Minister by that Act are being used satisfactorily for the purpose of remedying that position and being used in a manner which has earned the approbation of those whose main concern is to see that conditions and wages are what they should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question raised by Deputy McGilligan, there are some points I should like to deal with before coming to the particular amendment on the Order Paper.  Undoubtedly an increase in mechanisation should be accompanied by increased leisure for the worker, and is being accompanied by increased leisure for the worker, but at the present time it is unpaid leisure.  This is a point I want Deputy Davin to bear in mind, that we can give effect to that policy in relation to road transport in the same way, that is, we can take full advantage of mechanisation, by reducing the employment given.  That will mean increased leisure, but unpaid leisure. My view, which I have expressed strongly elsewhere, is that we should at least take steps to ensure that technological development is not going to outrun social development. If we do not do that, if we allow mechanisation to go ahead unchecked while our social services are lagging far behind, we are going to have very heavy social problems to deal with.  I expressed the view that nine-tenths of the social problems that the world is <Col N="1780" /> facing to-day arise from the fact that technological development has been much more rapid than the development of social organisation.  The International Labour Office summoned a special Convention at the beginning of this year to consider a proposal for the imposition of a 40-hour week in all industry.  That is a proposal well worthy of consideration, although it is obvious that it is a type of proposal that could be only put into operation by international action.  As the world is organised to-day one nation on its own can do very little to give effect to a proposal of that kind; nor can one trade or industry on its own do much to give effect to a proposal of that kind.  If we are going to start reducing hours of work for the purpose of taking advantage of mechanisation and giving increased leisure to workers, we have to do it generally, not in relation to one trade only.  If we have to start somewhere, I say the transport trade is the one we shall probably have to leave to the last, because of the peculiar nature of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Overtime is worked by railway workers.  They have to work overtime because railway organisation would be impossible if workers were not permitted to work overtime when required.  If this amendment is carried, however, they cannot do it.  If this amendment is carried, no railway worker, and no road transport worker, will be able to work in excess of 44 hours.  The amendment asks that the maximum hours of duty worked by persons employed by the holder of any merchandise licence shall not be in <Col N="1781" /> excess of 44 in any one week.  A merchandise licence is going to be held by each railway company and by persons who are also engaged in other forms of trade and industry.  The amendment asks, in respect of all persons employed by the holder of a merchandise licence in any occupation, in any trade, that they are not to be allowed to work in excess of 44 hours per week.  Does Deputy Davin think that efficient railway organisation would be possible on that basis?  If he does not, why does he think efficient road transport organisation is possible on that basis?  Are there to be no conditions whatever under which an employee of a road transport organisation is to be allowed to work overtime?  Must he stop work when he has completed 44 hours, no matter what rush of business, no matter what may be the perishable nature of the produce carried, no matter what the season of the year? I think when you examine the matter it becomes obviously impossible to impose a rigid condition of that type.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of limiting the hours of work reasonably.  I think, on an average, over the 52 weeks of the year, that 44 hours per week is not unduly low.  There are, however, times of the year when persons engaged on road transport must work more than that. There must be some elasticity.  There must be some means of providing that where public services are urgently demanded longer hours of duty can be permitted.  That is why the Bill has been drafted as it is.  I do not know whether everybody will say that on the average 44 hours per week is unreasonable in relation to the road transport business.  The trade unions are satisfied to impose 48 hours per week in respect of the omnibus business.</P>

The public service would require that it must be broken and then you would have the whole section rendered inoperative by frequent abuse.

      <P>When objection was taken to the renewal of any licence on the ground that the first condition of the licence, that reasonable wages and reasonable conditions of employment should be observed, was being broken. This Bill, when passed, will be operated in precisely the same manner. I am certain that the unions responsible for safeguarding the interest of the transport workers will be in continuous touch with my Department when they have an objection to make against any licensee upon the ground of the wages paid by him or the hours which his employees have to work, and that in conjunction with them it will be possible to secure a general improvement, where improvement is required.  I am not denying that improvement is required.  The main argument in favour of control of this kind is that <Col N="1783" /> certain persons operating road transport services are paying such very low wages and working their employees such long hours that they are able to quote rates for the transportation of merchandise with which the railway companies and properly-run transport services could not possibly compete.</P>

      <P>It is undoubtedly necessary that, in respect of a number of services for which licences will be issued, there should be a considerable improvement, if the aim behind the Bill is to be achieved.  I repeat that the most effective machinery for achieving what the Deputies desire to achieve is that proposed in the Bill, and not that proposed in the amendment.  The amendment would operate harshly; it would operate to make it impossible for various road transport businesses to be carried on, and, as worded, would operate to make it much more difficult for the railways to be carried on.  I want Deputies to consider also its effect upon employment. If we are to have a new condition imposed upon road transport operators, involving increased working costs, then undoubtedly there is going to be a diminution in the number of those services, and people are going to be unemployed in consequence.  We are going to get a diminution in a number of those services in any case, and people are going to be unemployed in consequence of this diminution, but we hope that they will&mdash;in some part at any rate &mdash;be compensated for the loss of their employment, and, as far as the rest of them are concerned, gradually transferred out of this particular branch of trade where they are not required&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All sections.  I am grouping all sections in one&mdash;road, rail, canal, and everything else.  I submit to the Dáil that it is desirable that machinery should exist to ensure that satisfactory working conditions and satisfactory rates of wages will operate in licensed road services.  I submit that the machinery contemplated in the Bill is the most satisfactory to that end, and that the machinery contemplated in the amendment instead of achieving that end might well work in the opposite direction, and would certainly impose difficulties in the way of efficient transport organisation which would in many cases make it impossible for services to be carried on.  I refer particularly to services likely to be engaged in the carriage of seasonal traffic, where at particular times of the year overtime would certainly have to be worked if the traffic was to be carried at all. We might contemplate an average number of working hours per week, but we cannot say that in every week, no matter what the circumstances or conditions, only a certain number of hours must be worked.  I can assure the Deputy that in the carrying out of the powers proposed to be conferred upon the Minister under this Bill I will work, as I did in relation to the Road Transport Bill of 1922, in close co-operation with the transport unions concerned, and there is more than one union concerned, as Deputies know.</P>

      <P>I would like to develop my argument.  I feel that there are no grounds for the fears of Deputy Dockrell, which, as I have suggested, are apparently shared by the Minister. I have just said that the trade unions make arrangements&mdash;by rules, negotiation and so on&mdash;for the working of overtime, and, as I said, even the railwaymen's union arranges for the working of overtime.  The Minister apparently agrees to the principle of <Col N="1786" /> the amendment, though not to the number of hours suggested in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

The amendment suggests &ldquo;the maximum hours of duty worked by persons employed.&rdquo;  How would the Minister receive this amendment, slightly altered by the insertion of a few words such as &ldquo;the maximum hours of duty, exclusive of necessary overtime, worked by persons&rdquo;? That, I think, would get rid of the fear, which Deputy Dockrell has and the Minister appears to have, that the driver on arriving back at his home station would be precluded from spending an extra hour or two looking after his lorry.  If the Minister and Deputy Norton would be prepared to accept the suggestion I make now to insert the words &ldquo;exclusive of necessary overtime&rdquo; it would very largely get rid of the main objections, as far as I can gather, raised by the Minister and also by Deputy Dockrell.  I would like to hear what Deputy Norton has to say in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House will agree that when we are dealing with the question of working hours it is essential that we should have uniformity.  I do not think there is any doubt on that point.  We were discussing in this House within the last week a Bill&mdash;closely allied to the Transport Bill&mdash;known as the Traffic Bill.  It is hardly necessary to remind the Labour Deputies of Clause 167 in the Traffic Bill.  Clause 167 provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Each of the following periods or series of periods of driving shall be deemed to be an excessive period for the purposes of this section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1787" /> (a)  any continuous period of driving exceeding five and one-half hours;</P>
    <P>(b)  any series of continuous periods of driving amounting in the aggregate to more than 11 hours in any period of 24 hours beginning two hours after midnight;</P>
    <P>(c)  any period or series of periods of driving so arranged that the driver has not at least ten consecutive hours for rest in every period of 24 hours beginning at the commencement of any period of driving.</P>
    <P>That is a provision in the Road Traffic Bill.  I may say that in most transport companies the driver is called upon to discharge two services: bus and lorry driving.  On the day that he is bus driving, is he to be subject to different hours and different conditions to the day on which he is lorry driving?  On the face of it the thing is absurd.  I hope there is sanity enough left in this House to recognise that uniformity is essential in industry.  In connection with the regulations that apply to buses, may I say at this stage that even these are not entirely acceptable to the trades concerned.  I have been asked to bring before the House the complaint that they impose hardships on employees. Men have pointed out to me that when they leave for certain areas in the morning, if they are compelled to comply with the regulations, it means they cannot get back to their homes that night.  They ask that the regulations might be relaxed so that they could get home.  I ask the representatives of labour to bear these facts in mind.  They often legislate here without regard for the comfort or convenience of those for whom they legislate. I suggest that, in many cases, it would be advisable for those representing labour to discuss with the departments of labour concerned the problems they have under consideration. In that connection I would urge on the labour representatives to get into touch with the individuals who will be concerned with these regulations.  I suggest to them, if they do that, they <Col N="1788" /> will find that the number of supporters of the views I am stating is not by any means small.</P>
    <P>When we get talking in this country of wages and hours I am afraid we often forget the circumstances of the country.  It is not by any means a rich country.  On all sides one hears it called a poor country, but that is by the way.  Agriculture is our basic industry.  Seventy-five per cent. of what is carried on our railways and roads is agricultural produce.  Taking the workers of the country as a whole 75 per cent. of them derive their livelihood from agriculture.  What are the circumstances surrounding that industry at the moment, particularly our surplus agricultural produce which has to be transported and sold in the most competitive market in the world?  It has to compete in that market against agricultural produce from all over the world.  If we are to hold our own there, then our costs of agricultural production&mdash;transport is an important factor&mdash;cannot be higher than those of our competitors. We seldom hear these circumstances mentioned when we discuss here hours of work and the wages of labour which constitute about 75 per cent. of the cost of transport.</P>
    <P>Can agriculture at the moment afford what may be called high prices for transport?  Those who are urging higher prices and shorter hours of labour and so on here ought to be able to put before us what are the hours worked and the wages paid to those engaged in transport services in the countries in competition with us in the British market.  That is an important factor.  All of us would like to see labour well paid and enjoying shorter hours, provided the country could afford it.  I would like to hear from those engaged in our basic industry whether it can afford to carry additional burdens in the way of higher costs of transport.  If I can get an assurance on that point I am quite willing to support a system of shorter hours and higher wages provided the industry can afford it, but I must be satisfied on that before I agree to such a proposition.</P>

He has, of course, made that quite clear in the Bill before us by making provision in one section for the payment of compensation to those who, he believes, will become redundant as a result of the operation of this measure.  His predecessor, Deputy McGilligan, also rightly said that there were many people engaged in the road service plying for profit-making purposes and carrying on on uneconomic rates. That undoubtedly has been the whole cause of the trouble which has led up to the necessity for the introduction of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes to licence some of those already engaged in the business, to licence all existing carriers, to control some of those who will, under the terms of this Bill, carry on industry in the future, and to leave others in certain exempted areas without any form of control of any kind.  If the Legislature, by a measure of this kind, seeks to impose certain conditions upon those who will in the future be engaged in this industry, and as the result of the operation of a measure of this kind throw people out of employment, I think that steps should also be taken to see that those who will get licences and who will carry on the industry in the future will be subject also to some form of control in so far as concerns the controlling of the conditions of service of the people employed in the industry.  If the people who came into the road transport service during the past five years were subject to the same conditions and were obliged by law, as the railway companies are obliged, to carry on their business on business-like lines and subject to parliamentary restrictions, there would not be the number of people in the carrying business operating on the roads of this country to-day that we have to face and recognise at the present time.  People have been carrying on in that industry for years past without any regard whatever to business-like methods. They can refuse to take traffic, or they can take what traffic they like, and <Col N="1790" /> they can carry at whatever rates it pleases them to carry.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan admitted that they have been carrying on at uneconomic rates.  If they were obliged to employ labour under proper conditions and to pay rates of wages something similar to what the railways were obliged to pay, you would not have these people quoting the uneconomic rates to which Deputy McGilligan referred and which have led to the semi-bankrupt conditions of the railway industry.  I was surprised to hear the Minister suggest that the road transport section of the industry should be the last industry which should be obliged to standardise the conditions of the people engaged in it.  That is what he suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is what I understood, and perhaps in a later speech he will explain what he did mean actually.  The Minister is well aware that in legislation passed by this House during the lifetime of the last Dáil, sections were inserted in the Housing Act making the provision for the payment of trades union rates of wages and trades union working hours for the skilled and unskilled workers in the building industry.  When the Minister voted for and accepted the amendment moved by Deputy Norton to the Housing Act he knew that the workers in the building industry were well organised and that it was in the power of the workers and those who represented them through their unions to see that the conditions then existing were maintained.  He is also aware that a similar amendment was inserted in another Act which made similar provision.  In that also the Minister knew that the workers then engaged were well organised and that the trade unions who had a right to speak for these workers were in a position to maintain the rates of wages and working hours then operating.  He knows that the workers in this case employed by the traffic companies, operating for years past without any control, licence or restriction of any kind, are not so well organised as the workers in the <Col N="1791" /> industries to which I have referred.  I think it is necessary, therefore, that the Minister should indicate quite clearly to the House before this discussion concludes what should be the maximum number of hours necessarily and normally worked at the standard rate of wages fixed for the workers in the industry.  In other words, will the Minister say that 44 hours a week should be regarded as the number of hours to be worked other than what might be necessary to be worked at overtime rates?  Deputy Anthony has suggested a form of words that would make it clearer, I think, than it is in the amendment.  The amendment is put down for a deliberate purpose, and that is to get this House to say whether 44 hours a week is a reasonable number other than the hours necessary for overtime.  I admit that it would be necessary to have overtime worked so far as the carrying companies are concerned here.  I know quite well that circumstances could arise in connection with the operation of a lorry or a bus, say, as the result of an accident, which might mean the detention of that bus or lorry in case of an emergency.  I would not suggest, nor is Deputy Norton suggesting in this amendment, nor would anybody else suggest, that a man should leave his bus or lorry on the roadside in a case like that where an accident occurred.  That is a necessary case.  We know of similar cases with engine drivers.  Does the Minister know that there are men working in connection with the Drumm Battery at Inchicore, who, I am told, work up to 100 hours per week while many other men have been thrown out of work while that kind of thing is tolerated, if not with the Minister's knowledge and consent, at least by his own Department?  If the Minister is not aware of this, will he call for a return of the number of hours worked since work was started on the Drumm Battery at Inchicore and find out how many workers there are working in excess of the stipulated number of hours and earning overtime which they should not be earning if men were taken in and compelled to work the normal number of hours?</P>

      <P>Deputy Good believes in fair competition within a particular industry. Does he believe in fair competition between those engaged in the building trade?  Of course, he does.  He joined the Master Builders' Association in order to endeavour to standardise conditions for the employers, and to use the Association to impose the same conditions on employees engaged in the industry.  If he believes in that let him apply the same principle to those engaged in the carrying trade.</P>

If the Minister will indicate his view with regard to that aspect of the amendment, and it is the kernel of the question, we would then be in a better position to see if suitable words could be found to get over the difficulty to which he referred in his last speech.</P>

      <P>My position is that we have in operation in relation to omnibus services a 48-hour week which was forced by trade union action.  There is not, as the Deputy stated, the same degree of organisation in the road merchandise carrying business.  The first step must be to get the element of organisation introduced, and when that element is introduced, a gradual improvement in conditions can be achieved.  It is being achieved in the passenger <Col N="1794" /> carrying business at present.  By the same methods it can be achieved in the road merchandise carrying business. It is because I think it is the most effective method to achieve that degree of organisation and gradual improvement, as suggested in the Bill, and not as suggested in the amendment that I am opposing the amendment.

Naturally enough not feeling too easy about the position he tried in his second speech to wrap the whole thing up in a maze of words.  The Minister's objection to Deputy Norton's amendment in the original speech was that it was too rigid, that there was no flexibility in it, that overtime could not be worked, that at particular seasons of the year, no matter how perishable the nature of the goods, the 44-hour week should operate and hang the consequences.</P>

In that connection, may I say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce bears no relation whatever to Deputy Lemass when on the Front Bench in Opposition for five years. The speech of the Minister for Industry <Col N="1796" /> and Commerce this afternoon was the very type of speech he was denouncing for five years when he was in Opposition. Every word he uttered against the amendment was the same as that with which he denounced, not only in this House but throughout the country for five years, this measure and practically every other measure that came on here.  When he changed from one side of the House to the other the Minister changed his mind and changed himself inside out.

      <P>Deputy Good treated us to one of his usual speeches, the type of speech to which we have been listening for over ten years.  He said he would have voted for shorter hours and higher wages if anybody could prove to him that at present the agricultural industry could afford it. Deputy Good knows as well as anybody in the House that at the present moment agriculture can afford nothing at all.  Therefore, he was quite safe in saying that he would vote for shorter hours and higher wages if the agricultural industry could afford it.  Deputy Good told us that a man employed in the transport industry came to him and objected very strongly to Section 167 of the Road Traffic Act, and said that it was not a question of the hours being too short, but of the distances fixed by the employers being too long.  I would suggest to Deputy Good if he is so keenly interested in getting drivers and others engaged on buses and lorries back to their homes at night that he should suggest to the employers that they should send their drivers on shorter journeys, that instead of sending them 50 or 60 miles they should only be sent 30 or 40.</P>

      <P>For the last week we have had the most amazing agreement with the Fianna Fáil outlook on wages and hours disclosed by Deputy Good. Last week, even against the advice of Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Good went into the Lobby to vote with the Fianna Fáil Party for one section of the Road Traffic Bill which would make it possible for a person to be employed for 77 hours a week.  The Deputy is going to be in the same Lobby with the Fianna Fáil Deputies again to-night.  I do not know whether I should congratulate Deputy Good on winning over the Fianna Fáil Party to his side, or whether I should congratulate the Minister for having made a convert of Deputy Good.</P>

If the Minister's sympathy could solve any economic or social problem, there would not be an economic or social problem left in the country.  The Minister can pour out sympathy in the way that the Niagara Falls shoot out water.  He is always in sympathy with this and that, but thinks that there is some other way of doing it, some other way of showing his particular brand of sympathy, the sympathy shown by the Minister yesterday evening on the question of exempted areas and this evening on the question of hours.  This sympathy, so far as I can judge, never takes any concrete form.  The Minister is prepared <Col N="1799" /> to say he is in sympathy with this amendment and he talked quite enthusiastically about the idea of regulating hours of work generally. Of course everybody will agree with that.  Even I think Deputy Good's teacher in Italy suggested recently an international conference for the purpose of fixing the maximum working week at 40 hours.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Good that I have no teacher in Russia. I am quite prepared to take an Irish teacher.  Deputy Good finds his teachers in every part of the world except here.  The Minister talks about the general introduction of a short working week.  He said that we must do this and that, that mechanisation will render this and that inevitable. The Minister has been Minister for over 12 months.  I could understand that speech if he were on the opposite benches or even on these benches, but he is Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister should be able to tell us what his own proposals are in the matter of reducing working hours instead of coming along and saying in a most vague and general way: &ldquo;We must do this and we will have to do that.  We will be inevitably compelled to consider so-and-so.&rdquo; I wonder the Minister was not a bit more precise and that he did not say exactly what he had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall make an offer to the Minister. I shall withdraw the amendment if he is prepared to tell the House that he has any legislative proposals for introducing a general 44-hour week.  But the Minister has no such intention.  He created a whole forest of words about what was desirable in the matter of hours, but when we came to find where the Minister really stood in the matter of hours, we found the maximum distance he was prepared to go is indicated in the Bill, which means that any Minister, the present Minister or any other Minister, can come along in future and say: &ldquo;In my opinion <Col N="1800" /> so-and-so are fair and reasonable conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We had an example not many years ago of a fair wages clause in a certain Act passed by the Dail.  Deputy McGilligan will no doubt remember the Shannon Scheme.  We had Deputy McGilligan as the Minister for Industry and Commerce taking the view that the rate of wages then paid on the Shannon Scheme complied with the fair wages clause.  We shall have the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, perhaps, taking a similar view.  One can have no guarantee whatever that the speeches of a Deputy in Opposition are necessarily a guide to his conduct as Minister.  We have too many examples to the contrary in the past 12 months to make me believe that the speeches of a Deputy made when in Opposition are necessarily a guide to his Ministerial conduct as a member of a Government. It is only control in the matter of hours that the Minister is seeking, but certainly I am not prepared, no matter what kind of individual the Minister may be personally, to leave it to the Minister to say: &ldquo;It depends on my sweet will what kind of conditions are going to be imposed or what kind of wages are going to be paid in this or that industry as a condition of a Government licence.&rdquo;  The Minister played for quite a long time with the idea that an amendment in this particular form was impracticable.  Of course when the amendment was submitted everybody knew that an objection in the matter of overtime could be raised.  It was raised.  It did not need any particular foresight to see that it could be raised.  Of course we knew that, and if the Minister was prepared to say that he accepted the principle of a 44-hour week, we were willing to meet the Minister to the extent of saying that if it is necessary to work overtime in emergencies or in case of special exigencies, outside the 44 hours, we were prepared to agree to a clause being inserted in that form that, if necessary, overtime might be worked, provided that overtime were paid for.  We make that offer now to the Minister.  The Minister tried to demolish the case for the <Col N="1801" /> amendment by saying it made no provision for overtime.  Overtime will cover any contingency referred to by the Minister in his speech.  If we are prepared to agree to the necessary overtime being worked and paid for, there is no case for the amendment except that the Minister does not like to have a 44-hour week enshrined in legislation.  The Minister says that the Transport Act of 1932 had a section which enabled the Minister to supervise the wages and conditions of bus companies which would receive licences under that Act.  The Minister is, apparently, quite satisfied with what has been done in that connection.  Let me tell the Minister that I am far from being satisfied.  Let me tell the Minister that the transport unions are far from being satisfied.  If the Minister has any doubts as to the adequacy of the rates of wages paid, I suggest that he should look up this month's issue of the &ldquo;Irish Trade Journal&rdquo; published by his own Department. Let him examine the table published there.  Let him see the average or individual rates of wages paid to the employees of these bus companies.  If the Minister finds satisfaction in the rates of wages paid to these employees, I suggest that he is not very difficult to satisfy.</P>

      <P>The Minister personally may be the most ideal person to do that, but the Minister has no passport to a long life.  The Minister may not be Minister for very long, and the conditions in the transport industry are to be determined by the particular outlook of a particular Minister at a particular time.  I am thoroughly dissatisfied with that.  I brought to the notice of the Minister on several occasions the fact that notwithstanding the provisions of the Transport Act of 1932, and the very explicit assurance given me in this House, licences were, in fact, issued to people who were paying rates of wages which were an absolute disgrace.  When I pursued the matter further, I was told that certain licences had been issued to those people, but I could find nobody to justify the rates of wages paid, or the hours of work.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows perfectly well the incident to which I refer.  It is possible for similar incidents to arise under the Minister's proposal in the Bill.  It is to prevent their arising and to prevent the interpretation the conditions then got that I am putting forward this amendment. I hope that Deputies who stand for reasonable hours of work, whether they are in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or in the Fianna Fáil Party, will insist on an amendment of this kind being included in the Bill.  It was suggested that if you shorten the hours of work, it may mean unemployment for the operatives.  That kind of argument has been used for years and years.  That is not what is causing unemployment or want of work. Everybody who takes any interest whatever in the problem of unemployment or other social problems knows perfectly well that it is not the present hours of work that are causing unemployment.  Issues far greater and far deeper than that are causing unemployment.  One of the biggest contributory causes is the mechanisation of industry generally.  Here, you have the mechanisation of road transport <Col N="1804" /> and we suggest that the operatives in that industry should get some benefit from that mechanisation.  If the Minister is prepared to give them that benefit, we shall withdraw this amendment, but the Minister wants this amendment defeated and conditions in the transport industry left to his own sweet will, no proposals being placed before the House, or indicated as to what he proposes to do generally in regard to the problem which has arisen as a result of the general mechanisation of industry.  When the hours of work were 84 per week, it was urged that if they were reduced to 60, it would mean the end of industry. When the Shaftesbury Acts were passed, Deputy Good's industrial ancestors said: &ldquo;This is the end of British industry.&rdquo;  Some of Deputy Good's former friends&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The whole trend of development in the matter of hours has served completely to contradict the case made by Deputy Good and supported by Deputy Dockrell&mdash;another convert to the Minister's view.  It also contradicts the case made by the Minister himself.  The Minister did not attempt to show in what way the reduction of hours would mean unemployment. The real position is that the Minister does not want a 44-hour week enshrined in legislation.  That is the kernel of this Bill.  Everybody who votes against this amendment is voting against enshrining a reasonable working week of 44 hours in legislation, being content to allow working hours <Col N="1805" /> to be determined by the sweet will of a single Minister.  I suggest to Deputies who believe in reasonable hours of work that it is not unreasonable to require in the transport industry a maximum working week of 44 hours in the interests of the operatives and in the interests of the general public.  I hope the House will endorse the principle of the 44-hour week, which can be altered, if need be, by the insertion of a section which will not make it impossible for persons to be required to perform necessary overtime at extra pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to urge Deputy Norton not to test the House on this amendment in its present form because he does not give the principle for which he is appealing a fair chance on it.  I think the Minister dealt unfairly with this amendment by spending so much of the time he did take to answer on two points more or less against the form in which the Bill is cast.  It is quite true to say that if the amendment is carried in its present form it will forbid overtime except under a fine of £5 on each occasion.  It is not fair to say, as the Minister did say, that the amendment has another flaw in it in that it applies to everybody employed by the holder of a merchandise licence whether employed for the purpose of the merchandise licence or not.  That is not in the amendment because, although it might appear to be in the first clause of it, the second clause, which is the penalising clause, says:</P>
      <P>..............any person employed by him or subject to his orders in the operation of his business of merchandise road transport...</P>
      <P>and the meaning of that is clear.  The Minister might have given a little more time to explaining what is his scheme as an alternative to Deputy Norton's. He did not give it, but there is a scheme.  I agree with the remark passed by Deputy Good that it is somewhat unreal to be discussing an amendment about limiting hours in what I have got to call a sheltered business like the transport business.</P>

Deputy Good drew our attention to the agricultural industry and everybody knows the depression that is in that industry at the moment.  The only thing that makes me speak on this at all with any feeling of reality is that I do not consider the present depression on agriculture is going to last, or that the present folly which has brought on that depression is going to continue, even with the help of the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not world folly that is hitting us so hard.  I was amazed by the calculations I made from answers given in the House last week &mdash;I am not alluding to this for the purposes of stirring up any Party strife&mdash;but we have the comments of the Labour Party made so vehemently as to rates of wages on particular schemes and we are told that they bear a close relation to agricultural wages as paid.  I have seen answers given here which stated that a six-hour day week at 21/- was being paid.  In certain other counties, the rate increased to 24/- and the hours went down from 60 to something lower&mdash;I do not think they ever went as low as 48&mdash;but supposing it was a 24/- wage, which is supposed to be analogous to the agricultural wage, for a 48-hour week, and I do not think you would get a 48-hour week specially limited anywhere, but, supposing you had, it represents 6d. an hour, and supposing you are thinking in terms of a 21/- wage and a six-hour day, you are more closely approaching the 4d. an hour rate and with that prevailing to the extent that the wages on schemes passed by this House are at that standard, it is considered right to talk about closing down the hours of <Col N="1807" /> transport to 44 hours per week and the overriding maximum being 44 hours. Of course, the thing is ridiculous, if we think of it in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>The only way to approach this with any reality is to consider that these are temporary circumstances which we hope will soon pass, but they are there at the moment and we are going, apparently, to build this very sheltered business on that depressed industry, which is the main industry of the country still, notwithstanding all the efforts made to dislodge it.  While that depression lasts, or even if it were over, I believe, and I state this distinctly, that if I had to make a choice between this amendment, even with an enlargement to permit of overtime, and the scheme in the Bill, I would prefer the scheme in the measure as it stands, plus Section 167 of the Traffic Bill, although I object to Section 167 of the Traffic Bill, and would like to see the maximum in it brought down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Davin understands Section 167, I do not think he will worry much about whether it is 48 or 54, because, so long as subsection 8 is in Section 167 of the other measure, these periods of work which are deemed to be excessive can be enlarged by Departmental order or Departmental legislation.  It does not matter a whole lot except that I think it is a sort of guiding line to the people who are concerned in the fixing of these hours afterwards.  Let the Labour Party consider the situation as it is under the Bill.  The Minister takes power in Section 14 to establish conditions and these conditions are applied to the wages and conditions of the employment.  That is the first drive and that is the first security, if you like to call it so.  The second thing is the overriding Section 167 of the Traffic Act, which says that hours in excess of a certain number are to be deemed to be excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it has, distinctly.  It is the only thing in the end which prevents the Minister from imposing completely unreasonable conditions on a licence.  The Minister is absolutely free, so far as the reasonable terms and conditions he can impose on a bus or lorry type of licence are concerned, if it was not for Section 167.  It is there, however, and I think the best way to meet this whole position would be to make another attempt on Section 167 on the Report Stage of the Road Traffic Bill and leave Section 14 as it is here.  I wonder does Deputy Norton soberly suggest to this House that that allowance for overtime in the transport business as it is at the moment&mdash; nobody having very much in the way of accurate data on which to found any good opinion as to what is the optimum point in respect of hours or wages in the business&mdash;should be abandoned and that we should take the position that normally nothing more than a 44-hour week should be worked?  I think it would be very injudicious to take that position here and now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputy Norton has got a very good expression of opinion from the House.  If he was definitely convinced that this was a reasonable suggestion, he should go ahead with it and should go fully out for it, but, at the moment, I think that he has got a pretty good expression of opinion from every side of the House with regard to what they would like to see done in the way of reasonable conditions of employment, hours of work and so on, and I suggest that, in this transitional period, it is best to leave the thing as it is with the Minister being empowered to impose conditions about the hours which people will work.  He knows very well that there is considerable force in the trade unions, who are very definitely organised in the transport business, to put pressure on the <Col N="1809" /> Minister if they think he is not putting what they consider to be reasonable conditions on the licence, and he has this House in which to ventilate his grievance if he thinks that these conditions are being attacked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the trade unions have faced that type of situation before and have not been defeated, and I do not think they are unorganised so far as transport is concerned.  If we had to consider transport more or less as a type of industry to which the Trade Board Acts would be applied, because the workers were unorganised, there would be room for that contention; but I cannot conceive the unions so weak in the transport business&mdash;why, they have almost ruined the transport business by their strength.</P>

      <P>Not on the roads, but otherwise.  I cannot conceive of them being so weak as to allow the position to be as the Deputy has put it in an intervention.  I suggest that the scheme in the Bill, even though I think there are defects in Section 167, is much better than asking the House to vote for a 44 hours week, even with the overtime allowed, in respect of transport.  I hope the Deputy will not press this proposal, because it will be thoroughly beaten, and the mere fact of it being defeated in the decisive fashion in which it will be defeated will not give a proper expression abroad of the views of Deputies on wages and conditions in the transport industry. There will be many expressions of opinion here to-night that will not be at all revealed by the mere vote cast on this proposal.  The proposal for a 44 hours week will be decisively beaten and it will set back the views the Deputy has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has been at very considerable pains to try to draw an analogy between Section 167 of the Road Traffic Act and this <Col N="1810" /> amendment.  I think there is very little analogy between them because in Section 167 there is specified the absolute limit that will be permitted under any circumstances, and this is regarded more or less as a safeguard to protect people from being run down by drivers who are worn out through being continuously behind the wheel. In our opinion a 44 hours week ought to be established as the normal working week in the industry which is sought to be regulated by this measure. As has been mentioned by Deputy Davin, this is an industry which has been carrying on in contrast with an old-established industry such as the railway where definite hours have been worked for a considerable time.  The establishment of a 44 hours week in relation to road services as against a 48 hours week on the railways could not be regarded as an undue handicap, even from the economic standpoint. There are different considerations involved.  From the point of view of the safety of the public the railways have safeguards in the way of signalmen and so on, and it is essential in the case of the road services to introduce as many safeguards as possible in the interests of the travelling public.  Unfortunately, there has been a great toll of life on the highways. An attempt is now being made to get rid of the existing chaos, and I think we should see to it that the drivers of these heavy lorries and buses should be facilitated from the point of view of not working them for unduly long hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan has been floundering between a 44 hours week and a 66 hours week, or possibly a 77 hours week, as in Section 167.  The Deputy ought to stand for some definite period. We would like to know if the Minister has made up his mind as to what should be the normal working week of a man in control of a bus or lorry.  The question of overtime is another consideration. Deputy Dockrell has envisaged certain circumstances in that respect, such as the overhauling of a bus in a garage.  There ought to be a definite standard set down as regards the working hours of operatives engaged in this industry.  Only too <Col N="1811" /> well do we know that the people who have been carrying on this service have had no regard whatever to working hours.  We are told, on the one hand, that there are certain people who are owner drivers but, on the other hand, we know that there are men who are not owner drivers who have been working under almost impossible conditions.</P>
    <P>It ought not to be very difficult to meet this proposal of a 44 hours week.  I think the Minister on another occasion was more or less inclined to accept the principle enunciated here.  I believe a 44 hours working week is reasonable, with facilities for additional hours when the occasion demands it at rates to be agreed upon between the employers and the union.  I hope this matter will be satisfactorily arranged irrespective of Party interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my point of view quite clear.  I do not think the demand for a 44 hours week is unreasonable&mdash;quite the contrary. The question I am putting forward is whether the most effective means of reaching that position is as suggested by Deputy Norton or as is suggested in the Bill.  I prefer the proposal contained in the Bill.  We do not know what the general conditions are.  I propose that the procedure that we followed in relation to road passenger transport should be followed in this instance. First of all, we found out the position and we got ultimately on paper the names of everybody in the trade, together with information as to the conditions which prevailed in the services operated by them.  We were able to draw a line which represented what was the average practice and we wiped out all beneath that line.  We then got to the position that operates more or less now where, in respect of other services, there is an agreement between the unions and the employers.  That is a satisfactory position to have got to, having regard to the circumstances that operated previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circumstances in this trade at <Col N="1812" /> the moment are in many instances very unsatisfactory.  I think the best machinery is the machinery we have operated with considerable success in relation to the passenger service.  We can then get to the point to which the Deputy wants to get, in a manner which is not going to involve any serious reactions.  I think we will have, in relation to all forms of transport, a 44 hours week generally recognised before long.  We may get the number of hours per week down below that point at a later stage, but at the moment we cannot say it is possible for us to impose a 44 hours week on this particular branch of this industry.  If there is a genuine desire to get to that point in a manner which will do the least amount of damage and which is likely to be most effective, I submit the proposal in the Bill is preferable to that contained in the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that in administering the 1932 Act they made inquiries as to the conditions operating, presumably before they issued the licences.</P>

      <P>I was invited by a certain gentleman associated with the business to come into the open and repeat a statement that I made in this House.  I made a statement outside this House that a certain firm that got a licence in 1932 had been paying the miserable rate of 17/6 a week to their conductors.  At that time I was threatened by this firm with a libel action, a libel action which never came off.  I made inquiries as to why that firm got a licence and I was in a position to tell the Minister that no inquiry was sent to the owner of these buses previous to his granting the licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>To prove that I am right, I have only to say that an assurance was given to Deputy Norton <Col N="1813" /> by the President, and the House was also informed of it.  The President had to admit, at a later stage, that the undertaking was not carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure adopted is well known.  As from the 25th July last year we gave licences, these licences to be operative for only three months.  At that time we publicly invited, through the Press, anybody who objected to these licences being granted on the ground that conditions of pay or hours of work did not comply with the regulations.  We got numbers of objections.  The principal objections came from trade unions for the most part.  In several cases a satisfactory agreement was concluded between the union and the employers, and these agreements still operate, with the exception of one case where negotiations for agreement are on at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And I repeat that the form upon which the application for a licence was made required the applicant to set out the conditions&mdash;hours of work and rates of pay.  If the applicant did not fill in these columns in the forms he did not get the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
