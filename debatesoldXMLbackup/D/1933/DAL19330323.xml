      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether, relative to the recent appointment by the Galway Board of Health and Dispensaries Committee of a Clerk of Works in connection with the clearing of a site at Central Hospital, Galway, he is now in a position to state (1) if the position was advertised; (2) what were the terms of the appointment and the qualifications of the person appointed and (3) if application for sanction of the appointment has been made to his Department by the Board of Health, and, if so, whether sanction has been given.</P>

      <P>(1) The position being a temporary one was not advertised; (2) the remuneration is four guineas per week; the person appointed is a Bachelor of Engineering of the National University.; (3) application for sanction was received in my Department, and the matter is being dealt with in the ordinary course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not think that this position should have been advertised?

I should like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary is sanctioning this appointment.</P>

      <P>There is no apparent reason why sanction should not issue <Col N="1210" /> in this case.  The estimated cost of the operation is £1,200, and under the Summary of Regulations in General Order, dated 18th December, 1882, it is laid down in Article 28 that the condition of advertising does not apply to the appointment of any person who may, subject to the Minister's approval, be employed temporarily.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the Road Transport Bill is a Bill of very great importance to a number of commercial bodies outside, and that a number of them are still considering the matter and have, in fact, prepared some amendments which they think they would like to put forward and have discussed here?

    <P>2. In sub-section (2), line 41, after the word &ldquo;vehicles&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;Provided that conspicuous notices shall be erected on the approaches to such areas stating clearly the restriction&rdquo;.&mdash;(Deputy Haslett.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I should like to add to what has been said in favour of having notices prominently displayed about the weights of vehicles which can go over certain roads and bridges.  I hope this idea that information need not be circulated to the public is not going to extend, because it would be a most unfortunate matter for our tourist traffic if, in various publications, tourists were advised that there were special regulations of which notices were not displayed, and that they would have to make themselves aware of them either by reading the public Press or consulting certain documents. I feel that this is an aspect of this matter which has not been brought to the Minister's notice and, therefore, I would like to impress upon him the desirability of accepting Deputy Haslett's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Deputy has had his attention called to Sections 155 and 156, which prescribe that in cases such as those mentioned here last night notices must be put up by local authorities.  This particular section&mdash;Section 16&mdash;deals particularly with the county boroughs, and it is proposed to leave the law as it is.  It is not proposed to alter it in any way.  In so far as this law has been in existence no case has arisen where anybody has brought to the attention of the Government or the Department concerned any disability or any inconvenience arising out of the absence of any notices.  The weight of vehicles is restricted, and if they are above the weight registration would be refused to them.  At any rate, in practice, so far as the Department concerned is aware, no case has arisen in the last eight years where any owner of a heavy vehicle raised any point to the Department that a difficulty had arisen owing to the restrictions imposed on heavy vehicles. In view of that the law has been left as it is.  We do not propose to alter it, and do not think there is any necessity for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it this amendment is purely designed for the purpose of ensuring that conspicuous notices are to be erected.  Did I understand the Minister to say that no transport company had admitted that they were using vehicles of a weight greater than that permitted over certain bridges in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This, as I say, relates to the county borough, and vehicles of a weight beyond what is allowed would not be registered.  Every vehicle which is in use is a registered vehicle or a licensed vehicle, and they would not be licensed or registered if they were above the weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>Might there not be a case where a vehicle would go out of its ordinary route and come into a borough such as this?  Whilst I can see the Minister's point of view, would it not make assurance doubly sure if the driver knew of the existence of the regulations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say with regard to that is that for eight years the law has been as it is now.  Not one solitary case has been brought to the notice of the Department by anybody; not one solitary case has been brought to the notice of the police by any individual or user of the road or any vehicle owner that any inconvenience has been suffered by the local authorities or anybody else.  We cannot discover that any case has been mentioned and the law has been as it is for the last eight years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a sub-section, sub-section (4), which was not in the original Bill.  I want to call attention to the reading of it: &ldquo;Whenever a member of the Gárda Síochána observes a vehicle which he suspects of being then used in such manner as to constitute an offence.&rdquo;  I thought there was a method of expressing that idea so that the Guard would have to justify his suspicions.  I thought there was a phrase about &ldquo;reasonably suspects&rdquo; or &ldquo;has reason to suspect.&rdquo; In this case the Guard will not be required to give any reason whatsoever for his suspicions.  We all know that in a force numbering thousands of men and where they are so much in contact with the public that it is inevitable that there will be personal differences from time to time between members of the Gárda Síochána and members of the public.  A member of the Gárda Síochána might take advantage of this to get his own back in respect of some little quarrel or another.  I suggest it should not be left as it is at present and that the Guard, without giving any reason whatever for his suspicions either to a superior officer or anyone else, should not be entitled to say he suspects an offence has been committed, and thereupon order a vehicle owner to submit himself to considerable trouble as is described in that sub-section.</P>

      <P>I move amendments 3, 4 and 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 49, to delete the word &ldquo;employ&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;engage&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 49, to insert after the word &ldquo;employ&rdquo; the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 54, to delete the word &ldquo;employs&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;engages&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of my amendments is to take off the employer the onus of seeing that on a proper date the licence is renewed.  I think it is quite right that if a person engages a driver he should satisfy himself that the person is entitled to drive and has got a proper licence.  I do not think it is reasonable to expect the employer to be the person who is responsible for seeing that a proper date is observed, and that when the licence falls out of date it should be renewed.  I think in this case the driver should be the person responsible and the driver only. I am not quite sure that the word I suggested will meet the object, but I put it down in order to have the matter discussed.  I suggest that the word &ldquo;engage&rdquo; should be used instead of the word &ldquo;employ&rdquo;, meaning by that to leave on the employer the responsibility of seeing that the driver is properly licensed, but taking off his shoulders the responsibility of seeing, when the time comes for renewal, that the proper date is not overlooked.  In these circumstances I suggest the word &ldquo;engage&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;employ&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Thrift wants to remove from the employer the responsibility of seeing that his driver must be licensed all the time while in his employment.  Our view is that the responsibility ought to be on the employer and we would prefer to keep the word &ldquo;employ&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;engage.&rdquo;  If the amendment be accepted it would relieve the employer of that responsibility.  We think at all times when an employer has a man in <Col N="1219" /> his employment he ought to make it his duty to see that the man is properly licensed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>The man engaged is not a child.  It is his duty to look after himself.  Speaking as the employer of a driver, I am bound to say that I find it exceedingly difficult to remember the exact date to renew a licence.  I am quite sure I would not do it as I would forget.  I do not agree with the Minister that it is reasonable to expect the employer to see after those kind of details.  I think that is the driver's duty and the driver's duty only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has any experience, but most companies pay the licence duty for the drivers, and these men know that they simply have to hand in their licences to the office, to be sent to the proper authorities for renewal.  Sometimes, as a result of this, the men get very careless.  The authorities in the office are not able at all times to get in touch with these men, and I think you are taking the onus off the driver unnecessarily.  He certainly should be compelled to see that his licence is kept up-to-date and in good order. The employer has no objection to do it, but there is no use in putting an obligation of this kind on the employer.  The driver should be compelled and forced to see that his licence is in good order. That is my own experience and I have to deal with a lot of drivers myself.</P>

It seems to me to be unreasonable to take this particular responsibility off the employee or driver.  It is more likely that each man could look after his own licence better than that one should look after a group of licences.</P>

      <P>If I might point out to the Minister, I really think he is more likely to secure his object by accepting my amendment than rejecting it.  If the driver feels the responsibility is the employer's, and not his, he is very likely indeed not to take out any licence at all and let the matter slip, and amidst a lot of other things, the employer might very easily forget.</P>

As far as this Bill is concerned, my position is that I would like to leave this matter to the House.  We do not want to stand here and to have it thought that we have here something that we are defending against all comers.  I want to get a consensus of the views of the House but, so far, I am strongly advised that it would be in the interests of everyone concerned that the word should be &ldquo;employ.&rdquo;  The legal side of my Department and those with practical experience of the working of the law advise me to stand by the word &ldquo;employ&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;engage.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The amendment is to secure that persons applying for drivers licences for any class of mechanically propelled vehicles shall furnish certificates of competency similar to those required by drivers of public service vehicles under Section 101.  The amendments standing in my name have been submitted by a committee of the Dublin Corporation which was appointed specially for the purpose.  The amendments are officially put forward for the Corporation.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept them, because they received very careful consideration in the Legal Department and from the City Manager.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has made a very strong appeal to me as an old member of the Corporation.  I am afraid I am unable to accept the amendments.  The statistics we have in the Department show that accidents are caused not by incompetent drivers but by competent drivers taking chances.  As a rule incompetent drivers are very careful, but competent drivers will take chances and try to get through where <Col N="1223" /> the less competent and, perhaps, wiser persons would not.  Another point is that this amendment would necessitate the immediate examination of over 60,000 persons for certificates.  Apart from the difficulty about machinery I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment, as the Deputy, who is Lord Mayor of Dublin, knows I have very great respect for the body which sends them forward.</P>

      <P>May I ask is it the Minister's intentions when this Bill is law that people who will have to apply for a licence will be refused because of physical disability, such as having one arm?

      <P>The point raised by Deputy Moore is a very important one. There are numbers of people driving cars who, if they had to undergo an examination say for their eyesight or for other defects might not be passed by the medical authorities while at the same time they have a record of many years of careful and safe driving.  The record of a person who has held a driving licence for a number of years, and who has had no mishap, of a serious nature, should be <i>ipso facto</i> taken as a certificate of fitness for a licence.</P>

      <P>If that point is not attended to many very serious cases of hardship will arise.  I happened to hear of one case of a man very seriously crippled who was only able to get to business from his home by driving his car.  He is perfectly capable of driving but I am quite certain that no doctor will certify him.  It is partially with the object of dealing with such a case that amendment 8 has been put down.</P>

If a man makes the declaration, and if it is only when an officer of the Gárdaí under Section 32, suspects that a person is not fit to have a licence, the Gárda challenges his fitness and he has to challenge that before a District Court and if the case goes against the applicant, the applicant has an appeal to the Circuit Court.

      <P>I feel that I ought to draw the attention of the Minister to sub-section (4).  It seems to me that that sub-section puts a power into the hands of the Guards which might be easily misused.  I quite recognise, that, as a force, the Guards are exceedingly efficient and do their work exceedingly well, but there are bound to be members occasionally whose opinions in such a connection would be worth very little.  I think that under this sub-section the liberty of the subject is definitely placed at the mercy of a Guard's opinion.  A Guard can just say in justification of his arrest: &ldquo;Oh, I thought so; I thought I was entitled to do so,&rdquo; and so on.  I think it puts a very serious power in the hands of every individual member of the Gárdaí, and that it ought to be considered very carefully before the House adopts it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Thrift objects to the giving of this power to the Guards under this section, but on an earlier section he did not support me, and was quite content, apparently, to give power to the Guards, where they suspected an offence had been committed, to order a person to drive a vehicle a certain distance along the <Col N="1232" /> road and cause that person all kinds of trouble.</P>

      <P>Surely Deputy Moore sees the difference between requiring a person to drive a motor car down a road a certain distance and incarcerating a person in Mountjoy or in the Bridewell.  Citizens have the right to resent being made criminally liable for things they never did, but they have not the right to resent being asked to take reasonable precautions against the commission of an offence.</P>

I have known cases where the Guards have prevented certain persons from continuing to drive a car when they considered that they were not in a fit condition to do so?  It appears to me, however, that if the section is passed in its present form and if the Guards find people in a certain condition they will have no alternative but to arrest them.  If a man adheres to the decision to drive his car, and the Guard thinks that he should not be allowed to do so, then I think that in <Col N="1233" /> order to protect the public the Guard will have no alternative but to arrest him.</P>

What I object to is the laxity of the words in sub-section (4): &ldquo;Whenever a member of the Gárda Síochána is of opinion.&rdquo; Under the section as it is it would be sufficient defence for the Guard to say in court: &ldquo;Oh, I thought I was entitled to arrest under the section.&rdquo; I think the Minister should come to the conclusion that the words in the section are very lax.</P>

      <P>I strongly disagree with the last Deputy.  It seems to me that for the safety of the ordinary citizen the Guards should be protected in this way.  It is always a matter of opinion whether a man is drunk or not.  It has been found very difficult to define drunkenness.  If the Guards were without this power and felt that they had absolutely to prove afterwards that a man really was drunk, then I am afraid they would often allow men to continue in charge of motor cars when they ought not to be in charge of them.</P>

Here, in this section, it is simply &ldquo;I suspect; I am of opinion.&rdquo;  The Guard has not even to give any explanation to his superior officer as to why he was of such an opinion.  We can all have certain opinions, but it is another matter to give a reason for them.  I suggest it is quite unreasonable not to ask the Guard to give some justification for an opinion that may lead to grave consequences for those concerned.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 35, to delete the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;three.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a case where a licence is being granted that had elapsed, or it may be a licence that had no previous existence.  We are now dealing with the particular section on endorsed licences.  A person who has had such a licence for three years is entitled to get a new licence provided the period has been a continuous one.  If the period has not been a continuous one, <Col N="1237" /> then the whole of the calculated broken periods must be equivalent to five years.  I think that is somewhat of a hardship because there are many of those drivers who have long periods of unemployment.  I do not think it is desirable to harass them by reason of circumstances beyond their control. In this amendment we propose that where broken periods amount in the aggregate to three years they should be accepted.  We, therefore, propose to substitute the figure &ldquo;three&rdquo; for the figure &ldquo;five&rdquo; in connection with the broken periods.  If a man, with a continuous licence for a period of three years, is entitled to a renewal, we think that a man with broken periods aggregating three years should also be entitled to a licence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these amendments deals with the case where the driver of a motor car has been called upon to show his licence, and, for some reason or another, he has not the licence with him.  There may be negligent people, and we must provide for these people. The case I have in mind is that of a tourist who, for some reason or another, has left his licence behind him.  He may be going some considerable distance from the place where he is asked to produce his licence, and some time may elapse before he is able to get his licence and bring it back to the particular area where he is called upon to produce it.  For that reason it is suggested that the period of three days might be reasonably extended to seven days.  The next amendment deals with the case where the owner of the licence is called upon to produce it personally. That I think is unfair.  I think, in the first place, it is desirable to give a person a little more time to produce his licence if he has to get to his destination for it and then <Col N="1239" /> come back again to produce it.  I suggest that three days, in that case should be extended to seven; and, now, further we propose that the person should not be called upon personally to attend in producing the licence, and that if he could get some other person&mdash;his legal representative or somebody like that&mdash;to produce the licence for him, it should be sufficient.</P>

      <P>The court always has a discretion.  They have exercised it whether they have it or not.  I must say they are not always right in doing so.  If Deputies would agree, I would be prepared to give five days instead of three.  With regard to the points of the discretion that is exercised, if we gave seven days it is quite possible that the discretion that would be exercised might extend it to ten days. It has been the practice to allow a little longer in that way.  We think it is unreasonable to allow it.  In regard to the second point, the handing in of the licence by another person, I am advised that it would lead to very great difficulties in identification and to evasions of the law, if persons who could not be identified put in the licence.  It would be very unwise to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we go on to Section 46, there is a point I should like to raise on the question of the issue of licences which appears to be fully dealt with in the clauses up to clause 45.  One is tempted to ask whether it would not be necessary for a driver to <Col N="1245" /> have a licence to drive a trailer.  Can any man with an ordinary licence drive a motor lorry with a trailer behind, carrying six or eight tons, and not under proper control, or are we now going to admit the principle that one driver can drive a heavy lorry and to have behind it what is equivalent to two or three cars with the one licence? Heavily laden lorries do considerable damage to our roadways and to our railways.  They do not provide any compensatory employment when there is only one licence.  Those of us who have travelled on the country roads have seen one man driving a heavily laden car with a trailer wobbling about behind with neither a man nor a boy in charge of it.  Would it not be necessary in order to protect our railways to see that there shall not be this procession of heavily laden motor lorries? The second or third vehicle, as we all know, is not under proper control when it is heavily laden, and any of us who have travelled the roads recently have seen some of these cars driving along with the second vehicle more than half way over on the other side.</P>
      <P>I have seen lorries with double decks of milk cans and double decks of sheep, and in one case, I saw double decks of cattle, and I say that, under the Bill that we have before us, those trailers cannot be considered as being under proper control.  I hope the Minister will go into it at some later date.  They do not give any compensatory employment for the work done or the damage done to the roads.  I suggest to the Minister that he might be able to introduce a section to ensure that these trailers will not be allowed. I remember about twenty-five years ago our tram company here endeavouring to have trailers or second tramcars with only the one driver and conductor, but they were not allowed.  They were forced to take the passenger-carrying trailers off and to put a driver and conductor on each car.  I suggest that the pressure of unemployment would be somewhat relieved if the Minister would see to it that such conditions as I have described shall not continue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 61, to delete the word &ldquo;twenty-five&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;thirty-five.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment I have down is a proposal to raise the speed limit under certain circumstances.  This particular portion of this Section 46 deals with the light motor car or motor car drawing a light trailer.  Those of us who use the roads and, especially, during the summer months, have been accustomed to see these trailers being more widely used.  One sees light trailers behind some cars carrying, in addition to luggage, tent equipment for camping and one sees caravans and a variety of things drawn at the back of motor cars.  The case I have in mind is that in which the luggage is in the light trailer with camping equipment and I think it would be <Col N="1247" /> exceedingly harsh to limit the speed of such a vehicle to twenty-five m.p.h. These vehicles, as we know, travel considerable distances and some of them I have seen coming across here and going out to camp in the West.  If they are to be limited to a speed of twenty-five m.p.h., they will be some time getting to the West and, if they know of that particular speed limit, they may not come here at all.</P>
    <P>While it would be quite safe to drive a motor car and trailer of the description I have just mentioned at 25 miles an hour, I quite agree there are other forms of trailers which it would be dangerous to drive at that speed.  If we could in some way define light trailers of the character I have mentioned it would be absolutely safe to permit them to go at a higher rate of speed and it would be unfair to keep them to a speed of 25 miles an hour.  As a matter of fact, it would be absolutely safe to drive them at 35 miles and hour.  I am not in any sense an advocate of speed.  I am not one of the community known as speed merchants; I am rather of the other type; but I think at the same time under certain circumstances we would not be doing anything that might be looked upon as unreasonable if we extended the speed limit from 25 to 35 miles an hour.</P>
    <P>There are other amendments down expressing more limited views on this matter, but I think, all things considered, we might in this case give permission for particular vehicles to travel over this specified speed limit. The cars might, if one liked, be limited by weight.  I know if the Minister saw the trailer I have in mind he would not hesitate to extend the speed limit in its favour.  I will trust to his generosity to accede to my request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment.  My experience is that 35 miles an hour would be a dangerous speed for any form of trailer, even the lightest, particularly at road bends.  I quite conceive that 30 miles an hour might be permissible for the lighter form of <Col N="1248" /> trailer, but it would be difficult to distinguish between trailers that would be dangerous and trailers that would be dangerous.  I think the section ought to be allowed to stay as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Our view is that the speed limit ought to stand as specified in the Bill.  If Deputy Good wishes to induce British tourists to come here, this speed limit will be attractive.  I am informed that in Britain the speed limit is 20 miles an hour for light private vehicles drawing trailers.  That will mean an advantage of five miles an hour here; they can scorch the extra five miles here, and that might be an inducement to them.  In other States in Europe, I am informed, the speed limit would more likely be 20 miles an hour.</P>
      <P>I have seen some types of trailers. The Department has supplied me with quite a number of illustrations depicting different varieties of trailers that are used in connection with light and other motor vehicles.  There are, for instance, caravans, trailers drawing cattle&mdash;I have not seen any drawing horses&mdash;trailers drawing vegetables and some things that appear to be like cottages, if not houses on wheels.  I think we are doing very well with the speed limit we have specified and it would not be to the motorists' advantage or to their safety, any more than to the safety of the public, to do more than we are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has mentioned that the limit on the other side for this type of vehicle is 20 miles an hour, I do not think we can ask for any more than 25.  I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <Col N="1249" /> In sub-section (2) (a) (ii), line 10, to delete the word &ldquo;thirty-five&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;thirty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope this will meet with the Minister's approval.  It is a move in the direction of prudence and the Minister has been very prudent.  Deputy Thrift could speak much better on this subject than I.  I have been informed by a motoring expert that 30 miles an hour is quite enough if one is to observe safety in the case of these large public service vehicles.  Such vehicles are very heavy and a speed of 35 miles an hour would be sufficiently dangerous for themselves, apart altogether from the danger to other road vehicles and to pedestrians.  The question of damage to the road surface must also be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there are many countries where a speed limit still exists for ordinary motor cars.  It so happens that in the State of New York, where I had a great deal of motoring experience, 30 miles an hour is the speed limit for an ordinary motor car, though it is not always strictly enforced.  At any rate, the police have the power to enforce it whenever they feel called upon to do so, as frequently happens.  I am absolutely confident, both from the point of view of damage to the roads and public safety, that buses ought not be allowed to go at more than 30 miles an hour.  I have motored quite a lot in this country and I feel that buses go far too fast.  I have seen many instances where buses travelling at a fast speed have narrowly missed being involved in serious accidents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House should be unanimous on this question of a speed limit for buses.  Anyone who has had any experience of road traffic must feel that at the present moment there is really no speed limit observed by big buses.  If this proposal is accepted by the Minister I hope that <Col N="1250" /> the authorities will see that a speed limit of 30 miles an hour will be observed and that it will not be merely a pious expression of opinion.  I have seen buses travelling at very high speeds.  I have chased them myself at a speed of 47 miles an hour and I could not catch up to them.  We all recognise that a potential danger in the country at the present moment is the rate of speed at which buses travel.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel like joining with other Deputies in asking the Minister to reduce this speed limit. I think some Deputies are influenced by what Deputy O'Neill speaks about; that is, the very excessive speeds at which buses in nearly every part of the country travel, and also the very great want of courtesy that very often is found on the part of drivers of buses and large trading cars.  The want of courtesy is very marked on the part of drivers on quite a number of the big vehicles.  I do not think, however, that the kind of unrestricted circumstances we have at present should make us introduce legislation here that will cramp a very necessary service. The Minister is taking power under Section 47 to vary the speeds that are being made statutory in this measure after a specific resolution has been passed by both Houses.  My own instinct in the matter would be to raise the 15 miles in respect of the double-decker rather than to reduce the 35 miles in respect of ordinary buses.  We did, I think, approach the double-deckers here with a certain amount of diffidence as regards the safety of travelling in them for the reason that we had no experience of them here and, perhaps, also for the reason that a number of double-deckers that came into the country were secondhand. I do not know what is the experience in the country of the double-decker, but I think 35 miles an hour as the maximum speed under the best possible conditions on the open road for the ordinary bus that is doing long route trips between one part of the country and another is not an excessive speed, and there is ample safeguard in respect of special areas <Col N="1251" /> for making orders with regard to speed limits.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the House and the Minister not to be swept away by any feeling that there are serious irregularities in connection with the speed and the general management on the road of buses at the present time.  Once you get this measure, and once you settle down to more detailed administration of the traffic on the roads, you will find that in the matter of the 35-mile limit with respect to buses there would be ample power to deal with a speed limit and to deal with it in a simple way by putting a resolution before the House here and having it passed.  I think the general spirit in the matter here is to do the best and the most sensible thing.  I would advise against touching the 35-mile limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a fairly strong case in support of the reduction in the maximum limit from 35 to 30 miles an hour.  When making a comparison between the speed limits here and in Great Britain I think one must pay some regard to the difference in the type of road here and in Great Britain.  I have travelled over a number of trunk roads in Great Britain and I know that anyone will have to admit that the trunk road running from London to Birmingham and up on to Scotland is about twice the width of any of our roads here. Let any Deputy picture to himself the road from Dublin to Limerick and picture to himself the number of dangerous corners on that road.  I travelled over that road by bus on several occasions and I can quite see the danger to people in overcrowded buses when you have a speed limit of 35 miles.  In travelling over the roads of the country I find that the engineers who originally constructed those roads must have had only one eye instead of two.  When considering whether the maximum speed should be 30 or 35 miles an hour, I do not think that it is right for Deputy Mulcahy to suggest that in reducing the speed to 30 miles an hour we are cramping a necessary public service.  We must <Col N="1252" /> consider the type of roads here compared to the roads in other countries, and I think that taking these circumstances into consideration there is a very strong case for reducing the speed limits for the buses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, unanimously agreed. By that agreement it was decided to leave out of the Bill, as amended, that question of a speed limit for private motor-cars.  Now we have the peculiar spectacle of Deputy Davin, ardent Labour man as he is, coming along here and saying that the rich people are quite responsible and that they are entitled to get where they want to go as quickly as they can, but when it comes to the bus, the poor man's motorcar, he is for strictly limiting the speed. He wants to prescribe the speed for the poor man and let the rich man go at any speed he likes.  That is a curious attitude for a Labour man to take up.  There is much more reason, in my opinion, for restoring the speed limit in the case of the private motorcar. Deputy Davin should remember that most of the accidents do not occur through the fault of one vehicle.  There are generally two vehicles involved and the accident may be the fault of the private vehicle which may be unrestricted as to speed.  It may be through the fault of the private car that the accident will happen.  Accidents to one vehicle occur very rarely. Accidents generally arise through one vehicle coming into collision with another, when you have legislation whereby one vehicle can go at any speed it likes on the road, irrespective of what danger it may cause to the other vehicle which is to go at 30 miles an hour.  I think Deputies will agree that that is an unsafe state of things. Deputies who urge that favour a line of reasoning that is not convincing.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Moore has overlooked the fact that a great many roads in this country are <Col N="1253" /> constructed in such a way that buses should not pass over them at all. There are roads in the West of Ireland where a bus looks as much out of place as a bull in a china shop; but buses are allowed to ply over them for the convenience of the travelling public. It is only on the understanding that they should be kept within a safe speed limit that cars should be allowed on these roads.  A great many of these roads are not fit to stand anything like a higher rate of speed than 30 miles an hour if we are to have a safe limit for travelling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the House can accept the view of Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Davin that this Bill entitles any bus to go round the corner at the rate of 35 miles an hour.  There are many corners on the trunk roads where it would be dangerous to the public to have a bus going round them at ten miles an hour.  The very roads which Deputy MacDermot has mentioned are roads on which it would be dangerous to the public using the buses to travel at 20 miles an hour.  But I take it that this Bill envisages other things. There are other roads on which it would be quite safe at 35 miles an hour. Take the road from Slane to Dublin which many Deputies here know.  Are we going to pull down a bus to 30 miles an hour on that road?  We are here enacting legislation, and we are supposed to make that legislation sensible so that there will be a reasonable hope of its being observed. On a road like that road from Slane to Dublin where you can see miles and miles ahead, it is foolish to impose speed restrictions at all.  On the other hand, where there are dangerous corners on the road, you are not under this Bill entitled to travel through them at this speed.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that in the case of the double-deckers, as they are called, we seem to have forgotten that in limiting them to 15 miles an hour we are making them a public nuisance on the roads.  I have travelled on double-deckers several times and, in my opinion, they are perfectly safe vehicles.  There is as little vibration as <Col N="1254" /> in a single decker.  The speed limit of 15 miles an hour is not right in the case of double-deckers.  On the other hand, I think it is foolish on the open road to reduce the speed limit on buses to what it is in the Bill.  I would suggest that the Minister should allow the 35 miles' limit to stand.</P>

      <P>I think the argument advanced by Deputy Haslett is one that has been overlooked by those advocating a reduction in the maximum speed for buses.  That is, that travelling at the maximum speed permitted may, in various circumstances, be in itself an offence making the driver liable not only to a fine but to imprisonment.  Section 51 prohibits dangerous driving, no matter what the actual speed is, having regard to all the circumstances of the occasion.  It is specifically stated there that it is no defence for the person who has been charged with dangerous driving to plead that he was driving within the maximum speed permitted. It is not stated in the Bill that an omnibus driver may drive his omnibus at 35 miles an hour in all circumstances. What is stated is that, under the most favourable circumstances possible, on the widest road and on the finest day, with the least amount of traffic, that is the highest speed at which he can drive his omnibus.  That is, in my opinion, a reasonable speed.  It is certainly much less than the ordinary speed of omnibuses at the present time.  If this section is passed and rigidly enforced, it will mean a substantial reduction on the speed at which omnibuses travel at the present time.  People who have to use omnibuses are entitled to get to their destinations in the shortest possible time that considerations of the public safety will permit.  I was astounded to hear that Deputy Davin travelled from Dublin to Limerick on a bus, side by side with the railway all the way.</P>

      <P>Assuming that Deputy Davin was travelling on a bus because there was no train service available and that that bus could travel at 35 <Col N="1255" /> miles an hour without danger to the public, there is no reason why it should not be permitted to do so.  That is particularly so when we remember that, as Deputy Moore pointed out, the wealthier person&mdash;the owner of the private car&mdash;is allowed to travel without any restriction as to the maximum speed whatever.  He is, of course, required to drive with all due care and caution, but he is not liable to a fine because he exceeds a certain speed.</P>
      <P>I was one of the members who, when this Bill was in Committee in a previous Dáil, were opposed to the idea of a maximum speed.  I think there is a case for a maximum speed in relation to heavy vehicles like omnibuses and lorries, but my view is that the imposition of a maximum speed-limit attracts attention to the wrong idea&mdash; that the right idea is a speed which, having regard to all the circumstances of the occasion, is reasonable.  The enforcement of a law of this kind should have as its first concern whether the public safety is being endangered by the speed under the circumstances. The introduction of a maximum speed introduces a wrong element into the situation.  It is, I think, true that a maximum speed of more than 35 miles an hour for heavy omnibuses is dangerous not so much to the people travelling in the omnibuses as to other people using the road.  The weight of the omnibus is such that it cannot be pulled up except over a considerable distance, and accidents cannot be so easily avoided as in the case of the lighter type of car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that a speed of fifteen miles an hour for double-decker omnibuses is much too low as a maximum speed, and that it makes for something in the nature of a public nuisance.  That was the speed suggested when this Bill was before the Dáil on the last occasion. As Deputy Mulcahy said, we had not at that time much experience of these double-decker omnibuses and they appeared to be somewhat unsafe.  In the City of Cork they have had experience of double-decker omnibuses for a long time now.  They have been in use for transport in and around the city, <Col N="1256" /> and they have been found quite safe at a speed in excess of fifteen miles an hour.  I do not say that we should have the same speed for double-decker omnibuses as we have for single-decker omnibuses, but I think the Dáil should press the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to increase the maximum speed for double-decker omnibuses beyond fifteen miles an hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other speakers in urging the Minister for Local Government not to reduce the speed limit of those heavier buses. One would think, listening to Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Davin, that the present Bill proposed to increase the speed of these vehicles.  Actually, I think that the effect of this maximum speed limit will be very drastically to reduce the speed at which those buses travel through the country.  I do not agree with Deputy MacDermot for one moment that if a maximum speed is allowed it is going to be the average or the normal speed.  In this Bill, there is ample power and ample machinery to deal with the driver of a bus who drives in a manner dangerous to the public under certain conditions and certain circumstances even if his speed is considerably less than the maximum speed limit outlined in the Bill.  From the point of view of public safety or public danger, I think that very heavy vehicles travelling along the road at a slow rate are often a greater menace to the public than if travelling at a faster rate. There is a temptation or a tendency to pass them out when they are going at a slow rate irrespective of whether one is at a corner or not.  I think that the proposed speed limit hits off the happy medium.</P>

      <P>I think that the amendment is unwise.  Buses are generally run to schedules and drivers are inclined to take chances.  If the driver is confined to a speed of thirty miles an hour on the open road, he will certainly take chances at corners.  You cannot have Civic Guards at every corner along the Dublin-Limerick road. <Col N="1257" /> If a driver travelling to schedule is limited to thirty miles an hour, he will take chances at corners and you will make bus traffic more dangerous.</P>

      <P>The question of a speed limit does not really arise.  The question at issue really is that of dangerous driving.  It may be dangerous to drive 5 miles an hour in one place, while it is quite safe to drive at fifty miles an hour in another place.  That is the law irrespective of any other consideration.  Owing to the strike on the Great Northern Railway, I am coerced&mdash;unlike Deputy Davin, who travelled to Limerick by bus&mdash;to travel by bus to Dublin.  On those long journeys, I thought that the bus was not going half fast enough.  Take the case of a bus travelling from here to Sligo and from Sligo to remote parts of Donegal.  If that bus was confined to thirty miles an hour, how would I ever get to my constituency?  It would be quite safe for that bus to travel at fifty miles an hour on certain portions of the road while it would be highly dangerous for it to travel at 10 miles <Col N="1258" /> an hour on other portions of the road. That is the law irrespective of anything else in this Bill.  The provisions of a time table do not exempt drivers of omnibuses from their liability under the law.  If the driver drives at a dangerous speed, he is liable irrespective of the contents of his time table. His time table is not going to protect him from the provisions of the law. We have to keep that in view.  This thing of a time table does not count at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore has endeavoured to create the impression that I was a member of some Committee responsible for making a certain recommendation.  That was a Committee of the whole House and I think it is ridiculous for any Deputy to suggest that every Deputy was responsible for what went through the Committee of the whole House when Deputy Mulcahy was Minister, and agreed with everything in the Bill.  That is not so.  I do not mind confessing frankly that if the law was rigidly applied and could be rigidly enforced, to the extent that the maximum limit in the Bill would be the real limit, I would be satisfied.  Deputy Goulding, however, hit the nail on the head when he said that in order to do so it would be necessary to have a Civic Guard at every awkward corner from here to Limerick, Waterford, or Ballina, or wherever buses run for long distances.  I recognise that provision is made in the Bill to deal with those found to be driving to the danger of the public.  How is that going to be enforced in a country like this with a very scattered police force to deal with this and other matters for which the police are responsible?  Deputy McMenamin spoke of the schedule provided for drivers.  I invite the Minister to look up the existing time tables even of the big bus companies and he will find it would be impossible under the time tables for a driver to go from here to Ballina or any other long distance by bus without exceeding the speed limit in the Bill.  I know of cases, and I think cases have been brought to the notice of the Minister for Local Government, and to the notice of the Minister for Industry and <Col N="1259" /> Commerce, where drivers found exceeding the speed limit through complying with the time tables were themselves made responsible for the fines although the owners were responsible for drafting the time tables which compelled the drivers, under penalty of dismissal, to get to certain places within a specified time.  Deputy McMenamin knows that well.</P>

I would be quite satisfied, if the law could be properly enforced and if the Minister could give an assurance that it will be enforced as soon as the Bill becomes law, to leave the maximum speed limit as it is in the Bill, although I believe, from the point of view of the roads available for the use of buses, compared with the roads available in Great Britain and elsewhere, there is a far better case for a higher speed limit outside this country.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Davin as to the speed limit.  I consider that it is far too high.  My only regret is that there is not some limitation to the speed at which private cars can go. From the few trips I had with the Minister for Industry and Commerce I must agree that he would not share my view in that.  The point I should like to make clear is, as Deputy Goulding said, that the schedule will be fixed at the maximum speed limit. Buses will have to slow down at corners and take them at 10 or 12 miles an hour, but they will make it up on the open road by travelling at 40 or 45 miles per hour.  We have to <Col N="1260" /> consider the farmer who is coming out of a boreen or a passage with a horse and cart on to a road when one of these buses is coming along at 45 miles an hour.  Then there is the farmer who has to use the roads for the driving of cattle.  Can a bus going at that rate be pulled up in time?  One would think that the only thing required in this country is speed to take people who have nothing to do somewhere where they will have nothing to do either.  Anybody who watches on Sundays private cars taking the new rich from one public house to another will see that they insist upon going at 60 miles per hour even for a distance of two miles.  As I say, the speed limit is far too high.  Even 30 miles per hour would be too high, in my opinion, because the schedule will be arranged at that rate.  That will mean that if they have to go slow around corners or on bad stretches of road they will make up for it when they come to a clear stretch of road and the speed will be 60 miles per hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I would be quite willing to leave it to a free vote of the House.  We might then get a fairly large majority for one figure as against another, but no matter what figure you arrive at, there will be a very large amount of disagreement, judging by the discussion in the House two years ago and judging by the discussion we had to-day.  We have had speed limits ranging from 15 to 50 miles per hour suggested.  I think that if we put it to a vote we will have amendment after amendment put up to reduce it by five miles every time. I really think that the figure of 35 miles as the maximum speed is as good a figure as you will get, judging from my experience of the discussions in the House.  It is suggested that that figure will be more an average figure than a maximum figure, because bus companies will tie their employees to a schedule which will oblige them to travel at a much faster rate in certain places in order to keep to the <Col N="1261" /> schedule.  But if Deputies turn to Section 54 they will see that that particular question of the schedule is dealt with.  Section 54 provides:</P>
      <P>Where the owner of an omnibus instructs the driver thereof to observe a time table and such time table is so framed that such driver could not observe it without driving such omnibus at a speed which would be a contravention of this Part of this Act, such owner shall be deemed to aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of an offence punishable on summary conviction within the meaning of Section 22 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Davin may rest assured that it will be regarded as the maximum, and it certainly will be an improvement on the conditions as we know them at present.</P>

That is the objection which we have.  I am old enough to remember the period when there were metres put on our trams to prevent their going beyond a certain speed.

Those things occur, and will occur in the future if some steps are not taken other than what are being taken at the moment.

      <P>I do not propose to detain the House very long.  I have experience of motoring in practically all parts of the country, at a moderate speed on all occasions, notwithstanding any qualms of conscience people may have to the contrary.  I have experience of bus drivers and lorry drivers, and there is a marked improvement in the courtesy extended by those drivers to practically everybody on the roads. I believe I was passed on one or two occasions by buses, but it is many years ago.  It is not at all a question of speed; it is a question of the <Col N="1264" /> security of the vehicle which is being driven, and of the competency of the person driving it.  It is nonsense to say you are going to make a regulation here for the amusement of making it; you are making it to preserve order on the road, but with good machines and good drivers, speed is a matter of secondary consideration.  Ten years ago this 35 miles that we are mentioning here might reasonably be put down at 22 or 23 miles.  The improvement in the road, the improvement in the machine, and the improvement in the competency of the driver, have advanced beyond ten miles an hour during that period.  The damage that is done to the road at a speed of 35 or 37 miles an hour is negligible, no matter what the size or weight of the car, if it is a tarred macadam road. Driving at 35 miles an hour on a warm summer day or in normally mild weather in this country would be intolerable.  The heat of the car would make it almost a penance to do so.  If we are concerned with the order of the road there is no danger whatever in a speed of 35 miles an hour, even if it were an average rather than a maximum speed.  There is danger with quite a number of cars at over that speed, but few cars that are capable of being on the road are dangerous at a speed of 35 miles an hour.  I take it we do not want to put undue hardship on people who have to journey on omnibuses.  As regards the competency of the drivers, one has only got to look at the list of accidents.  There are very few head-on accidents with buses as compared with private cars.  The damage to the road is negligible.  The convenience of the persons on the vehicle ought to be considered.  Steps should be taken, in connection with licences given to individuals to drive mechanically propelled vehicles, to see that they are competent.  It would make a laughing-stock of the House if there were a lower speed than 35 miles an hour for buses.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 50, to delete the words &ldquo;without exercising due care and attention or.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment for the purpose of drawing attention to the wide scope of this particular clause in this section, and also for the purpose of eliciting from the Minister some sort of official justification for the insertion in this section of these wide words.  In the Second Reading speech of the Minister he merely stated that careless driving, as distinct from dangerous driving, is also dealt with.  This section, I am of course aware, is almost a precise copy of a similar section in the English Road Traffic Bill.  I do not know whether the Ministry consider that a sufficient justification for its insertion in this Bill.  I do want to direct the attention of the House <Col N="1266" /> to the very wide scope that these words insert into the Road Traffic Bill.  The words themselves are &ldquo;without exercising due care and attention or&rdquo; and those words constitute a separate offence in this section apart from the next part of the section which provides against anybody who does not exercise reasonable consideration.</P>
    <P>With the second portion of the section I am in full agreement.  I think it is an offence that anybody should drive on the public roads without exercising reasonable consideration for other people.  But I do want to know what precise significance is to be given to the new terminology of &ldquo;due care and attention.&rdquo;  Those words &ldquo;due care and attention&rdquo; replace the words &ldquo;recklessly and negligently&rdquo; which were in Section 3 of the Motor Car Act of 1903, and everybody is conversant with the meaning of the word &ldquo;negligent,&rdquo; and everybody, particularly District Justices and Circuit Court judges, knows the standard of care which the word &ldquo;negligent&rdquo; requires, but so far as I know nobody knows what standard of care is to be applied where the expression used is &ldquo;due care and attention.&rdquo; What I am apprehensive of is this&mdash;that those words &ldquo;due care and attention&rdquo; will be used merely to harry motorists and also for the purpose, perhaps, of justifying a District Justice in prosecuting a motorist who is brought by a traffic Guard to the District Court in circumstances in which there should be really no conviction at all.  That is borne out by the provision of the next section which provides that, if a person is prosecuted for driving to the danger of the public, and the evidence does not sustain a charge of that kind, he can still be convicted by the District Justice for not exercising &ldquo;due care and attention.&rdquo;  It appears to me, therefore, that this provision is merely inserted, as I said, for the purpose of enabling the District Justice to stand over the action of a Guard who brings a prosecution in circumstances where there really should be no prosecution at all.  I should like to know what is the precise meaning, or what is the precise justification, for that particular offence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> In this connection, perhaps it would not be irrelevant if I urge on the present Ministry what I urged on their predecessors, namely, that provisions of this kind, and provisions such as are contained in the next section, are provisions for the protection of the public, and particularly those sections of the public who use the roads.  And the provisions in this particular section &ldquo;without exercising due care and attention or&rdquo; are wide enough to enable a prosecution to be brought where no member of the public using the road is in any way endangered.  It will be noticed also that while the words which these particular words replace, namely, &ldquo;recklessly and negligently&rdquo; had attached to them the qualification &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo; the words &ldquo;without exercising due care and attention or&rdquo; now in the present section have not that qualification attached to them.  I do not know whether it would be possible to determine whether a person had or had not exercised due care and attention without having regard to all the circumstances of the case, but when you find in one section those words are omitted and in the next section they are inserted it is possible at least to construe the provision as excluding the words &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances of the case.&rdquo;  I would suggest, as I said before, that in the administration of this Act traffic police should not have as their guiding motive merely bringing a considerable number of prosecutions under this Act. When the Act is passed there will be regulations, the breach of which will be an offence, and the sections all over this very long Bill provide for numerous offences, and it appears to me, having regard to those provisions, and for this particular provision, it will be almost impossible for even the most careful and law-abiding motorist to cross the city without running the risk of, at least, being liable to prosecution at the hands of the police.</P>
    <P>What the administration of this Act should be directed to, in my submission, is this: That the really dangerous drivers should be concentrated upon, those who pass at corners, those who <Col N="1268" /> cut corners, those who stop without giving warning, and various other matters of that kind, and that merely technical offences such as would be comprised in the expression &ldquo;due care and attention&rdquo; should be overlooked or at least treated with considerable discretion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of putting those words which the Deputy has asked to be deleted&mdash;&ldquo;without exercising due care and attention or&rdquo;&mdash;in this section was to make it as wide and as all-embracing as possible.  Everyone knows that the number of accidents&mdash; happening&mdash;very serious accidents&mdash; where loss of life is involved, is on the increase, and while in the Act already in force, there were laws making it an offence to drive recklessly and negligently, the law was not sufficiently strong or was not so administered as to make the penalties sufficiently severe on those who drove recklessly or negligently, even to reduce the number of reckless drivers and the dangerous accidents which took place. It is not the intention, I think, of the Bill, and I do not think it is the intention of the House here, that any Bill of this kind should pass which would enable the Gárdaí to harass motorists. I do not think anybody in the House wants that, but I think the whole House does want legislation to be such as will put the person who is not a careful driver off the road&mdash;that would be my own personal desire at any rate &mdash;that the person who is a habitually careless driver and does not drive with due care and attention should be put off the road.  I would not want it to be proved always that the individual was a reckless driver, that he did not drive with due care and attention.  I think that person ought not to be permitted to drive.  However, I say if there is an opinion in the House here that these words in this section would be capable of being so interpreted or so used by anybody who was straight in administering the law, whether the District Justice or Gárda, if it would be that they would be interpreted or used merely to harass motorists and not achieve the purpose we have in view, and the purpose for <Col N="1269" /> which these words were put into the section originally, I would leave the matter entirely to the House to say whether these words ought to be allowed remain in or not.  Speaking personally I think they ought to be.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider that the object he desires to achieve, and which I think everyone desires to achieve, is covered by Section 51, driving to the danger of the public? When I was moving the amendment I do not think I directed attention to the fact that the words &ldquo;due care and attention&rdquo; would be sufficient to enable a passenger in the car to prosecute the driver.  That is not a reason for putting in this section.  The old section of the Motor Car Act of 1903 was construed as not enabling any prosecution to be brought unless a member of the public using the highway was in danger.  I think the object of the Bill was to preserve the lives, the limbs and the safety of users of the highway, and that there is no desire or necessity to preserve the life of, say, a young lady travelling in a car with a gentleman with his arm round her during the progress of the drive.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Moore I would like to say that there is no standard laid down in this particular section.  It would appear to me that the measure of the &ldquo;due care and attention&rdquo; required by the Bill would be what a particular policeman at one <Col N="1270" /> point might consider it, while another policeman at another point might not consider it in that way.  That is what I object to.  It leaves the question whether due care or attention was exercised to the individual whim of a Guard.</P>

      <P>He acts in a judicial capacity.  Deputies will appreciate the fact that the District Justice very naturally&mdash;and I would like to add very properly&mdash;does not wish to let down the Guards.  If a prosecution for dangerous driving is brought by a Guard, and if the evidence does not justify such conviction on the facts, then the tendency of the District Justice will be to use his powers in the &ldquo;due care and attention&rdquo; section in order not to let down the particular Guard who brought the prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision is not the one that is most likely to lead to abuse of that kind.  I think a very good general case of that kind could be made against the Bill, particularly in view of the enormous number of regulations that the Minister is empowered to make, because in that way considerable scope is given to Guards who may be ambitious or who may wish to have cases every hour.  Seeing that we have got on so long without practically any law with regard to road traffic, now when motor traffic is actually beginning to decline, such a vast amount of law should not be required in this matter. I think this is the least likely provision of the Bill to be abused.  It would want to be much more definite in order to give an opportunity to busybodies in the Gárda to claim that due care had not been exercised.  It is quite a necessary phrase to have in, because if a motorist is seen wobbling from one side of the road to the other, though he may not do it in circumstances that would be dangerous, or if he stops here and there suddenly, it should be open to the Guards to prosecute for such conduct, and particularly in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an interjection as to whether the object of this proposal was not to preserve life. There is no question of human life involved.  If human life were in danger it is not a penalty of £10 would be mentioned.  The interjection was like more of the nonsense that people interject about things of which they know nothing.  The question is whether motorists are to be used, as far as this section goes, to prohibit careless driving.  What is carelessness in driving?  Is it not enough to see that they exercise reasonable consideration for other persons and vehicles?  If a person drives a car and exercises reasonable care and consideration for other persons and vehicles, surely that is sufficient.  If he is able to prove that he has exercised reasonable consideration he may be answered that he did not drive with due care.  I do not see any necessity for this at all.  There is only one possible case which might arise, and that is in the case of a person who drives a small car, the type which would catch in the rails of the tramways.  If there was a skid that might possibly be regarded as lacking the exercise of due care and attention, although it was purely accidental.  If a person is prosecuted in such a case I think it is really penalising motorists. There is enough in the section without this.  It is like the case of a schoolboy explaining that he was not guilty, and being told by the schoolmaster that his past conduct was bad, but that he had been punished enough already.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, standing in my name, is rather of a verbal nature.  Section 51 deals with dangerous driving.  The section is worded as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Every person who drives a vehicle in a public place at a speed or in a manner which, having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including the nature, condition, and use of such place and the amount of traffic which then actually is or might reasonably be <Col N="1274" /> expected then to be in such place), is dangerous to the public shall be guilty of an offence under this section,&rdquo; and so on.  The words &ldquo;traffic... which might reasonably be expected to be&rdquo; are very ambiguous.  I suggest to the Minister that these words might lead to some misapprehension on both sides.  The phrasing is very loose.  It seems to me to be quite unnecessary. The words are, if anything, looser than the phrase they are supposed to exemplify&mdash;&ldquo;the circumstances of the case.&rdquo;  I suggest that the words which are in brackets are redundant and weaken the section.  Indeed, there is hardly any necessity for the words, and it should be sufficient to say &ldquo;who drives a vehicle in a public place at a speed or in a manner which, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, is dangerous to the public.&rdquo; Otherwise, there would be a tendency to limit one's attention to the specific points mentioned as exemplifying the circumstances of the case.  I stress particularly the looseness of the phrase &ldquo;traffic which might be expected to be.&rdquo;  I suggest that it would be very hard to estimate that.  Who would estimate it?  Would it be the driver of the motor car, the policeman, or the judge?  I suggest to the Minister that the wording should be reconsidered.</P>

We do not propose to alter the law in that way; but, of course, if a person, hiring a public service vehicle, such as a taxi, does offer an inducement of any kind to a driver, such as a few shillings, to catch a train at a certain station, and that necessarily, as a consequence, the driver has to exceed the speed limit, and an accident happens, I do not think that the hirer in that case should be free from responsibility. Other than in cases of that kind, however, the hirer has no responsibility at present, nor do we propose to put any further responsibility on him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, our advice is that there is still a doubt about it. The Minister makes the plea that, supposing an inducement is offered by the hirer of a vehicle to the driver, <Col N="1278" /> that in that particular case the hirer accepts a liability.  Supposing a single person hires a motor, an accident with liability accrues and the driver alleges that he was informed by the hirer it was necessary to take certain liabilities while the hirer says that is not the case&mdash;that there was no such inducement&mdash;who is to decide?  Even in the case which I think the Minister put, it is very unfair that the liability should be cast on the hirer.  The hirer, even assuming that he should make a request to the driver, may be wholly unaware that as a result of his request certain liabilities accrue.  Surely it would not be fair to make him liable. I think the Minister ought certainly free the hirer under all circumstances. If he likes to offer an inducement to the driver, and that the latter accepts that inducement and the liability, then it should be the driver's liability and not the liability of the hirer.  As Deputy Dockrell has pointed out this will certainly keep a number of people from using taxis.  The people in this city are not apparently a taxi driving people.  Some people hope that in the course of time we may become users of taxis to a larger extent than we are at the moment.  Difficulties of this kind should not to my mind exist if the law was framed as it should be framed.  I would press on the Minister that, in the circumstances, it is not desirable even in the particular case he mentioned that that particular liability should accrue.</P>

      <P>Though that is done in ignorance: that is to say that the person doing it is quite unaware of the liability that would accrue from his action.  As regards 99 out of every 100 hirers of taxis I think that would be the case.  They would not be aware that, in offering an inducement to a driver to speed up in order to catch a train, they were incurring this additional liability.</P>

      <P>In connection with these insurance proposals, when the 1931 Bill was before the Dáil we had a discussion, I think, as to whether it would be practicable to cover, in the arrangements for compulsory third-party insurance, accidents arising from such a thing as a skid where negligent driving was not necessarily the cause of the accident.  Since then I know that representations have been made to the Minister to consider whether something could not be done so that the relatives of victims of accidents arising in that way might have the benefit of insurance.  Everyone will agree, I think, that it is a very regrettable thing that where an accident occurs and the victim is a poor person with perhaps big family responsibilities&mdash;cases of the kind have occurred again and again&mdash;that there is no compensation of any kind for the relatives simply because negligent driving was not proved.  I think an attempt was made to deal with cases of the kind in a special Bill in England, but how far that measure got I am not able to say.  Seeing that we are introducing this principle of compulsory third party insurance now for the first time, it would be very desirable indeed if we could so extend those compulsory insurance proposals that the relatives of people who meet their deaths in that way might be able to get compensation.</P>
      <P>Since we last discussed this matter I, myself, was involved in an accident where a man was killed.  The accident arose from a skid.  It was described by the poor man himself before he died as an unavoidable accident.  He had seen the car skid.  Cases of the kind make one realise what a terrible thing it is when a family finds itself bereaved in that way&mdash;when the breadwinner, perhaps, loses his life&mdash;that it has no claim for compensation.  I am sure the Minister has inquired into this since he took up the preparation of the Bill, and I would be glad to hear whether he has anything to say on it.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister another question?  I put this case to the Minister as a possibility. Of course I know the driver would be breaking the law, but laws are broken. Supposing a taxi-driver were driving a taxi at a time when he was not insured and supposing an accident happened, would there be any possibility of taking an action&mdash;it could not be taken against the insurance company, and there would not be much use in taking it against the taxi-driver, because even if it were successful it would not be likely to produce anything&mdash;against the employer of the taxi, even though it could not be proved that he had urged the taxi-driver to drive at an excessive speed?  There is nobody else, I presume, against whom the injured party could make a case.  May I ask is there anybody else against whom they could make a case?</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 54, after the word &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;to a fine not exceeding ten pounds or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to put in an alternative.  The section as it stands reads: &ldquo;Every person who ... commits any fraud or makes any representation or statement (whether in writing or verbally or by conduct) which is to his knowledge false or misleading in any material respect ...&rdquo; But there may be a technical offence committed.  There may be, in filling up a proposal form for insurance against accident, for which a person could claim compensation, something omitted, and which was omitted with no intention of misleading. In that case the justice before whom the case might be tried would have no option but to imprison the offender.  The object of the amendment is to provide another way, and to enable the justice to exercise his discretion.  He is the judge of the case and if, in his opinion, it is a case in which there might be a nominal or a substantial fine, he should have the power to impose such fine.  As the sub-section reads at present there would be no option but to imprison the offender.</P>

      <P>It is quite true that there is no option given to the justice or judge in this case.  That was the deliberate intention.  The words of the section are &ldquo;which is to his knowledge false.&rdquo;  It is not something that would have slipped, unintentionally, into the form, but something put there deliberately, and, to the knowledge of the person putting it there, false.  In that case of putting in deliberate and false or misleading information there should be no alternative. A fine would not meet the offence under that section.  The justice, in that case as in every other, has the choice open to him of the First Offenders Act or something like that.  If it was not a very serious matter the justice might allow the person out under the First Offenders Act, but if it happened a second time we all know there should be no alternative.</P>

Assuming that it is desirable that there should be imprisonment, without the option of a fine, why have this long drawn out expensive process of a first hearing before the District Justice followed by Circuit Court proceedings?  Why not allow the matter to be tried by the District Justice or give him jurisdiction, in minor cases, to deal with such matters, under this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>After what Deputy Costello has said, perhaps the Minister will consider this matter further. Surely it is altogether against the tradition of the administration of the law in this country to prescribe a penalty of the character set out here, withdrawing from the District Justice the option of imposing a fine.  I quite recognise that a deliberate fraud means a very grave crime, but the Minister will realise that circumstances may arise in which any person may do something, and sometimes it may be carefully written, that should be marked with the severest censure. But the District Justice may consider, taking everything into consideration, the offender's family and all the circumstances in connection with the offence, that it would be quite excessive to impose a penalty that would make a jail bird of the offender when a fine might very well meet the case. The infliction of a heavy fine might suffice, and might save the offender's family from having a jail bird amongst them&mdash;that is a jail bird who had committed a criminal offence.  There are, of course, few families that have not jail birds amongst them who were sent <Col N="1284" /> to jail for other purposes.  I suggest to the Minister that we in this House are never able safely to withdraw from a judge the exercise of his discretion. Cases will arise in which a judge feels he is either bound to let down the administration of the law or do what he believes to be a substantial injustice to respectable people.  There is no suggestion, as Deputy Haslett said, of reducing the penalty that may be imposed.  The suggestion here is to give the judge discretion to do what he thinks is best.</P>

      <P>Deputies will remember how many of them contended that insurance companies were going to be the arbiters whether persons were going to drive motor cars or not, and rather considered that there would be a considerable number of persons who are anxious to drive but who would be prevented from driving by reason of the fact that the insurance companies would be squeamish of covering them by insurance.  That was the original idea that suggested imprisonment rather than a fine.  I would ask the Minister whether the intention in sub-section (2) of the section does not cover the point raised by Deputy Costello; that is whether sub-section (2), at any rate, permits a minor case coming before the District Justice and being dealt with there subject to a term of imprisonment of six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (2) does allow the accused to consent, and also gives the justice jurisdiction if he is of opinion that it is a minor offence. My point was why is there not machinery in this Act for small offences to be tried summarily as misdemeanours and to be brought under summary jurisdiction, leaving it in the hands of the District Justice to say whether or not it is a minor offence. Arising out of what Deputy Dillon said, from my experience extending over a considerable number of years of looking after the administration of criminal law in this country.  I can say that it is utterly useless to provide minimum penalties in cases of this kind.  The court simply ignored them <Col N="1285" /> and, in any case in which it thought fit, ruthlessly made use of the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act.  In fact the provisions of Acts providing for minimum penalties are simply set at nought by District Justices and Circuit Court judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We regard an offence under this section as being of a very serious nature.  It is bound up intimately with the whole insurance section of the Act.  After all the whole question of insurance will depend on the information that will go to form the declaration to be made to the insurance company.  If the whole basis of insurance is to be falsified, if the information is to be false and misleading, and deliberately so, then the whole machinery breaks down.  This only applies in a case where a person deliberately makes a false statement. It does not relate to a person who unknowingly misleads the insurance company.  As Deputy Dillon has stated it is a great hardship on any family, respectable or otherwise, to have one of its members put in prison, but if we do not make the provisions of this Act very secure and if we do not make it a very grave offence for people to give false information of this kind, the consequences may be very serious.  We are not here to press for any undue hardship on anybody in connection with this Bill.  We want to try to get the views of the House.  If the House considers this an unduly harsh penalty, I certainly would be prepared to consider the matter again but from what I know of the views of those who have been concerned with the drafting of the Bill, and who are concerned with the administration of it, I can say that they are strongly of opinion that it should remain as it is.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider accepting the amendment on the clear understanding that if, after a year's experience of it or some period like that, it became apparent that this crime was prevalent he would approach the House again for powers to make the penalty imprisonment?  I do not quite follow whether Deputy Costello agreed with me that to withdraw the discretion from the judge is a fundamentally <Col N="1286" /> bad principle.  There is no necessity for me to recapitulate what I have already said.  The thing is so dangerous and might work such hardship in particular cases, that unless a reasonable case can be made for it it should not be proceeded with.  I suggest that if the Minister makes this concession now, no difficulty will be placed in his way if he decides to introduce an amending Bill to restore the original penalty if he finds that his leniency was making the administration of the Act impossible.</P>

The District Court deals with much more serious offences than this.  The Minister said that the punishment would be only inflicted in case false information was deliberately supplied.  One might find a case where a person would find it difficult to disprove that it was false.  Suppose one got compensation for an accident which escaped one's memory.  You can imagine the prosecution saying: &ldquo;Well, did you not get a cheque, was that not in your mind and should you not have remembered that?&rdquo; As against what Deputy Mulcahy says, I would point out that this is a clause which has been in operation in Northern Ireland for some years and the experience has been that premiums have been reduced as a result of it.  It has not been worked against insurance companies. They have not been compelled to raise premiums as a result of any statements made to them in applications for policies.</P>

    <P>(d)  any person who is refused a licence by reason of his failure to pass any test of competency or fitness carried out in accordance <Col N="1291" /> with the provisions of this Part of the Act, shall be entitled to appeal to the District Justice Court against such refusal, after giving previous notice to the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I do not want to waste any time over this.  This amendment is in the same form as one I proposed on the previous Bill, of which the then Minister said, I believe, that he admitted the justice of it and was prepared to try to embody it at a later stage.  I would ask the present Minister to consider whether this right of appeal is not a thing which should be permitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was considered and, while there is no right of appeal there is, in fact, always an appeal to the Department.  There are at present appeals under the Motor Law to the Department, and every case that comes up gets very patient and careful hearing and consideration. It might also go to the senior officer of the Gárda, and if an individual failed there it would probably go to some Deputy, who would take it up perhaps with the officials of the Department, and while in law there is no appeal, there are, in fact, several appeals, and it is very unlikely that any case of hardship would arise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment on similar lines was brought forward here on a previous occasion.  It was then suggested, as I now suggest, that normally the Gárda Síochána does not include a person or persons properly qualified to carry out the work intended to be carried out by this section.  The Irish Trade Union Congress, at its annual meetings for some years past, has been making a demand along the lines contained in this amendment.  I understood it was the intention of certain unions to make direct representations to the Minister in connection with this matter.  I am not in a position to say what happened. I believe it is only right and proper that the Minister, when carrying out this section, should have at his disposal a person or persons skilled in the body-building industry who would, as <Col N="1293" /> a result of their skill and experience, be considered the most proper and suitable persons for a duty of this kind.

They are qualified to carry out the examinations that are required; they are competent to deal with the mechanical and other aspects of vehicles.  While that is so, I quite admit that it is necessary to have expert knowledge and I am ready to accept the amendment, but not exactly in the form in which it is here.  We will have an amendment embodying that principle drafted for the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 33:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 90 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any person who is the driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle in respect of which no public service vehicle licence is in force and who takes up and carries passengers whether for reward or otherwise (save as excepted by Section 90 of this Act) on such vehicle, shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds for a first offence, or in the case of a second or subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds.</P>
      <P>(2)  This section shall not apply in the case of a driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle who is the owner of such vehicle and who takes up and carries as passengers on such vehicle members of his family or his employees or where an employee of such owner is the driver of such vehicle such employee may take up and carry on such vehicle as passengers members of the family of his employer or other such employees: provided that in such cases not more than one person is allowed to occupy a seat beside the driver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first sight, this amendment may seem to be antagonistic to amendment 34, but the fact is that the amendments are dealing with two different matters. This amendment seeks to prevent the improper use of a commercial vehicle while being used for commercial work purely.  The other amendment deals with a vehicle from the point of view that, when not used for commercial work, it may be used in order to carry parties to Gaelic matches.  I want to <Col N="1295" /> provide that lorries, motor vans, and other commercial vehicles, when travelling on the public road, shall be prohibited from taking up unauthorised passengers and from giving people lifts from place to place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>For reward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>For or without reward. For instance, a lorry driver might engage in conversation with a man, whom he would then take for a lift. The result is that the driver of the vehicle does not properly mind his job.  He will probably stop at the nearest public-house and the two of them will have a drink.  That occurs several times in the course of the journey until finally, the passenger reaches his destination.  The driver in that case is really neglecting his employer's work and he is using his employer's vehicle in an improper manner.  He is putting on the employer a very serious liability which is not generally recognised.  For instance, if there is an accident to the vehicle, and there are personal injuries, the person carried as an unauthorised passenger has a claim against the owner of the vehicle, and he may claim very serious damages.</P>
      <P>If the person taken up happens to be a lady&mdash;and girls are frequently taken up in these lorries by the drivers &mdash;there is a serious temptation to waste the driver's time.  One of the reasons why I am forced to bring forward an amendment of this sort is that in Cork last year we had a case where the driver of a motor vehicle had ladies as passengers.  He wasted his employer's time.  There were two cases where such parties went to the Cork Fair one evening; they were late going home, and one of these men killed two ladies on the way home.  That man is still, I believe, in jail.  That shows you the danger that exists in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very much impressed by the Minister's introductory remarks.  He said it was his object to secure the safety of public life.  Another case occurs to my mind.  A little boy was taken up by a lorry driver in order <Col N="1296" /> to show him the way to a certain place.  The boy fell off, was killed, and the owner was mulcted in very serious damages.  It is on that account and because of the grievous waste of time on the part of drivers, that I am induced to bring this amendment forward.  I think drivers should be forbidden to take unauthorised passengers on their lorries.</P>
    <P>The second portion of the amendment is partly a corollary of the first. There would be an exception made where the driver would be carrying fellow employees, provided he would not carry more than three.  Carrying more than two persons at the front of the lorry is also dangerous.  Deputy Moore will understand the point I have in mind here.  Several accidents last year were caused by over-crowding in the front of the lorry, the result being that the driver had not proper control of the gears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the object of the Bill is to regulate road traffic so as to reduce the casualties that occur.  I am strongly of opinion, however, that the Deputy's amendment is altogether too drastic, and could not be worked.  It would make it impossible for example, for a person, a driver of a motor car, even to take up a person who would meet with an accident and who might need immediate hospital attention.  It would make it illegal for that driver to take an injured person to hospital, even though the person might be dangerously ill.  One portion of the amendment would make it impossible for the driver of a car to take up his own employer; he might take up some of his own family, but not his own employer.  However, I know the Deputy did not intend it, but as it is drafted it certainly goes too far; it is too drastic, and it would be absolutely impossible to work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is condemning it from extreme cases.  The cases I mentioned were not extreme or exceptional.  They are everyday cases.  The cases which the Minister raises as objections where the driver could not take up his employer are cases that could be got over.  I would <Col N="1297" /> ask the Minister to take into account the matters I have raised and to give them some attention.  I would ask him to consider the evils and dangers I have pointed out.  If he does that he will meet my case.  With the implied promise of the Minister, I beg for leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 34:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána in any district may, where he is satisfied that such provision is necessary owing to lack of public service vehicles, grant to the owner of a mechanically propelled vehicle a licence for each occasion to use such vehicle for the conveyance of the members of a hurling or football team who do not exceed twenty in number and who are travelling to engage in an entertainment promoted by a club affiliated to or under the direct control of the Gaelic Athletic Association, which entertainment consists solely of games ordinarily contested out of doors, and the issue of such licence shall not be deemed to render such mechanically propelled vehicle a public service vehicle within the meaning of the Act merely by reason of its being <Col N="1298" /> used under and in accordance with such licence for the conveyance of such teams for reward.</P>
    <P>I will not take up the time of the House beyond pointing out that it is a practice of the Gaelic clubs in this country to utilise lorries for the conveyance of teams.  It is only the teams we have in view when we ask for the acceptance of this amendment and it is chiefly to facilitate teams in rural parts of this country getting to the different venues for football and hurling matches.  I trust the Minister will accept the amendment and meet the wishes of the G.A.A. in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this amendment, I wish to stress, for the information of the Minister and the House, that it is intended to apply to districts where there are no regular bus or train services for the conveyance of teams to central matches.  We have had resolutions adopted by more than one all-Ireland G.A.A. congress and applications sent to the Governments in office.  But we found that the Government were statutorily prevented from meeting the wishes of the G.A.A. in this respect.  The safeguards set forth in this amendment ought to satisfy the House and satisfy the Minister that there would be no abuse.  I want again to point out that the concession we ask for is in respect of teams only, twenty members constituting the team.  In respect of actual competitions there would be no abuses whatever with these safeguards. Our activities extend into every area in the country.  Our members are drawn from the ordinary plain people whose financial resources are not unlimited.  The amendment would help them in this respect also.  As drafted, the amendment explains itself pretty well and I bespeak for it a favourable reception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not vote for anything in this House which would in any way hamper the activities of the G.A.A.  When proposals were before this House on previous occasions I think I gave evidence of that by my vote.  I would like, however, to ask the movers of the amendment <Col N="1299" /> whether it would not be possible for them under existing legislation to hire vehicles at a reasonable rate, as is done by many clubs.  I mean vehicles that are licensed for the purpose.  I know it is possible to get special rates of charges from bus companies.  Would that meet the situation that the amendment purposes to meet?  I put that query to the movers as to whether they have endeavoured to meet the needs of the teams in that respect and to what extent they have been met by the people concerned.  Deputy Gibbons has greater knowledge and experience of football and hurling in recent years I am sure than I have, but I am aware, and I am sure he is aware, that lorries are being used to carry passengers in places where trains and bus services are available.  I think it is wrong that lorries that are not licensed for the purpose of carrying passengers should be allowed to carry these people for profit.  I think that is pretty unfair in the case of lorries that are not licensed.  I have raised that point because I am sure Deputy Gibbons realises that that has been going on, and has been going on to the disadvantage of people licensed and paying heavy duty for their buses and also to the considerable disadvantage of the railway companies in areas where hurling and football are played.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment be accepted by the Minister I intend, on Report Stage, to move a further amendment.  I will do so for two reasons.  The first reason has been mentioned by Deputy Davin.  The second reason which, perhaps, I should have placed first, as it appears the more important, is that I cannot understand the insularity of mind behind the amendment.  That is that the advantage must be passed on to only one association in this country, namely the G.A.A.  I am a strong admirer of the G.A.A., but I am not so insularly minded as to suggest that the same kind of protection and the same kind of encouragement should not be given to the followers of other games.  If Deputy Gibbons were to alter his amendment so that it would read in <Col N="1300" /> such a way as to embrace other athletic clubs, instead of confining it to clubs affiliated to or under the direct control of the G.A.A., I would be in favour of the amendment.  In East Cork, at Cobh, for instance, an event comes off every year on the 15th day of August. This attracts very large numbers of people not only from Cork County but places beyond Cork County.  I am aware that for that day the facilities which Deputy Davin suggests can easily be got for taking many thousands of people travelling to Cobh over the system run by the railway company to Cobh.  But there are thousands of people who have no means of getting to this annual event except by the methods suggested in this amendment.  I suggest that Deputy Gibbons and those associated with him in drafting this amendment should, at this hour of the day, have regard to the fact that there are other games played in the country and games to which the same facilities should be extended as are now extended to the G.A.A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I am sorry that Deputy Anthony is bringing the old, not exactly red herring, but the old vengeance he has always displayed in this House towards the Gaelic Athletic Association, into this matter.  Practically 80 per cent. of the teams engaged in hurling and football come from country parishes.  They have not the facilities of which Deputy Davin speaks.  They cannot hire a bus for the day to take them from Cobh to Rathcormac or any other part of East Cork to play a hurling or football match.  What usually happens is: a shopkeeper of the town or village lends them his lorry for the day. Unfortunately, this Bill finishes that kind of convenience.  It will mean, if this amendment is not carried, that about 30 per cent. of the rural hurling and football clubs will be knocked out of existence.  The members of these teams have not a great deal of money to spare and they cannot afford to hire special buses.  They are working boys who have only one day in the week free&mdash;Sunday.</P>

      <P>In supporting Deputy Davin's attitude, I should like to ascertain from the Minister how this provision squares with the general line of legislation as regards the organisation of passenger-carrying services and goods-carrying services.  If facilities like these are to be provided for the followers of a certain line of athletics could not similar facilities be more reasonably claimed by those who organise feiseanna and educational festivals of one kind or another? Could they not be claimed by bodies of that kind which are widespread in their organisation, and which engage in educational work?  Could they not be claimed by dramatic societies and by pipers bands, apart from the claims that might reasonably be made by persons following other kinds of athletics or by hiking bodies who wanted to get over rather flat parts of the country and get away into the mountains?  I should like to have an answer to these questions from the Minister.  Before an amendment like this is accepted, the Minister, and particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, should give the House an idea as to how it cuts across the whole general policy with regard to the organisation of our transport.</P>

      <P>I do not quite agree with Deputy Mulcahy in his alarm lest this should cut across general policy.  As Deputy Jordan and Deputy Gibbons said, the circumstances governing these cases are peculiar.  It usually happens that a team representing a parish or some such area wants to get to the scene of a football match.  Unlike a feis or some gathering of that character, there would probably be no general traffic going.  It would be out of the question for a small parish team to raise sufficient money to hire a bus. Very often, a local shopkeeper, or somebody with a local interest in the <Col N="1303" /> team, places a lorry at very reduced rates, or perhaps gratis, at their disposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Frequently, gratis.  I should not at all approve of making this general or spreading it out to feiseanna or other activities, because it is up to organising committees of feiseanna to arrange for omnibuses and so forth if they want to bring a crowd together.  What astonishes me about a very reasonable amendment of this character is the effect it has on Deputy Jordan and Deputy Gibbons. Deputy Jordan is a good-humoured man and so is Deputy Gibbons.  But when they set their hands to a pen to prepare an amendment of this character, they immediately get cranky. Why?  What evil effect has their association with the G.A.A. upon them?  Most of these G.A.A. men up and down the country are good-humoured men and pleasant men to meet.  But nobody seems to be able to draft an amendment which refers to the G.A.A. without hitting somebody else.  What is the point of that? Surely, if you are making this little concession to promote athletics, you should not leave out the National Athletic and Cycling Association or the Association Football teams or any other legitimate athletic club which would desire to enjoy a similar privilege.  If you are sending a team to a cycling competition or sending a team to represent a parish in a cross country race, why on earth should they be marked with the seal of the G.A.A.'s disapproval?  What a much better feeling it would create if Deputy Gibbons and Deputy Jordan, who represent the G.A.A., would show themselves solicitous for the N.A.C.A. and every other athletic organisation, at the same time?  Instead of having this rather regrettable note of acrimony and laurels laid upon their brow by Deputy Corry for their good national spirit, they would get pretty general support all over the House.  I think it is regrettable the way in which this amendment is moved and I would <Col N="1304" /> be very much gratified to hear from the Minister that, if Deputy Jordan withdraws the amendment and redrafts it to include athletic teams to represent their parish or district, no matter whether they were G.A.A. or N.A.C.A. or any other athletic association, he would favourably consider an amendment on those lines on the Report Stage. I do not believe, and I really do not think Deputy Davin believes, that this is going to have any serious effect on the ordinary carrying companies. We all know in practice what this amounts to, and it is not going to interfere with the traffic of the railway companies or the authorised bus undertakings. If this concession is not made some of these people will not go and the rest will borrow bicycles.</P>

      <P>I should like to associate myself with this amendment.  It seems to me that this is a specific section, and as regards the paucity or the lack of facilities for other organisations let the other organisations speak for themselves.  This is a specific sub-section drafted for the G.A.A.  If Deputies opposite are so <Col N="1305" /> anxious to know why Deputies on this side are so solicitous for the welfare of the G.A.A., let me tell them straight that but for the G.A.A. the bulk of them or of us would not be occupying these benches.  That is the reason why the amendment is specifically devoted to the G.A.A.  Let the other bodies speak for themselves.  If the principle of this is right in so far as it is confined to the subject under discussion, that is all we have to deal with now.  Other bodies are well able to speak for themselves.  The facilities afforded to the members of the G.A.A. to travel to various centres through the country are sometimes extremely restricted and, as has been pointed out by members of the Centre Party and others, the local traders are sometimes compelled to run lorries gratis. This is not meant to cut across or in any way to be inimical to the bus companies or the railway companies. It is meant to apply only to specific instances.  There are hosts of poor fellows who could not possibly club together to get a bus or pay the small fare necessary to travel on the train. They must, perforce, travel on a lorry. This is, therefore, a specific case.  As regards other organisations, such as ploughing matches and Feiseanna, there is no analogy.  I should like to explain that G.A.A. matches are carried on practically all the year round, while Feiseanna are confined to the fine weather and ploughing to half-a-dozen matches.  The activities to which this sub-section refers are carried on all the year round.  As regards other athletic organisations I think Deputy Anthony said the same conditions were applicable to Rugby Clubs, etc.  I do not wish to allude to other associations, but my experience is that those associated with Rugby Clubs are very well able to pay for vehicles.  Consequently, I have much pleasure in associating myself with the amendment.</P>

After all, who can tell what will happen to the G.A.A.? <Col N="1306" /> Perhaps one section of it some years hence may wish to break off from the parent body, may consider the parent body is not sufficiently patriotic, for heaven knows what reason.  It is undesirable that we should be called upon here in the Legislature of this country to put the whole resources of the country at the back of one particular athletic association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is accepting the proposal I hope he will at least fix some standard of safety. It is a very big responsibility for the Dáil on an occasion when they are discussing a Bill to secure the safety of life on the roads and when there has been so much emphasis laid on that to declare at the same time with regard to Sunday traffic that they are prepared not to worry; that vehicles can be used regardless of their efficiency, regardless of the safety which they will provide.  I am not speaking against the principle of the proposal, though I would certainly ask the Minister if he accepts it to extend it at least to bands.  I may say that while I have had several applications from bands I have never received an application from the G.A.A. to get the privilege of travelling on a lorry on a Sunday to fulfil an engagement.  If the Minister is accepting the proposal I hope he will see that there will be a certain standard of safety laid down and that the Superintendent of the Gárda Síochana or somebody like that will be responsible for ensuring that the vehicle used will be up to a certain standard of safety.  It is known that last year there were two serious accidents to vehicles which should never have been put on the road but were used to convey parties, one to Dublin during Congress Week&mdash;I think everyone will recall the serious accident near Maynooth&mdash;and another travelling to a G.A.A. match in Kildare.  I do not think the Dáil should take the responsibility of saying with regard to traffic that may prevail in rural places on Sundays that they do not care what type of vehicle is used and that the people themselves will have to take the responsibility.</P>

      <P>I should like to <Col N="1307" /> say that the remarks we have heard on this are a very curious commentary on the unanimity with which, say, the proposals in the Road Transport Bill are being gulped down on the far side. The proposal before us now is to enable a trader, who under the Road Transport Bill is going to be prevented from carrying a parcel for a neighbour from his own place to some place else, to bring an athletic team on a particular occasion from one place to another.  I should like to know what the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Local Government think of the proposal. I may say in reply to Deputy Dillon that teachers do bring groups of children from one school area to another school area to Feiseanna, and if facilities of this kind are to be made available for a hurling or a football team, I think that a group of children going to a Féis and taking part in educational competitions are entitled to get the same facilities as some of the Deputies on the far side would hold out so readily and invitingly to athletic clubs of a particular kind, and that the same thing ought to apply to a rural dramatic company going to give a performance in some neighbouring village or town.  Those are only samples of the kind of demands that could readily arise once this principle is admitted, to say nothing of the demands that are going to arise from traders to be allowed to carry their neighbours' parcels, in, of course, very special circumstances.</P>

      <P>I do not want to allow Deputy Mulcahy to misrepresent any view given expression to by me.  I am, personally, quite prepared, as I have done on previous occasions in this House, to justify preferential treatment&mdash;by vote or in any other way&mdash; for games that are looked upon as national games in this country.  I have endeavoured to do it before, and will do it again when the opportunity arises, irrespective of what Deputy Dillon or Deputy MacDermot or anybody else may think.  I am quite sure that this amendment, limited in operation as it is in its wording here, is not <Col N="1308" /> going to do any serious harm to the transport industry.  Deputy Gibbons and Deputy Jordan, who are leaders of the G.A.A. in this country at present, know that a very large percentage of men working in the transport industry have done more than one man's part for the G.A.A.  What I want an assurance upon is this: I am personally aware of numerous cases where lorry owners have charged young men in the country so much per head for bringing them to hurling and football matches, and were not licensed for that particular purpose.  I do not want any man who has not a licence for the carrying of passengers to make a profit out of this kind of thing.  I think if that were accepted by the majority in this House it would certainly be very detrimental to the people engaged in the transport business.  The people engaged in the transport business are there to make a living out of that particular business, the same as people engaged in farming or in any other occupation.  It is not right that pirates should be allowed to come into the industry, and, under cover of an amendment of this kind, make money out of their lorries which are not licensed for the carrying of passengers.  I want an assurance from Deputy Gibbons&mdash;I am sure he can give that assurance&mdash;that the G.A.A. are not going to put their hallmark upon the use of lorries not licensed for the carrying of passengers for the purpose of making profit out of them in connection with the running of hurling and football matches.</P>

If anything of that kind, therefore, were intended I would not accept the amendment, but I am prepared to accept it in principle and to apply it not alone for G.A.A. purposes, but all other purposes such as Deputy Mulcahy mentioned.  We had a case brought to our notice where in one parish in Donegal people had something like seven miles to go to Mass, and had no way of getting there on a wet day except on a lorry lent by some friendly neighbour.

In those conditions I am prepared to accept this amendment, and leave it to an authority of that kind to give us an assurance that there is no other transport facility available.

I can give that assurance with a full sense of responsibility. There seems to be a misconception in the minds of several Deputies.  This amendment, as drafted, tightens up the giving of licences very considerably. It applies only to teams, not to followers or supporters of teams, and the number is set forth as 20.  That is the official number which constitutes a team.  It is restricted also to official legitimate competitions conducted under the auspices of the G.A.A.  It is intended to meet cases that crop up very frequently, particularly in remote districts where there are no other facilities of transport for the teams. I think it is a very fair amendment, and one which I am sorry aroused so much opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I want to draw attention to sub-section (4):&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whenever a mechanically propelled vehicle is used for the carriage of passengers for reward in contravention of this section the owner of such vehicle shall be guilty of an offence under this section and the driver of such vehicle shall, unless he proves that he did not know that no public service vehicle licence was then in force in respect of such vehicle, also be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to explain why the driver has to take responsibility for an offence which is an offence solely of the owner of the vehicle. Why attempt to divide responsibility? What is gained by it? Surely it is a tremendous injustice to the driver. Employment is not such that a driver on a public service vehicle can feel so independent as to challenge his employer to show the licence and that he can argue for a moment on the question.  If he has doubts as to whether he can argue the matter or not, his decision depends on whether the employer is an amiable person or whether he is inclined to be autocratic. If he is not an amiable person he can very quickly get rid of the driver and make him sorry that he dared question whether a licence was in existence.  I ask the House is it fair to put a driver in this position? He has got to risk the displeasure which may result in his being dismissed from his position in order to comply with this provision when the responsibility should really rest solely on the owner of the vehicle. There must be some explanation for this curious provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> Then again, in Section 93, it is even more absurd, but I suppose there is some explanation for it because it was discussed here before.  At the same time, I cannot remember when discussing it before that there was one reason advanced in favour of the principle. I would expect a very satisfactory explanation indeed before we would vote for such a curious principle&mdash;on a principle which would mean that a number of people who have been a long time waiting for jobs and now having got them, may lose them within a week or even a day after getting them simply because they must challenge their masters, with regard to their masters' duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of dual responsibility in this Bill is mainly to ensure that there would be no possibility of evading its provisions.  If the driver is released from any responsibility in the matter it might be possible for an arrangement to be entered into between the driver and the employer to put the onus upon the driver in the event of a prosecution taking place, the owner pleading that the driver had been liable under the Act if it were amended, as the Deputy suggests.  Under this section it is a good defence for the driver to prove that he considered the licence had been issued, but the obligation is upon him to prove that.  If he does prove it, he has a good defence.  If he cannot prove it, he is held to be equally liable for having broken the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that that seems a hopelessly unsatisfactory defence of such an extraordinary provision. Further, taking it at its face value, is the Minister going to provide that the employee will be compensated in the event of his sacrificing a day's employment in order to prove his innocence.  Will he provide that the employee can engage counsel, and if it is proved that the employee acted innocently that he will not be responsible for these legal expenses?  In my opinion there is nothing to be said in support of the principle and I will certainly vote against it.</P>

If he takes out the lorry with the consent of the owner, and it is an offence, as he is likely to do under this particular section, then there is a dual prosecution and he is brought to court to give evidence against his employer.  I see there is double danger there for the driver also.  By bringing the driver into a position of dual responsibility, as suggested in this amendment, it looks as if he is going to lose his job one way or the other.</P>

      <P>It is clear that this section does not really relate to lorries at all&mdash;only omnibuses.  I cannot imagine a case where the driver would be likely to be required to engage in the driving of an omnibus for which a licence had not been issued without his knowing it.  If such a situation did arise he has a good defence, and he is not liable to conviction under this section. But if he does know there is no licence for it and, nevertheless, takes it out for the conveyance of passengers, then he must share responsibility with the owner.  In any event it is quite clear you open the door wide to evasion of the Act if you omit to place responsibility on the driver as well as on the employer.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister no pity at all for the unfortunate wretch who is out of employment for two years and goes into a job after waiting all that time?  This happened within the last two months.  I know a man who got into employment as the driver of a bus.  Now he is a week or so in his employment and everyone knows that there is a certain nervousness for the first few weeks at all events, and very often much longer; he is afraid of his life something will happen which will deprive him of his employment again, and he knows the horrors of unemployment at this time only too well.  He has got then to brave his master and tell him he does not believe his story; that there is no licence for this vehicle, and he must make his master produce the licence.  Supposing the master admits there is no licence and says: &ldquo;We will risk it, it is a very special occasion and the guards will not observe us,&rdquo; he must say: &ldquo;No, I would rather be dismissed, because the law punishes me just as it punishes you.&rdquo;  Surely, it would not be fair to put an unfortunate man in that position. Then he is offered no compensation. There is no provision by which he can recover any damages from his master.  There is no attempt to pay his expenses in connection with the matter.  I think it is outrageous.</P>

I was not going to make representations in the case unless I got the matter in writing, <Col N="1315" /> or any information which would enable the Minister to satisfy himself that these people were not operating under the 1932 Act.  I suggest to the Minister if the driver of the lorry or owner of the bus comes along, and if under the terms of this Bill he wants to make a complaint in connection with the matter and was satisfied he was not carrying out all the condition of the Bill fear would prevent him lest he would lose his job. It is the fear of losing their jobs which prevents drivers from coming forward and giving information against the owners.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister hold that the passengers would be safe by having the responsibility put upon the driver?  It would be difficult to do that.  I alluded to the same principle in Section 93 where, if a plate seems to have the serial numbers defaced, it is the drivers' duty to object and to tell his master that he will not take out the vehicle unless a better plate is put on. Does not the Minister admit that this case is almost certain to arise?  The master may tell the driver: &ldquo;You do not think that the Guards are looking for prosecutions.  We are prepared to take the risk.  We have no other plates.&rdquo;  The driver is told to go ahead.  Does not the Minister realise that that is likely to take place?  Does he want the unfortunate driver to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; and lose his job?  That is expecting too much.</P>

      <P>I suggest that we will get on much better if we discuss one section at a time.  This section relates to the driver of a public service vehicle which has not been licensed.  If a driver knowingly co-operates with an <Col N="1316" /> employer in having such a vehicle utilised for the conveyance of passengers then he should not be exempted from responsibility or released from the punishment for such an offence. We are not putting the responsibility on the driver instead of the owner, as Deputy Moore suggests.  We are putting it on the owner as well as the driver and the prime consideration must be the public safety.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might now get some hope from the Minister, having regard to the fact that he said that he <Col N="1317" /> preferred to have Sections 90 and 93 discussed separately.  Has the Minister considered the injustice with regard to the very small offences indicated in Section 93, offences which certainly will not affect the safety of passengers and the public?  The unfortunate driver, at all events, should not be asked to lose his job by opposing his employer's wishes and telling him that he is not prepared to take the risk of taking out the vehicle if the plates are defaced.  Does the Minister hold that there is any reason whatever for such a situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Deputy to consider the case from the other point of view.  He is assuming that the owner would be entirely responsible for the fact that the plate was obscured or defaced, and that consequently the driver should not be held to be blameworthy.  But the reverse might be the case.  The driver might have removed, obscured or defaced the plate, and surely in such case the driver, and not the owner, should be held responsible.  The purpose of the section is to hold both responsible and to ensure that the plate is not defaced or obscured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly disagree there.  I think the driver would be responsible to the employer.  Why hold the driver responsible to the public?  I think that would be an outrageous thing when the employer knows that he is responsible for the vehicle and for its safety.  We are not making the driver responsible for negligent driving where the damages recovered are recovered from the owner.  Why make the driver responsible when the owner may refuse to supply a new plate, having said that he is prepared to take the risk?  No matter how it may happen the driver has as much responsibility as the employer.  I think that is a new principle, and a shocking principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that this Bill does not deprive the individual of his remedy for negligent driving.  It gives a statutory remedy to the injured <Col N="1318" /> person against the proprietor of the vehicle.  Surely the Deputy will consider the question from the point of view of the owner of a vehicle who takes every precaution to see that the plate is as it should be.  For the purposes of illustration, let me take an extreme case&mdash;that of a driver who deliberately desires to drive recklessly, to break the law, and who, for his own purpose, deliberately obscures the plate.  Why make the proprietor liable for that, and discharge the driver from all trouble?  Surely that would not be equitable or prudent.  Would it not be a licence to the driver to obscure the plate, to do anything he liked, and to leave him free of all responsibility? The sensible thing is to make both parties liable and to leave it to the court to decide the burden of punishment. Leave it to the discretion of the court to deal with the driver and the owner fairly and equitably, after taking into consideration the respective guilt of the parties.  If the driver makes the case that his employer told him to go out and to break the law, or that otherwise he would sack him, no judge is going to penalise that man heavily or to make his position intolerable.  On the contrary, discretion would be used and the penalty would be placed on the owner.  If a respectable owner tells the court that he saw the plate, that it was in perfect condition when the omnibus went out, and that the driver deliberately spread oil on it, surely the judge would measure the penalty in accordance with the guilt by penalising the driver, and excusing the owner?  That would be justice.  Unless judges are fools they are not going to penalise savagely the unfortunate drivers.</P>

      <P>Why are offences of that kind picked out for special treatment? Cases dealing with the handling of vehicles generally by the driver will not come before the courts.  They are matters between the employee and the owner.  When doing up a vehicle before he takes it out, a man who is expected to deface a plate, if he is so inclined, can cause injury to the engine so that it will break down&mdash;if we are supposing him to have that criminal intention with regard to his master's vehicle. Deputy Dillon missed the point entirely.  He thought that my principal aim was to prevent the man being brought into court.  My principal aim is to prevent him from losing his employment.  My point is that, if the employer is prepared to take the risk, the driver should not be expected to say to his master: &ldquo;No, I will not take out the car even though my refusal may involve my dismissal.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On the section, the only point I want to raise is that if those vehicles are not licensed, and if they are in possession of certain persons, there is a certain confiscation taking place of public property.  Can there be any consideration given to that matter?  I understand that some of those people are not people of very considerable means and, in certain cases, it may be that it is their entire livelihood, and it might not possibly pay to have a conductor on a small vehicle of that kind.  Could there be any arrangement made whereby the life of a car would be allowed to be worked out and no future licence given in respect of another vehicle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that it is not the practice to carry conductors on buses larger than 14 seaters.  It is undoubtedly correct that on the 14 seater buses the driver acts in the double capacity of driver and conductor. That will still be the case.  This <Col N="1325" /> only applies to vehicles of larger size &mdash;22 and 32 seater buses.  It would not be easy for the driver on these to act also as conductor.  For one thing, they carry a larger number of passengers than the smaller buses, and as a rule, they are entered from the back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there vehicles at the present time with more than 14 seats not carrying conductors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there are very many.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister look into that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Apart from the fact whether there are or not, I feel that for the larger type of vehicle a conductor is essential.  For one thing, on the larger buses a conductor is required to look after the passengers. The door is usually at the back of the vehicle, while on the smaller buses it is at the front.  On the larger buses a conductor is necessary to give the driver signals when to start and to stop as well as to signal to traffic coming behind when the bus proposes to turn.  On these larger buses a conductor is essential not merely for the safety of those using the road but also for the safety of the passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle.  I am a child in these matters as I have never travelled on a bus.  I accept what the Minister says, but, having regard to what I have pointed out, I think some consideration ought to be given for the life of the bus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will remember that since the Road Transport Act came into operation licences for public service vehicles have only been given to those who have undertaken not merely to preserve the service with the degree of efficiency that existed at the time the licence was given, but to improve it and also the efficiency of the vehicles on the service.  If they allow their buses to deteriorate, become old or unsafe, then, apart from whatever penalties may be imposed under this measure, they are liable to suffer the withdrawal of their licence under the Road Transport Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that in crowded areas such as cities it is not advisable to have buses under the control of only one man, but in rural areas where the conditions would not be at all as exacting it might be advisable to relax the regulations in that connection somewhat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in the rural areas is that apart from one or two omnibus services which operate in isolated districts all the omnibuses are now railway-owned over the greater part of the country.  Apart from a few services running into Cork and one in Galway the Great Southern system&mdash; the I.O.C. buses&mdash;is really the only one operating at the moment.  These are all large omnibuses and the company should be able to supply the staff provided here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will understand that in areas where the population is small and the distances covered not very great, while it would not pay to run a large bus it might pay to run a smaller one, and just because the larger bus does not pay there is no bus run at all, with the result that the people do not get the convenience to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The 14-seater bus is the ordinary small bus that one sees running in the city.  There is no obligation to carry a conductor on it.  The next size of bus is generally the 20 to 22 seater.  That is a substantially larger vehicle, and usually has the door at the back.  It would certainly require a conductor, both for the safety of the passengers and the public generally. Then there is the 32-seater bus on which a conductor is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I travelled on a bus not many weeks ago on the other side&mdash; a 20 seater&mdash;which was controlled by one man.  He controlled the door, which was almost opposite him, by a <Col N="1327" /> lever in his box.  I think the Minister ought to consider taking powers in order to deal with cases such as I have mentioned&mdash;a case, say, where a larger bus would not pay and where it might be advisable to instal a small bus.  He should take power to deal with the 14 to 20-seater vehicle.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 115.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 46:-</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 47, to insert after the word &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and the motoring organisations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As Deputies know we have in this State motoring organisations which serve a very useful purpose.  They erect signs on our roads and they give a lot of useful advice.  I suggest that it would be a very useful thing to make provision in this section that motoring organisations such as the A.A. should be consulted in the making of by-laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ordinary course motor organisations of the kind the Deputy has in mind would be consulted in the preparation of by-laws of this kind, but it is obviously highly undesirable that such consultation should be made a matter of statutory obligation.  If that were the case it might, in fact, be necessary to prove consultation before the by-law could be admitted as valid.  Apart from that the term which the Deputy uses in his amendment is a rather wide one.  It might cover a lot more than the particular organisation to which he referred.  It is a very wide phrase <Col N="1328" /> indeed.  If we were to include it we might find an organisation in some part of the country that no one ever heard of before coming forward and objecting to the validity of certain bye-laws on the ground that it was not consulted.  As I have said, it would be the practice to consult these organisations in the preparation of the bye-laws. It is very advisable to leave it at that and not to attempt to make it a matter of statutory obligation.</P>

      <P>(7) For the purposes of this section, the expression &ldquo;public service vehicles&rdquo; shall include tramcars.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to empower the Commissioner to regulate the movement and stopping place of trams by the police.  From the by-laws that the Commissioner is empowered to make, tramcars are omitted, and, I think, the Minister will see the desirability of giving such power as is suggested in the amendment to the Commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

It has been moved as a result of consultation between the members of the Dublin Corporation and the officials of the Corporation, who have some responsibility for the stopping places of public vehicles. This amendment, and others of a similar nature, are the result of such consideration, and I hope the Minister will see his way to meet the borough representatives upon this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, I would refer to Section 145, which purports that the Commissioner may, with the consent of the Minister, make in respect of any tramway system by-laws for all or any of the following purposes, that is to say: (a) regulating the management of other vehicles in relation to tramway cars on such tramway <Col N="1329" /> system and in particular the conduct of such vehicles when overtaking a tramway car; (b) the places at which tramcars on such tramway system may stop to pick up or set down passengers; (c) the places at which intending passengers in such tramcars may congregate to await transport in such tramway cars.  I would ask the Deputies if that does not meet their point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In that section the county council or the municipality is not consulted.  The amendment that I am asking the Minister to accept gives power to consult the Commissioner as to the particular stopping places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is complicated by the fact that the tramways company has powers, under various private Acts and Statutes, all of which are administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce, and are not under the Department of Local Government.  To bring it in now, in the manner suggested, would complicate things very considerably, and would involve very substantial amendment of this Bill.  The Deputy may take it as reasonably certain that the Commissioner, in exercising his power under Section 145, will take into consideration any views that the local councils may submit in connection with the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister really sees the point which the municipal authorities have in mind.  Apart from the ordinary facilities that will be accorded in regulating traffic, the municipal council is engaged, almost continuously, on building operations, and so forth. They have to consider, in the clearing up of certain areas, that they may have to remove facilities in connection with public vehicles.  Bearing that in mind, they want to be consulted so that they might have some right, one <Col N="1330" /> way or the other, when occasion arises.  I assure the Minister these amendments are not put down except from the point of view of absolute necessity from the municipal side.  All sections of the municipal authority are satisfied that these amendments are essential in the public interest, and from the municipal point of view. They are not merely asking for rights because they are a public authority, but they are asking for them for the purpose of being able to work in with the police authorities in regulating traffic, so that it will be for the benefit or the State as a whole and the public in general.</P>

If the Minister would amend Section 145 in the way I suggest I think he will get over the difficulty he mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making such points at all.  It is clear that there is power to regulate where people may stop to get their trams; and as there <Col N="1331" /> is power to interfere in these matters, and as it is proposed to give the Commissioner power to make by-laws in connection with them, there is no reason why the Commissioner could not be forced to consult with the local authorities before making the by-laws.

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 58, to delete the words &ldquo;County Surveyor&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;County Council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to make the county councils, instead of the borough surveyors, the authority to be consulted by the Minister before approving of a road in the county for the purpose of an omnibus route.  As the sub-section provides for consultation between the Commissioner and the county surveyor in every urban district and county borough through which the road passes, the suggestion is that the council should similarly be the authority in the county to be consulted. Sub-section (2) definitely makes reference to the county surveyor as the authority to be consulted, and not the council, which is the employer of the county surveyor.  I think it will be agreed by everybody in this House that the council should have some right to be consulted as to a bus route which it is proposed to make and which may possibly entail a road being made through some new housing estate of theirs.  I think that the council should be consulted.</P>

      <P>I do not know why in this particular section the surveyor in Dublin should be picked out as distinct from the council, whereas the council is the authority in other areas. As Deputy Byrne has pointed out, the municipal authority after all is the ultimate authority.  It may have a surveyor or certain surveyors in its employment from time to time, but I think the Minister should indicate that this was not done with any intention of singling out the City of Dublin to deprive the council of its authority. Apart from the distinction which the Bill makes, the municipal council may appoint a second surveyor.  Which surveyor then is the Minister to consult? I think the Minister should leave us this authority in our own area.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 3, after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;after consultation with the road authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to provide that the Commissioner, in making by-laws for the control of traffic generally, should consult the road authority.  The suggestion of the Corporation that such consultation should take place has already been adopted by the Minister in Sections 115, 124, 146, 147 and 148 and the amendments in my name have had the consideration and approval of a committee of the municipal council.</P>

      <P>When the Bill was before the House on the previous occasion, similar amendments which were put up to many of these sections were suggested by the Corporation and wherever it was possible to secure that that consultation should be held with the local authorities in reference <Col N="1342" /> to regulations to be made, the necessary amendments were made in the Bill.  This section, however, deals with a type of regulations that would be made to govern the whole Saorstát and it would mean, therefore, that, in the case of every regulation, every road authority should be consulted. We do not think that that would be possible, but in all other cases in which regulations are being made concerning a particular district, Dublin, Cork, Galway, or wherever it may be, the road authority will be consulted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 55:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (3) to add the words &ldquo;and the cost to the council of erecting or providing such notices, instructions directions and instruments shall be paid from contributions to be made to the council from the Road Fund.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hope that this amendment will be acceptable to the Minister.  The object of it is to secure that the cost of providing notices, instructions, directions and instruments for giving signals by mechanical means for the regulation of traffic shall not be paid by the ratepayers of the district but shall be borne by contributions to be made to the local authority from the Road Fund.  Such expenses are properly payable from that fund rather than from the local rates.  We all see the day coming when mechanical signals for the direction of traffic will be used to a great extent in Dublin City.  These electrical robots will be asked for.  Personally, I am against too much machinery being used in anything and I would prefer, if it were possible, that man labour would be employed everywhere possible for the direction of traffic.  But, if in various outlying districts in which it might not be considered necessary to have a traffic constable, these electrical or mechanical devices are erected for directing traffic, the cost should not be borne by the ordinary ratepayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As you have a Road Fund being subscribed to by those using the mechanical devices to be erected under the Bill, we think that the Road <Col N="1343" /> Fund should bear the cost.  My own opinion is that we are getting too fond of machinery and I see the possibility of machinery displacing men, which is regrettable, but, when I raised that point in another place, I was informed that in big areas where traffic constables had to be employed, they will continue to be employed and that these signals might go up in districts where traffic constables are not already in employment.  I feel that I am appealing to a sympathetic Minister in this matter because he knows how heavy the burden of rates is on the city and, having regard to the fact that there is a substantial Road Fund in existence, I think it should bear the cost of those instruments.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (1) (e).</P>
      <P>Briefly, the amendment means that exception is taken to the payment of a fixed fee.  It is held by many that the fee payable to the attendant at these parking places should be a voluntary and not a fixed fee.  Under the proposal in the Bill the Minister will prepare a schedule of fixed fees to be paid to the attendants in parking places.  My intention is to leave it entirely optional with motor owners as to what their contribution will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If I remember correctly, I think this subject was discussed at considerable length on another occasion.  My recollection is that the consensus of opinion seemed to be that there should be a fee laid down.  That is our view.  The fee may not be a very large one, but there ought to be something definitely fixed and it should not be purely a voluntary matter.  We think there ought to be something in the way of a definite fixed fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree we discussed this matter at considerable length when the Bill was before us on a previous occasion.  There was a considerable variation of opinion on the subject.  I must admit that the consensus of opinion was with the Minister.  If he is still of the same opinion, there is scarcely any use in pressing the matter further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>How have the existing regulations worked?  At the present moment these parking attendants get entirely voluntary contributions. No doubt they are very generously paid by some people, and, I think, on the other hand, it is highly probable that there are persons who do not pay at all, who avail themselves of the attendants' services and do not contribute anything.  It seems to me there will be difficulties.  I submit for the consideration of the Minister that there may be great difficulties about <Col N="1346" /> fixing a fee.  If you fix a fee you must fix a very low one.  If a car stands in a place for five minutes, nobody would give anything except a comparatively small tip.  If a car were standing in a place for a couple of hours, I expect the ordinary person would give a reasonable tip.</P>
      <P>If you fix a scale you will have to fix it at the very minimum and, in consequence, a person whose car stands for ten minutes or for an hour will be charged the sum of twopence or threepence and the result might be that the attendants would finally lose heavily, because the motorist would give the fixed fee which might very often not be one quarter of what he would give if it were left to his own generosity.  I would rather like if the Guards ascertained the views of the parking attendants on this matter.  This proposal in the Bill may have the effect of cutting down the tips which are being received by the attendants&mdash;making them very much lower than they are at the moment. Except in some places, I know the attendants are not doing extraordinarily well.</P>

It was not a new idea here at all.  At that time they were worked by voluntary contributions in England and they were started here on the basis of voluntary contributions.  I suggest that the Minister would have a consultation with the Department of Justice on this question and ascertain the views of the Guards on the matter.

This is somewhat on the same lines as my amendment to Section 144 that any expenses in connection with the matter should be paid from contributions to be made to the council from the Road Fund.  This will benefit the public generally and the expense should be borne out of the contributions to be made to the local authority from the Road Fund.  I would like to have an assurance from the Minister on that matter.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot give any assurance to the Deputy with regard to this particular amendment. The idea of my Department is that all these various stations should pay for themselves.  The local authority will decide whether it is wise to have such stations put up and whether they will undertake the expense of keeping them in order.  If they do they should make them bear their own costs.  I am afraid that I could not promise the Deputy it would be borne out of the rates.</P>

The same would apply to a number of areas in and around the city.  These people would come from Dublin and places around it, and it would certainly be a hardship on the ratepayers of Howth and small areas like that to have to provide these conveniences.  If they do not provide them see what is likely to happen.  I would ask the Minister to give the matter consideration between now and the time when the Bill comes next before the House on Report Stage.

      <P>Railways which are in competition with the buses have to provide their own terminal stations, and if the railways have to provide their own terminal stations it is only fair that those in competition with the railways should have to carry similar obligations.  I agree with Deputy Byrne that it would be most unfair that citizens would have the obligation of providing accommodation for these bus companies.  I think some means ought to be provided whereby the burden of that expense would be taken off the city and thrown on to the bus users.  What I have in my mind at the moment is that in Scotland a number of people travel by steamer to different places.  Before they can get on to the steamer they have to pass through a gate at the pier, and at the gate at the pier there is a charge levied.  A somewhat similar arrangement might be made in this case so that the burden of maintaining and providing stations would fall on those using the stations. I think it is only fair that the obligation should be cast on them and not on the ordinary ratepayers of the city.</P>

      <P>I do not think so, but the Road Fund may be used for many other purposes.  I am only looking at the bus as a competing service with the railways.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment appears in my name although it is one of those suggested by and agreed to by the Municipal Council.  I received a communication on the 15th March from the City Manager's Office saying he was directed by the Housing and General Purposes Committee of Dublin City Council to enclose me a series of amendments which the Committee at its meeting the previous night decided to request members of the Council to support.  I looked through the amendments and, in my ignorance of the rules of the House, I left them in my pocket, thinking it would be just the time to move them when considering the Bill.  Afterwards, I thought that, having regard to the very severe forms of this institution of which I am a member at present, I had better make some inquiry.  I called at the office below and the clerk in charge told me that Deputy Byrne, whom you all know as the Lord Mayor of Dublin, had been in there and had lodged all the amendments. I said &ldquo;Very well&rdquo; and put them back in my pocket.  I was not long out of the office when a messenger was sent after me to say that Deputy Byrne would not lodge the amendment <Col N="1352" /> relating to bicycles as he did not agree with it.  I submit that when the Municipal Council make representations they ought to be heard in full. Consequently, I put down in my name the amendment approved of by the Municipal Council's Housing and General Purposes Committee.  I have no feeling whatever regarding cyclists. If you accept this amendment, it is all right; if you reject it it is all right, so far as I am concerned.  The case made in the memorandum submitted to me on behalf of the Municipal Council is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The amendment, which is clear in its terms, speaks for itself and represents the opinion of the Corporation of Dublin on the necessity for the registration of pedal bicycles and tricycles and for imposing on the riders the obligation of the provisions of the Bill with regard to third party insurance.  It is hardly necessary to point out the number of accidents caused by pedal bicycles and tricycles in which the victims had no redress owing to the fact that the riders of the machines were people of little or no means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two amendments on the paper in the name of the Deputy&mdash;Nos. 60 and 60a. Amendment 60a is out of order and cannot be discussed.  The Bill as read a Second Time provided for third party insurance for mechanically propelled vehicles.  To extend the scope of the Bill to include pedal bicycles, would be to go too far.  The Deputy must confine himself to amendment 60.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>You will understand that the Municipal Council of Dublin is speaking and not I.  You have knocked out one half and I expect the Deputies present will knock out the other half on the same principle as obtained long ago in a locality in which I lived in Dublin.  There was in the neighbourhood a small monarch who governed all he surveyed.  He usually paid his rent to his landlord by saying to him: &ldquo;You knock off one half and I will knock off the other.&rdquo;  In order to retain the friendship of the tenant, the landlord always agreed to do so, as his <Col N="1353" /> tenant's enmity was particularly dangerous having regard to his fistic accomplishments.  I have no feeling against cyclists at all&mdash;quite the opposite.  I suppose I have much the same experience as other citizens who use Shanks' Mare.  Some of the cyclists are gentlemen.  If they get into your way or cause you either inconvenience or alarm, they express their sorrow for it.  Others sometimes become rude and angry.  Others call you names.  &ldquo;You old blind bat&rdquo; was the expression used to me in a very busy thoroughfare in Dublin.  An adjective was used also which is not pronounceable here.  &ldquo;Waken up, four eyes&rdquo; was another expression used to me.  I dare say if I was in a hurry and had very little experience I might use much heavier expressions. Regarding the ladies on bicycles, I have not the smallest possible complaint to make.  I always admire them whether they go on two wheels or four wheels or whether they keep their feet near the ground, as I do myself.  In my whole experience of Dublin, I have never yet seen a cyclist run away from an accident of which he or she was the cause.  They always held their ground. I must say that for them.  I do not think that I have made any case at all for the amendment standing in my name but I am not going to let the Corporation down.  The Corporation was let down some years ago and we shall have a word to say about that piece of history some time or other. I submit the amendment to the consideration of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our view that the fitting of a reflector on a mechanically-propelled or other vehicle could not be any hardship.

In that case it would be a wise precaution for the motorist himself to have a reflector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look into the matter before the Report Stage, because there are, as he knows, large numbers of tourists visiting this country, and it would be rather a serious obligation to place upon them.  The Minister may say that it is not a very heavy penalty, but it is not a very easy thing to affix to a motor. I think that he will get all the benefits which he hopes to derive from this provision from the attachment of this to other vehicles.  I think everybody will agree that motor vehicles are <Col N="1355" /> sufficiently well-lighted at present.  Of course, lights are liable to go out, but if the Minister argues that it is necessary to put a reflector on the back of a vehicle, so that when the light goes out there will be something to show, he might argue just as strongly that it would be desirable to put white reflectors in the front of all vehicles.  I would ask him to consider the matter before the next stage.</P>

      <Col N="1357" /> We had considerable discussion on this matter when the Bill was previously before the House.

The way I propose to clarify the situation is to delete the words &ldquo;such lamp, reflector or other instrument&rdquo; and to substitute the words in the amendment.  If we had that regulation in, I do not think it would add very much to the troubles of those driving cattle at night and it would ensure their safety from approaching motorists.  One of the greatest difficulties that a motorist has is when on a dark night he comes round a bend and before he has time to pull up is into a drove of cattle.  That is the risk to the motorist and to those driving the cattle and it is a danger to the cattle.  If such a lamp as is proposed in the amendment were carried the reflection of that lamp would appear for some distance and warning would be given to the approaching motorist.  I think, with all respect, that it is an amendment which is desirable in the interests of all concerned.</P>

It is very well lighted there when cattle are being shipped, but, although it is almost as lightsome there at those times as it would be in daylight, if the amendment were insisted on every drover of cattle would have to carry a lamp.  We know the difficulties of the farming community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has quite a different situation in mind to what the framers of this resolution had.  I quite agree that no motorist would run into cattle at the North Wall in driving down to the boat.  The motorist who would do that under the present lighting conditions in this city ought to be very severely dealt with.  What Deputy Good has mentioned and what I certainly had in my mind were country roads at night, which are practically unlit, and where in the summer time the road is grey&mdash; almost the colour of sheep.  I would say that sheep are practically invisible on an ill-lit road in summer time. That is the precise situation which we had in our minds&mdash;where sheep or cattle are being driven from one farm to another in the country.  It has been mentioned here in this Bill that the drover has to carry a reflector.  I do not know whether he would carry the reflector before, or behind, or in his pocket.  Certainly if he carried it in front it would be quite invisible to a motorist coming behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has displayed such solicitude for the safety of everybody that one would like to examine the class of accidents which do happen. As far as I know, the accidents resulting from one motor car running into the back of another motor car in motion are few and far between.  I am afraid the accidents to motorists, such as Deputy Good has described&mdash;coming around the corner on a dark road and running into cattle or sheep&mdash;are fairly frequent.  The drover is usually on one side of the road, and even if he sees an approaching motorist, he <Col N="1359" /> has no method of warning him.  I would like to impress on the Minister that this is a very common cause of accident and a great danger to motorists.  I think it is not very much to ask a drover to carry a lamp with some sort of reflector that will be visible and give some sort of warning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I am opposed to the amendment.  I think it is rather ridiculous to ask a drover or whoever is in charge of cattle to carry a lamp.  I think the accidents resulting from driving into cattle are so rare as to make such a section as this undesirable.  I can only recall one accident of this kind in my own lifetime.  Everybody knows that cattle coming towards you provide by their eyes the greatest reflector that can be produced.  Anybody who on a dark night could not see the eyes of a flock of sheep or cattle coming towards him does not deserve to be allowed to drive a motor car.  As regards cattle going away from you, they are generally followed by one or two persons. If you are to provide that every person walking after a flock of cattle has to be provided with a light, it follows logically that every man walking on the road ordinarily must be provided with a light or reflector.  One suggestion is just as logical as the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot conceive of any motorist driving carefully, at whatever speed, running into a flock of cattle numbering anything more than one or two. I notice that in the case of the lesser number this regulation does not particularly apply.  Although if there is any danger it would be occasioned by a single beast or two beasts.  As regards any man in his ordinary senses, driving carefully, irrespective of speed, it seems to me impossible that he could drive into a flock of cattle.  Only once in my long experience of motorists have I seen a man driving into a flock of cattle, and on that particular occasion the man was not in a condition to drive a motor car.  There is danger, as Deputy Good says, of a motorist coming around a bend driving into a flock of cattle. <Col N="1360" /> There is danger of driving into anything, and it is because of the negligence of people driving around bends that accidents of any kind happen.  I fail to see the necessity for the lamp, or, for that matter, any light at all.</P>

    <P>(a)  where a driver has at least nine consecutive hours for rest in a period of twenty-four hours beginning at the commencement of a period of driving, such period of at least nine consecutive hours shall be reckoned as a period of ten consecutive hours if such driver has at least twelve consecutive hours for rest in the twenty-four hours next after the expiration of the above-mentioned period of twenty-four hours;</P>
    <P>(b) any two consecutive periods of driving shall be deemed to form and be one continuous period unless such two periods are separated by an interval of not less than half-an-hour during which the driver can obtain rest and refreshment;</P>
    <P>(c)  any time spent by the driver of a vehicle on work (other than driving) in relation to such vehicle or the load carried thereon, including in the case of a public service vehicle any time spent in any capacity (other than as driver or as a passenger) on such vehicle while on a journey, shall be reckoned as time spent in driving;</P>
    <P>(d) in the case of a vehicle which is being used for or in the course of any operation of agriculture or forestry, time spent driving or working on or in connection with such vehicle while it is not on a road shall not be reckoned as time spent in driving.</P>

    <P>(4) Every person who drives for an excessive period a mechanically propelled vehicle which either is a public service vehicle or is designed and constructed solely for the traction of another vehicle or is fitted with a body designed and constructed for the carriage of goods (other than passengers' luggage and effects) either in addition to or without passengers or two or more such vehicles successively shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds.</P>
    <P>(5) Where a person is charged with an offence under any sub-section of this section, it shall be a good defence to such charge to prove that the act alleged to constitute such offence was due to delay in the completion of a journey and that such delay was unavoidable and was caused by circumstances which could not reasonably have been foreseen by such person.</P>

    <P>(8) The Minister for Industry and Commerce may, on the application of any person who appears to him to be representative of employers affected by the operation of this section or of employees similarly affected and after referring the matter to and being advised by the advisory body to be established under this section and if he is satisfied that the proposed order will not be detrimental to the public safety, by order vary in any manner any period which is declared by this section, or by any order previously made under this sub-section, to be an excessive period for the purposes of this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 53:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 10, after the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; to insert in brackets the words &ldquo;(the drivers of privately or professionally owned cars excepted i.e. those cars not plying for hire)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I ask in this section is that drivers of privately or professionally owned cars be excepted.  A person may be considered to be on duty even if he has made a stoppage and is waiting for whoever he is driving.  In the case of a medical man the car may be stopped for a considerable time. <Col N="1364" /> Under this section a man might be construed to be on duty even though sitting in the car and not actually driving.  For that reason I would ask that the driver of the private car should be excepted.  I can see the force of the section in providing that a man shall not be in a bus and driving for longer hours than we prescribe, but in the other case where his actual driving would not be so very long, he might be considered to be on duty even though he was not actually moving the car.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's speech has, in fact, very little relation to his amendment.  His amendment proposes to exclude entirely from the operation of this section employed drivers of private cars.  I can see no justification for that whatsoever.  If, in the interests of public safety, we prescribe maximum driving hours for the professionally skilled drivers of omnibuses and lorries there is, in my opinion, a much stronger case for prescribing similar hours in respect of drivers of privately-owned cars who are as a rule less skilled than the drivers of the public service cars or the commercial cars.  In any event the same considerations of public safety apply.  I think most Deputies will admit that the greatest danger on the road is the man who is half asleep, and who has been driving for a long period and has not got the full control of his wits, so that he is unable to think rapidly in case of an emergency.  If that is a danger to be avoided the provisions to deal with it should apply just as rigidly to the driver of the private car as the driver of the public service car or the commercial car.  In fact, I was expecting that we would get an amendment to this section to extend it to the owner driver.  We have not included the owner driver in the section because of the difficulty of administering it, the difficulty of securing evidence that the owner driver had, in fact, exceeded the hours prescribed.  If there was any substantial demand by the House for the inclusion of the owner driver, I would not be disposed to resist it. It seems to me that in every case <Col N="1365" /> where the driver is an employed man and subject to orders these maximum hours which are quite reasonable should be insisted upon in the interests of public safety.  I think any man who has been driving for 11 hours in a day, even with half hour intervals, is so tired that he is not in a fit condition to take full control of a high-powered car.  The Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána, and other parties, interested are repeatedly issuing notices to drivers to remember that when they are in charge of a car they are in charge of an instrument capable of considerable destruction, and it is absolutely necessary that such persons should be wide awake and not apt to be in a somnolent condition.  That is why we think these conditions should be inserted. They are, in our view, essential conditions for securing the public safety.</P>

I have done 12 hours myself and I imagine myself quite as capable to drive at the end of 12 hours as at the beginning.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (b), line 14, to delete the word &ldquo;eleven&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;eight.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make it clear to the House that I fulfilled all my promises to the Municipal Council.  I could tell at the beginning that there was one amendment which I could not see my way to move.  The Corporation suggested that Section 110 of the 1931 Bill, which has been repeated in Section 119 of the present Bill, should contain regulations governing hours of labour not less favourable than those contained in Section 19 of the English Road Traffic Act, 1930.  This Section 167, which is a new section, is an improvement in the matter of hours and goes far to meet the Corporation's suggestion.  The Corporation are of opinion that it does not go far enough. They consider the seriousness of continuous periods of driving, and that in one period of 24 hours it should be limited to eight hours instead of 11 hours as suggested in the measure. Now, if I want to make a speech to support that amendment I would just try and repeat word for word the Minister's speech a few moments ago on the last amendment when he said men working for long periods are a danger to the public.  This eight hours suggestion instead of 11 hours was unanimously agreed upon by members of every party in Committee.  This amendment had the hearty support of every member of the Corporation representing Labour, members of the Minister's Party and others.  I am <Col N="1367" /> asking the Minister to accept it in view of the speech he made a few moments ago.  I think men driving for a long period, without a break, have to sleep on the return journey, and are a danger to the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I gathered from Deputy Byrne that the consideration that weighed with the Council for the inclusion of the amendment, was that it would prescribe hours of driving not less favourable than that of the British Act.  This section prescribes hours of driving not less favourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We tried to get this suggestion put through in a previous Bill, but did not succeed.  The Council agreed that the new section goes further, but not far enough, and they asked me to press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point arising out of this is that the section in this Bill is not less favourable than the corresponding section in the British Transport Act.  In fact, it goes a little further than the British Act.  The second point is that the section does not permit eight hours continuous driving.  It permits a maximum of five and a half hours, and it provides that in any period of 24 hours there may be a succession of periods not amounting, however, to more than 11 hours.  I think if Deputies consider the circumstances under which certain omnibus services are conducted, the period in which private cars&mdash;not owner driven &mdash;but driven by hired employees&mdash;are utilised, and the circumstances under which certain commercial cars have on occasions to be used, they will come to the conclusion that the provisions here are not unreasonable and that any lesser provisions would be a considerable restriction on trade.  This section does not set out to prescribe what should be regarded as maximum hours of work for persons employed in the transport industry.  It sets out to prescribe in the interests of public safety the maximum number of hours any person can drive in 24 hours.  If an omnibus driver takes a bus to Ballina in the morning and has a rest in the afternoon, and comes back later, he <Col N="1368" /> would be entitled to do so under this Bill, subject to the total driving hours not exceeding 11 hours.  That is what it is intended to provide for.  It seems that if we were to prescribe that in any circumstances no one could drive an omnibus, a lorry or a car for a greater number of hours than eight in 24, the restriction upon a number of commercial enterprises would be very considerable. This is not a restriction that is essential to the public safety. I think we have taken our cue from the British Act and got the periods least likely to impose hardship on commercial enterprise, and at the same time we secure the maximum of public safety which is what we were aiming to do.</P>

Failing a complaint by an employee where is there a check in the section on the actual number of hours worked?  I was reading to-day evidence that was tendered before a British Tribunal dealing with this matter.  The Minister is after admitting that he has copied the working hours from a British Act.  According to the evidence before the British Tribunal the Act there is so loosely worded that it has been possible for employers <Col N="1369" /> to impose intolerable conditions on employees so far as working hours are concerned.  If an employee makes a complaint and a prosecution follows I know what would happen to him shortly afterwards, if the employer was convicted.</P>

As far as I can make out under this Bill an employee can drive for 5½ hours, they stop for half an hour's rest and go on again for another 5½ hours.  That is the limitation put upon him in the 24 hours, a half an hour's rest during each period. But he can be made to work 77 hours in the week.  That is the situation with regard to the carriage of passengers in public service vehicles. In the other Bill to which we are coming, Deputy Norton wants to have an amendment inserted providing that the maximum hours of work by persons employed in the carriage of merchandise shall not be in excess of 44 hours a week.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is confusing the two things.  This section has nothing to do with the maximum hours a week.  It has to do with the maximum number of hours worked in 24 in the interests of public safety. The Deputy is only trying to cause a little confusion.  The fact is that this section has relation only to one consideration&mdash;the <Col N="1370" /> public safety.  The Road Transport Act of 1922 and 1923 was designed to give effect to certain general principles affecting employment in this country.  That is entirely different to what is under consideration here.  May I remind the Deputy that an attempt was made to introduce a section similar to this, prescribing the maximum number of hours per week in the Road Traffic Bill introduced by his Government and that he strongly opposed it?  He wanted no limitation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was listening on the Second Reading to the principle of the Bill and under a certain section when considering applications for licences, the Minister must consider the condition of the workers employed by carriers.  A question was put to the Minister from these Benches and he indicated the lines of the proposed Bill, which are the lines in this section.  It was then understood that the matter would come up for consideration long before the Transport Bill.  Everyone admits that Deputy McGilligan can make good debating points but anyone who understands the Bill knows that he is misrepresenting the position of the employees, as laid down in the Road Traffic Bill.  All I am concerned about is that the Minister should ensure that it is possible to detect any owners of vehicles who may be abusing the conditions laid down in the section. How can they be detected if they force employees to work hours other than those laid down?  They can only be detected by an employee making a complaint, and if the owner is convicted, <Col N="1371" /> and the employee loses his position, I want to have some method devised under this section so that the responsibility should not be laid on the employee who made the charge.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows perfectly well what would happen to any employee who would make a charge against his employer.  I want some system to be devised to deal with this.  I want an assurance from the Minister that something in the nature of a log-book, or some other scheme of the kind, will be devised which will enable the people responsible for administering this Act to detect those owners who are trying to evade its provisions.</P>

      <P>That suggestion might be practicable in relation to a limited number of operators, such as bus owners and so on, but this section relates not alone to those but to everybody in the country who is employed in the driving of a car, whether a private or a commercial car.  Obviously, it would be quite impossible to arrange for a log-book in all these cases.  As I have said, it might be possible to devise some such system in relation to omnibuses, licensed bus services, or public service vehicles generally; but I do not think that it would be practicable in relation to every single commercial or private car in the county for which there is an employed driver.  Undoubtedly, the position is that action could not be taken under this section except the information came to the Guards in some way.  That information need not necessarily come from an employee. As we all know, such information sometimes comes from an employee who has been dismissed and who has a grievance against his employer.  In addition to that, there are other means, obviously, by which information can also come.  For instance, an investigation into an accident might reveal the fact that the driver charged with responsibility for the accident had been working for an excessive period, in which case, his employer would become liable to a penalty under this section.  In such cases, and many others, information might come to the Guards that this <Col N="1372" /> section had been contravened and, following on that information, action would be taken.  Apart from that, I do not think that there are any practicable means of devising a system.  We might devise one to cover those who get licences under the Bill now before the Dáil.  In relation to this particular section, however, I think that the enforcement of it must be left to the ordinary course of things as in the case of every other section in the Bill.</P>

      <P>One could not fail to notice that when the Minister said that it is impossible to devise a scheme to cover this matter, Deputy McGilligan said &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;  Deputy McGilligan made that comment when the Minister said that it was impossible to devise any scheme to detect owners of vehicles who might be inclined to ignore the provisions of this section.  With regard to what the Minister has said as to the impossibility of devising such a scheme, I suggest that the very same argument would apply in the case of the licensed traders of the country in so far as there is no proper inspection on Sundays or during the various prohibited hours in a week all over the country. Obviously, it is impossible for the Guards in every case to go into the houses of licensed traders during all the prohibited hours, whether during the prohibited hours on Sundays or any other part of the day or week. But in ordinary business concerns there is some record kept of the time worked by the employees.  Take the case of the factories coming under the Trade Boards Act.  The Minister has some way of finding out what are the hours of work in these factories if a complaint is made to him.</P>

      <P>This section has only to do with the number of hours which a driver may drive having regard to the public safety.  If under some other Bill the drivers of omnibus or road vehicles are confined to ten hours&mdash; well, I suppose it would have to be 11 hours&mdash;it would not conflict with this. That is an entirely different proposition. What would be regarded as proper working conditions have nothing to do with this Bill.  This is simply a Road Traffic Bill, and its aim is the public safety merely.  The object of this section is to prescribe a certain number of hours per day for driving consistent with the public safety, and it is to prescribe the number of hours per day that this section is concerned with.  No question of the number of hours per week arises.</P>

      <P>The first condition of an omnibus licence being given is that reasonable hours are worked and satisfactory rates of wages paid. When all these licences came up for renewal on 31st October last year we publicly notified, in the Press and otherwise, that anybody who had any reason to object to the renewal of licences on the ground that that first condition was not observed, could do so.  We did get objections and in each case, as soon as the objections came to the Department, we were able to force the owners to improve the workers' hours and to increase the rate of wages.  I have received no complaint since then, but if there is the possibility of making a complaint on that ground and if the information is supplied to my Department, then it will lead to the result I have stated. There is adequate machinery for dealing with that, but all that has nothing whatever to do with this Bill which only prescribes the maximum hours per day that may be worked by persons driving all sorts of cars.</P>

      <P>Would there be any administrative difficulty in the way of having periodical surprise tests carried out as to the number of hours worked particularly by people employed in the carrying trade?  I know one fairly large lorry owner operating in my constituency who pays his men a minimum wage of £1 a <Col N="1375" /> week with commission on the tonnage carried.  The result is that his workers are influenced to work unduly long hours.  They have to do so to earn a reasonable weekly wage.</P>

All that, however, has nothing whatever to do with this particular section.  What is prescribed here is the maximum driving hours per day.  That is done in the interests of public safety.

A surprise test means that an inspector authorised for the purpose pays a surprise visit and asks somebody&mdash;is it to be the employee?&mdash;what number of hours he has been on duty.  I presume that is what the Deputy means.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is back again to the log book system, but that has already been ruled out.  The Minister said that it would be too cumbersome, that you could not impose it on every employer, and that it would be troublesome and expensive.  The only other thing then is to ask the employee and Deputy Davin has already answered himself on that.  He said that the employee could not answer because if he did so he is going to be victimised.  Therefore, the Deputy himself has set up an insuperable obstacle to any method of inspection, because if employers are going to be heartless enough, as he suggests, to get rid of employees who give information, they are certainly going to be heartless enough to do that if they make log book entries of unreasonable hours worked.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways.</P>

Supposing a merchant has a man driving a lorry and the man is sent out to deliver stuff here and there through the country, are the intervals during which he is engaged unloading the stuff&mdash;these may extend to half an hour or forty-five minutes in a particular place&mdash;to be considered part of the time during which the man is driving the lorry?</P>

Having regard to the strain imposed <Col N="1378" /> on men driving these road transport vehicles is the Minister satisfied that with a short interval, say, of half an hour for lunch they are competent or that it is safe in the public interest, to drive for an eleven-hour period? Take the case of men driving these heavy vehicles from Dublin to Limerick.  Is the Minister satisfied that a man would be competent to carry on at the wheel for eleven hours with the little break that is provided for in the section?  I suggest to the Minister that he should define the period that must elapse between the two working periods of five-and-a-half hours each.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It might be necessary, in certain circumstances in a particular trade, that a man might make that journey in a day.  It has nothing to do with the hours he works per week.  He might work 11 hours one day and none the next and none the next and 11 hours the next day. It is the maximum.  As the law stands at present, he might drive 24 hours; there is nothing against it.  The idea here is to try and get a period which is reasonable, having regard to the convenience of particular trades, and, also, to public safety.  We are considering the matter and, it seems to us, that the periods specified in the British Act seem suitable.  We are following that idea as the period was fixed following a very exhaustive <Col N="1379" /> inquiry.  They all arrived at the same conclusion that 11 hours should be the period.  I am prepared to adopt that as the maximum.  A man may drive 11 hours who is not fit to drive any more.</P>

      <P>I think it would be a great improvement to the Bill if the Minister would consider a separate section for buses.  I think the weakness of the whole section is to try to cover too many different sets of things. The Minister must insist on the real principle that ought to be considered, that is when a vehicle becomes a danger to the public.  It is particularly wrong in principle to tell a man, at one kind of work, say a man driving a lorry delivering goods, that after a time he becomes a danger to the public if he works the same number of hours that a man driving a bus does. If there was a separate section for bus drivers I think we might get a section &mdash;one that would satisfy all parts of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have powers at present under the Transport Bill. These powers are general powers and I explained the manner in which they were administered.  We tried to get each licensee to give the same conditions of work and wages which a good employer would do.  We were trying that and gave licences generally for a period of three months.  Then we got an inspector to procure the information required as to the wages paid and hours worked.  Once that was established we began to cut off at the bottom.  We were assisted by the trade unions, who laid objections on the ground that the hours of work were too long and the wages too low. In each case where that happened notice of objection was sent to the licensee, and conditions and wages were improved, so as to bring them up to the general level.  This worked very satisfactorily, indeed, and I do <Col N="1380" /> not think that in relation to the omnibus service there is any complaint at the moment.  There may be particular instances that I cannot call to mind, but, as far as I am aware, the trade unions expressed themselves satisfied in relation to the omnibus services at the moment.  If they were satisfied that the position was not satisfactory, and if any particular licensee tried to increase the hours of work, or decrease the standard of remuneration to the extent that would draw forth a protest in that direction, we would consider the protest in relation to our information as to the general conditions, and, if we considered the protest justified, we would give notice to withdraw the licence if the conditions were not improved.  So in relation to omnibuses we have powers, not all set out here, but in another Act, to ensure what are reasonable and satisfactory conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that and I am not confusing that at all with when a driver of a vehicle is likely to become a danger to the public.

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 66:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 48, to delete the words &ldquo;or permits.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that the Minister ought to be satisfied with the word &ldquo;causes.&rdquo;  The addition of the two words &ldquo;or permits&rdquo; introduces a great deal of ambiguity into the working of the section and it will lead to all sorts of disputes between masters and men and as to the interpretation of the section. The Minister should be quite satisfied if an employer does actually cause his employee to work over hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appreciates that that would make it almost impossible to get a clear case in any single instance.  The section definitely makes it an offence for an employer to cause or permit an employee to work for more than 11 hours in the day and that responsibility is definitely placed on the employer because, otherwise, we would always have a conflict of evidence as between employer and employee in any case that might arise. It seems to me that, if the section is to have any value at all, these words &ldquo;or permits&rdquo; must remain in it and I think it is right that they should remain.  It is, of course, desirable, in the first case, to ensure that there would be no possibility of misunderstanding as to the obligations and no possibility of a conviction falling through because of inability to prove what would otherwise be capable of proof under the section, but, in any case, I think that the employer of men engaged in any transport business should clearly understand that it is against the law for him to allow, much less to insist, on one of his employees driving a bus for more than 11 hours a day in view of the public safety being involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly why I urge the omission of the words. It will be practically impossible for an employer to prove that he did not permit.  His only remedy will be dismissal and he will have to turn out his employee if he has done wrong.  It will be nearly impossible for him to prove in court that the thing was not done with his permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Deputy to keep in mind that the main consideration behind this Bill is the public safety and I want him to consider the section from the point of view of the person on the road whose life or health is being endangered by the fact that a person is driving a bus or lorry for more than eleven hours a day.  It is <Col N="1385" /> not a matter entirely of the relations between employer and employee or the effect of the section on such relations. The main consideration must be the public safety and, as we make it illegal for an employer to require his employee to drive for more than eleven hours, it is illegal for an employee in fact to drive for more than eleven hours, and, consequently, it should be illegal for an employer to permit his employee seeing that he controls the vehicle, to work more than eleven hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Prof. Thrift Prof. Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Prof. Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an illustration of what I was saying a few minutes ago.  The Minister is trying to make the same clause apply to different things altogether.  The Minister has in mind one group to whom this section applies&mdash;the bus or lorry driver&mdash;and I am thinking solely of the chauffeur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Prof. Thrift Prof. Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Prof. Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, it will be impossible for an employer to clear himself, if you leave these words in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say, if an employer gives a general instruction to a driver that he was not to break the law in this respect, whether that would discharge the employer from liability or will it be held if, despite the employer's instructions, the man does break the law by driving for twelve hours or by not taking a rest in the middle of the day when he should take it that the employer permits that because he cannot prevent it? How can he?  Take the man with a lorry in the country who sends a driver out to do eight hours' delivering of merchandise.  He tells him &ldquo;at one o'clock, you must stop driving until a quarter to two.&rdquo;  It transpires that the man does not do so but stops only for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes&mdash;part of his earnings may be commission and he wants to cover as much ground as he can&mdash; but, although the employer expressly warned him that he must not do so, is the employer still to be liable for something he cannot control and, no matter <Col N="1386" /> what he does, cannot control, beyond cautioning the employee not to do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only argument I can advance against the Deputy is that, on the whole, our judges and justices are reasonable people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  If the Minister tells me that if an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the court that he expressly forbade it, that acquits him, I am quite content, but does the word &ldquo;permit&rdquo; mean that if the misdemeanour or irregularity has occurred, it places a liability on the employer from which he cannot escape by any explanation?  What more can an employer do than say to a driver, &ldquo;Do not do this.&rdquo;  He cannot follow him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, it would be a good defence for the employer if he satisfied the court that the driver had exceeded the hours against his express orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more in it than Deputy Dillon has said because express forbidding may not occur and yet the employer may not intend or, in fact, have permitted, the breach of the law which has taken place.  Yet, it will be impossible for him to prove it.  It may be said that he ought to have expressly forbidden but he could not expressly forbid such a thing on every occasion.</P>
