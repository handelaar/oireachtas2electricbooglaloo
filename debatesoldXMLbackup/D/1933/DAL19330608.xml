      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether the plans and estimates for the provision of waterworks schemes for Portarlington (£15,000), Stradbally (£3,600), and sewerage schemes for Portlaoighise (£11,000), Mountmellick (£10,300), and Mountrath (£10,000) have been sanctioned by his Department; whether the area of charge has been fixed in each case, and whether in view of the large number of able-bodied unemployed living in the towns named, together with the recent increase in local rates, he can now state the amount of grant to be made available for each of the schemes mentioned, and when such information has been or will be communicated to the Laoighis County Board of Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspector's report of the local inquiry recently held into these schemes has been received, and is at present under consideration. The fixation of areas of charge depends on the decisions to be arrived at on consideration of the report.  The allocation of a grant towards the cost of these schemes rests with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that some of these schemes have been under examination and consideration by both the Department and the county board of health, in some cases up to 18 months, and also in view of the fact that the Minister for Finance is bound to be influenced by the viewpoint of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, will the Parliamentary Secretary see that some of these <Col N="162" /> recommendations will be forwarded to the Minister for Finance as to the percentage of grants to be made available as soon as the inspector's report has been sanctioned by the Minister?</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Minor Relief Schemes.   Laoighis and Offaly.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (1) the total amounts allocated for the financial year ended 31st March, 1933, for minor relief works in the counties of Laoighis and Offaly; (2) the amount paid to county engineers, foremen and gangers for supervisory work in connection with the carrying out of such works; (3) the amount paid in wages to workers; (4) the amount paid for carting material; (5) the cost of material; (6) the location of the schemes and (7) the schemes left unfinished owing to shortage of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with (1), (6) and (7) first:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The total amounts allocated are as follows:&mdash;County Laoighis&mdash;£3,317; County Offaly&mdash;£3,040.</P>
      <P>In addition a sum of £3,132 was expended through the Land Commission in County Offaly on work at Turraun analogous to minor relief works.</P>
      <P>(6)  Copies of complete lists of the works are being furnished to the Deputy.  These lists show the location of all the works undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(7)  Complete information is not yet available.  It should be observed, however, that in minor relief schemes <Col N="163" /> grants are made in a large number of cases for the repair and extension of accommodation and bog roads; the grant being apportioned in respect to the needs of the district.  In undertaking works of this kind it is foreseen that a certain amount of work will often be left over to be completed, possibly, in the relief work of a subsequent year.  In such cases it would be misleading to state that the schemes had not been completed owing to shortage of money.</P>
    <P>As to points (2), (3), (4) and (5), for the ordinary purpose of administration no such elaborate statistical return for each county has been found necessary as would supply the information which is sought, nor would the public advantages likely to accrue from its special preparation be commensurate with the amount of labour entailed in the task.  From general investigations made recently in connection with over 200 average wages sheets of minor relief schemes in different counties it was ascertained that the wages paid to labourers and carters represented approximately 91 per cent. of the expenditure on wages plus materials, plus tools, plus national health insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be unfair to ask the Minister to give an assurance that as the schemes referred to in (7) of my question have been left unfinished owing to the shortage of money&mdash;that is my information&mdash;some provision will be made for their completion as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy can take it that in the ordinary course that provision will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (1) the number of applications received during the financial year ended 31st March, 1933, from the counties of Laoighis and Offaly for grants for the carrying out of minor relief works; (2) the number of such applications already investigated and the estimated cost of carrying out same and (3) whether applications received since 31st March, 1933, are being investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="164" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As to numbers (1) and (2) of the question I want to say that for the ordinary purposes of administration no such statistical return for each county has been found necessary as would supply the information which is sought, nor would the public advantages likely to accrue from its special preparation be commensurate with the amount of labour entailed in the task.  Approximately 7,000 applications have been received for minor relief works in the Free State.  Some 1,200 works were carried out during last winter and spring but a great many applications in excess of this number had necessarily to be investigated, many of which were found to be unsuitable.  It was not, however, feasible even if it had been desirable or economical to investigate all the applications received, as the cost of so doing is borne by relief funds.  (3) Applications received since 31st March, 1933, for Laoighis and Offaly are not at present being investigated, but arrangements to do so will be made in due course.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition courteously gave me notice of his intention to raise this point.  But before receiving that notification I had examined the Bill very carefully, and these amendments, in relation to it, and it seemed to me that amendments 4 and 5 definitely came within the ambit and scope of the Bill. I am still of that opinion.  Incidentally the matter was discussed in Committee. As to the advisability of accepting No. 4, which would extend the scope of the Bill to persons about to establish hospitals and nursing organisations, <Col N="177" /> that is a matter for the House to decide.  The Chair could not pronounce upon the merits of the case.  It is my considered opinion that these amendments are quite in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be necessary to discuss amendments 4 and 5 together.  They are intended to cover the points raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney on the Second Stage, that before a grant was given to a hospital it would have to be in existence and that the Minister had no power under the Bill to make a grant to a new hospital unconnected with any existing institution or body.  The intention of the Bill was to provide for financing such new institutions.  There appeared to be some reasonable doubt as to whether that intention could be carried out without this amendment.  The amendment is now submitted for the purpose of removing any possible doubt that might exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as drawn, makes provision for a scheme being submitted to the Minister for Justice by the Sweepstake Committee under the Act.  I do not know whether it is intended to amend the section so as to allow any one of these bodies to formulate schemes.  But it would appear that if a certain number of persons, from A to Z, came together and formulated a scheme, the scheme having been formulated, it is open to people who had nothing to do with the formulation of the scheme proposed to make a claim in connection with a new institution about to be established.  On the merits, generally, I would say that the existing hospital accommodation in the country would be better served by extension rather than by the creation of other hospitals.  Considerable attention was directed towards the policy of the amalgamation of hospitals.  Now we appear to be going to the other extreme and making provision for the <Col N="178" /> institution of others.  Unless the Minister has some particular institution in mind, or the starting of some institution for nursing or the extension of hospital accommodation, I think it is not good policy to extend the number of those institutions already in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that certain bodies would be entitled to participate under this amendment without taking part in preparing a scheme.  Apart altogether from this amendment, various boards and authorities, for example, which will benefit considerably under the scheme, are precluded from taking part in promoting schemes so that principle is already dealt with in the Bill.  First, there are new institutions that might be set up, and in order that they be set up it might be necessary to have this amendment incorporated in the Bill.  I am not clear that we could set up a research institution at the present time.  It is possible we could, but there is some doubt about it.  A research institution might be set up on the recommendation of the Hospitals Commission. There has been much discussion on the question of an institution for research such as a Paediatric Institute.  These are some of the points that strike me at the moment.  This would possibly be a new institution and governed possibly by an entirely new governing body. In the original draft of the Bill I was definitely under the impression that we could make allocations to such institutions, but Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney threw some doubt upon that position, and this amendment is meant to ensure that the Minister will not be hampered in making allocations for the classes of institutions that I have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, there is the provision, in page 2 &ldquo;...and also includes institutions for the carrying on of medical research, but does not include any institution or organisation conducted by persons for their private profit&rdquo;.  That would appear to have <Col N="179" /> covered one portion of the Parliamentary Secretary's recommendation for this amendment.  So far as paediatrics are concerned, there are institutions for children, I should say, but extension of these institutions would be better than the inauguration of others.  With the inauguration of every new institution, there comes expense as regards management and so on, and it would be very much easier and better, deferring, of course, to the Parliamentary Secretary's expert knowledge in that connection, if extensions were to be carried out rather than the inauguration of new institutions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, before Section 24 (4), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In specifying the purposes for which a grant out of the Hospitals Trust Fund is to be expended and in attaching any conditions to the receipt of such grant or of any payment to be made in respect thereof the Minister shall not specify any purpose or attach any condition which would directly or indirectly enable the Minister to interfere with, direct or in any way affect the executive, administrative or financial management or control or the internal policy or affairs of any hospital or nursing organisation to which such grant is made.</P>
      <P>I suppose Deputy Sir James Craig will not press his amendment, No. 14, if my amendment is accepted.  They may be slightly different, but I think they are, in substance, the same.  This was discussed on Committee Stage and the amendment seeks to retain for the hospitals the autonomy which they have had up to this, which has not been interfered with in any way and with which, so far as I know, it was not the intention of the Minister to interfere.  It would retain to the hospital management the executive, administrative and financial management and control of the internal policy and affairs of any hospital or nursing organisation to which such grant is made.  As I said on Committee Stage, there is no objection to conditions being made in respect of how money should be spent but there is apprehension on the part of many of these institutions, or some of them, that their position may be affected.  The Minister said that it was not intended to affect the autonomy of the various institutions, in any way, by means of those grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a considerable <Col N="182" /> amount of discussion on a somewhat similar amendment by Deputy Sir James Craig on Committee Stage.  He withdrew the amendment standing in his name and I think there was general understanding that Deputy Cosgrave would endeavour to frame an amendment that would be possible of acceptance and that would be consistent with the principles of the Bill and the intentions as expressed, from time to time, during the course of the debate. The present amendment appears to me to be much more far-reaching in its scope and open to more serious objection than even the amendment Deputy Sir James Craig tabled on the earlier stage.  The purposes for which the grants can be expended will be set out in the Bill under a later amendment and the Minister will be bound to specify one or other of these purposes. It seems clear that, in specifying any of the purposes, he cannot interfere in the management of the hospitals but would merely have to see that the money is spent for the purpose for which it was intended.  That part of the amendment, therefore, appears to be unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment also prohibits the Minister from attaching conditions which would enable him to interfere with the financial management or control or internal policy or affairs of a hospital or nursing organisation.  The words &ldquo;internal policy or affairs&rdquo; are so vague and indefinite that I do not think the Deputy could reasonably hope to have the amendment accepted and these words inserted.  The Minister will not be in a position to say what these words might cover and, in making an allocation, he could not be sure, at any time, that any condition that he attached to a grant was not an infringement of the internal policy or a direct or indirect interference in the affairs of the hospitals. With regard to interference with the management, it must be borne in mind that the Minister has certain powers in so far as the administration of the rate-supported hospitals is concerned and any amendment which might be construed as curtailing these powers would be unacceptable from that point of view.  I might again emphasise the <Col N="183" /> fact that there is no likelihood whatever that the Minister will intervene in the ordinary management of voluntary hospitals or attempt to interfere actively with their administration and supervision and, if any particular institution felt that the conditions attaching to a grant would constitute an undue interference with its autonomy or affairs or their internal policy, such an institution would not be bound to accept the grant.  It can say: &ldquo;We would prefer to have autonomy in our internal policy, and to have our institution run without any condition being imposed by anybody, and we will not accept any grant out of the sweepstakes fund.&rdquo;  At any rate, the main purpose in the mind of the Minister is to ensure that, as a result of the allocations and the buildings and equipment provided, and the endowment for the maintenance of free beds for the future, hospital facilities will be available for the poorer sections of the community. There is no other particular interest in the mind of the Minister at the present time.  As it appears to me, it is impossible to ensure that that accommodation and equipment will be available, if the Minister is not entirely free to attach the necessary conditions to the grants that will ensure that result.  A comprehensive amendment of this kind might, in practice, be used to defeat even the simplest reform the Minister might wish to inaugurate.</P>
    <P>For example, the Minister might make it a condition, when giving a grant, that an hospital should keep proper accounts, that the accounts should be audited, and that statistical tables should be available showing the numbers in the in-patients and in the out-patients departments and the average number of occupied beds during the year.  There would be nothing unprecedented in that.  For the past 20 years that condition has been imposed on London hospitals by the governing body of the King's Fund. It is an English fund which was founded about 36 years ago for the benefit of the hospitals.  Such a simple and necessary condition as that, for <Col N="184" /> example, might possibly be attached to a grant or to an allocation, and it might be ruled out, or might be held to be an interference with the internal administration, or with internal policy, or the affairs of the hospital, and the Minister might find that he had no power to impose it.  He might attach a condition that a grant might be made, and subsequently it might be held by a competent authority that the Minister had attached a condition that he had no statutory or no special right to attach.  Of course, such a condition would not be binding, but the allocation would have been made, and the Minister would have discovered that he had done something which cut across the internal policy, or interfered, directly or indirectly, in the affairs of the hospital.  In fact, it would be difficult to imagine any condition that might not be held to affect the executive administration, the financial administration or the control of the internal policy or affairs of an hospital.  The Minister might very well find himself in the position that he could not attach any condition whatever, that even if he attached the condition that 25 per cent. of the beds should be free, that might be held as an infringement of the internal affairs or on the internal policy of the hospital.</P>
    <P>It was understood when Deputy Sir James Craig's amendment was withdrawn that a less far-reaching one would be circulated for discussion at this stage.  The present amendment goes far beyond the original amendment, and from that point of view is open to much more serious objections. The amendment was evidently drafted in an atmosphere of suspicion.  We have had that atmosphere of suspicion since the Bill was introduced.  I am at a loss to understand why that atmosphere should be created.  I do not suggest that Deputies deliberately tried to create that atmosphere or, at any rate, to make it any worse than it is at present, but I repeat that there is no ground whatever for it.  We hope to have the friendly co-operation of the voluntary hospitals, and when conditions are being attached to the giving of a grant, prior to attaching <Col N="185" /> these conditions, we will endeavour to have exchanges of views with the governing bodies of the hospitals.  We will endeavour to consult with them, the Hospitals' Commission will consult with them, and the Minister will consult with them, to see how far the conditions it is proposed to attach might, or might not, be calculated to interfere with the ordinary autonomy of the hospitals, or with their policy.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is anything behind this amendment, or behind the general lines of the discussion, in relation to this Bill that does not appear on the surface.  I hope there is not. I hope there is not any suggestion behind this amendment, or behind some of the other amendments that we have dealt with, that the religious communities are in any danger from the present administration.  If the case is made that it is not what the present administration might do, but some future administration, I should say, in that regard, that a future administration will not be bound by the terms of this Bill.  If a future administration wants to take complete control of the voluntary hospitals, and has a majority in this House to support them, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent a future administration from doing so. The present administration can be trusted not to abuse the powers sought in the Bill, and I think that ought to satisfy the House, and satisfy the governing bodies of the hospitals.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot regard the Parliamentary Secretary's speech as being at all satisfactory. He comes here and tells us that he may want certain powers, and he asks for absolutely unlimited powers of control over the hospitals. He made the argument at the beginning of his speech that he can give the sums which he allocates to the hospitals for certain purposes, and for certain purposes only, to be set out in the new sub-section.  But before he makes a single attempt to do so he is in a position, as the Bill stands, to make his condition precedent to the grant of a single penny for the various purposes set out&mdash;any single thing he likes.  For instance, an hospital may wish to get <Col N="186" /> a building grant.  It may be necessary that it should receive a building grant. As the Bill stands the Minister can say: &ldquo;There is an allocation for a doctor; if you do not elect my nominee you will not get the grant&rdquo;; or he may say: &ldquo;You did not elect my nominee so your grant stops.&rdquo;  He is made absolute controller of the hospitals under this Bill.  He tells us that that is not the purpose in his mind; that, having this control, he will not exercise it; but that is most unsatisfactory. The Minister can only speak for himself as one individual, and the Parliamentary Secretary can only speak for himself as one individual.  It is not right for this House to give unlimited powers to a Minister, simply on the word of an individual.  I am not suggesting that the individual will not honour his word, but it is not right to give unlimited powers to an individual upon the word of an individual, or the promise of an individual, which can, after all, only bind himself.  It is for this House to give such powers to the Minister only as the House thinks that the Minister requires them, and not to give him unlimited powers on the implied understanding&mdash;because it can only be implied since it is not expressed in this Bill&mdash;that he will not exercise these powers improperly.  Let us have what are the purposes in the Minister's mind if he thinks it is necessary to interfere with the autonomy of the hospitals, and let those be set out here.  He asked the House, and asked especially Deputy Cosgrave, to make an attempt to produce a satisfactory amendment.  The Minister himself has made absolutely no attempt to do so. As far as the Minister's attitude at the present moment, or the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary at the present moment, is concerned, he seems to be retiring from the position he took up before, that he was willing that his powers should not be unlimited. He said that under this amendment he would not have power to make it a condition that 25 per cent. of the beds should be free.  I had down an amendment the other day which would have given him that specific power.  He rejected that amendment.  I do not know why, but he did reject it, and now, having <Col N="187" /> rejected it, he says: &ldquo;I am very sorry it is not there.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>But it was one of the arguments he put forward, that under the amendment I proposed he could not do certain things.  He induced the House to reject that amendment, the amendment being that he could make it a special condition that a certain proportion of the beds should be given to poor persons.  The Minister said that &ldquo;Suppose we do put terms so onerous upon the hospitals, and interfere so greatly with the hospitals that they object to what we are doing, there is a very easy course open to them; they can refuse to accept the grant.&rdquo;  That is the Minister's argument. Why should they be put in that position?  After all, the money is not the Minister's money; the money is not money belonging to this House; it is not money which is voted by this House; it is money which is the private property of the promoting hospitals.  That is the position.  Why should a hospital that has promoted a scheme be compelled to refuse to accept a grant of money which is justly and properly its property?  I am afraid that all through the minds of the promoters of this Bill, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, there seems to run the idea that in some way or other those moneys which are collected through the hospital sweeps are State moneys.  They are not State moneys. The State has nothing to do with them. They are the private property of the hospitals.  As far as they belong to the voluntary hospitals, they are the private property of the voluntary hospitals.  I will only just repeat now the way I put it on another occasion, that the Minister, under Statute or otherwise, has nothing else than a power of appointment amongst the various beneficial owners of the fund. It is, therefore, very unfair to say that the hospitals are not bound to accept the grant, that they have got a locus penitentiae, that they can get out if they like and take nothing if they refuse the Minister's terms.  I would <Col N="188" /> ask the House to accept this amendment. The Minister says that possibly it is too wide, but he has put forward no alternative to it.  It is perfectly obvious that a limitation of the powers of any Minister must be imposed by this House.</P>

      <P>I was prepared to accept what the Minister stated on the last occasion, that there was no intention to interfere with the autonomy of the hospitals or with the continuance of the voluntary work in which they are engaged, until the Minister made the statement this afternoon.  In the course of that statement, having again expressed the intention of the Ministry with regard to their desire not to interfere with the hospitals, he went on to say that it would not be possible to impose the simplest reform in hospital management if this amendment were to be carried.  What is the meaning of the simplest reform?  The Minister says at one moment: &ldquo;I have no desire to interfere with the internal administration, management, control, or other disposition in connection with the hospitals,&rdquo; and he proceeds at once to say: &ldquo;If I wish to have the simplest reform this amendment would take from me the power to impose it.&rdquo; He went further; he went on to say that it would not be possible for him to impose a condition upon the hospitals to keep proper accounts, to have satisfactory statistical information as regards bed accommodation and so on, mentioning several of the matters which are outlined in very elaborate and spectacular form in the publications of the late Committee of Reference. At that time the Minister had no power to command or direct the hospitals to keep those accounts, or to furnish tabulated information when requested by the Committee of Reference, and yet, without having that power at all, that information was vouchsafed to the Committee of Reference. The Minister now complains that if this particular amendment were put in he would not be in a position to demand the simplest reform.  His interpretation of the simplest reform is audited accounts, statistical information regarding patients, bed accommodation, and so on, all of which, as I <Col N="189" /> have said, are set out in the various reports that have been recently published.</P>
      <P>There was no intention whatever in putting down this amendment to affect in any way&mdash;and I do not believe it would affect in any way&mdash;those institutions comprised in what is known as the Poor Law.  The Minister has other powers to deal with them.  He has already power to interfere in the Poor Law administration according to Statute, and this particular amendment would not limit in any way his power in that connection.  I take it that the Minister simply threw that out as a sort of suggestion of interference, although I am quite sure that in his innermost heart he does not believe any such thing.  &ldquo;Simplest reform&rdquo; merely gives vocal expression to the fears that the hospitals management, generally, have got as regards what is intended.  The Minister, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has pointed out, has power to impose as a condition that a certain number of beds should be available for the poor&mdash;any number; he need not confine himself to 25 per cent.  He can take power to make that a condition, and there is no objection, and ought to be none, on the part of any hospital to a condition such as that in connection with the distribution of the hospitals sweeps moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is not, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has pointed out, in the position of being a beneficial trustee in this matter at all.  Those are not State moneys.  There is no comparison between those funds and what the Minister has mentioned as a sort of parallel case, the King's Fund.  This is not the same as the King's Fund. Those moneys may come from the King's subjects in Great Britain, or a very considerable portion of them, but once they have parted with them they have parted with them for a purpose, and that purpose is enshrined in the Acts that have been passed up to this&mdash;for the benefit of the hospitals. The Minister is only in the position of a Civic Guard on point duty, regulating the traffic of this money into the funds of the various hospitals.  He is not creating the traffic.  He has not found this money.  He has really got <Col N="190" /> no authority over it other than what this Parliament will give him.  He correctly expressed the opinion of the Dáil here when he said there was no desire on the part of anybody to interfere with the internal policy or control of the hospitals.  I understood from the Parliamentary Secretary on the last day that this Bill was discussed that if the amendment which I then proposed to submit were not found to be acceptable, the Parliamentary Secretary would at least take the trouble to offer an alternative amendment or to make some suggestions as to how this amendment might be accepted in order to give some security to the hospitals that there was no intention of interfering with them.  I submit that these two words &ldquo;simplest reform,&rdquo; which the Parliamentary Secretary used, disclose that there is something in the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary on this whole question of interference which has not been disclosed before this.  What does it mean?  Surely it does not mean the keeping of proper accounts, the getting of statistical information and the information with regard to beds, of which the Parliamentary Secretary spoke.  Surely there is something else, because that information has been given already and is already in the possession of the Minister or of his Committee of Reference. Has there been an objection on the part of the hospital controlling bodies all over the country to have standard accounts or to submit plans for improvements or extensions or anything of that sort, or an objection to giving particulars regarding costs per head or any other information that the Minister has asked for?  If not, what then is the real objection to this amendment? It must be that there is an intention of interfering in some way or other with the hospitals.  We had a lot of talk on the last day as to the internal policy of these hospitals and how they should be run.  Let it be remembered that these institutions were there before this Dáil existed; that they helped the poor before this Dáil came into existence; that they gave assistance and medical treatment to people long before there was any thought of the hospitals sweepstakes <Col N="191" /> and that the sweepstakes, while a benefit to the hospitals, nevertheless have dried up sources of income of these institutions which we cannot restore, and which the Minister cannot restore.  The hospitals have at least a prima facie case in respect of those losses which ought to be considered without any possible interference on the part of the Ministry.  I do say that, whatever apprehensions there may be regarding the question of interference, they are not in any way helped by the statement the Parliamentary Secretary has made.</P>

      <P>The amendment which stood in my name and which was withdrawn was an amendment to the effect that the Minister should not <Col N="192" /> interfere with the internal policy of any hospital to which a grant was made.  That amendment was withdrawn on the condition, as I understood it, that the Parliamentary Secretary himself would look into it and that Deputy Cosgrave would look into it, in order to try to find an amendment that would be more in keeping with what our desire was, and to have things cleared up.  The state of affairs now is that my amendment is gone and cannot be brought up again, and it was withdrawn on the understanding that either the Parliamentary Secretary or Deputy Cosgrave would produce an amendment that would meet the situation.</P>

      <P>Amendments 11 and 12 go together.  I move:</P>
      <P>11. In page 12, line 2, Section 24 (4), to delete all from the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;thereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>12. In page 12, line 12, Section 24 (5), to delete the words &ldquo;or of any such particular payment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The words to be deleted gave rise to some apprehension that the Minister might possibly vary the original conditions when making the payment of an instalment.  Deputy Cosgrave on the 31st May said: &ldquo;As it stands, it looks as if there might be a hold up .... the Minister might propose something that was not contemplated under the contract.&rdquo;  As has been stated already, in the case of a grant certain conditions will be imposed and a contract will be entered into.  Once that is done no new conditions will be added.  The words to be deleted are not really material to the sub-section.  They can be omitted without giving rise to any difficulty or inconvenience.  I think that meets the point on which Deputy Cosgrave expressed some anxiety on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 13:</P>
      <P>In page 12, Section 24, to delete sub-sections (6), (7), and (8) and substitute a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6)  A grant made by the Minister under this section for the benefit of any existing or proposed hospital or nursing organisation may be made for all or any of the following purposes, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the purchase of land or buildings, including any superior or outstanding estate or interest in land or buildings;</P>
      <P>(b)  the construction of buildings;</P>
      <P>(c)  the reconstruction, extension, alteration or improvement of buildings;</P>
      <P>(d)  the purchase of hospital, nursing and other equipment;</P>
      <P>(e)  the endowment of any such hospital or nursing organisation or any part of the activities of any such hospital or nursing organisation, including in the case of any such hospital the endowment of a bed or beds in such hospital;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> (f)  the payment of maintenance expenses;</P>
    <P>(g)  the discharge of debts.</P>
    <P>Apart from the slight verbal changes the only difference between this sub-section and sub-section (4) as introduced is the addition of paragraph (f) dealing with the payment of maintenance expenses.  The position now is that a grant can be made for every conceivable purpose connected with hospitals: land, purchase of sites for building, equipment, maintenance and endowment and for the payment of debts.  Sub-sections (7) and (8) are no longer necessary as the prohibition against grants being made towards future maintenance has been dropped and the definition of grantee has been transferred to the new sub-section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points arise on this new sub-section.  The first is as regards its construction.  I should say that the discharge of debts ought to be placed first in connection with the distribution of moneys.  The payment of maintenance expenses ought to be placed second, and then let the others follow in the order set out.  I can quite understand that it is more stylish as it stands, but I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, as I am interested in his salvation, I would not like him to appear before the Judgment Seat without having all his obligations in this world discharged, and, apparently, he is undertaking an obligation here.  The second point is as regards the maintenance expenses.  Apparently what the Parliamentary Secretary feels in connection with that is that the disposition of his Department would be to evade payment until the last moment.  In other words, to let the debts run to the end of the year before payment is made.  I do not think that is a good system.  People ought to know what they have to spend, and even though it may mean an imprest account I should say that would be more satisfactory than the other arrangement.  I think the maintenance expenses ought to be provided for rather than met at the end of the period.  As the sub-section is drawn it is <Col N="196" /> not clear which way it is intended to go.  What will happen if people have to wait until the end of the year is that it will be some time after its expiration before the accounts will be made up.  Then there is always a doubt in the minds of persons or of committees as to whether the full amount will be forthcoming or whether there would be any objection to it. I would like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary's interpretation of the new sub-section is in the light of what I have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be considered, perhaps, by the institutions in which Deputy Cosgrave is particularly interested that the discharge of debts should be a primary consideration.  Maintenance will be largely provided for by endowment.  Hence, once an endowment is made, it will provide in perpetuity a certain annual income which will go to the maintenance of an institution, or to the maintenance of patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation of the position is that a certain sum will be ear-marked for endowment, and the endowment will be the future maintenance. It will obviously take a considerable time to investigate the needs of the various hospitals that will ultimately participate, and to arrive at the figure that could reasonably be calculated to cover all future endowments. In the meantime, it may be necessary to make year to year advances in the form of grants to cover maintenance. Whether it would be possible to make <Col N="197" /> such grants at the beginning of the year, to estimate in advance what the probable outlay under any particular heading would be, I am not in a position to say at the moment.  But if necessary a rough estimate could be prepared and a grant made during the transfer period, while the Commission is investigating and reporting.  If it were found that the grants made were not sufficient to cover the entire maintenance expenses, then a supplementary grant could be made at the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I strongly recommend the method of making a grant, and for two reasons.  One is that if the hospitals have an overdraft the costs incidental to that are high.  On the other hand, the saving which would be effected by not paying until the end of the year&mdash;I have in mind the interest side of it&mdash;would not be so great.</P>

      <P>In page 12, before Section 25, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister shall not have power to alter the constitution or to interfere in the administration of any hospital which does not receive any benefit from any sweepstake promoted under the Public Charitable Hospitals Acts, 1930 to 1932, or under this Act, or which does not receive any grant from any local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know, a Chinn Chomhairle, whether you were in the Chair when this amendment was before the House on a previous occasion, but I agreed to withdraw it, because I understood very clearly from the Parliamentary Secretary that he was willing either to bring in a slightly altered amendment in this form, or to insert some change in the definitions by which a hospital would be defined as one that was going to get a benefit from the sweepstakes.  I found, however, when the amendments for Report Stage were circulated that such an amendment did not appear, and accordingly I put down this amendment, which I had moved in Committee, again.  I want to say this: that I do not want to be at all nasty to the <Col N="198" /> Parliamentary Secretary, but on several occasions he gave me to understand that he was quite willing to accept the amendment.  In following out the promise that he made to me I went so far as to tell the people who had asked me to propose the amendment that the Parliamentary Secretary was willing to accept it.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary in answer to a point made by Deputy O'Sullivan said: &ldquo;That is so, we are not going to interfere with any hospital that is not looking for any money out of the sweepstakes.&rdquo;  I quote further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Professor O'Sullivan: That will be made clear in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ward: Yes, we will accept that amendment.</P>
    <P>Professor Thrift: Will the point not arise in connection with other sections?</P>
    <P>Dr. Ward: Anywhere it arises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to press this matter too much.  I only want to say this, that I was led to believe that the Parliamentary Secretary was quite willing to accept the amendment.  I told the people interested that he had told me that he was willing to accept it.  If he now refuses to accept the amendment, he will be putting me in a more or less awkward position.  I do not see any reason for not accepting the amendment as it stands, and I accordingly move.</P>

      <P>There is no going back whatever of the undertaking I gave in earlier discussions of this Bill to Deputy Sir James Craig and other Deputies who were interested in this matter.  There is no intention whatever of interfering in the manner suggested in the amendment.  I am definitely advised by the legal advisers and by the Parliamentary draftsman that the Minister has no power to interfere where the hospital is not a participating hospital and that it is altogether foolish to insert an amendment to try to prevent the Minister doing something which he has no legal power to do.  It is on that basis I am opposing the amendment.  I have no objection to the amendment except that I am advised that it is entirely <Col N="199" /> superfluous and there is no need for it.</P>

      <P>If there never had been the precedent that a statement was always made on the Estimate itself, together with a statement on the general position with regard to agriculture and the policy that was being pursued, one would imagine that under the present conditions, some statement of policy would be made.  The fact <Col N="201" /> that no statement was made is all the more remarkable when we consider the attitude taken up by the Minister when, from the Opposition Benches, two years ago, he last spoke on the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture.  At that time, the Minister as reported in column 1977 of the proceedings of the 27th May, 1931, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister in his opening statement did not give us any very clear or general review of the result of the working of his Department as he did in previous years.  On previous occasions he was inclined to tell us what were the effects and the good results of the various Acts that had been passed under the wise administration of his Department.  It would appear that he was not very much inclined to go on that line in presenting his Estimate this year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the attitude of the present Minister on that occasion.  He drew attention to the fact that it had been the custom not only to deal with the Estimate itself, but also with general policy, and the general position in regard to agriculture.  This complaint was made even when the then Minister went carefully and in detail through his Estimate.  It is therefore all the more astounding that no statement, good, bad or indifferent, is made under the present circumstances.  If there is any feature outstanding with regard to the present Estimate, it is that £81,000 odd less is being provided for the assistance of the creamery industry than was provided in the last Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a situation in the country which has been described by the Minister and his colleagues as a blessing in disguise.  The disguise at the present moment is so thick that the Minister apparently cannot get any exact picture of that situation.  If the Minister wishes an expression of opinion from individual farmers, or farmers at meetings, or even if he takes the local Press, he will find that this industry which is of such importance, and which he especially is supposed to look after, is labouring under such difficulties at the present moment that the farmers declare that they are not in a position to meet their obligations, either as regards their ordinary debts or as <Col N="202" /> regards State debts in respect to which the Minister and his colleagues have informed them that they will get no mercy if they do not pay.  The persons engaged in the industry for which the Minister is responsible are in such serious difficulties at the present moment that they are taking up the attitude that they are not able to support the machinery of local government, or to contribute towards the general taxation imposed on them.  They find themselves reducing, as Deputies of the Minister's Party have pointed out, the number of persons they have employed, and in many cases reducing wages. They find themselves up against the question of the conservation of their capital.</P>
    <P>If there was ever a time at which, in order that the Dáil might discuss what the Minister had to say, a statement should be made, I submit it is the present time but, on the contrary, the Minister, in reply to Deputy Dillon, stated that he wanted to hear what other Deputies had to say.  The Minister on the last occasion heard something of what other Deputies had to say.  In order that the House might discuss this Estimate with fairness to itself and the Minister, I would suggest that the Minister should now make a statement on the general position.  I have had put before me statements by some persons who are in fairly close touch with general financial conditions. The Minister for Finance would, I am sure, say that the inspectors of taxes throughout the country were very keenly alive to the general position of the finances of the country.</P>
    <P>I have had drawn to my attention a statement made by an inspector of taxes to a person in one of our principal dairying counties, on the question of what wages ought to be paid in the agricultural industry at the present time.  This inspector pointed out to this person, who was making certain claims with regard to wages in connection with income tax, that amounts of £1 12/- per week to John so-and-so, £1 5/- per week to Michael so-and-so, and 14/- per week to Patrick so-and-so, were surely excessive for milk men, as such work was usually performed by women who <Col N="203" /> could be obtained at 5/-, 6/- and 7/- a week.  You have the position that in March last you had Finance officials pointing out to a farmer, engaged in what the Minister himself, I think, has described as the basis of the agricultural industry, namely, the diarying industry, that 32/-, 25/- and 14/- a week for men were, surely, excessive wages, and suggesting that instead of employing men, even at these small wages, women should be employed and that suitable wages for women were 5/-, 6/- and 7/- per week.</P>
    <P>The aspect of the dairying industry that meets us here in the City of Dublin is, first, that we have to pay something over 75 per cent. more for butter than the world price.  Citizens of Dublin have to pay 1/4 a lb., as against a world price approximately of 9d. per lb. for butter.  It is the basis of our agricultural industry.  I think the Minister committed himself to that statement.  At any rate, it is a very important part of our agricultural industry.  Statistics available in 1926 show that our exports of butter alone were about 4½ millions, whereas the total consumption in the Free State of the produce of our farmers was 11½ millions.  So that our butter export was one-third or more than the total consumption in the Free State of the product of the Irish farmer.  Therefore, it is an important part of our industry, and that important part of our industry is in such a condition that we have to pay 1/4 per lb. for butter in the City of Dublin as against the world price of 9d. per lb., and the Finance officials administering the Government's policy are telling the people engaged in that industry, which is one of our principal dairying industries, that wages of 32/-, 25/- and 14/- per week for milkmen are excessive and indicating that women can be obtained at wages of 5/-, 6/- and 7/- per week.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the farmers are in difficulties.  He knows that the farmers are getting rid of their employees; that they are reducing their wages, and that they are in difficult circumstances with regard to the conservation of their capital.  If <Col N="204" /> the policy he is pursuing is a blessing, I think that at this stage, with the effect on the country, generally, that the farmers' difficulties are having, and are going to have, he ought, when dealing with the Estimate, at least remove the disguise and let the farmers see something of the blessing involved in his policy.  Otherwise there may be too great a dislocation of labour in our agricultural industry; there may be too great a reduction of wages, and there may be too great an exhaustion of the farmers' capital. I suggest that it is an astounding thing that in a way absolutely without precedent, and in these unprecedented circumstances, the Minister should introduce this Estimate and make no statement on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Only one Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches has so far thought fit to intervene in this debate on the most important Estimate in the whole series.  The Minister himself introduced the Estimate without making any statement whatever.  I think that is almost unprecedented on the part of the Minister dealing with such an important Estimate as this, more especially when the Estimate for this year shows a reduction of, approximately, £100,000 as compared with last year, and when that reduction has been made by savings on very important sub-heads. I notice that there is a decrease of over £1,294 under sub-head (I), which provides for special schemes in the congested districts.  The Gaeltacht was always the adopted child of the Fianna Fáil Party, and when they were in opposition they never ceased singing the woes of the unfortunate people in the Gaeltacht.  During the lifetime of the last Government a subcommittee was appointed for the purpose of ascertaining what effective steps should be taken for the purpose of bringing some relief to these people.  I was a member for a period of about 12 months of the Gaeltacht Economic Committee, which recommended quite a number of schemes for the approval of different Ministers. Practically all these schemes were approved of.  I notice from the <Col N="205" /> Estimate that the most important scheme of all, that providing money for the reclamation of land, has not been in operation for the last ten months.  According to the Estimate only £10 was spent.  I should like to know from the Minister what has happened that particular scheme.  That scheme was approved of by his predecessor and, so far as I can recollect, a substantial sum of money was set aside for the purpose of enabling the small farmers in the congested areas to carry out works of reclamation on their own holdings. Everybody who knows anything about conditions in the congested areas, particularly in areas like Connemara, parts of Mayo and Donegal, will realise the importance of work of that character.  I should like to know from the Minister if he has definitely abandoned that scheme, and if it is the policy of the Government not to proceed with that scheme, which was approved of, as I say, by his predecessor in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice also there is a very big reduction in the amount of money provided in the Estimates under the sub-head for the improvement of the creamery industry in this country.  Whatever may be said of the Minister's policy in some respects and certainly in many respects&mdash;and I have nothing complimentary to say of it in those respects &mdash;I must certainly admit that the creamery industry is the one industry in the country which has held its own, and this is due largely to the subsidies which the State provides for the production of butter and for the export of butter.  Yet the Minister has reduced that Estimate by £81,800.  In the sub-head it is stated that this money is to be utilised for the purpose of providing &ldquo;funds for the purchase of creameries and associated businesses; the extension of the redundant creameries; the reorganisation and sale of non-redundant undertakings to co-operative creamery societies; and the expenses of liquidation and carrying on business pending reorganisation and sale.&rdquo;  I think it has been recognised for quite a long time that the creamery industry needs reorganisation and that it needs reorganisation <Col N="206" /> badly.  There are a great many redundant creameries in many counties.  It was the intention of the Minister's predecessor to carry out schemes of reorganisation in many counties.  The Estimates prepared during the time the Minister's predecessor was in office provided substantial sums for this purpose. The present Minister, presumably, has abandoned any intention of proceeding further with that very necessary work, if one is to judge by the huge decrease in the amount provided in this year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>I have discussed on more than one occasion the reorganisation scheme in one particular county and the Minister is quite familiar with the circumstances to which I refer.  But the circumstances of the creamery industry in that particular county are not peculiar to the County Sligo.  There is a need and a very great need in many other counties as well as Sligo for a reorganisation scheme, and if the creamery industry is to be put on a safe, sound and firm foundation it seems to me that the Minister must spend money for the purpose of carrying out the schemes of reorganisation on which his predecessor embarked.</P>
    <P>One more reason why some of the creameries in the country are in a bad financial condition is that they are not getting an economic supply of milk. There are not 25 per cent.&mdash;perhaps I should say 35 per cent.&mdash;of the creameries in the country at the present moment receiving an economic milk supply.  Naturally when a creamery is not receiving an economic milk supply that creamery will find itself at the end of the year in, perhaps, an embarrassed financial condition.</P>
    <P>This money to which I refer was provided for the purpose of relieving that situation and situations of that kind, and for the purpose of enabling the Minister in control of the Department of Agriculture to carry out a scheme of reorganisation in each county and to group two or three adjacent creameries into one, so as to ensure that the reorganised creamery would have an adequate milk supply. This decrease in the sub-head is altogether abnormal in the circumstances. <Col N="207" /> As we have received no explanation and no reason from the Minister as to why he has decreased this Estimate, I can only assume that he is abandoning the scheme for the reorganisation of creamery areas and other schemes of a similar character on which this money was spent.</P>
    <P>There are many other items in the Estimate on which savings have been effected this year, but these are the two principal ones.  I do not propose to deal with the others just at the moment.  The amounts in any event in the other cases are not very large, and the Minister may have some very good reason to offer why such reductions were carried out.  It is customary in an Estimate of this kind to criticise the policy of the Department which the Minister administers.  A great many debates have taken place in the past few weeks on the subject of agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very little can be said on that particular subject that has not already been said.  Judging by the speech which the Minister made last night it appears that it is the policy of the Government that the economic war is to continue, and that the farmers of this country would be asked to endure such accentuated sufferings as they are bound to meet from time to time while that economic war is imposed on them.  It is interesting in the light of the Minister's statement to recall the efforts which are made by other countries to catch a foothold in the British markets, of which the Minister and his Government have deliberately by their policy practically deprived our farmers.  A few weeks ago the Danes succeeded in making an agreement with the British Government by means of which that country is guaranteed a very big portion of the British market for a period of three years.  She has been promised the allocation of not less than 62 per cent. of the total permitted bacon imports into England.  She can send as much as 2,300,000 cwts. of bacon and 5½ million great hundreds of eggs into <Col N="208" /> Britain, while any reduction in the quantity of a free import is to be made as gradually as possible.  Under the terms of that contract the imports into Britain of Danish produce cannot be reduced, but these imports can at any time be increased by an arrangement with Great Britain.</P>
      <P>A similar agreement has been made with the Argentine, and judging by the reports in the British Press it seems that similar agreements are to be entered into by Great Britain with other countries.  We, as I say, have lost a very large share of the British market already.  The Danes will not allow any sentimental nonsense to stand in their way to secure a still larger share of that market.  If Great Britain pursues her present policy of extending her trade in return for an extension of trade with other countries and if she is prepared to make concessions to them in the same direction as she has already made to Denmark, what will be the position of this country in another two or three years?  Is it not quite conceivable if this tendency on the part of Great Britain is continued for a period of two or three years that by the end of that time we may have lost the British market entirely?</P>
      <P>If it is to be taken as a settled policy of the Minister and his Government to continue this economic war, and to go on saddling the people of the country with taxation for the purpose of enabling the farmers to get their cattle, other farm animals and farm produce into the British market, what will be the position at the end of another two or three years when the taxation will have reached such a point that the farmers will not be able to pay it no matter what subsidies are given to them?  At the end of that time they will probably not be able to get into the British market at all with any of their produce.  Whatever may be said about other aspects of the Fianna Fáil policy the Minister and the Government are certainly not justified in any circumstances whatever in making a plaything, as they have done, with the main industry of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it was their duty and their responsibility as well to take stock of <Col N="209" /> the situation when they entered on the responsibilities of Government.  It was their duty to pause before making any change.  If they had taken stock of the situation, if they had paused and ascertained, as they should have done and as it was their duty to do, the full circumstances relating to the trade of this country with Great Britain and relating the trade of the country to the political ties which connect the two countries, the position would be different now.  If they were possessed of commonsense at all they would have looked to these things before embarking on a policy of the kind they have embarked on, a policy which must inevitably mean an end of the export trade in agricultural produce between this country and Great Britain.  The Minister's policy has impoverished the country. There is no doubt at all about that.  The farmers are gradually becoming poorer and if the same policy is continued for another year or two I believe the majority of the farmers will be in such a state that it will not be possible for any Government, no matter how capable or competent they may be, to restore confidence and initiate it in them again.</P>
    <P>All the expedients which the Minister has been forced to resort to to bolster up his policy are bound to fail.  The aim of any sane agricultural policy should be to stimulate prices, not to depreciate them.  The effect of the Minister's policy has been to depreciate agricultural prices all round.  After all, if the Minister compares the average price of beef at present on the British market with the average price on the Dublin market, he will find that there is a very wide disparity.  For the week ending 18th May, the average price in the British market was 38/4½, and in Dublin the average price was 27/6&mdash;a difference of 10/10½.  For the week ending 25th May, the average price on the British market was 37/9, and on the Dublin market 26/9&mdash;a difference of 11/-.  For the week ending 1st June, the average price on the British market was 37/8, and on the Dublin market 26/3&mdash;a difference of 11/5. Some time ago, in a debate here on <Col N="210" /> agriculture, the Minister said that there was very little difference between the price on the Dublin market and the price on the British market.  I do not know whether the Minister was quite serious or not when he made that statement.  In any event, if the Minister takes the trouble to compare the prices on the British and Dublin markets for the early weeks of this year, he will find that there was a much wider difference than the difference during recent weeks.</P>
    <P>To offset the decline in the price of live stock, the Minister's policy is to encourage the farmers to go in extensively for the production of grain&mdash;for tillage.  I wonder if the Minister has taken the trouble to envisage the conditions which such a policy will bring about.  Surely, if our export market is lost to us, as, in my opinion, it is bound to be lost to us if the Government persist in their present policy, what is the use of encouraging the people of this country to till more?  If the farmers are to embark on a tillage policy, surely they ought to have some guarantee that that policy will pay them.  Under present circumstances, what possible guarantee can the Minister offer that tillage&mdash;the production of grain crops or even root crops&mdash;will be a paying proposition?  The Minister must know&mdash;I am perfectly sure that his officials will have advised him&mdash;that, under present circumstances and under present world conditions, it is impossible to make the production of grain or even the production of most root crops, a paying proposition.  If Deputies look up the price of grain in most of the European countries, they will find that these prices have been depreciating for the last three or four years and that they are still falling.  At the present moment there is a very rapid decline.  The only line of our agricultural economy that was paying was the production of live stock.  The Minister and his Government have deliberately, by their policy, destroyed that line of our agricultural economy.  As I said a moment ago, this whole question of <Col N="211" /> Fianna Fáil policy with regard to agricultural has been discussed here on so many occasions recently that there is very little for anyone to say which has not been already said in a previous debate.  But I want the Minister, when he is replying, to let the country know quite definitely whether it is the considered and definite policy of his Government that this economic war should be continued even at the risk of losing the British market absolutely.  If that is the deliberate and considered policy of the Minister and his Government, what substitute for that market is the Minister prepared to offer the farmers?  The farmers want an answer to those questions.  The Minister has, so far, carefully refrained from giving any indication as to what his policy will be in the event of that market being eventually lost to us.  What other line of agricultural economy are the farmers to follow?  Can the Minister indicate any other line which can be made to pay under any circumstances and, particularly, under existing circumstances? The Minister toyed more or less with that question when replying to Deputy O'Donovan's motion. Deputies expect now that the Minister will give a definite and explicit answer to the question as to what his policy will be in the event of our losing the British market as, in my opinion, we are bound to do if this economic war is continued to the bitter end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring a couple of matters to the notice of the Minister for his consideration.  The first refers to the creameries.  In East Cork, where I come from, there is a great scarcity of auxiliary creameries.  The one creamery which we have is in Castlelyons&mdash;a co-operative creamery. For the past month milk has been sent from within a radius of 20 miles to that creamery, with the result that they find it very hard to cope with the supply.  Milk has been delivered there in the morning from 7 o'clock to 11 o'clock.  The milk that cannot get through the creamery has to go back, sour and unsaleable, to the farmers <Col N="212" /> At the last election the Fianna Fáil candidates in East Cork promised that, if they got back to power, auxiliary creameries would be established all over the constituency.  So far, not one of these auxiliary creameries has been established.  It is a great hardship on the farmers that they should have to send milk long distances to the co-operative creamery at Castlelyons. The establishment of a creamery in Lisgoold was in contemplation.  That would be a very central situation and would take a lot of the work off those who have to go into Castlelyons creamery.  Nothing, however, has been done.  On one thing I have to congratulate the Minister.  He has got the farmers' sons and daughters up very early in the mornings so as to get the cows milked and send the milk into Castlelyons.  To early rising, I have no objection.  If people rise early and work late, it shows that they are, at least, industrious.  I hope that the Minister will take serious notice of what I have said, and extend assistance to those who are anxious to establish these auxiliary creameries.</P>
      <P>As regards the sale of calves in the spring months, a lot of these calves are imported from outside areas and have been hawked all over the country from one fair to another.  They carry a certain amount of disease into the farmers' places and it takes a considerable time to eradicate it.  I think the Minister would be well advised to send a veterinary inspector to examine these calves before they are put into the market for sale.  There is another matter: The best of the heifers at present are leaving the country.  They are sold at prices from £1 to 30/- per head and it is a very serious thing for the milk industry that the best of our stock should be going across to English farms.  We will be in a different position later on to supply the needs of our dairies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards flax, very little has been done.  In my opinion it is a very important industry to develop.  There is a small sum in the Estimates, a couple of hundred pounds, to be devoted to the improvement of flax growing.  Some years ago there was a flax factory in Cork, and the farmers <Col N="213" /> around Watergrasshill district and other parts of the country derived great benefit from it.  It does not require rich land to grow flax and the industry should be encouraged by the Department of Agriculture.  The policy of the Government and of the Department of Agriculture has been debated here before, and I have very little to say about it, but I certainly hope that the outcome of the Economic Conference, to be held in London, will be satisfactory and will bring about a successful termination of our troubles.  The Minister said last night that no proposals were put before him as to what was to be done.  If I am in order, I would suggest one proposal at this stage: We do not want the Government, or President de Valera, to go hat in hand to the British Government asking for a settlement.  I would suggest that there should be a round table conference of the leaders of all the different Parties of this House with a view to hammering out a solution that would bring this deplorable economic war to a successful and honourable end for all parties concerned. If it goes on for another 12 months I am very much afraid that the people will be on the verge of starvation and misery and ruin.  I, for one, feel awfully anxious about the conditions that exist in the country at the present moment.  They are becoming very serious and I sincerely hope that in the very near future the conditions under which the farmers are existing at the present moment will be completely changed, and that they may hope for something for their labour and their time.  They cannot be satisfied with war for all time.  Therefore, for the peace and prosperity of the country, it is up to all Parties in this House to do their utmost to unite in one effort to bring this economic war to a successful termination.  There is one more matter that I object to and it is this: the huge sum of money spent on the Department of Agriculture.  It is a staggering amount considering the position of the country at the moment. Salaries are paid to officials which the country cannot afford.  I think they should be drastically reduced.  The reductions that have taken place under the Economics Bill, at the moment, are <Col N="214" /> not sufficient.  If there are to be sacrifices, let every class make sacrifices as well as the farmers.  We cannot carry on the economic fight unless we are supplied with the sinews of war.  The farmers at the present moment are down and out.  They are looking certainly with hope to the Economic Conference and I do trust that it will bring good results, and bring about an honourable settlement of which the Irish people would be proud and pleased, and one also that would be honourable to the English Government.</P>

      <P>As several speakers pointed out, we are in a difficulty in discussing this Estimate. It is in many respects much the same as that presented by the Government that represents the Party now sitting on this side of the House.  But the procedure of the Minister reminds me somewhat of the procedure adopted, a year ago, by the then Minister for Justice, who assumed that because the items in the Estimate were the same as those of his predecessor, the policy was the same and, therefore, no explanation was due to the House. I suggest that in that way the House is at a disadvantage because the Minister must know, as the Minister for Justice must have known at the time, that in some respects there was a complete reversal of policy.  There are many things, such as those mentioned by Deputy Roddy and Deputy Kent, that the country and the House want to know about before they can usefully discuss the general policy of the Minister.  Having listened to some of the Deputies opposite, and having listened to and read some of the contributions from the Minister for Agriculture, I find it extremely difficult to know where, precisely, the Government stands so far as agriculture is concerned.  They seem to me to be travelling along two divergent lines, and although that may be extremely uncomfortable for themselves after a while, they want to compel the country to do the same, and I am afraid that would be disastrous for the country.  According to one account their frame of mind seems to be the following:&mdash;&ldquo;We <Col N="215" /> want economic independence, therefore get out of the English market.&rdquo; Getting out of the English market in practice means we are going to have no foreign market for our surplus agricultural produce, at least no foreign market with a price that will pay the farmers of this country to produce any surplus.  It is no comfort to the farmers of this country to learn from the newspapers that prices of their surplus stock have fallen so low that it has induced some Continental countries to come into our markets as buyers.  That is a practical demonstration that prices have fallen very low indeed.  But the advent of these buyers, so far as I can make out, was not to be accompanied by an increased price for commodities.</P>
      <P>As I say, that is one line of policy pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party and, unfortunately, it is the dominating line, so far as I can see.  It is a line of policy dictated not by economic reasons, not by reasons of the interests of agriculture in this country but by politics in the ordinary sense&mdash; international politics, if you like. &ldquo;Get out of the English market&rdquo; and you may say &ldquo;and thereby make yourself independent.&rdquo;  That, I suggest, is the aim of the one definite line of policy pursued by Fianna Fáil. It is the policy that is dominant at the moment and it is the policy that often finds expression in the speeches of most of the members of the Ministry and of many of their followers.  A great deal of the special pleading we hear in this House, a great deal of what I consider the cruel deception often practised on the people of the country about the alleged comparatively bad prices in Great Britain, is really meant to back up that particular line of policy&mdash;the line of policy that says &ldquo;Get out of the English market&rdquo; or, if you put it in another way, &ldquo;We have got out of the English market; we have been driven out of it and we have lost nothing by that.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that all these misquotations of figures we have had, again and again, these suggestions that there is no reasonable or comparatively <Col N="216" /> good price for agricultural produce in England, are solely dictated as an attempt to justify that policy&mdash;the policy that has driven us out of the English market.  That is one particular line that the Fianna Fáil Party is going along but there is another line, and, though it seems, at first, to run parallel with the line I have described, it diverges after a short time.  Again, starting from the desire to become economically independent, with that <i>a priori</i> fashion of reasoning so favoured of the Government, it proceeds to set out that, therefore, we must produce at home the basic food&mdash;wheat. Wheat means more tillage; more wheat means rotation of crops and rotation of crops means more cattle. The Minister said that was quite right when that was put up to him by, I think, Deputy Belton, and he was glad that we saw it at last.  Why, then, he asks, do we accuse the Ministry of wanting to do away with cattle?  We, again and again, put up to him that if this wheat policy is a success, he will have to have more cattle, but I suggest that an acknowledgment of that truth as merely a theoretical truth does not carry us anywhere, so long as he does not draw the practical inference from it, which is &ldquo;Get the market for that increased cattle production.&rdquo;  What is the good of the Minister saying here that his policy means not merely more tillage but greater production of live stock, when, as I say, the general policy of the Government seems to be framed with the express purpose of seeing that we have no market not merely for the increased production of live stock but, even, for the live stock we have at the present moment? I suggest that a purely theoretical acknowledgment by the Minister and a mere statement that his policy means that, is simply playing with the country, unless he is prepared to put it into practice.</P>
    <P>Does anybody suggest that, with the present policy of the Government, so far as our principal market&mdash;practically, our only market&mdash;for agricultural produce is concerned, it is going to pay to produce more cattle and other forms <Col N="217" /> of agricultural produce unless that market is restored?  We have here two conflicting lines of policy on the part of Fianna Fáil.  They can play on whichever instrument they like as suits their particular audience.  If it was a mere case of a verbal contradiction on the part of the Minister, I should pay no attention to it but it is a contradiction that strikes at the very root of the economic well-being of agriculture in this country.  It is time the Ministry made up its mind as to what it wants and that is the reason why I think the House has a right to complain that, on this most important Estimate, the Minister has given no indication as to where he stands in that particular matter.  Is he or is he not in favour of an increased production of live stock? According to one line of his reasoning and one portion of his policy, he seems to be in favour of it.  Why, then, does he not take steps to see that we get that particular production of live stock made remunerative so far as the farmers are concerned, that, in other words, we get back the market for that surplus?  You cannot have it both ways and, remember, it is not merely the general policy&mdash;we know what that is&mdash; but we have the definite statement.  We had, very clearly, last November, I think, from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the definite statement that so far as that market was concerned</P>
    <P>it does not matter whether England put on a tariff of 10 per cent. or 50 per cent. or 100 per cent.  We cannot stay in that market.  It may be that we may continue exporting these things at a loss to get credits abroad, just as happens in the case of Russia.</P>
    <P>That is the policy as expounded last November by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the colleague of the Minister here.  Now, I suggest that there is no good pretending that you are in favour of an increased live-stock production in this country so long as you take up that attitude.  It can mean nothing except economic disaster for the country.  Not merely that jumping from one foot to the other but trying to drive the country along divergent lines can only mean disaster and, therefore, that is why we feel <Col N="218" /> that a mere lip service to the desirability, even, the necessity, of foreign markets is no good.  It is simply the usual policy of the Government of extreme callousness to the sufferings of the farming community and to the destruction of the agricultural industry in this country.</P>
    <P>I must say that I do echo the hope that was expressed by Deputy Kent that again an effort will be made at the coming Conference to reach some settlement on this matter and I trust that the hopes of the country will not be disappointed, because I fear very seriously, not merely the economic results of such a disappointment, but even more the moral results of such a disappointment.  There is a certain point to which the callousness of the Government may drive the country; and if we confine ourselves to economic results the worst disasters may not be reached.  But I trust that the Government are now wise enough to see that a settlement of this question is necessary and that they realise that every day that passes spells increased economic danger and other danger to this country, if a settlement is not reached. It was only the other day that we opened our Press and saw that even the bacon trade was threatened by a new development.  It is threatened already, but it is further threatened by new developments.  Let us hope that wiser counsels will prevail with the Government and that they will not be dragooned by the speeches we sometimes hear from some of their back benchers about not surrendering and not giving way in anything.  What the country wants is a real effort at settlement. We hope, and I think every Party in this House echoes the hope, that there will be such a settlement.</P>
    <P>As I said, you have the Government speaking with different voices, and one of these voices is in favour of more production. But what is to happen to the increased production when you have got it?  No one suggests that the home market will be sufficient to pay the farmer, not merely for his wheat, but for the root crops and the beasts that he must produce to make that wheat policy thinkable.  There may be certain difficulties inherent in the wheat <Col N="219" /> policy, but, as an element in the general agricultural policy of this country, there are bigger difficulties.  I suggest in that connection that the market is one of the principal considerations.  As every farmer now knows to his cost, the question of the market is a prime consideration.  What is the good of Deputies coming along here, or making speeches in the country, and suggesting that the English market is worthless?  Figures were quoted by Deputy Roddy from different trade journals.  I have one Scottish journal here, from which it is quite clear that there is a tremendous difference per cwt. between the price that cattle realise in 20 or 30 British markets, and the price realised in Dublin.  Will anybody tell me that when a beast two years old, weighing 8 cwt. is bought in Kerry, and when £6 is paid on it in the way of duty when going to England, that there is still practically no difference between the price prevailing in the market here and the price prevailing on the other side of the Channel?  Are the cattle buyers such extraordinary philanthropists that they are paying the duty out of their own pockets?  The thing is practically ludicrous.  It is the usual case of cruel deception, deception with no argument to back it up, or to justify the disastrous policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the wheat policy of the Minister.  Possibly in a couple of years we shall be in a position to decide whether it is or is not a failure. I suggest that any chance of success it may have is intimately bound up with the cattle trade that the Government so despises, with the export of the surplus agricultural stock, which very often they pretend to despise, and a market for it.  But I always felt that there is this danger where a bounty is concerned, that a number of people who in their hearts feel that the experiment will not be an economic proposition may be induced to grow it by the bounty, and I am not aware that there is anything in the Act, notwithstanding efforts made on the different stages, to show that the wheat is of a useable quality.</P>

      <P>Here is a case where nothing at all illegal need have been done, and I expected that, having got the assent of the House to the Bill, there would be some Estimate.

      <P>I suggest that if the Government was keen on jumping at illegalities, even after a Second Reading&mdash;so far as the Economies Bill is concerned&mdash;that when the Dáil passed a Bill through all stages last December the Government could, at least, have done what <Col N="221" /> was not illegal by providing an Estimate. However, apparently they have a conscience, but like their policy, sometimes, it is very difficult to understand.  So far as that Act is concerned, even if it is a success in certain portions of the country, I feel that the poorer farmers and the poorer land, especially in the constituency I represent, will be paying very heavily for it in the way of the bounty that the State will have to give.  As that is the point I made when the Bill was passing through the Dáil I do not want to repeat it.  I say that by their disastrous policy of destroying our markets, and at the same time pretending to increase tillage&mdash;which ultimately means that we will have to find markets for the increased agricultural produce&mdash;they are bringing disaster on the country, and I can only re-echo the hope that the opportunity now offered by the conference in London will be utilised by the Government to bring about a settlement.</P>

      <P>On this Estimate I want to pay a tribute to the Department of Agriculture for the very useful work it has carried out during its existence of some forty years.  I remember when the Department was established, since when it has done useful work.  For a short time I was connected with the Department in connection with a very useful commodity which is now extinct.  I have listened to debates on this Estimate for the past ten years.  There was very little criticism of the work of the Department until Fianna Fáil came into office.  Then wheat schemes were started, and there was criticism of the policy of improving the cattle trade, the milk supplies, the agricultural stations, and the giving of grants. Fianna Fáil introduced their schemes, and also introduced the economic war, so that I cannot see what need there is now for a Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>Why carry on the farce any longer?  What is the use <Col N="222" /> now of improving the cattle trade, improving milk production, or giving grants to agricultural schools and colleges, where boys and girls are being trained under the best possible system and by the best brains?  Some of them went to these schools in the hope that they would become professors. They did become professors, and would be bright stars at the moment were it not for the policy of the Government.  I am certain that some of those who are professors of agriculture do not agree with the policy of the present Government, but I suppose they have to bow down and accept what President de Valera says must be done.  We have sent our boys and girls to those schools.  Some of them came back to the land, practised what they were taught in those schools, and practised it successfully. They improved their herds; they improved and increased their tillage; they improved every form of agriculture which they took up; yet by one stroke of the Government Party they have lost their market, and, after all the time and money that have been spent, they are now faced with what I call a stone wall.  As I say, why carry on the farce any further?  There is an Estimate of £415,450 to pay the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture in the year 1933-34.  That is exactly the amount that the Minister for Local Government has withheld from the rates in this State, and if we were to stop this farce at the moment and give this £415,000 to the farmers of this State it would about compensate them for what has been filched from them by the Minister for Local Government. The farmers would be nothing worse off at the moment if the Department of Agriculture ceased to function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not miss it.  I take one item, the improvement of live stock.  Representatives from my constituency went with me to the Minister for Agriculture to see if we could get one registered Clydesdale stallion for West Cork.  The <Col N="223" /> Department, in their wisdom, have decided that outside a ten-mile radius of Cork City no registered Clydesdale stallion should stand.  The farmers of West Cork.  Who are workers, want at least one registered Clydesdale stallion in order to give us bone in our horses to carry on the farmers' work, if we ever carry it on again.  I suppose it does not matter to us now whether we have them or not.  We put up this case to the Department of Agriculture, and the Department, in their wisdom, turned it down.  They said: &ldquo;It is not you in West Cork who have to deal with this; we in the Department have to decide.&rdquo;  The Department decided, and did not give us the stallion.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to, I think, in his speech on the Budget, and that is that they had developed the linen industry in the Free State and made it an unqualified success.  You cannot develop the linen industry in this State unless you have the necessary raw material, and that is flax.  I see that in 1932-3 there was an Estimate of £490 for the improvement of flax growing.  This year it is down to £137.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that we had developed the linen industry in this State and made it an unqualified success, but it does not look very like it as you cannot have linen unless you have flax.  The Department here had developed the flax industry, had produced an excellent seed, had their instructors out and taught all about the flax industry, but to-day although this present Government say they have developed the linen industry they have cut down the Estimate for the improvement of flax growing from £490 to £137.  That is a thing I cannot understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the improvement of milk production, I suppose the least said about it the better.  Deputy Corry, speaking on this Estimate the other night, said that were it not for the policy of the present Government we would be getting only 2½d. a gallon for our milk now.  I am satisfied that, <Col N="224" /> no matter what is going to happen, the country will be in such a condition three months from now that the farmers will be very glad to get 2½d. a gallon for their milk, and I do not know where the 2½d to give them for it is to come from.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to refer to here is miscellaneous work, sub-head M.1.  I see in the year 1932-3 honoraria to farmers for keeping and furnishing accounts, £410; in 1933-4 it is not mentioned.  There were also supervising allowances to county instructors in agriculture and assistant agricultural overscers in connection with farm accounts, £260 in 1932-3; in 1933-4 that item is not there.  I think the reason for that is that the Department and the Minister saw that if any farmer did keep accounts they would be on the wrong side, and would damn the policy of the Minister more than anything else has done.  It is very significant that in 1933-4 there is no allowance for this important item, because accounts and costings form one of the most important items in agriculture.  The Department and the Minister in their wisdom have dropped that item, because they know that the accounts would be on the wrong side.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to the question of bounties.  The Minister for Agriculture denied that bounties were paid on net returns.  I have here some cases which prove conclusively that the bounties are not paid on the gross value of the stock exported.  It is not necessary for me to read them all, but I can give one case of a farmer who sold 21 pigs; he shipped them to Birmingham on the 17th April. There was 40 per cent. duty charged on the gross price, £117 16s. 9d., and there was 12½ per cent. bounty paid on the net price.  The net price was £71 7s. 11d.  That is only one of a good many cases I could mention.  I hope that the Minister will even now acknowledge that the bounty system is wrong.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter I want to refer to, and that is the Department of Agriculture Report on &ldquo;Agricultural Conditions in Saorstát Eireann on the 1st May, 1933.&rdquo;  Dealing <Col N="225" /> with flax it says: &ldquo;In County Donegal portion of last season's crop is still unscutched and about one-fifth is unsold,&rdquo; so the Minister for Industry and Commerce has a little to fall back on in the Free State when there is some flax sown here to keep the Free State mills going.  It goes on to say: &ldquo;The cattle fairs held in provincial centres during the month were mostly of from small to average size.  Conditions generally showed little change as compared with last month, store cattle being in slow demand except in the case of really first-class lots showing condition.  Fat cattle met the usual inquiry for the home trade, but export demand continued weak.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the gem:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following may be regarded as representing the average prices for the various descriptions of stock at provincial fairs during the month:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Calves under 1 month, £1 2s. 6d. to £2 10s. 0d.  Calves 1 to 9 months, £2 15s. 0d. to £4 0s. 0d.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder where the Department got this information&mdash;calves from £1 2s. to £2 10s. per head.  That was the 1st May, 1933.  I would sell all the calves I have at the moment for £2 10s., but I would not get it.  Then we have the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;First-class stores, 9 to 12 months, £3 5s. 0d. to £6 10s. 0d. First-class stores, 12 to 15 months, £5 5s. 0d. to £8 0s. 0d.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I saw yearlings from 14 months old sold in Clonakilty last Monday for £3 10s. apiece, and here we have them from nine months to 12 months at from £3 5s. to £6 10s.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Then we have first-class stores from 15 months to two years at from £7 5s. 0d. to £10 0s. 0d.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I saw the best three-year-olds&mdash;and we have some good ones in West Cork still&mdash;sold in Clonakilty last Monday for £7.  If that is the sort of information that is being sent out through the country, I do not know who are the originators of it or whether or not the parties who are sending this information are blind to he conditions of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another matter which is of importance in the present period of depression, and which the Department should take note of, is the egg and poultry trade.  We have a number of egg distributing stations all over the country, and whilst at the moment, fowl, poultry and eggs are of very little advantage, still the thrifty housewife throughout the country will always have a few sittings of eggs and keep them going.  While she has been selling her eggs for the past three months at an average of 4d. a dozen, if she wanted to get a sitting from the departmental stations she had to pay, for early sittings in February or March, as far as I remember about 2/6d. a dozen.  She was selling her own eggs at 6d. a dozen.  The price has dropped as the season advances, but it is grossly unfair that the departmental stations should be charging such an exorbitant price for sittings of eggs whilst the poor woman who has laboured hard can only get 4d. or 5d. for her eggs and, perhaps, 4d. or 5d. a pound for her chickens or ducks.  It <Col N="227" /> is grossly unfair that the Department should be charging these high prices for eggs.  They could give the station holders some form of subsidies along with all the other subsidies they are doling out and give eggs at a cheaper rate to the poor people throughout the country who are inclined to be thrifty and industrious.</P>
      <P>As I said, this Vote at the moment is a Vote that should be turned down. This £450,000 should be diverted into another channel.  What I would suggest to the Minister is to give this money to the relief of rates and, while he is keeping on the economic war, give up all these foolish schemes which are being kept up by the Department, the experimental stations, seeds and manures, and all the other things that were right enough in their time.  Their time has long gone by and it is about time that they should stop.  If we have a return to normal conditions and good times and have our markets back again, I, for one, would be the first to stand for a Department that would give such useful service as this Department has in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to the need for an increased bounty on farmers' butter.  As far as we are concerned in Kerry, the position is very serious.  A large percentage of the butter produced in the county is farm butter and the price at the moment is most unsatisfactory.  Unless some system is immediately adopted by way of relief for the farmers I have mentioned their position will become very serious.  It is all very well in some counties, where they are well organised and where the creameries are well developed, for the farmers in these areas to be satisfied with this matter of the bounty on creamery butter.  In portions of our county, however, it is quite a different matter.  There are no creameries and the hard-working farmers in those areas are open to being exploited by traders who have no scruples whatever about giving them what they like.  I think that is most important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking over the Estimate of 1931, when you see the export of creamery <Col N="228" /> butter was £1,500,000 and the export of farmers' butter in that period was £600,000, it will readily be seen that the export of farmers' butter is by no means a minor matter and that is the reason that I put forward this point. It is an important factor and I think that, if one industry&mdash;the creamery industry&mdash;is to be catered for, the farmers should not be neglected and left, as I have said, to the mercy of exploiting traders.</P>
    <P>Another important point in regard to Kerry is the bounty on cattle.  That bounty is of no benefit whatever to Kerry because of the fact that the main export, in so far as cattle are concerned, from Kerry consists of two classes&mdash;the 1½-years-old Polly, which are open to a tariff of 50/- per head and on which there is no bounty available, and the two and three-year-old Kerry bullock, which in former years were purchased by the dealers from the midlands for the purpose of holding them and turning them out on the Dublin market or for export.  At the moment, we cannot avail of the bounty in so far as that type of beast is concerned because of the fact that, even when fat, the beast could not reach the maximum weight.  Such a beast could not exceed the 7½ cwts. which is the minimum in regard to the tariff, which means that on a beast from two years old onwards a £6 tariff is imposed and a dealer will not buy a beast that will not reach a weight over 7½ cwts.</P>
    <P>When he can buy a beast that will reach 8 cwts. or 11 cwts. he will not touch the other type of animal.  The result is that no one will take them off the farmers' hands in South Kerry. In Caherciveen, Kenmare and Killorglin there are hundreds of cattle of this type for sale, but there is no one to take them off the farmers' hands.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would be able to devise some system whereby the farmers could get rid of this type of stock.  If he cannot devise some such system the position will be very serious indeed. I suggest as an alternative that, in so far as this type of beast is concerned, there might be in increased bounty on live cattle <Col N="229" /> going to England for slaughter, or a bounty for cattle slaughtered in this country.  That may be difficult, but the position is pretty serious.  So far as the hard-working farmers in Kerry are concerned, I stand up for them. It is evident to the whole country that they are hard workers, that they are industrious.  We have gained practically nothing by this bounty system.  As against all that, we have been purchasing and must purchase grain from the grain-growing counties. We have to adhere to the system of the admixture in the matter of pig feeding.  Kerry is the greatest pig-raising county in the State and the Kerry farmers are buying produce from the Kildare, Wexford and other farmers and still we are getting nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the last General Election the Fianna Fáil Party told us that we were on the eve of establishing a prosperous and a happy country.  They promised that if they were returned to power they were going to set up industries everywhere. The first thing they did was to tackle the farming industry and they have succeeded almost in killing it, in <Col N="230" /> breaking it up.  They are out to make this a prosperous country and their first effort is to put the farmer out of existence.  That is a thing that should not be allowed to happen in the Free State.  They have practically killed the only market we had for our live stock.  The 40 per cent. tariff imposed as a result of our Government's policy has not helped to improve our live-stock market.  The Minister for Agriculture told us we were only 18/- a head worse off in the matter of live stock than the farmers in Northern Ireland.  Where did he get his figures?  At the time he spoke we were 40 per cent. worse off than the Northern farmers and now we are very much worse off.  We have now a flat rate of £6 a head on cattle more than two years old; £4 a head on animals from 15 months to two years and £2 10/- a head on animals from six to 15 months.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding all that, we are told the farmer has nothing to grumble about.  When Deputy Belton spoke here last Thursday, a Government back-bencher, who appeared to be in an excited condition, asked was there anybody in the country but the farmer.  I maintain that in view of the fact that the farmers and farm labourers represent fully 75 per cent. of the population, the interests of the farmers should be first seen to.  If the farmer is not prosperous the Free State cannot hope to be prosperous. You cannot make the farmer prosperous until you end the economic war.  The Minister for Agriculture and I come from a county where the farmers work very hard, where they till a big proportion of their land and where they raise a lot of stock. They stall-feed the stock there during the winter months.  In what way are they recompensed for all their hard work?  I am aware of many farmers who fed stock for six months and then had to sell them for less than they originally paid for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding all that, the Minister says we have nothing to grouse about.  He is going to make this a great country by growing corn.  We will want a market for our surplus corn.  Where is that market to be <Col N="231" /> found?  The only market we had is killed.  Before Fianna Fáil got into power we had the British market for our surplus oats, barley and potatoes. Now there is a tariff against everything and our market is killed.  The fact of the matter is that in our present circumstances we cannot continue producing. After the last election Fianna Fáil held a meeting in Wexford and the Minister for Agriculture, speaking there, said he did not give a damn if John Bull put 100 per cent. on Free State cattle.  It meant nothing to him; he did not care.</P>

They are not wanted at home because there is no market for them.  In view of all these things how are the people to pay their annuities and their rates?  Fianna Fáil told us that the November, December and May and June annuities were to be funded.  They will ask for only half the annuities next November and December.  Will they tell the British not to collect the annuities in the way of taxes, because in that way we are paying them, too?  What is the alternative for the poor farmer?  He is told to smile and pay up as long as he is able.</P>

      <P>If the Fianna Fáil Government love Ireland as well as they say they do, let them show their love by getting back the means of livelihood of the bulk of the people.  There is no alternative for this country but to raise live stock.  Some people talk sneeringly about the bullock and the rancher.  The Minister for Agriculture knows quite well that we have no 200 or 500-acre farmers in Wexford.  He <Col N="232" /> is aware that the more stock we raise the more employment is given and the more land is put under tillage, because the stock have to be fed.  If stock are not properly fed they are no use.  I ask the Government seriously to show their professed love for their country by working for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>It was rather refreshing to hear the views that were expressed by a Deputy on the Fianna Fáil benches a few moments ago.  It is the same old song that has been sung over and over again since I came into this House.  I am very pleased on this occasion to find that even one member on the Fianna Fáil benches had the pluck to tell the Government what the position really is and what are the consequences of the economic war.  I asked the Minister on a recent occasion what the farmer could produce that would leave him a profit, and he mentioned pigs.  Possibly at the moment pigs would pay, but if the Minister casts his mind back to last September, October or November, he ought to know the condition in which the pig industry was at that time.  I told the Minister on that occasion that the Cereals Bill was one of the causes why the pig producer had gone out of production. The situation referred to a few moments ago by Deputy Flynn is not peculiar to Kerry.  There are counties which are not suitable for the growing of barley, but the Government have succeeded by their policy in penalising the hardest working farmers we have in the country&mdash;the small farmers who are our principal pig producers, and they have gone out of production. As to the Government's wheat policy, I want to say that I am no novice in the growing of wheat.  I have been growing it for years and probably would be growing it still if I had not gone too far along experimental lines.  I know I can grow wheat, but what kind of wheat can I grow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the point. I can grow it and get a good return. I have grown wheat and ground it, and for years I have fed it to pigs and calves.  I have grown some this year. <Col N="233" /> I will say this, that it might be advisable for the farming community to grow a little wheat for themselves, because at the prices now offering for pigs they will not be able to buy any other food for them.  I see in the Estimate for the Department this item: loss on resale of stallions, £1,750 for 1932-33.  The figure for this year is £1,000.  I would like to know how that occurred.  It strikes me as being a rather serious item.  There is also this item: purchase of stock bulls, £1,500.  What are they for?  The policy of the present Government is simply to ruin the cattle industry, and still we see this item of £1,500 for the purchase of stock bulls that they evidently do not want.  I want to know what these stock bulls are for. These are questions that must arise in the mind of every honest man who thinks about the present situation. There is no member of this House, I do not care from what bench he speaks, who can challenge this statement: that no Government can produce a substitute for the live stock industry of this country which is being absolutely ruined by the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not one bit adverse to increased tillage.  I think it is advisable.  That, I think, would also be the opinion of most farmers, the working farmers who give a lot of employment and produce everything they can.  What can they produce at present that will pay them?  Oats is the great cereal crop.  It can be grown in practically every county.  What is the price of oats at the moment?  The position is that it is absolutely unsaleable.  Black oats at the moment would not fetch 6/- per barrel.  I know farmers who have on their hands good white oats which they cannot get 8/- per barrel for.  They would not have it but for the fact that they go in for the growing of oats and of keeping some over for seed purposes, but there is so much of it in parts of my county that it is absolutely unsaleable.  I agree with the other Deputies, who said that until such time as the economic war is brought to an end the money asked for in connection with this Vote could be much better expended in <Col N="234" /> some other way than that proposed here.</P>

      <P>The English farmer is going to have something to say to it, and the British Government is going to see that he has something to say about it.  The tariffs imposed have unquestionably increased the price of beef in England.  They have had the effect of keeping it up to a standard that I believe it would not otherwise hold.  Deputies may shake their heads. During the last six or seven years I have been listening to Deputies telling us here that the moment a tariff is imposed prices must go up.

This economic war did not start 12 months ago.  As long as I can remember, and as long as my father and grandfather could remember, and his grandfather could remember, this economic war has been going on. What did the 1916 insurrection indicate? There are Deputies on the opposite benches who before and after 1916 went out, and the main reason for the insurrection was because of that economic war and the economic position that existed in this country.  Is there any Deputy who will tell me that economically this country was not pressed and hard pressed?  Thousands and millions of people had to leave this country, for what?  In the last 20 years, and even in the last seven years, what was the reason why they had to leave?  To earn the money to pay the rates and the annuities on the farms of this country.

      <P>If we went to the country to-morrow we would get a greater order.  If we went down to County Meath we would get a bigger order to carry on.  People are not fools at all.  They know perfectly well that some great effort has to be made to get this country into the position in which it will be able to hold the market that is there.  We have been losing that market since 1921.  I sat here in this House listening to members on certain benches, making statements against the Opposition Party to this effect: &ldquo;If you did not get that Treaty we could sell our cattle.  It is the Treaty that is doing it.  We cannot get any price.&rdquo;  I think that statement is quite correct.  It was the usual political dodge&mdash;the damned insincerity of it.  Those men knew perfectly well that the position was that the British markets were rapidly failing.  That is the real cause of the trouble.  Even if this economic war were ended the British markets, like other markets all over the world, are not in a position to buy our produce and pay the price they once did.  I believe that that fact must be realised. We must face up to it if we want to hold the British market.  We have not been doing it and it is not because we got a form of independence that we are not doing it.  The Englishman is purely a business man.  It does not matter what difference of opinion we may have had.  Even if a moment before we had come to blows, it makes no difference to him.  As long as there is business to be done he will do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> What stage have we been reaching in recent years?  We have been reaching the stage which has been lamented in this House, that we were simply summer producers.  We were unable, possibly because of the high cost of production or the low price on the other side, to maintain ourselves with any degree of continuity in that market.  It does not matter what market you get or how friendly the people in that market may be, if you are not able to ensure to them a supply of any commodity the whole year round, you are bound to fail in that market.  Our position since 1921, for many causes&mdash;one may be the decline of trade in England, the other may have been the financial results of the Great War&mdash;is that we have not been able to keep up our supplies and the result was that prices gradually fell.  Undoubtedly members on the opposite benches will have to agree that when prices were rapidly falling, year after year, and when the quantity we exported was decreasing, it was gradually coming to the point when a position such as the present in this country would have to be faced.  Huge sums of money, amounting to £5,250,000, for which we held we were not legally liable, were being paid annually to England.  It was recognised by members on the opposite side as well as on this side, and by people generally in the country, that it would become absolutely impossible to meet that payment in the near future.  These moneys were eventually retained and the idea in retaining them was that we believed we had a legal right to them.  A settlement came from England and was accepted here on the occasion on which they had imposed tariffs, in fact, total exclusion.  Did that settlement do us any good?  The settlement did not do us any good because the home market we had here was rapidly declining.  Until we reach a certain stage here, until we have a home market of sufficient volume, we will not be in a position to export surplus produce with any degree of success.  Our effort should be to develop our home market to such an extent as that it <Col N="238" /> will be able to consume a reasonable amount of our produce.</P>

We were told that the Opposition Party had 10,000 votes there.  They got 4,000 when they went to the poll, just the same as they did five years ago.  What was the reason of that?  Because these people just before voting said to themselves: &ldquo;We have no duty to ourselves perhaps, but we have dependants.  We have children.  It is to these people we owe a duty.  We cannot emigrate them now.  There is no country in the world to which they can go.  If we cannot develop something for them to do here, what is going to happen?&rdquo; Immediately they decided: &ldquo;Because of the future of the country we will vote for no party except Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  They did so and that is how we got an overwhelming majority.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to intervene in this discussion and I shall only do so for a very few minutes and in consequence of the <Col N="239" /> remarks that have fallen from Deputy O'Reilly in whose constituency I have at present the honour to reside.  We heard in this House at the time that the economic war started that it was likely to prove a blessing in disguise. While I resented intensely these utterances at the time, I have begun to think just lately that perhaps that statement was true, but true in quite a different sense from the sense which was originally intended.  I have begun to feel lately that the economic war is now doing a great deal for the economic education of this country and that, perhaps, we might be learning wisdom more quickly by that process than we could have by any other. But, if the speech we have just listened to were really representative of the economic outlook in this country at the present moment, I could not console myself with such reflections as this.  I do not think, however, that it is typical of what men are saying and thinking at the present time.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Reilly says quite frankly that he would regard a compromise settlement of the economic war as a disaster; he would go into mourning to-morrow morning if he heard that such a settlement had been arrived at. I absolutely deny that that represents the feeling of the country, or even the feeling of the bulk of Fianna Fáil supporters.  I am quite convinced that the larger proportion of people who voted for Fianna Fáil at the last election did so with the expectation that a settlement would be arrived at. They had been induced to believe that the best way to arrive at a settlement was by strengthening the hands of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil orators, when they are in any difficulties over contentious matters in this House, are always able to cheer themselves by referring to election results.  Whatever else they are not experts in, they feel they are experts in electioneering.  I agree that there is a good deal to cheer them up, if they are not too scrupulous, in thinking about how they do at elections. They will, however, be making <Col N="240" /> a big mistake, even about the lore of elections, if they imagine that the result of the last election, or the election before it, means that the people welcome the economic war.  They were told in the 1932 election that there would not be any economic war; that there was not the slightest chance of the British taking any punitive steps as the result of retaining these moneys. They were told at the 1933 election that if the Government were returned to power there would soon be a satisfactory settlement.  I am optimistic enough to believe that, after all we have gone through, a settlement cannot be much longer delayed.  I hope, and I believe, that a settlement is coming, and coming in the near future. That is why I was unable to sit silent and not intervene when I heard what I considered a thoroughly mischievous speech, misrepresenting the views of the people, and giving extraordinarily bad advice to the Government as to the attitude they should adopt at the coming Economic Conference.</P>
    <P>That is the main part of what I wanted to say.  I shall just refer, because I am a little tired of this particular point, to the stress that has been laid once more by Deputy O'Reilly on these vast sums that are alleged to have been going out of the country; the plea that we have been bled white for so many years by all these moneys going out.  Does Deputy O'Reilly maintain that there was a net payment over from this country to England every year of five and a quarter millions?  I say that is an absolute fallacy.  I pointed that out before in this House and I do not hesitate to point it out again.  It is not just and fair to say a thing like that.  We have to remember, in the first place&mdash;I have forgotten the figures now; it is a long time since I quoted them&mdash;that something in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000 out of that is coming back to holders of Irish land stock in this country; that something like three-quarters of a million of that is coming back to people enjoying police pensions in this country.  That is a big hole in the £5,000,000 to start with.  Though I admit it is not so strictly relevant as the figures I have given, we might <Col N="241" /> incidentally bear in mind that further large sums have been coming, year by year, into this country from England in the shape of war pensions.  I have been told on good authority that they are in the neighbourhood of £2,000,000 per year.  I do not want to stress these figures to the extent of saying that no effort should have been made to reduce the burden of the payments we were making&mdash;not at all.  But I do say that it is describing the case wrongly and unjustly to talk as if we were being bled of a net payment over to England every year of 5¼ millions, and that that was something so desperate and so oppressive that it drove us into this gigantic gamble of the economic war. I submit that it is not fair to use figures in that way.</P>
    <P>I certainly would be one of the last to take a favourable view of the whole policy of the Government with regard to the land annuities.  I have said over and over again that I would have been glad to support them to the utmost if they had proceeded on normal lines to try to get a revision of our financial arrangements with England.  But I did think, I do think, and I shall always think, that the way they went about it was an unbusinesslike way, and I do not hesitate to say it, although it is unpopular, that the way they went about it, was a dishonourable way.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I do not think that any of us will feel inclined to harp upon the past, or to cast reproaches upon the Government, if only now, at this eleventh hour, with the Economic Conference in front of us, with the general spirit throughout Europe making for peace and goodwill, with the view being preached by all men who count for most in the world, that the time has come for international friendship and international co-operation, and that without these things the world will perish, the Government now take their courage in their hands and act in the interests of the Irish people, what they know to be the interests of the Irish people themselves, and not according to the catch-cries of their more benighed followers.  We shall all be grateful to them and congratulate <Col N="242" /> them so far as the making of a settlement is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the sentiments expressed by Deputy MacDermot.  Certainly, in a crisis like this, I am proud to hear the Leader of one Party in the House say that our private feelings should be made subservient to the national interest.  I shall go as far back as 1926, if the House will excuse me for going into what is perhaps ancient history.  Since 1926, from all our platforms, we told the people that we would retain the land annuities.</P>
      <P>There may be certain repercussions from that attitude.  We knew we would have to suffer a little through that attitude, but at the same time we went before the people two, three and four times on the policy or principle of the retention of the land annuities. The people returned us in 1932. Standing then on the Fianna Fáil platform I told the people as a farmer and a candidate that we would retain the land annuities.  I am a farmer Deputy representing perhaps the majority of the farmers in Limerick.  I told them that no matter what the consequences were we would retain the land annuities and the farmers voted for us twice.  That is at the General Elections in 1932 and 1933.  A year ago we were told a fortnight before the British imposed a tariff as a result of our retention of the land annuities, that cattle prices had gone down.  These cattle prices had gone down this time 12 months before the imposition of the British tariff.  We hear this growl here about the result of the economic war.  I will ask the House to go back to the time before the economic war with the British&mdash;to go back to the time when the British deflated the £1. That was in 1921 and farmers were losing in their cattle then.  We lost from £10 to £20 a head that time on cattle.  As a matter of fact I lost it myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present issue is a national one and I have better faith in the national spirit and in the national outlook of the Irish farmers than to believe that <Col N="243" /> they would have been influenced by such a cry as we are hearing now.  I believe the national spirit to be more firmly planted in the Irish farmers. Personally I dislike intervening in the debate, but I do intervene because I resent the farmers being trotted out in this House by doctors, lawyers, shopkeepers and everybody as people who are suffering in the fight.  They are trotted out on every occasion, and as a farmer and on behalf of the farmers I resent it.  I say that the farmers of the County Limerick are absolutely and entirely behind President de Valera in this fight.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words in connection with this Vote, seeing that it is costing the country so much, and that it is one of the most important Votes that come before the Dáil.  I think it is only right and proper that I, as representing a county nearest the Six Counties and recognising the sufferings of the farming community should say something on this question. It has been stated by many speakers on the Fianna Fáil Benches that the farmers are as well off to-day as they were a year or two years ago. It has been actually asserted by members of the Government that the prices prevailing in the Free State for size stock are very little below those prevailing in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  Commonsense tells me, although not a farmer, that when a cattle dealer goes into a fair the first thing he has got to reckon with is&mdash; what will be his expenses and what is the price that he can afford to pay for the cattle which he buys.  If my information is correct, the very first thing and the first expense he has to meet is the £6 tariff which he has got to pay before he can land those cattle in Great Britain.  I put it to the members on the Fianna Fáil Benches that the man who pays that £6 is surely the man who is selling the cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will assume for the moment that the other expenses on the cattle are stationary.  They do not change very <Col N="244" /> much.  There are expenses by way of rail and steamer and so it is that for cattle on which there are tariffs of £6, £4, £3 and down to 25/- on calves, the amount of the tariff will have to be paid by the farmer.  It is the same with the pig industry.  We had it trotted out here the other evening by Deputy Corry that the price of pork was 2/- per cwt. more this year than last year.  Agreed.  But that is not the issue.  That is not the position as far as the farmer who has to dispose of his pork in the Free State is concerned. The issue is that the North of Ireland farmer is to-day receiving from 7/- to 8/- a cwt. more than the Free State farmer is receiving for his pork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies representing Southern counties know nothing about what is happening in the North. They have shown a clean pair of heels to the North.  They have deserted the North.  As one who has experience of what is happening over the Border, and knows the prices quoted at fairs as we can all see from the Press, what affects the position there is that the Free State farmer is selling his dead pork at 6/-, 7/- or 8/- per cwt. less than the price at which his neighbour across the Border gets for it.  That is a fact that cannot be contradicted and there is no use in Deputy Ryan saying: &ldquo;Give us this or give us that.&rdquo;  I am not here to tell anything that is not true.  It is seldom that I intervene in discussions at all, but knowing the position of the farmers at the present time and seeing the hardships they endure, I would, I think, be failing in my duty if I did not get up here and state what I believe to be the truth.  The facts that I am stating are true and cannot be contradicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the same way with every section or department of the agricultural economy of the Free State farmer at the present time.  He is suffering all round.  The irony of the whole situation is this, that he can get no reward and no return for his sufferings.  It is the same in the matter of his potatoes as it is with his pigs and cattle in the County Louth.  There we have an <Col N="245" /> extraordinary position, especially in the Cooley area.  The farmers of that district are the most hard-working and industrious section of the farming community to be found in this or any other country.  During the past 12 months they have been compelled to sell their potatoes at 15/- a ton.  That is less than 1¼d. per stone.  Then you have what I might call the extraordinary policy of the Minister giving a bounty of £2 on an article for which the farmer receives only 15/-.  In other words, according to the Fianna Fáil policy, the British market is no earthly use to the Free State farmer but yet, in the opinion of the Minister for Agriculture, it is so important to the farmers of Cooley that he is prepared to give £2 bounty for every ton of potatoes exported from that area to the British markets.</P>
    <P>The irony of the whole thing is that the farmers there are only receiving 15/- per ton.  What is more, owing to the policy of the Minister's Department, the farmers in that area cannot dispose of their potatoes in any market other than the British market.  The only consolation those farmers received was 12 or 18 months ago when they sent a deputation to the then acting Minister for Agriculture&mdash;the Minister for Defence.  That Minister's solution of their difficulties was that they should grow strawberries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position so far as the farming community is concerned. Although it was said during the last general election that, after all, the Irish farmer is always complaining, yet as one representing the urban areas, I have always held the opinion that the agricultural industry is essential if the cities and towns of this State are to prosper.  It is a well-known fact that the agricultural community absorb a very large percentage of the products of our factories.  If the Government continues its present policy, does not commensense tell us that in the ordinary evolution of affairs with the present prices prevailing for agricultural produce the farmer will <Col N="246" /> find it impossible to buy the products of the factories which we all hope to see set up and some of which have been set up during the past year or two.  Are not the interests of the farming community and the interests of the people of the cities and towns interdependent and mutual?  You cannot legislate for one without taking into consideration the position of the other.  At the moment the policy of the Government is rendering the position of the farmer more hopeless and more confused each day of the week.  That policy is weakening the farmers' capacity to make purchases.  If he is making any purchases they are of a very attenuated nature.  I do not pretend to know very much about the agricultural industry. At the same time I have eyes to see and ears to hear.  I do not want statistics. I can go out and get any information I want from observation.  You can count more on the information you receive from observation than on the information you receive through books. I can safely say that the farming community, whether they support Fianna Fáil, Cumann na nGaedheal, Labour or any other Party, are hoping that a settlement will be arrived at whereby this economic war will be ended and they will be allowed to pursue their ordinary tasks&mdash;that they will be allowed to dispose of the products of their farms, whether in the form of cattle, sheep, pigs, or any other part of their agricultural economy to the best advantage.</P>
      <P>In other words, the position is that the majority of the farmers of this State would much prefer to have the state of affairs existing previously&mdash; namely, paying their annuities, paying their debts as they always paid them, and having their market restored.  It has been stated here that it will be necessary to pay £5,000,000 for that market if a settlement is effected.  Does it ever occur to Deputies on the Government Benches that we are at the moment paying much more than £5,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Have Deputies on the Government Benches read the statement of Mr. Chamberlain, Chancellor of the British Exchequer, in which he <Col N="247" /> stated that in the coming Budget they expected to receive, as a result of the duties on our cattle, our pigs, our butter, our eggs, and our poultry a sum of almost £3,000,000?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the policy of the Government in taxing many of the commodities which the farmers, in common with other sections of the people have to import, the Government have extorted from the people a sum in the neighbourhood of £1,500,000. That is almost £4,500,000.  All that is coming out of the pockets of the taxpayers of the Free State.  Not one penny of that £3,000,000 which Mr. Chamberlain hopes to get this year is coming out of the pockets of John Bull.  It is all coming out of the pockets of the farmers and of the other sections of the people of this State who have occasion to buy those articles which have been tariffed and which are necessary to enable the people to carry on.  That is the position as I see it at the moment, and no amount of camouflage and no amount of this big, wild talk about not surrendering to England will be of any avail.  The fact is that deep down in the hearts of the Deputies on the Government Benches and of many of their chief supporters in the country is the hope that this settlement will come.  The only difference between them and others is that they do not want to say so in public.  But it is a well-known fact and Deputies opposite cannot hide it Deputy O'Reilly referred to our young people having to live in the country.  I am listening to that talk for the past forty years.  Irishmen will roam and emigrate no matter what the condition of affairs is here. The sooner we recognise that fact the better.  If emigration were open to-morrow 250,000 Irishmen would show a clean pair of heels to this country.  There is no use in this camouflage and bluff.  There is no use making the pretence that young Irishmen are going to stay here and starve.  If the policy of Fianna Fáil is to continue, we shall be back to the Stone Age when people were living <Col N="248" /> on yellow Indian meal three times a day.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking on this amendment last night, I said it was not correct for the Minister to say that teachers themselves had agreed to a reduction in their salaries in 1931.  I said that their agreement involved the acceptance by the Government of full responsibility for making good the insolvency of the Pensions Fund.  The cuts now proposed are greater than those proposed in 1931, at any rate, for teachers of £275 or upwards, because it is from there you start the 6¼ per cent. There is no provision in this Bill, or by agreement with the teachers, as far as we know, for dealing with the insolvency on the Government side, of the Pension Fund.  It was, if you like, the sugar coating of the cut of 1931, <Col N="249" /> that when the teachers felt that their time came to retire they would be paid pensions out of the fund provided for such pensions.  The position is now, that the teachers' salaries are cut, and that a young teacher has to pay into this fund, which is insolvent, without any guarantee when it comes to his time to retire that there will be any money in the fund to pay him the pension to which he is entitled.  Deputy Breathnach made a last appeal to the Minister to modify the cuts as far as the national teachers were concerned. I would join in that appeal if I thought it was any use.  I am afraid, however, after the line the Minister has taken towards national teachers, especially, it would be very little use indeed.  I doubt if an appeal to the Centre Party would have any better results.  I would like, however, to appeal to the Centre Party to support this amendment.  They should surely understand that the policy of wage cutting is not going to benefit the farmers of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of the Government in depriving the farmer of his only market has thrown him back on the powers of the people at home to absorb his agricultural produce.  Helping the Government to reduce the purchasing power at home will only injure the farmer.  The economies proposed in this Bill will not bring one penny into the pockets of the agricultural community.  On the contrary they will only provide funds for the Government coffers for carrying on the economic war, and, therefore, there is good reason for stating that they are inimical to the interests of the farmers.  Apart from what one might call the self-interest end, I think the farmers should not allow themselves to be carried away with the rather foolish cry about the big salaries that the teachers enjoy. That cry is of course absolute rubbish. Nor should they be led away by what some of them referred to in their speeches, namely, that the majority of the teachers supported Fianna Fáil at the last election.  If it was true that the majority of the national teachers supported Fianna Fáil at the last election on the strength of <Col N="250" /> the promises made by the Fianna Fáil Party, if they were short sighted enough to believe these promises, still I would not consider that any justification, or any reason for acting unjustly in this matter.  I think it would be a very poor reason for seeking to take revenge upon the teachers because they were opposed to one in the political arena.  The 1933 election will&mdash;at least some of us hope&mdash;not be the last election in this country, and one can assume that the national teachers, like many other electors, will be better able to appraise the promises of Fianna Fáil at the next General Election.  I appeal, therefore, to the Centre Party to go into the Lobby in support of this amendment, to save the national teachers from these very unfair cuts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the Centre Party towards this amendment is not dictated by any spirit of revenge, on account of the attitude of the teachers at the general election.  It is true the majority of them played the part of jingoes.  I doubt if any class of the community was more jingo than the teachers at the last election.  I doubt if any class of the community had more responsibility for the launching of this dispute with England than the teachers had.  But apart from that I cannot see that any case has been made for excluding the teachers from the sacrifices the economic war brings in its train.  I have no spirit of animosity or revenge in regard to the teachers, but I am in favour of all classes sharing this sacrifice, and the last class that should make a claim to be excluded is the class that undoubtedly had a great deal to do in bringing about the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch said that an attack upon the standard of living is not going to help the farmers and he appeals to us for that reason to vote for the amendment.  I wonder if there is any form of economy that Deputy Lynch would not consider an attack upon the standard of living.  Of course, every economy when it comes to cutting down social services, or people's salaries, may be superficially described <Col N="251" /> as an attack upon the standard of living.  Supposing you take the instance of a family, and you see that the family is spending more than it can afford, or that it is spending out of proportion to its real wealth, and you want to retrench, you can only do so by reducing comforts, amenities and luxuries.  From that point of view, you are superficially cutting down their standing of living, but if you took the long view, you are not cutting it down at all.  You are saving that family by making them economise in time, so that in the long run they will be able to enjoy the <Col N="252" /> comforts of life.  No one has a right to talk of economies as meaning a reduction in the standard of living. When we compare the expenditure in this country, with its expenditure in the past or with the expenditure of other nations of about the same wealth as our own, we find we are spending grossly beyond our means.  Apart altogether from the economic war we have to realise that there is the greatest need for economies in the country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 59:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7 to delete paragraph (b) of Part III of the Schedule.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to exempt from the cut in salaries untrained assistant teachers with a scale maximum of £139 10/- per annum, and junior assistant mistresses.  As was clearly indicated in the text of the Bill, the Minister even goes to persons in receipt of salaries of a maximum of £139 10/- and is intent upon making these people, lowly paid as they are, make a contribution towards this £280,000 which he wants to get in this way, because he is legislatively too lazy to get it any other way.  We had a most extraordinary demonstration of inaccuracy from the Minister last night. He said that one justification for cutting the salaries of teachers was that they had agreed to the cut.  On that point I want to ask the Minister one question.  What is the justification for cutting the pay of Civic Guards? Surely they have not agreed.  What is the justification for cutting the salaries of civil servants?  They have not agreed to the cut.  On that particular issue the Minister was just as weak with argument as he was on other amendments to the Bill.  I suppose the same philosophy is going to apply to untrained teachers and junior assistant mistresses.  I suppose their salaries are to be cut because they have agreed to a cut.  That is a most extraordinary statement for the first Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Executive Council to make.  The last Executive Council agreed to pay another country over £5,000,000 per annum.  The first chance they got the people repudiated that settlement and put in a new Executive Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The untrained teachers are a part of this argument, and if I had any doubt about that I might quote what the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) said on the 27th January, 1932:&mdash;</P>
      <P>There is no need to cut the teachers or the Guards, and the Budget deficiency can be met by retaining the land annuities and the R.I.C. pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the point I want to make, that the last Administration agreed to pay £5,000,000 to another Government, and that the people repudiated that settlement and put in a new Executive Council which said: &ldquo;We are here not to pay that money, and we have a mandate from the people not to pay it.&rdquo;  That is the attitude which the Minister for Finance takes up in his negotiations with another Government <Col N="255" /> and, in my opinion, rightly takes up.  While the Minister was whistling that tune with one portion of his mouth he was trying to whistle another one with the other portion. He comes along to the teachers and says: &ldquo;You made a bargain with Cumann na nGaedheal, and although your executive, with your authority made that bargain, and although subsequently you repudiated that bargain, still you are not entitled to get away with it because at one stage you made it.&rdquo;  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  Either he is right in his negotiations with Mr. Thomas and wrong with the teachers, or right with the teachers and wrong with Mr. Thomas.  I suggest to the Minister that he is right with Mr. Thomas&mdash;as I believe he is&mdash;but that he is clearly wrong with the teachers.  The Minister knows that his attitude on this whole matter is perfectly inconsistent with any kind of clear reasoning, and perfectly inconsistent with the attitude he adopted on the question of the disputed payments.</P>
    <P>We had another declaration by the Minister for Finance last night, and on this matter he appears to have thrown all accuracy to the winds, so desperate was he in his efforts to justify this unjustified cut.  Until he was corrected by Deputy Breathnach, the Minister stated that the speech delivered by the President at the Rathmines Town Hall was made with special reference to civil servants and did not apply to the teachers.  The Minister was duly corrected and admonished by a Deputy in his own Party, the chairman of the teachers' organisation, who, I think, in a matter of this kind might well be given credit for more accuracy because of his more intimate concern with the teachers than the Minister.  What is the position?  I took the trouble this morning to look up the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; of the 16th February, 1932.  There is a panel paragraph in the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; of that date, the morning of the election, which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In reply to queries from teachers, Mr. de Valera has announced that the principles which he stated in <Col N="256" /> regard to civil servants' salaries will also apply to the teachers.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But not referred to in the speech at Rathmines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister put his foot into it badly last night, without repeating the performance this evening.  In my desire to be accurate, and not with a desire to get over some of the stuff that the Minister got over last night on this matter, I made further inquiries in order to ascertain where exactly the statement emanated from.  I got the interesting information that it was 'phoned by the President to a person who is now a member of the executive council of the teachers' organisation.  Does the Minister for Finance challenge the accuracy of that statement?  The Minister stated last night that the speech at Rathmines Town Hall was only intended to apply to civil servants.  We have the Minister's official newspaper saying that Mr. de Valera's intention was that &ldquo;the same principles which he stated in regard to civil servants' salaries will also apply to the teachers.&rdquo;  When I probed the matter further I found that that information was communicated to the teachers' executive on the telephone by the President to a person who is now a member of the executive of the teachers' organisation.  I think that proves conclusively that the Minister's statement last night was in accurately used in an attempt to bolster up his impossible attitude on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seeing that his Party and himself are so deeply committed on this matter I appealed to the Minister last night to give some evidence that, in respect to the teachers, he would be more liberal-minded towards them than he is in the section.  In June last the Minister offered the teachers' executive a five per cent. cut in salaries and a full settlement of the pensions question.  In this Bill there is no question of a settlement of the pensions issue, and cuts varying from five per cent. to eight per cent. are being imposed.  If the Minister was prepared to agree to cuts of five per cent. in June, with a settlement of the pensions question, what has happened in <Col N="257" /> the meantime to justify him in declining apparently, to settle the pensions question, and inflicting a cut in salaries in this Bill, varying from 5 per cent. to 8 per cent. and upwards?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Ask the teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can imagine the reason.  The Minister is so accustomed to getting his own way at the Party meetings that he cannot understand anyone opposing his point of view. The Minister is so used to getting away with those eloquent speeches of his that he is rather annoyed, vexed and piqued with everybody who does not regard his decisions and utterances as something that came out of the Books of Truth and Revelation.  The fact that the Minister is piqued with the teachers' executive, and the fact that the Minister is vexed simply because somebody challenged the equity of those cuts, is no reason for cutting the teachers further.  I agree that it might satisfy the Minister's own sense of vengeance in the matter, but the fact that the Minister is piqued is no reason for increasing the cut on the teachers whom last June he was prepared to allow off with a five per cent. cut, he to settle the pension question.  I do not think that the Minister has made any case whatever for imposing a cut on teachers who, as I said earlier, are not overpaid but seriously underpaid.  In this particular section he is seeking to impose cuts on even the lowest paid of the teachers. I wonder whether the Minister believes that his Budget is going to be balanced, and the financial structure <Col N="258" /> of the State preserved from decay, merely by cutting to the extent of one per cent. persons with a maximum salary of £139 10/- per annum.</P>
      <P>I appealed to the Minister last night to try to make restitution for some of his misdeeds towards the teachers in connection with this whole Bill.  Biblical history, I think, records that Pharaoh when appealed to frequently only hardened his heart.  We now have the Minister for Finance a modern Pharaoh in the matter of cuts. Instead of making some effort at restitution he simply hardens his heart.  I suppose in reply to this particular amendment he is going to make another one of what Deputy Cormac Breathnach last night called ill-tempered attacks on the teachers, whom apparently he is not content with cutting, but against whom he also wants to deliver tirades.</P>
      <P>Might we have an explanation from the Minister as to the inaccurate speeches delivered last night, or do I take it that he withdraws them and apologises.</P>

We cannot get a word out of him and any words that do come are the result of the absolute imagination of the Minister.

The only thing I wish to say is that I am glad he is not making a case because those who are not fully familiar with the figures that the Minister has given in all his speeches might be deceived.

      <P>I beg to move amendment 61:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete paragraph (d) of Part III of the Schedule.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to exempt from the provisions of sub-section (d) the teachers who receive special grants in the Fior-Ghealtacht. We have had during the past ten years quite a considerable number of declarations, from both the last Government and recently from this Government, of tender regard for the Irish language and both Governments have expressed a desire to promote it in every possible way.  This seems to me to be a very peculiar way of promoting the Irish language. Under this sub-section it is proposed to inflict a 6 per cent. cut on the special grants given to teachers in Fíor-Ghaeltacht schools.  I suggest to the Minister that this is just the way not to encourage Irish.  In any case, the cuts proposed in this Bill are from grants which, when originally awarded, were considered to be reasonable and in no way excessive. If Deputy Cormac Breathnach were here I would make a special appeal to him for support on this.  At all events, I would appeal to him to deputise for the Minister and speak on this.  He is an ex-president of the Gaelic League, he is a member of the Gaelic League executive committee at the present time and he is keenly interested in the study of Irish.  As well, it is all members of the teaching profession who will be cut, and I would expect that the Deputy who has so many connections might, on that account, come into the Division Lobby with us so as to make it clear, at all events, that he dissents from this method of cutting the special grants to teachers in the Fior-Ghaeltacht schools.  These grants, as I have said, are in no sense excessive. In many respects they are inadequate. I think it is a very poor recompense for teachers who have made a special study of the language for the purpose of imparting it to the children in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht schools that they should be singled out for a cut in the special grants awarded to them.  The Minister cannot possibly plead that it is necessary to cut the special grants awarded to the teachers in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht schools in order to balance his Budget.  He knows that the amount he will receive under these cuts will be relatively small, and it is in no sense essential that the Minister should reject the amendment in order to balance his Budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 62:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7 in paragraph (a) of Part IV of the Schedule&mdash;(1) to delete the words and figures &ldquo;does not exceed £300&rdquo; and substitute the words and figures &ldquo;does not exceed £400&rdquo;; (2) to delete the words &ldquo;exceeds £300 but does not exceed £400&mdash;2 per cent. per annum of the salary&rdquo;; (3) to delete the figures and words &ldquo;2 per annum from the first £400 of the annual rate of salary&rdquo;; and (4) to delete the word &ldquo;plus&rdquo; before the figures &ldquo;2½&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to endeavour to exempt salaries under £400 per annum from any cut whatever. It is not, of course, a desirable way of tackling the problem, but on the Second Reading we voted against the Bill, and on the Committee Stage <Col N="267" /> we sought to render the Bill inoperative by deleting various classes affected by the Bill.  Having been defeated on both issues, we are now endeavouring to ensure that if the Bill is going to be passed it will be passed in a manner that will inflict the minimum of hardship on the people affected.  This amendment, as far as civil servants are concerned, seeks to exempt them from any cuts in respect of salaries which are not in excess of £400 per annum.  As I mentioned on the Committee Stage, civil servants' remuneration is calculated by reference to two elements, one the basic or pre-war salary and the other the cost-of-living bonus, which fluctuates with the rise or fall in the cost-of-living index figure.  Civil servants have always contended that the cost-of-living index figure as applied did not provide them with adequate compensation for the increase in the cost of living over the pre-war level&mdash;in other words, that the cost-of-living bonus and the basic or pre-war salary were not adequate compensation having regard to the extent to which the purchasing power of their salaries had shrunk as a result of the increase in the price of commodities.</P>
    <P>When I mention that the full cost-of-living bonus is only applied where the basic salary does not exceed £91 5s. 0d., that 60 per cent. is applied to that portion above £91 5s. 0d. but which is not in excess of £200, and that only 45 per cent. applies in cases where the basic remuneration exceeds £200, I think the House will feel that as far as the cost-of-living bonus is concerned, it by no means compensates civil servants for the shrinkage in their pre-war salaries by reason of the increase in prices.  After the index-figure arrangement was first introduced in March, 1920, the cost-of-living index figure rose, but I think for only a very short period&mdash;for approximately 12 months.  Since that time there has been a very steady decline in the cost-of-living figure, a decline which has resulted in inflicting on civil servants, who are subject to the cost-of-living bonus, a cut in remuneration greater than is endured by any <Col N="268" /> other section either inside the public service or outside it.  When I mention that under the cost-of-living bonus arrangement the income of a civil servant has fallen by as much as 40 per cent. since March, 1921, the severity of the cuts they have endured will be apparent to all.  Notwithstanding the fact that they have chafed under that arrangement, notwithstanding the fact that they have protested for many years&mdash;at one time with the support of the present Minister for Finance&mdash;that this cost-of-living bonus was not adequate to meet the increased cost of living, not merely are they going to suffer a loss of income in respect of the cost-of-living bonus but they are also going to be cut in respect of the basic or pre-war proportion of their salaries.  In other words, they are being slashed at one end of their remuneration by the fall in the cost-of-living index figure and at the other end they are being slashed by the Minister's proposals as contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Civil servants are at present, and have been for some time in a very unfavourable position in relation to their colleagues in the Six Counties or their colleagues in Great Britain. Following the change of Government a new scale of salaries was introduced here.  That scale of salary provided for lower rates in respect of new entrants.  These new entrants into the Civil Service here had to be content with a much lower salary than they would have had if the old scale had obtained, a much lesser scale of salary than their colleagues in the Six Counties or Great Britain had.  On the top of that new low differentiated scale, which was applicable here since 1924, it is now proposed that there shall be a further differentiation, that there shall be a further cut in the scales of salaries which were cut in 1924, and which will now be further cut by this Bill.  You have, in addition, the overriding cut of the heavy decline in the cost-of-living bonus.  If the Minister has any conscience left after the many unconscionable things he has done in connection with the Bill, I think, in respect of the civil servants he should relent in the same hard-hearted attitude <Col N="269" /> he has displayed since the Bill was introduced right up to and perhaps including this particular amendment. Civil servants have suffered a reduction of approximately 40 per cent. in many cases in their income since March, 1931.  There is no case for cutting them further, no case based on equity.  In any case we have the testimony of the President which I must quote again in order to impress it on the Minister. Speaking in the Town Hall, Rathmines, he said that they did not propose to cut salaries between £300 and £400.  The Minister selects the £300&mdash;not the £300 basic salary as the President clearly intended.</P>

I proved to the Minister from the columns of the <i>Irish Press</i>, that is not prejudiced in my favour, that the President stated that the Rathmines speech covered, in principle, his attitude towards the teachers.  I have stated also that the President 'phoned that information to a member of the teachers' executive.</P>

      <P>The Cement Bill!  I suggest that on this amendment the Minister has a particularly weak case. He knows well that civil servants' remuneration has been cut seriously. He knows that there has been applied in the Free State, since the change of Government in 1922, new low scales of salary.  He is proposing now to cut these new low scales of salary in defiance of the undertaking given by the President, in defiance of what the Minister himself at one time believed. I do not know whether it is worth while appealing to the Minister on this matter to see the unreasonableness of his attitude, but I do say that on this particular matter the Minister has a very weak case.  He is not merely an accessory both before and after the fact in slashing the remuneration of civil servants through his cost-of-living bonus machinery, but he is proposing also to cut basic salaries. Having regard to the low rates of salary, having regard to the onerous, responsible, and exacting duties which they perform, having regard to their domestic responsibility, and having regard to the paramount consideration that efficiency cannot be purchased at the price of low wages and salaries, I suggest to the Minister that on this occasion he might reconsider what he proposes to do under the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points to which I should like to draw attention in connection with the Schedule.  The amendment presents us with the lesser of two evils.  To the extent to which we are committing ourselves by voting, I should like to <Col N="272" /> explain that it is in that setting we are voting for the amendment.  This particular part of the Schedule deals with &ldquo;Rates of deduction from salaries of persons employed in any capacity in a Preparatory College and of persons employed in any civil capacity in the public service to whom none of the foregoing parts of this Schedule applies.&rdquo;  Civil servants are roughly divided into two classes, those who were in the service previous to the signing of the Treaty and those who came in after the signing of the Treaty.  I leave out for a moment those who have been dealt with and who made special arrangements when coming over.  I have always considered that one of the objectionable articles of the Treaty was the one which sought to provide for the security of civil servants.  In a sense it might be said to be a reflection upon the honour of future Governments of this State that such a provision was necessary.  It was put in, at any rate, and according to that article they have their rights under the Treaty.  We were told here some 12 months ago by no less a person than the President that these rights could not be abrogated, that the Act of Parliament in question could not be repealed, altered, or amended.  This Bill, and in particular this Schedule, is altering that Act, no matter what may be said to the contrary, and to that extent there is a breach of faith, to my mind, on the part of the Government of this State or of the Oireachtas of this State in doing that.  In a sense, it almost seems to justify whatever misgivings there were on the part of civil servants when seeking to have their rights enshrined in the Treaty in Article 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to you, Sir, that this speech is not in order on the amendment.  The House has already decided to cut the salaries of this particular class of civil servants and the only question is whether a limit of £300 or £400 should be fixed.</P>

      <P>On the point of order, technically the Minister's <Col N="273" /> contention is correct, but business has been got through very expeditiously for the last hour and the Chair has allowed considerable latitude in view of that fact.  I am allowing the Deputy to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the first phase.  I make no comment on it.  I simply present the House with the facts.  I regret very much indeed that it was considered necessary, in connection with the agreement that we entered into with another country, that the employees they left behind should be safeguarded by a provision such as that, which ought not to have been necessary.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately it was apparently necessary, and now what we have got to consider in connection with this amendment is whether we will limit the damage that has been done by the breaking of our plighted troth to those officials.  The amendment gives those civil servants who entered into the service of the State in the last eight or nine or ten years certain advantages. They came in at lower salaries. They made their bargain and it is wrong that they should be put forward now for any worse treatment.  In protecting them our own honour is at stake.  If we had entered into a conference with the civil servants and pointed out to them the national necessities they would be at one with us in trying to find a solution.  I support the amendment as the lesser of two evils.</P>

There is no breach of any agreement entered into with the civil servants or with any servant of this State or any other State.  The rights which those civil servants had under Article 10 still remain to them.  If the Deputy had been in his place when this matter was debated during the Committee Stage he would not have made the speech to which we have just listened.  He would not have wasted the time of <Col N="274" /> the House.  When this matter was challenged by the Deputy who was Attorney-General in his own administration it was clearly pointed out that the only right the transferred officer had was a right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know a little more from the Minister as to what solace civil servants with salaries less than £400 a year will get from the repeated, impassioned and senseless statements of the Minister.  I should like also to say that this is somewhat a little more than the preaching of the Party opposite.  We all heard for many, many years that no person is worth more than £1,000 per annum, whether that person was a civil servant, judge, teacher or Minister or anybody else.  Nobody can deny that that was preached all over the country. There was a general tendency towards <Col N="275" /> pruning down or planning down of salaries and the standard of living. There was also preached an appeal to the persons who did not happen at the time to have reached the higher scale. I understand that a Deputy on the opposite benches used the expression from time to time &ldquo;the under dog.&rdquo; Deputy Corry always represented himself as standing for the &ldquo;under dog&rdquo;. This amendment is really one which does stand for the &ldquo;under dog.&rdquo;  This amendment is one for which I am sure that Deputy Corry will vote.  It is, as Deputy Cosgrave said, the lesser of two evils.  It does attempt to take out of the general principle of the Bill a small section of the numbers affected by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter which has not been referred to here in the general discussion on civil servants.  The vast majority of the civil servants have to live in Dublin, unfortunately for themselves.  You do not find civil servants in Ballydehob, Ballyporeen or Ballyjamesduff.  They have to live in Dublin.  Whatever one says about the standard of living, or the scale of living bonus granted arising out of the cost of prices, everybody in this House must agree that the standard of living and the cost of living in Dublin are higher than in Ballydehob, Ballyporeen, Ballyjamesduff or, as somebody has said, in England.  I think if the Minister insists on refusing this amendment he will be doing an injury, not to his Party or to his Government, but to this country and to the younger civil servants who have come in here for the past eight, nine or ten years, and who are and will necessarily be for years under £400 a year.  They cannot be expected to give that attention, that energy and that full efficiency of brain power to their work that one should expect from a contented civil service at present and about which those on the Front Bench opposite talked so much in the past.  I would really appeal to the Minister to make some concession on this amendment.  After all, Governments will come and Governments will go, but the civil servants must be there <Col N="276" /> anyhow.  If you have a discontented lower grade civil servant you cannot expect him to develop into an efficient higher grade civil servant.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has been kind enough to bring in about the under dog.  Deputy O'Sullivan and those with him have been whipping the under dog for the last ten years and when we were in opposition and made appeals for the under dog and asked them to give a little less loot and to save those who had to pay the piper, the ordinary tenant farmers of the country, we know the answer we got from Deputy O'Sullivan and those with him.  It is the farmers of the country who have to foot this bill and to find the £13,700,000 that Deputy O'Sullivan and those associated with him clapped down on the country in salaries to paid officials. This country cannot afford to pay £13,700,000 to paid officials.  They could not afford it at any time since Deputy Cosgrave became President of the State in 1922.</P>

The people who get these salaries could much better afford a cut than the old age pensioners.  We hear a lot about income tax.  Compare the farmer's income in 1921 with the farmer's income in 1927, when we new Land Bill was introduced, or the farmer's income in 1931, when we had added compensation for this disturbance clause into the latest Land Bill.  Compare these things and ask yourself where was the money to come from.  I made my position very clear to the House before on this Bill. If you go back to 1922&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They were very anxious to preserve the top-notchers and they did not give a hang what happened the under-dog. Deputy O'Sullivan talks about the man with a thousand a year.  There was never in this country a man worth more than a thousand a year to the country.  If there is a man worth more elsewhere, in God's name, let him go and get it.</P>

We heard a lot about these little agreements&mdash;Article 10 and so on&mdash; that the salaries of officials were never to be touched.  I am sorry a few other agreements were not made which would safeguard the taxpayers and the ordinary workmen.  When Deputy O'Sullivan talks about the high prices in Dublin, does he realise who are causing the high prices?  It is the highly-paid officials in Dublin who are shoving up the cost of living in Dublin. The unfortunate workman has to pay the same prices out of his week's wages.  We have heard the tale about the poor civil servant with £1,500 a year who has to go in a Ford car when he used to go in a Rolls Royce. We have heard about the insurance on his house and all the other items which he has to pay.  I am sick of that old tale.  It is played out.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Corry was dragged into the net by Deputy O'Sullivan.  When he stood up, I thought that he would offer to the House some explanation of his failure to reproduce on this stage of the Bill the amendment which stood in his name on the Committee Stage and which he did not then move.  I understand, as Deputy Corry understands, how he was saved the trouble of having to move that amendment at that stage. He made a statement here that, if he had been assured of any fair measure of support for the amendment which stood in his name on Committee Stage, he would have reproduced the amendment on this stage and moved it.  May I ask him&mdash;he will probably have an opportunity of replying&mdash;how he endeavoured to secure support for that amendment?  Was it inside the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party at the Party meeting, or was it in the Lobby canvassing Deputies, irrespective of Party, that he is supposed to have found that he could not get the necessary measure of support to carry the amendment.</P>

I believe that there would have been a considerable measure of support for the amendment which appeared in his name.  Since it appeared in his name, I thought he would have the courage at least to move it and test the House on its merits.  Deputy Corry has repeatedly stated in this House that no man in the service of the State&mdash; Minister, civil servant or public servant of any kind&mdash;is worth more than a thousand pounds a year.</P>

Does the Minister deny that?  If he does not, does Deputy Corry know it?  Deputy Corry talks about protecting the under-dog, but he fails to stand up to move an amendment which I honestly think he believed to be right and fair.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not withdrawing what I stated.  I say it is a correct statement.  There was a discussion on the Hospitals Bill in the House during the week and Deputy Corry was silent, and I believe his silence gave consent to what everybody knows is contained in the Bill, namely, a proposal to give £1,000 to one man and £800 a year to two others for doing three months' work.  When Deputy Corry speaks again I hope he will go, in greater detail, into the matters he raised a few months ago and that he will convince the House that in this State we have civil servants and public servants who are drawing £13,700,000 a year.  The Minister for Finance was chairman of the Public Accounts Committee for a year, and he was a member of it for at least another year, and from the information he gained there he <Col N="281" /> could easily have found out that by wiping out waste in many departments he would save more than he is going to save by cutting the salaries of people in the State service.  There are other amendments which are being proposed to cut the salaries of individuals who have only £60 a year.  I think instances of money wasted could have been found by the Minister if he had the time and the inclination to go carefully into the Estimates for the public services.  He could have procured this £280,000 by cutting waste and not salaries.  I hope that when Deputy Corry again appears in the part of defending the <Col N="282" /> under dog he will have some regard to the realities of the situation we are discussing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 63:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, in paragraph (b) (i) of Part IV to insert after the words &ldquo;in the case of&rdquo; the words &ldquo;scale payment sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses and.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am moving this amendment for the purpose of endeavouring to secure exemption for a particularly lowly-paid class from the cuts proposed in this Bill.  I understand that it is proposed, under Part IV of the Schedule, to cut the remuneration of scale payment sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, and if that proposal is proceeded with it will, in my opinion, inflict very serious hardship on the people concerned.  On 26th April of this year I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs a question with a view to securing information as to the remuneration of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, and I am sure that the Minister could not have felt very proud of the scale of salary paid by his Department to these public servants.  These figures are interesting, because while Deputy Corry purports to believe that he is standing for slashing the top-notchers, as he described it a few moments ago, and while other Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party will say that this Bill does not mean cutting the underdog, I want to put it to those Deputies who want to salve their consciences in that way that the figures I am going to read for them now indicate clearly that this Bill is a slash on remuneration, great and small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must quote from the official reply given to me by the Minister.  In that reply, the Minister informed me that there were, in the Post Office service, 1,308 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses whose inclusive remuneration did not exceed £60 per year.  He stated that an additional 216 had between £60 and £80 a year; that an additional 146 had between £80 and £100 a year; an additional 114 between £100 and £120 a year; an additional 59 between £130 and £150 a year, and, out of 2,041 scale payment sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, only 1989 have more than £3 per week or, out of 2,041, 1,308 have less than £60 per year.  What is the £60 per year for?  Is it all remuneration for personal services?  It is not, because for that £60 per year which these 1,300 people receive, they not merely have to carry on the post office and accept complete responsibility for the financial transactions in the office but they have, in addition, to supply the premises, to provide the lighting, the stationery except the official forms, and even the blotting paper and the ink.  They, even, have to provide the twine in the office and all this plus their personal energy for the magnificent sum of £60 per year, and not exceeding £60 per year for 1,308 such people out of a total of 2,041.  Even £60 per year, however, is an exaggeration of the real position.  Many of these people have £20 per year and, for that £20 per year, they provide the premises, the light, the stationery, the twine, the ink and the blotting paper.  While the Minister for Finance may think it desirable to cut the payments of these people, I am sure the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has a very heavy heart over the whole matter, because he knows perfectly well that these people are shockingly underpaid, and that every day in the week there comes to the attention of the Minister, and to the attention of other Ministers, the same sad story of people getting into unfortunate circumstances, because of <Col N="285" /> the scandalously low rates of wages they receive for performing important and responsible services on behalf of the community.  It is sought in this Bill to cut these people's payments. I would like to know on what principle, or what justification there is for cutting their remuneration.</P>
    <P>I suppose I will be told that this is only part-time service.  Anybody who has any practical experience of the work of these people, as distinct from mere theoretical experience, gathered from a prepared brief, knows perfectly well that they are not part-time servants.  Many of these people are sub-postmasters, and their salaries in many cases are so low that they cannot afford to employ any assistant.  They are required to have the offices open at 9 o'clock in the morning and to balance their accounts after 7 o'clock in the evening.  If people come in and out during these hours they must be there. If people do not come all the better, but they are in the same position as any other shop assistant.  It is quite unfair to attempt to describe them as part-time officials when, in fact, they are full-time officials.  If they were regarded as full-time officials their remuneration would not be cut, because the Bill exempts whole-time officers with £300 yearly.  These people are put into the category of part-time officials apparently for the purpose of inflicting cuts in their payments.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party had better get this into their heads, that this is a case of cutting remuneration as low as 8/- per week.  There can be no justification whatever for that.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell the House the machinery that he will necessarily have to construct in order to inflict this cut, if he goes ahead with his intention.  The remuneration is not all for personal service.  He cannot cut the remuneration relating to the cost of twine, light and premises.  If he does not do that, he must in each individual case of 2,041 persons go through the remuneration to find out the rent, rates, number of lights, and number of desks in the office in order to ascertain the amount of stationery required.  When he has done that he must segregate each salary into two <Col N="286" /> parts, allowing so much in respect of personal service, and so much in respect of non-personal service such as the provision of premises, light, stationery, etc.  I do not know if the Minister made any estimate of the cost of doing that in the case of 2,041 persons.  I challenge the Minister to deny this, that what he will save by cutting these people will not, in my opinion&mdash;and I have some experience of the work&mdash; amount to the cost of ascertaining how much of the salary was in respect of personal service and how much in respect of non-personal service.  If the Minister consulted his advisers on the matter he would know perfectly well that, even after inflicting the cut, he will have spent more money getting the particulars than he will get by inflicting the cuts.</P>
    <P>There is no justification whatever for cutting these people's remuneration and the Minister ought to know that. I hope the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will tell the House what he knows about the under-payment of these people; tell the House the experience he has every day in the week, and every week in the year, and at all events save his soul and his conscience, by getting up and saying that he has no responsibility for the action of the Minister, as indicated in this Bill.  If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs does that he will, at least, save his own soul.  As far as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is concerned, it is realised that cutting people with these low salaries is not merely an unjustifiable procedure, but a fiendish procedure.</P>

    <P>Where the Minister is satisfied that the amount of the salary of an office has been fixed on the basis that an undefined part thereof is of the nature of an allowance for expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of such office, the Minister shall determine for the purposes of this Act the <Col N="287" /> proportion of such salary which is attributable to such allowance and thereupon the proportion so determined shall not be included in or form part of the salary of such office for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Deputy is aware of the fact that we have power to do that, and that consequently it is not proposed to cut the whole of the payment made to the persons whom he would cover in his amendment.</P>

      <P>It must have been, otherwise how would it be possible to say that an office would carry so many pounds, and that the person appointed must provide, as the Deputy says, premises, light, stationery, ink and even blotting paper? If it had not been made, how is it possible to fix an amount which would cover the expenses that might properly attach to an office in a particular town and, at the same time, provide a fair remuneration for the person who is running the office?</P>

      <P>At any rate that is how it will be done.  It will not be necessary to have this personal tour <Col N="288" /> of inspection, which Deputy Norton has suggested would be essential, if the terms of the Bill are going to be fulfilled.  There must be on record in the post office a statement showing the annual income derived from every sub-post office, and it is quite clear, even if it did not exist, that it would be easy to determine what amount of such income might properly be allocated for expenses.  In putting the amendment before the House Deputy Norton has been careful to mislead it, as always.  He talked about persons who get £20 but he has been silent about persons who get over £180, big and prosperous shopkeepers in a country town who will be able to say that a large part of the remuneration which they draw is paid by way of rent for premises, and in recoupment of the other expenses which they must necessarily incur in holding the post office.  In some cases they would probably be persons paying a substantial amount of income tax.  In some cases they would probably be persons enjoying an income equal to the salary enjoyed by a higher grade Post Office official, or a higher grade civil servant.  When the remuneration of such a person comes to be considered, as I said, we will probably find that the greater part of the £150 will be allocated&mdash; and properly allocated&mdash;to office rent, light, and all the other expenditure which he must necessarily incur in the proper discharge of the duties of his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore the amount of the reduction which he will suffer will probably be much less than one per cent., and if it is much less than one per cent. in his case it will certainly be very much less even than that in the case of a person with the remuneration of £20, referred to by Deputy Norton.  In fact, I might go so far as to say that it will probably be found that a person with a remuneration of £18 to £20 a year will not be cut at all under this Bill.  It is not the intention to cut them. because quite properly it is realised that in cases like this the Post Office barely pays the cost of running it, from the point of view of the person <Col N="289" /> who holds it.  We all know that the person who holds the office does not hold it, and does not wish to hold it, merely for the income that accrues to him out of it.  We all know he holds it because it is an additional attraction to his premises; it brings into them customers that might go elsewhere. That is the reason why the competition for those offices is so keen.  The Deputy is well aware of the fact that it is keen, and it is keen not because of the small remuneration which is paid to the office holder, but because it makes the premises in which the office is situated much more attractive to the ordinary customer. It is not, therefore, a question of dealing with the wage earner.  The fact that the business of a sub-post office is carried on in certain premises is in the nature of an advertisement for those premises; therefore, the policy of the Government might be put in this way, that instead of cutting remuneration, as Deputy Norton would like the House to understand we propose to do under this Bill, we merely propose to increase our advertising rates, and to compel the shopkeeper who holds those premises to contribute something to the Exchequer at the present time.</P>

      <P>I must forego that <Col N="290" /> delight.  The Minister for Finance has made a statement which is tantamount to saying that I was telling an untruth to this House when I said that the information as to the cost of premises, light, stationery, etc., was not available. I made that statement.  The Minister for Finance told this House that that was not so; that the information was available.  Would you permit me, therefore, in the interests of veracity, to refer again to this question which I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the 26th April, what the remuneration of sub-postmasters was, and how many exceed £60, £80, £100, £130 and £150.  I also asked if he could state approximately what percentage of the salary is in respect of (a) personal services and (b) premises, lighting, stationery, etc., supplied by such officer.  The Minister supplied me with the information about the remuneration, and added this: &ldquo;The information asked for in the second part of the question is not available and would be difficult to ascertain.&rdquo;  My statement is, therefore, perfectly proved, and the Minister has completely misled the House.  In his endeavour to prove me incorrect he made a perfect fool of himself by stating that this information was available when the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who is in charge of the Department, knows that it is not available.</P>

      <P>As a Senator remarked recently in the Seanad, there is very little use in talking on this question, because the Government seem to pay very little attention to the position of the farmers.  Some days ago, when he was speaking in the Dáil, Deputy Corry started off by saying that he had to admit the farmers were in a very bad way.  Then he went on to indicate all that the present Government has done for the farmers during the last one and a half years.  I think the Deputy's attitude was very inconsistent.  At first he admitted the truth and then he proceeded to endeavour to bluff the people.  There is an old saying that you can bluff some of the people some of the time, but you cannot bluff all the people all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism about the way in which the farmers in this country utilise their land.  There has been a good deal of talk about tillage.  The members of <Col N="295" /> the present Government have time and again endeavoured to put the late Minister for Agriculture into the position that he was opposed to a tillage policy during his term of office as Minister.  That is not so. The late Minister for Agriculture stated on many an occasion in this House that his view was that every farmer should till a certain amount for the purpose of feeding to his own stock, but he was not in favour of a tillage policy if its only purpose was to produce cash crops.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that he himself had made the production of pigs pay, but he did not go into the matter very fully as he should have, and told us whether he reared the pigs himself, or whether he bought them and, if so, how long he was feeding them, the price he paid for the young pigs and the price he received when he sold them.  I have lived amongst farmers all my life and I know as much about them as anybody in this House.  I have always heard farmers say that the only man in the country who made money on pigs was the man who was always engaged in their production.  There were times when such a man would not make a profit on producing pigs; there were times when he met with losses, but then when a rise came in prices he had his supplies for the market and was able to make a profit on them.  What is the position now of such people?  I represent a constituency where the people are most industrious and where they produce a lot of pigs.  In fact, the production of pigs is their mainstay.  What is their position to-day?  One man told me that his position would not be so bad last year but for the fact that on 58 pigs he suffered a loss of £1 apiece.  In view of that one may say that the position in the farming industry to-day is that the less you do the less you lose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry stated here that he got £6 15/- for oats last harvest.  I would like to know where he got it. The Millers in Cork, when they took stock, found that they sold a certain amount of Indian meal over certain <Col N="296" /> periods previous to the mixture scheme under the Cereals Act being put into force.  They calculated that on the ten per cent. mixture they would require a certain amount of oats, but what is the position now? Since that time they have bought no oats at all, with the result that people all over the country cannot get sale for their oats.  There is no market for it. Only last week a member of the Seanad told me that he had a large quantity of oats and he did not think he would be able to sell it.  Deputy Corry tried to get over that by saying that he had no pity for people who could hold over their supplies.  That is how Deputy Corry meets the situation in regard to oats.  The Minister is encouraging people to produce wheat, and to those who hold it over to give an increased price for it.</P>

      <P>At what price?  I would like to know what the flour scheme is costing this country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government went out of office only 1,500,000 sacks of flour were being milled in the country, and he went on to say that the output now was 2,500,000 sacks.  A merchant in Macroom told me that he could buy foreign flour at 3/6 a sack cheaper than the home manufactured flour.  A simple calculation shows that 3/6 a sack on 2,500,000 sacks of flour amounts, roughly, to £437,000.  Deputy Brennan asked a question as to how many hands were employed in the flour-milling industry here, and I put a question to the Minister as to what the cost was, but the Minister evaded replying.  Everybody who has read the Report of the Tariff Commission knows that if all the flour millers of the country were engaged in the production of these 2,500,000 sacks of flour the calculation was made that employment would only be given to 153 extra hands.  Making the liberal allowance of £4 a week each for these 153 extra hands there is an expenditure of about £600 a week or £30,000 <Col N="297" /> a year, so that if we deduct this sum of £30,000 from the £437,000 we find that the policy of the Government, so far as the milling industry is concerned, is costing this country £407,000 a year.  Yet in the face of these figures we are told that wheat growing is a paying proposition.  If it is why did not Deputy Kelly of Meath accept the generous offer I made to him last October?  I offered him 15 acres of tillage land situate about 15 miles from the City of Dublin in order that he might avail of it to educate the people in that area how to grow wheat at a profit.  The Deputy did not accept my offer, and he did not accept it because, as I said at the time, wheat growing experts have found that the growing of wheat is not a paying proposition.</P>
      <P>With regard to the feeding of pigs, Deputy Corry made a comparison between the prices here and in Scotland for wheat and barley.  He said: &ldquo;look at the prices we are paying as a result of the Government's policy and legislation.&rdquo;  I asked him who paid it except the farmers in the poorest parts of the country.  The Government themselves admit that the ten per cent. addition to the mixture resulted in an increase of about 10/- a ton to the cost of meal. Now there is to be a further increase to 15 per cent., which will mean that the farmers of the country will have to pay 15/- a ton more for their meal. It is no wonder, as Deputy Kent said, that the hens are going on strike because the feeding they are getting is not strong enough.  Farmers have told me that their pigs come out in the middle of the night crying because of the hunger.  I have always maintained that it is not fair to tax the people in the poorer parts of the country to help those who can well afford to provide feeding themselves. I think it would be a much better policy for the Minister to give a subsidy of so much per ton so that the people in the areas who have to buy feeding stuffs could obtain homegrown cereals at a reduced price and mix them themselves.  People would then know what they were getting, but at present they do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> When this admixture scheme was under consideration before the Tariff Commission, an expert witness, giving evidence, said that it was impossible to detect adulteration in the mixture. For that reason I object to the present system.  If the Government feel that people who produce grain should be helped, then they should do that in a different way to that in which it is being done and be honest about it. Fianna Fáil Deputies, in the course of their speeches, have told us about the great depression there is all over the world.  When they occupied these benches and when we made that statement they laughed at us, and said that it was the Cumann na nGaedheal Government that was responsible for all the depression.  We are getting a good deal of dictation now from the experts on the Government benches as to how we should run our farms. We are told a lot about the wisdom of a tillage policy.  I have some experience of feeding.  I put in seven cows to feed and a fortnight afterwards I was offered £51 for them.  I fed them for another eight weeks and at the end of that time I was very glad to get £50 for them.  I leave it to members of this House who know what it costs to feed cows to estimate the loss that I sustained.</P>
    <P>The most unfortunate thing about the whole policy of the present Government is that it is driving people out of production.  In Cork this year the quantity of feeding stuffs sold was only half what was sold two years ago.  I am not a politician.  I said in this House before that it made no difference to the people of this country what party occupied the Government benches if the country were prosperous.  That is my policy.  There has been a good deal of talk about dividing up land. I have seen some land that was divided up, but so far as I could observe there has not been much change made in the working of it, because most of it is still being used for grazing.  If the Government want to go in for dividing up land, then surely they ought to take steps to provide a market for what is produced and we have not that market <Col N="299" /> at the present time due to their policy.  My policy always was to increase production on the land but our position to-day is that we have no market in which to sell our produce. Before the last two General Elections we were told by the Fianna Fáil Party that the markets would be got.  We were to get a market in Germany, but to-day our cows are going to Germany because they are cheaper than old horses.  I always heard it said that it was a foolish thing for a man to give up on job until he was sure of walking into another.  That saying has great application so far as the policy of the present Government is concerned. They should have taken care to try and preserve the markets we had until the other markets that they talked about were procured.  The Minister said a few days ago that we had circulated the report that they were going to reduce the number of cattle in the country.  We never said that but they said it themselves: that they were going to put people instead of bullocks on the land. They have admitted now that the more land they divide the more cattle the country can produce, but what is the good of producing anything when you have no market to sell in?</P>
    <P>There are people in my area producing cattle and a very poor part of the country it is to produce cattle.  At the present time, every one of these cattle from two year olds upwards has to bear a tax of £6 which, if you wish, less the bounty, is reduced to about £4 15s.  Some time ago a cattle dealer was buying cattle from a man in this district.  He caught one of the beasts by the head to look at its teeth.  The man from whom he was buying them asked what was that for. He replied: &ldquo;You can ask President de Valera.  He can tell you all about it.&rdquo;  I think it is up to the Minister now to give us some idea of the future policy of the Government with regard to agriculture in this country.  Nobody would be more pleased than I if he were able to say that the agricultural position in the country was satisfactory. We want a market for our <Col N="300" /> agricultural produce and we want to encourage production amongst the people.  If you build up the agricultural industry in this country you can build up your other industries side by side with it.</P>

      <P>There is one thing on which all Deputies are unanimous and that is that the Government and the Dáil should work in the interests of the farmers of Ireland.  Starting with that as our base, we should ask ourselves in what way are we to work in the interests of the farmers of Ireland, taking the farmers of Ireland as the Irish nation?  It is undeniable that during the ten years of Cumann na Gaedheal Government in this country we handed over £52,000,000 to the British Government.  We were asked to give 25 per cent. of the total revenue of this nation to a foreign country.  If we continued to give that 25 per cent. for a few more years to that foreign country, we would have no further need of an economic policy, or any other policy in this country, for the country was bound to become bankrupt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keely</NameTxt>
      <P>During those years, as I said, we were handing over £5,250,000 every year to the British Government. The British themselves owe a debt to the United States and the annual payments in respect of that debt amount to about five per cent. of the British revenue.  The British Government and the British people say to-day that they are unable to bear the burden of that five per cent. of the revenue which goes to a foreign State.  Here we are, an agricultural country, asked to hand over 25 per cent. of our revenue to the British Government.  If we continue to do that how, in God's name, could we survive as a nation? How could we continue to do that unless we were prepared to face ruin and bankruptcy when a highly-industrialised country like England, a wealthy country, is not able to bear a payment which represents only five per cent. of its total revenue?  That is a fact which I would ask Deputies on <Col N="301" /> the opposite benches and Deputies of the Centre Party to consider.  If they have any interest in the nation, if they wish to save the people from ruin and bankruptcy, they should be content to support the Government who are trying to save this nation from the plunder of this £5,250,000 by the British Government.</P>
      <P>We are told that if the economic war goes on this country will lose far more than we can hope to gain by it. We heard Deputy MacDermot a few moments ago say that we should not consider that we are paying £5,250,000 to the British.  He mentioned the fact that pensioners in this country, those who were maimed and crippled in the Great War, are getting some £2,000,000 from the British Government.  Does he mean to insinuate that that is a gift from the British Government to this country?  Does he mean to insinuate that the people of this country should pay the pensions of men who fought for Britain in her war for the supposed freedom and liberties of small nations?  Should we pay £2,000,000 to the soldiers who helped England in the reconquest of Heligoland or in the annexation of these German territories which she holds to-day?  Are we to pay pensions to those soldiers who exposed the people of these annexed territories, heretofore held by the Germans, to bombing by British aeroplanes when the people there tried to shake off the British yoke?  Is that what the Deputy meant?</P>

      <P>Agreed in word, but what have been your actions here in this House?  Where is the general in the field who would hear from opposing armies the remarks that have been passed by Deputies on the other side and who would surrender in such circumstances? Are you not giving every encouragement to the British Government to continue this war in the hope that they will be able to starve out our people and bring us to our knees?  Is that not the encouragement you are giving to the British? One Deputy put the loss to this country by the economic war at £18,000,000 already.  If Mr. Thomas, or Mr. Chamberlain, or the British Ministers over there think they have caused a loss of £18,000,000 to this country are they any more likely to make an amicable settlement at any conference? Another Deputy puts the loss at £4,500,000 a year.  His reasoning to me runs something like this: Mr. Chamberlain, in the British House of Commons, says he hopes to collect £3,000,000 by reason of the tariffs. Add to that, said the Deputy on the opposite benches, £1,500,000 given in bounties to the Irish producer, which in all makes £4,500,000.  He counts as a loss to this nation the £1,500,000 given as bounty on the produce of the Irish farmer.  He says it is a direct loss to the nation, whereas, if my intelligence has not gone greatly wrong, that £1,500,000 goes into the pockets of Irish agricultural producers and is no loss to the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPKeely" hpid="Mr. Keely Mr. Keely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keely</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, apparently.  I should consider that the £1,500,000 obtained from tariffs on goods coming into the country would be a gain to the country and not a loss.  If Great Britain exports coal and other materials to this country and we levy a tariff of £1,500,000 on that coal and the other materials she sends in, and if our ports are open to the Germans, the Dutch, the French, and other people who send in their produce, the only reasonable conclusion we can come to is that we are getting that £1,500,000 off Great Britain.  I am dealing with the argument made by Deputies on the other side.  I heard a Centre Party Deputy yesterday, speaking on the Cement Bill, say that cement can be bought much cheaper in Dublin than in Liverpool.  If that is so, why is it? Does it not arise from the fact that Great Britain tried to under-sell the Continental exporters here?  If that is so and cement is sold cheaper in Dublin than in Liverpool, is not that a gain to the Irish people?</P>

      <P>There is only one honest way to settle this question and that <Col N="304" /> is to show Great Britain that there is going to be no surrender here until Great Britain concedes the rights to which we believe we are legally and morally entitled.  When Great Britain concedes those rights to us, we shall make a Treaty with Great Britain that we shall honour in the letter, as well as in the spirit.</P>

      <P>May I correct the account given by the last speaker of what I have said?  He suggests that I put forward the view that it was the duty of this country to pay the pensions of people who served in the British Army during the Great War. I never suggested anything of the kind.  I challenged the statement, and I challenged it again, that there was a net sum of five and a quarter millions being bled from this country year by year by England.  That is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true. That is not a net sum, because I pointed out that large portions of that came back here; that one million pounds, or thereabouts, came back to the holders of Irish land stock in this country, that three-quarters of a million, or thereabouts, came back to Irish police pensioners in this country; which makes a big hole in the five and a quarter millions to begin with. Although I admitted that it was not on all-fours with these other payments, I said that we ought not to forget that there was a stream of two million pounds year by year coming into this country to pensioners who had served in the Great War.  So that the general statement that there was this terrific net drain from us of five and a quarter millions year by year is totally misleading as to our financial situation.</P>

If there is going to be a settlement of this financial question, and if it were brought about before <Col N="305" /> the Horse Show was held, it would make a great difference to the breeders and owners of horses in the sale of their animals at the Show.  It was pitiful last year to see the prices that people got for yearlings, some of which cost £50 to be sired.  Some of these yearlings were sold at seven and eight guineas each.  The Minister knows the worry, expense and trouble of breeding thoroughbred stock and what it means to the country.  We have the name of breeding the best horses in the world.  That trade has been absolutely ruined.  I would, therefore, impress on the Minister the necessity of having a settlement of this question before the Dublin Horse Show.</P>

      <P>I am not a farmer, but I have listened to a lot about farming since I entered this House a couple of months ago.  Almost every day in the week we hear about the wrongs of the farmers.  We had them last night for three or four hours; we had them for three or four hours to-day; and now we have them again at 10.15 at night. Nobody that I ever could trace in my ancestry was a farmer&mdash;certainly on the paternal side anyway.  I went back a long way at one time to find out something about my family history in the City of Dublin.  I went back well over one hundred years, but I had to stop because there was a woman amongst my ancestors who was not as good as she might be.  I had to stop then or goodness knows what else I might discover.  I have, however, met farmers both in private and in public and I have always come to the conclusion, founded upon certain experience, that they were a shrewd body of men.  Their heads are well screwed on.  I do not blame them for that because I know they have to earn their living very hard, like their fathers before them, and their fathers before them again.  Being a shrewd body of men, they know the difference between right and wrong.

Great Britain would not accept that arbitration.  The Fianna Fáil Party and every Nationalist in Ireland will remember well what happened <Col N="307" /> over arbitration in connection with the Six Counties.  Everybody knows that they could never again accept the same class of tribunal to try to settle any question that might arise between England and ourselves. I heard the President saying some years ago, in connection with a much similar matter which needed the interpretation of a tribunal to fix it, something that has always stuck in my mind.  He used these words: &ldquo;Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.&rdquo;  There is sound sense in that.  We should just think of the way in which Britain acts in her own interests.  Her Prime Minister is travelling about Europe and America seeking international aid for the present policy of Britain.  Does he not go one day to France, another day to Italy, then to America and back to Switzerland?  Does he not go all over the globe?  Is he not a regular hiker, seeking international aid and influence for the policy of his own country?  Why would he refuse the same treatment to us?  Is he not inconsistent when he refuses the same aid to settle the dispute between this country and his country?</P>

    <P>The Deputy who spoke in the elevated position this evening said he trusted more in observation than in newspaper writings and speeches heard here or elsewhere.  We can all observe.  I am not an agriculturist and, in order that I might learn something about the consequences to this country, I ask the ordinary man and woman in the street who I know would not be liars, their opinions on this matter.  I put questions to them regarding the position of affairs in the country.  I can give you a lot of instances of what their replies were. One was a professional man, who is an architect and was a strong Unionist.  I remember when, if he could not sing &ldquo;Rule Britannia,&rdquo; he used to whistle it.  I asked him how things were and he put his hand gently on my shoulder and said: &ldquo;The best Government we ever had.&rdquo;  The next man I asked was a County Dublin farmer, whose family has been in business for generations. <Col N="308" /> When I asked him how are things, he said: &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;  I am only speaking of people as I find them.  A lady came into my shop some time ago on a certain business.  Having transacted the business, she said to me: &ldquo;I came all the way from Kildare to see you and I am only just after arriving.&rdquo; I asked her: &ldquo;What were you doing in Kildare?&rdquo;  She said: &ldquo;I am travelling; I travel amongst the small farmers of the country.&rdquo;</P>

I asked her what is the position amongst the small farmers and she said: &ldquo;They are hard pressed, but they are all right; they are keeping their hearts well up. They believe that this thing is going to come right; they are acting up to that belief and working as hard as they can.&rdquo;  I asked her: &ldquo;Do you travel through other counties?&rdquo; and she said: &ldquo;Yes, principally in Leinster.&rdquo;  I asked where she travelled last week and she said around Cavan&mdash;she mentioned Virginia&mdash;and she had the same experience there. The next man I questioned was a commercial traveller for woollens.  I asked him how things were and he said: &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;  He mentioned a number of factories in Ireland which are doing three times as much business as they were doing a couple of years ago.</P>

      <P>I explained that I was not a farmer and I thought that would be sufficient for the members of the Centre Party, without their asking questions.  The next person I <Col N="309" /> questioned was a parish priest connected with a church some distance outside Dublin.  I asked him: &ldquo;How are the farmers in your district doing?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;The farmers are all right; it is very hard to pull them down; they never come down except through their own fault and they will stand up to this; if they have to sell cheaply they buy cheaply.&rdquo;  The next person I questioned was a doctor in touch with the North of Ireland.  I asked him: &ldquo;How things were there.&rdquo;  He said that the farmers around here were complaining about the economic war, the pressure on agriculture, and the hardships to themselves and their families, but he said: &ldquo;They are no worse off than the farmers in the North of Ireland; they are better off, though the farmers in the North of Ireland have a free entry into the British markets, the thing that the Southern farmers are complaining that they have not got.&rdquo; The next man I met was a commercial traveller in millinery, and I said to myself: &ldquo;Now this man surely must be down and out.&rdquo;  I asked him how was he getting along and he said: &ldquo;I am doing remarkably well.  Since the week before St. Patrick's Day, we have been working overtime.&rdquo;  I asked: &ldquo;Is it selling hats you are?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is selling hats and I never had a better time.&rdquo;  I <Col N="310" /> asked him: &ldquo;Was it to the farmers' wives and daughters he was selling the hats,&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;Yes, they have got the latest fashions, and what is more they look remarkably well in them.&rdquo;  All right, you may laugh, but it is not a laughing matter to me.</P>

      <P>I am only telling you my every day experiences.  Hope has been expressed here that this question will be settled.  Well, that will be all right if it is settled, but the men in charge of affairs here are not the type of men to be cajoled any more. They did not get into this economic war with light hearts at all.  I submit that they are as patriotic a body of men as are in this House and are as anxious and desirous for the welfare of the country as any other Party. Deputies ought to give them credit for it.</P>
