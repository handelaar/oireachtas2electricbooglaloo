      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the Rushbrooke Docks, County Cork, have been advertised to be sold within the next few days; if he is further aware that it is essential that the up-to-date equipment of this dockyard should be available for ships using the Port of Cork, and whether he proposes to take any steps to prevent the sale of the equipment of this dockyard and thus secure its retention for the Port of Cork.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Inspectors of Taxes and Wages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, as alleged, it is a fact that inspectors of taxes are endeavouring to dictate to farmers as to the wages they should pay and, if so, what is the present position in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1544" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Deputy for affording me an opportunity of dealing with this matter.  I have invited Deputies Cosgrave and Bennett, who raised it in the House, to let me have the correspondence on which the charge is based, but they have declined to do so.  Furthermore, I have not received from any taxpayer any complaint that any inspector of taxes has attempted to dictate to him in the manner represented by the Deputies and by certain newspapers, as to the wages he should pay to his work people; and the Revenue Commissioners are not at liberty to produce to me correspondence dealing with a particular taxpayer's private affairs, unless such taxpayer makes a complaint to me and asks me to go into his case.  The difficulty in this instance is also intensified by the fact that the Deputies who first made the allegation have declined to supply to the Revenue Commissioners even the name and address of the taxpayer so as to enable them to identify the case or the particular inspector's district in which it arose, and to make the necessary investigations.</P>
      <P>In view of this extraordinary attitude it must be presumed that these Deputies feel that the charges which they have levelled against the Revenue Officers will not bear examination&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and that they are now concerned to shirk an inquiry into the matter.  Members will appreciate the extreme difficulty of dealing adequately with an allegation of this description in such circumstances.  I may say, however, that the suggestion that officials of the Revenue Department are endeavouring to dictate to farmers as to how their farms should be run is palpably absurd.  In computing the profit or loss on a farm an inspector of taxes must see that he does not allow to be charged against the farm revenue wages which in fact are not paid, wages paid for work which has nothing to do with the farm, or sums handed over to members of a wealthy farmer's family far in excess of the value of their work on the farm.  Except <Col N="1545" /> to ascertain the correct profit or loss, he is not concerned.</P>
      <P>It is still more absurd to suggest that it is the policy of Ministers to instigate action by the Revenue authorities to depress farm wages.  The Revenue authorities exercise statutory powers and Ministers have no power whatever to interfere with them in their interpretation of the Income Tax Acts.  As far as this Government is concerned there has never been the faintest attempt at such interference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware from the answer he has read out to the question that (1) it is not denied that the document in question was issued&mdash; it is not denied either by the Minister or by the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;and (2) the suggestion made, to the effect&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this a supplementary question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  The Minister does not deny&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the question the Deputy asked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that it was obvious from the Minister's reply that he did not deny the document in question was issued.  I am inviting him to give a denial in respect of two matters (1) that the letter was written and (2) that the statement made in the House was true.  That statement was to the effect that in cases where 25/-, 26/- and 27/- a week were paid to men the suggestion was made that women should be employed at 5/-, 6/- or 7/- a week.  Does the Minister deny that it is without his power to ask for particulars in such cases from the inspectors of taxes or from the Revenue Commissioners? Of course, it is to be understood that an inquiry in respect of particular cases is not allowed, but does the Minister seriously deny that he can ask the Revenue Commissioners for particulars of extracts of letters sent in connection with farm accounts to farmers as regards wages paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not propose to accept the statement of any Deputy who is not willing to substantiate <Col N="1546" /> that statement by producing the letter on which he bases the statement. I may say further that Deputy Bennett has refused to produce, to the Revenue Commissioners, a letter which he alleges to exist.  I have no knowledge of such a letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept the Deputy's word that he has such a letter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter has been seen by several Deputies.  Is the Minister not aware that the Revenue Commissioners could get the information from many such letters written to farmers in many counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister apply to the Revenue Commissioners for copies of previous correspondence which they had before them when similar letters had to be withdrawn?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether his attention has been called to the very low prices prevailing this year for Irish wool; whether his Department are taking any action with a view to securing new and better markets for the product; whether any plan has been considered for utilising in the mills of the Saorstát a larger share of native wool; and whether in view of the big losses being endured by producers, he has any proposal to put forward for improving the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters referred to in the question are at present receiving the attention of my Department and of the Department of Industry and Commerce, in the light of existing conditions in the wool industry generally.  Questions relating to woollen mills, and to the marketing, grading and other commercial aspects of the subject, as distinct from the production of wool, should be addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire whether the Minister saw, in the last few days, a report that there is likely to be a <Col N="1547" /> great scarcity of wool in the immediate future?  Will he inquire as to the probable accuracy of that report and if he finds it to be accurate will he notify the producers not to part with their wool at the very low prices that prevail to-day?</P>

If there is to be any objection to taking it, as arranged, that is taking it on this day week, we would be prepared to put it back to Thursday, but we would have to have the Committee Stage on the 25th.  On our side we are quite prepared to take the Second Stage this day week, but if the Opposition thinks that does not afford sufficient time, owing to the fact that the Bill was only circulated to-day, then, we are prepared to give two extra days and not take it until Thursday week.</P>

It was in the light of having the Bill in our hands during the week-end that Tuesday was agreed to. To cover this we are now only being allowed a single week-end.</P>
      <P>As for taking the Committee Stage on the 25th, I do not think that sufficient time is being afforded in this case.  This Bill requires more than a layman's examination.  It requires thorough legal examination and report, and advice, in respect of such portions of it as may require amendments to be moved.  While I would say that the Second Reading ought not to be taken before Thursday week, that day fortnight would be the earliest date, I think, that would be fair to take the Committee Stage.</P>

We would be prepared to sit on, and unless you sit through the whole summer you cannot get through the Government business necessary if you postpone it for another week, that is, if you postpone the Second Reading from next Tuesday to the following week.</P>

Taking the Second Reading on Tuesday week makes it necessary to hand in amendments on Friday or Saturday so that in essence there is only one week-end. It is really insufficient.  If the Ministry wish to rush particular measures through this House, they have their majority.  They are, apparently, determined on doing that. So far as sitting here is concerned, no objection has been made from this side and we shall be able to test the physique of the members of the Ministry in that connection, if it comes to a contest.</P>

If the Second Reading were taken on Tuesday, that would leave a full fortnight before Committee Stage.  As, however, Deputies might have a grievance if we proposed that, we are prepared to take the Second Reading on Thursday instead.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;&mdash;(Minister for Finance).</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, in its present form, still contains certain proposals with regard to excess profits duty and certain proposals with regard to taxation.  I should like, at this stage, to remind the present Minister for Finance of what he said in previous years with regard to taxation generally and more especially with regard to excess profits duty.  The present Minister for Finance, speaking on 4th June, 1930, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In introducing his Budget in 1928, referring to the proposed new measures of which the country so <Col N="1552" /> bitterly complains to-day, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;For this coming year, we propose to get a substantial part of the extra income required by a resort to expedients which will give us revenue for one year only.  We intend to speed up the collection of abnormal arrears of income tax.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the comment upon that of the Minister for Finance who has imposed still greater taxation upon the country:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And the Minister has been as good as his word.  It is true that he has not used the thumb screw and the rack, favourite devices in mediaeval days for extracting revenue, but, short of these physical instruments, there is no procedure to which the Minister has not had recourse in order to secure the extra sums which he euphemistically describes as &lsquo;abnormal arrears of income tax.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The present Minister continued in one of those flights of fancy which we should have expected of him:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From inquiries which I have made, I am perfectly satisfied that large sums of money, described as &ldquo;abnormal arrears,&rdquo; have been in many cases nothing of the sort, have been simply blood money which harassed and broken men have paid to escape an even more unbearable victimisation.  The Minister smiles.  It is no laughing matter for the men who have been put out of business by the Minister's Department; no laughing matter for the men who have been ruined in health, mentally and physically; no laughing matter for the country and for the industries which have suffered because of the enormous and unjustifiable sums which the Minister has extracted from them.  It would scarcely be correct, I suppose, to describe these payments as blackmail but the methods which have been adopted to secure them are similar to the methods adopted by those who extort such unwilling tribute.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage of that Bill, on 5th June, 1930, the present Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am sure most members of the House are familiar with the situation <Col N="1553" /> which has been created in this country by the efforts of the Revenue Commissioners to collect, particularly in the case of excess profits, moneys which should have been paid to the British prior to 1921-22.  The position is that taxpayers to-day are being asked, first of all, to pay taxes not paid to the British Government; secondly, they are asked to pay interest on such taxes from the date upon which they should have been paid to the British Government; and, thirdly, they are asked to pay penalties for not having made returns in their proper time of their full income to the British Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I stop the quotation there to remind the Minister that this is all applicable to himself now?  Whatever force and intelligence these comments then had, they have application to his own methods to-day.  The present Minister then went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The important factor in connection with all this which the House ought to remember and which the Minister for Finance should take into consideration is that in 1919 practically every income tax office in the country was destroyed by order&mdash;notwithstanding anything the Minister may say to the contrary&mdash; of the Irish Republican Army. Every man who destroyed such an office was guilty of a crime against the then existing British law in this country but practically every person who engaged in that physical act of destruction has since been exempted from penalties or proceedings by the various Amnesty Acts.  But the people who broke the British revenue laws in this country, particularly those relating to excess profits, are still, I think, being visited with penalties and threatened with proceedings by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again let me pause.  At that stage the law was that the only assessment in relation to excess profits duty that could be made was one in respect of which the Revenue Commissioners were of opinion that failure to make returns was due either to fraud or to wilful neglect.  It was stated that wilful neglect had to be such as to <Col N="1554" /> amount to fraud.  We have an enlargement of that since.  Now, an assessment can be made whether or not there was fraud or wilful neglect. Even in the restricted conditions of assessment in those days, the Minister was pungent.  This is what he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In connection, first of all, with the excess profits duty, I have to refer the Minister to the report of the Revenue Commissioners, in which they say that they cannot make further assessments for excess profits duty unless, in their opinion, there has been fraud or wilful neglect on the part of the taxpayer. That is quite emphatic and very definite.  It means that the only case in which the Revenue Commissioners are now assessing is where, in their opinion, Irish taxpayers have been guilty of fraud or neglect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the Minister paused and asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fraud upon whom?  Not upon Saorstát Eireann, but upon the British Government because the excess profits duty, I believe, officially ended in August, 1921, long before the Free State was established and the Government came into office.  The point is that taxpayers are now being visited with pains and penalties because they did not pay excess profits duty to the British Government.  Whether or not there was an official declaration that the people should not pay these taxes, at any rate, there was a very general understanding that they should not be paid where it was possible to avoid paying them.  It was only in circumstances where a man's business or fortune might be jeopardised by the non-payment of income tax that the payment of such income tax was connived or winked at by those responsible for guiding the Republican movement at the time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister tied that up with income tax.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of the people who made wrongful returns to the British authorities in 1922 in relation to income tax, I think that what I have said in regard to excess profits duty largely applies also.  Again, you have the same circumstances; the <Col N="1555" /> destruction of the income tax offices, the wholesale interference with the machinery for the collection of the tax, the general belief fostered and encouraged by those who were responsible for guiding the Republican movement at the time, that it was an unpatriotic thing to pay duty or tax to the British Government whenever they could be avoided without involving the person who failed to pay in undue consequences or penalties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we have a man who was himself one of those guiding the Republican movement of that day bringing people into court who cannot have even the charge made against them that there was fraud or wilful neglect when they failed to make correct returns.  The Minister had another argument.  Fur ther on he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether it is expedient, even from the point of view of revenue, to endeavour to collect these taxes, is a matter that is capable of argument. Many men, warned by the fate of their neighbours, knowing what worry is in store for them, have placed their funds abroad.  A considerable amount, I am informed by those who are in a position to judge&mdash;by bank managers and others in similar capacities...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see that the Minister, in those days, was doing a certain amount of business with bank managers.  Bank managers, in those days, were almost felon-setters and treason-mongers, according to certain opinion at that time.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... a considerable amount of Irish money is on deposit abroad in British banks.  The country receives practically no benefit from that.  I do not believe one-tenth of the interest upon the deposits ever comes home, because it is difficult to get it home, and when one has it, it is difficult to employ it here.  The money is lying there in British banks financing British industries, when it ought to be and could be employed with much better advantage in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And so on.  The Minister also made <Col N="1556" /> a proposal that a notice should be published indicating that if people would make returns, he thought that a sum, which he estimated at about £10,000,000, would be recalled by people then withholding it for fear of the Revenue Commissioners.  Last year he gave notice in his own terms and one interesting piece of information has been withheld from the House so far.  What was the result? How many hundred thousand pounds of the £10,000,000 he thought was coming home, in fact, did drift home by reason of the notification as to leniency which the Minister caused to be published last year?</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, as he then was, in an earlier Finance Bill&mdash;that of 1929 &mdash;had given his point of view upon this matter; first of all, as to whether there ever was an order for the destruction of income tax buildings, or as to whether or not income tax was payable to the British authorities. We got this clarity from the man who is now President.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Was it not quite clearly understood, and is it not a matter of commonsense that it should be so understood, that we were anxious that money should not go to the British Government during that period, and the only reason against definite instructions being sent out to that effect was that we thought there would be hardships imposed upon some of the people if definite instructions of that kind had been sent out and had to be obeyed?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, Mr. de Valera said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am perfectly satisfied that the general impression throughout the country, so far as we could create it, was that the people were not to give the British income tax or any moneys if they could avoid it.  We did not make it a definite order because we thought that the penalties on those who obeyed might be too great.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, in col. 1898, interrupting the then Minister for Finance, the present President de Valera said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before the Minister passes from that, I would like to ask a further question.  How far is this inquisition <Col N="1557" /> going back?  I have been told that it is going back to 1914 and to 1911.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A little later, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is it fair that a person should be asked to produce books as far back as 1911, and to show the state of his business from that year up to 1914, and even since?  Take the case of the average business man.  Supposing that I were a business man and I felt that I had done nothing wrong and that no penalty should be enforced against me, I do not want to pay the penalty and I am not in a position, without putting myself to endless worry, at a time when I want to be looking after my business, to produce records going back to 1911 and 1912.  I think it is ridiculous.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on, after the then Minister for Finance had spoken about eight lines, there was another interruption to this effect:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should like to know what the offence is?  Is it an offence not to have disclosed to the Free State arrears of tax due to the British Government?  Would that be regarded as an offence?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On getting an answer to his question, the present President proceeded:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Supposing somebody said, for one reason or another, that there was no obligation on him to pay tax to the British Government, and that he withheld payment and spent the money, thinking it was an annual charge which he had got rid of, and that then he made a return to the Free State Government and did not disclose that in these years he had not paid the British Government, would that be accepted?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The philosophy of those days was that arrears of income tax were more or less the result of patriotic action and that certainly any man who withheld statements with regard to excess profits was withholding them from the British authorities and preventing them from getting moneys, and that the Free State Government had no right to these moneys.  The idea was that men were being distracted from their business and harassed into their graves <Col N="1558" /> because the Revenue Commissioners were endeavouring to get returns that should have been disclosed to the British Government but were not disclosed for patriotic reasons.  In 1929 and 1930 the philosophy was that these moneys should not be sought because it was patriotism that prevented these sums being paid and that it was going against patriotism to attempt to collect them.  Again, I want to repeat that that was a time when it could only be a case of fraud or neglect.  Now, when there is no question of fraud or neglect, we can distract people from their business to which they ought to be attending, as President de Valera said, and annoy and harass them in order to get these returns from them, all the time neglecting the fact that whatever had been done was done in the name of patriotism and it is only those patriots who are now going to be mulcted.</P>
    <P>On the 24th April, 1929, the present Minister for Finance is reported in Vol. 29, Col. 794, speaking on the resolution about income tax and excess profits, as having said&mdash;and he got down to concrete figures on that occasion and they ought to be given again to the House:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been represented to us, and I believe with a great deal of substance and foundation, that Irish investors have considerable sums of money invested abroad which they have not disclosed to the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;the proceeds, or rather the profits, of income they secured in earlier years and failed to disclose to the Revenue Commissioners. The position in regard to them is difficult.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To interrupt the quotation, the Minister's conscience was not as hardened in April as it had become by June of 1929.  He is a little bit tender about this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One does not like to ask the House at this stage to condone a wrong. Undoubtedly it was wrong that these concealments should be made.  But I understand that a considerable number of them were made at the time when the position in the country was very uncertain.  A number of <Col N="1559" /> them related to profits earned and incomes secured in 1919 and 1920.  At that time the income taxpayers were generally warned not to assist the British authorities in any way in collecting revenue in this country, and even those of them inclined to make a disclosure were more or less prevented from doing so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I ask, at that point, if some taxpayer, now threatened with pains and penalties, makes a statement to the effect that he was willing to make a statement previously but was prevented from doing so, will he be subjected to the thumbscrew and the rack or will the bloodhounds be called off?</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They did not disclose their profits for income for the boom years. They were faced afterwards, in 1922 and 1923, with being compelled to disclose them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is very appropriate to present circumstances:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And they were compelled to disclose them in the very height of the deflation period when they found that their annual income had fallen practically to vanishing point and when the profits made in 1918 and 1919 were gone entirely beyond the hope of repetition.  In that way I believe a number of people did refuse to disclose their incomes for income tax, and I suggest that the Minister might now, purely on the ground of expediency, issue a notice stating that if these income taxpayers came forward and disclosed their present investments abroad he would not proceed to carry any inquiry further back than the year 1923&mdash;six years ago&mdash;and that he should see, by legislation, if necessary, that the Revenue Commissioners would not exact penalties for false returns made prior to that year or since that year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Look at the position then&mdash;no penalties for false returns made prior to 1923 or since that year.  Then the Minister continued:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" />&ldquo;The reason I am making that suggestion is this: It has been represented to me&mdash;and I made inquiries from a number of bankers&mdash;that the amount of Irish capital concealed in that way is not less than £10,000,000. Many of the people have that money on deposit in English banks.  I understand that English banks cater specially for these concealments on the part of Irish income taxpayers and investors for the reason that they have the use of that money at something like three and a half per cent. or, at any rate, a comparatively cheap rate, and they are able to secure from five to six per cent. return for it.  Therefore, from their point of view it is a traffic which should be encouraged, and the Irish investor should be encouraged to conceal his profits, if he can, by investing in English banks.  The traffic has gone on on these lines and the English bankers are deliberately encouraging it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister regarded the British as at the root of the difficulties as usual. It was British banks who were trafficking in this big gain and in order to get the money back the Minister might issue a notice stating that there would be leniency.  There was not less than £10,000,000 to be brought back for financing Irish industry.  The notice was issued last year.  Will the Minister even now tell us what was the return; how much money came back? Let us have, at any rate, this evidence that the money came back by the Minister telling us what profits accrued to the revenue through this lenient offer of his.</P>
    <P>There are numerous other quotations about these excess profits and these arrears of income tax, but they are all on the same lines.  The people who had withheld returns were regarded by the Minister in these days as patriots, as people who deserved commendation, certainly who should not be harassed by the income tax authorities or the Revenue Commissioners and their coterie, even although it was only on the ground of fraud or wilful neglect.  These people deserved something better from us <Col N="1561" /> than that.  If they did engage in fraud it was not fraud upon any Government in Ireland; it was only fraud upon the British Government; and as fraud upon the British Government had been actively urged by those in charge of the Republican movement, according to the present Minister for Finance, it was only just and equitable that these people should be let off making returns in 1929 and 1930.</P>
    <P>There is one other quotation which the Minister should hear from himself. The Minister at the end of his speech on the Budget on 25th April, 1929, reported in Volume 29 of the Official Reports, column 925 and onwards, summed up by asking what was the real economic position of the people under the present Ministry?  He had made a certain contention that the country in 1919 was overtaxed.  &ldquo;That is serious,&rdquo; he said.  It is in print here, and the present Minister said it. Then he went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The truth of that contention is corroborated and upheld by the declining yields from the Stamp Duties, which show that business and industry are declining; by the falls in income tax and Corporation Profits Duty, which show that we are earning less, and by the position as disclosed by the figures in connection with the Estate Duties which I have just submitted to you and which show that we are saving less.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was his peroration:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dwindling trade, smaller earnings, whether wages, salaries or profits, diminished savings and an overburdened, overtaxed community.  In such a situation as that what is the policy which the Minister has set before the Dáil?  Not to lighten the burden, not to give the country a chance to recuperate and recover, but to continue to oppress it by maintaining taxation at a level which every factor of economic significance unites in proclaiming that the community is unable to bear.  It is because of that this present Budget is entirely unrelated to the economic condition of this State.  We ask the Dáil to take that view of it, and we <Col N="1562" /> ask them, irrespective of Party, to press that view here and elsewhere, so that there may be a complete reconsideration of the whole position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we get back to what was then foremost in the Minister's mind:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Expenditure must be cut down. That is quite clear from the figures that I have put before you.  Economies must be secured.  I want to guard myself against misrepresentation, and I mean by that, not economics secured by the curtailment of the social services, but economies secured by more efficient administration. There should be economy in every service which does not yield a due and proper return for the mass of the people who have to pay for it. There should be economies in the Army and in the Civic Guard.  As regards the latter, possibly there should not be economies in their scales of pay but rather in their numbers.  There could be economies in the trimmings and trappings of the State and the Executive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder did that visualise the 19 guns and the red carpet and the top hats in France?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These must be further and ruthlessly sought.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I see I was wrong because the Minister continued:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let there not be a mere skimming of the surface, taking only the scum of waste,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, I suppose, what he would have described them as in those days:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a mere saving of £172,000 where at least a million is required, but to change the metaphor, a paring of waste and extravagance remorselessly to the very bones.  That is the financial and administrative policy the community requires in its present extremity, and until it has been definitely embarked upon by this or some other Government there is no room, no ground, and no reason for optimism.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the Dáil were asked to reject the Budget of 1929.  Will the Minister ponder a little bit over what I have read?  Will he think of what he said in regard to excess profits duty payers or non-payers as he stood for them in <Col N="1563" /> 1928, 1929 and 1930?  Let us neglect this appeal to patriotism, because the Minister did not mean it and nobody who spoke in that strain meant it at all.  There may be certain people who did refuse to make payments because they thought certain orders had been issued and then even their fortunes had declined and they had not the money. The Minister knew quite well that the majority of the people for whom he was speaking could not come under that description and never did come under that description.  He was all out for mercy for them in those days and for denouncing the people who stood for extracting the moneys.  On the lower ground of expediency it would be better not to try to extract these moneys from these unwilling people who were unable to pay, was really his comment.</P>
    <P>There was the other class, people who had their money lodged safely in England, to whom he made the plea to bring it home, and again, also on the ground of expediency, the Minister pleaded that it was proper these moneys should be brought home, and that the way to do it was to offer lenient terms with regard to payment. He then suggested the terms should be so lenient that, even if false returns had been made, there should not be any penalty exacted.  The Minister believed so much in the bankers with whom he mixed in those days that the amount represented not less than £10,000,000 which could be brought home to finance Irish industry, and be removed from financing competing British industry.  Last year, there was a modified type of leniency, not the clean sheet, for anyone who made false returns, but, that if they came forward and made disclosures of what they withheld from the State, instead of payment of the maximum percentage, everything would be wiped out, that the State would take nothing more than 75 per cent. of the arrears, and that the money would flow into Irish industries.</P>
    <P>We all know how much came in by reason of the Minister's allurement in that regard.  It was disappointing, I know, because this is the Minister's <Col N="1564" /> excuse for what he said in his Budget speech last year.  He said he was going to offer special terms to people in arrears of income tax payments, and he went on to say that if the leniency were not met in the proper spirit, he was going to turn another foot and to salt another class, people who had escaped excess profits duty. They should pay it this year, throwing aside all he said about patriotism, about expediency, and about the necessity of bringing home moneys that were financing British Industry. The Minister proceeds to search people who are not now protected, even by a mistake of an innocent type, for money that could only be got if there was fraud or wilful neglect, but now it can be got, if it is there to be got, whether the law entitled the Minister to get it or not, as long as he is capable of getting an amendment of the law.  He is going to get it whether it has been put into industry in this country or not.  He does that at a time, and the words can be re-echoed, when trade is dwindling, returns are neglected, profits have been exhausted and dissipated.  Surely on the grounds of expediency alone, if there was any justification for what the Minister said in 1929-30, he ought to harken to what he did say, and relate that to present circumstances.  He knows that men&mdash; whether patriots or not&mdash;who withheld money from the British Government are now faced with the necessity of repaying it, when trade has never been so bad, when profits have definitely declined, if not entirely gone, and when the main industry upon which the country depends has been shattered, possibly shattered without hope of any decent redemption, certainly beyond hope of decent redemption at an early period.  I direct the Minister's attention particularly to the last quotation I read.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked of the position in the country as disclosed by the Budget speech which the then Minister for Finance had made.  Let me talk of the items of economic significance.  Let him concentrate his mind on one that I pointed out on every occasion it has been possible to do so since the last Budget was introduced, the yield he <Col N="1565" /> expects from the increased amount which he is levying on income-tax payers.  Let him analyse, when he talks of income-tax&mdash;it is of economic significance&mdash;and ask himself if it does not point distinctly to what has been said that the country is in a terrible state of decline, and that the measure which is called for is one for the reduction of taxation and not to increase the taxation which was imposed on the country last year, despite the promises to the contrary.  That is one of the factors of economic significance that the Minister might pay attention to. Others have been stressed from time to time by other speakers on the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill, where we were told that the objective was to share the burden, leaving out of consideration, at the moment, how that burden came to be imposed.  See how far the sharing of the burden has gone. The income-tax payers have been mulcted more heavily still, yet their returns are less, because there is no income from which the tax could be paid.  It is only necessary to talk to farmers about income-tax and profits in these days and to hear their answers to realise how that position was brought about.  Remember, despite the election promises and the safeguards given to people in particular positions, without any statement showing that the salaries paid were excessive, we have cut these salaries.  We have the wages of those engaged in relief schemes now equated to labourers' wages, with excessive hours&mdash;more than ever worked before&mdash;and lack of facilities for getting to work.  These wages are estimated to be between 21/- and 24/- per week.  In addition, in order to make it clear, work which is somewhere being given in the numerous factories which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has claimed to have established, we are having a rapid turnover in employment; men in certain employment for months and for years are now going to be thrown out and replaced by others taken from the streets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Matters of economic significance are the subject of debate <Col N="1566" /> on the Budget.  Does the Minister contend that these are not factors of economic significance?  That is the Minister's own phrase.  Where indeed is there to be a stop to all this?  The wages of labourers have been reduced; the earnings of farmers have vanished; income-tax returns are so reduced that the Minister only gained a small yield in spite of the increased levy that was made upon the taxpayers.  It is from employment that money comes; money irrigates the revenue of the State.  The Minister's idea as regards the giving of employment will be a failure, as he admits by the policy of getting people taken from work, where they have been for many years, in order to give an odd six months to people who otherwise cannot get any work, and that despite the talk we had about the numerous new industries that we have been building up&mdash;all the factories and workshops that were established, all the new sources there were going to be from which the Minister might exact his toll and so relieve some of the people who are now being taxed out of existence. Could the Minister give us any of these?  Could he give us any single good feature distinguishing the present situation from the situation which the Minister so adversely criticised in 1929 and in 1930?  We have been given the favourate remark of the Ministry when he is in a difficulty &ldquo;You cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.&rdquo; You can have a lot of broken eggs without any omelettes.  If you had an egg mania&mdash;I am not being personal to the Minister; I said &ldquo;an egg mania&rdquo; not &ldquo;egomania&rdquo;&mdash;you can smash quite a heap of eggs and get quite a beautiful selection of eggs and there is no return for it, but every time there is a piece of wreckage shown to the Ministry, the answer is &ldquo;You cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy that has been pursued and the policy that is reflected in the returns on which the Minister bases his Budget is a policy of destruction. Destruction, sometimes, may be valuable. The clearing of a site for the erection of a new premises, if the new premises are going to bring in a better return, or are, in some way, going to <Col N="1567" /> be better than the old premises, is a sane and wise proceeding, but merely to go out on a career of destruction, without having any idea of what is to replace the old system, what new social or economic system is to be found to replace the old one that is being destroyed is the height of folly. It is that folly that is being pursued and that folly, and what results from the pursuit of it, is definitely reflected in the Budget which the Minister has produced.  He has shown us that there are declining yields from the duties; there are items of economic significance to show that business and industry are declining; there is a fall in income tax relative to the increased levy being made on the income taxpayer and that, according to the Minister, in 1929, showed that we were earning less. The Minister said then:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dwindling trade, smaller earnings, whether wages, salaries or profits, diminished savings and an over-burdened and over-taxed community. In such a situation as that...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I again quote the Minister?:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What is the policy which the Minister has set before the Dáil? Not to lighten the burden, not to give the country a chance to recuperate and recover, but to continue to oppress it by maintaining taxation at a level which every factor of economic significance unites in proclaiming that the community is unable to bear.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That situation was presented by the Minister, who then said that the remedy for it all was that expenditure must be cut down and that is presented by a Minister, who, having said in 1929 that expenditure must be cut down, in 1930-31 promised that he could cut it down and by not less than £2,000,000.  Having done that, he piled taxation on to this country, despite all these factors of economic significance showing that we were an over-burdened community.  He makes no attempt to reduce taxation, but simply runs along ruthlessly and carelessly on this career of destruction. There has been no indication given to this House that, even in the 18 months <Col N="1568" /> or so that have elapsed since the present Government first took office, although they professed to have had it beforehand, they have found out a plan with regard to the future of this country.  A plan means an objective, properly set before the people's minds, means to that end carefully thought out&mdash;and practical means&mdash;and, then, some attempt, by legislation or otherwise, to put these methods into operation. Have we yet got, from any member of the Ministry, in relation to his own Department&mdash;segregating it that way&mdash;his idea of his plan for the betterment of his country under whatever be the powers he has in his own Department?</P>
    <P>Where is the better situation, financially, that the Minister for Finance looks forward to?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture hide themselves behind statements, one, that he has actual factories in existence but he just cannot locate them, and the other, that he has markets in which to sell our goods but he just won't tell them, but the Minister for Finance has not got even so much.  He has not even announced a scheme with regard to finance and he does not tell us if he hopes ever to get taxation down and how he hopes to get it down.  If we had some statement from him in that regard, we could analyse it and see whether his hopes were rosy and whether they were likely to be fulfilled or whether they were due for disappointment again.  He simply contents himself, in the teeth of all his promises and despite all his previous statements and the warnings he previously gives, with piling further taxation on this country and to keep on piling it on to the country at a time when he has definitely declared himself that it was overburdened with taxation and that every factor of economic significance showed that that was the truth.</P>
    <P>As I said before, we can go on a little bit in this fashion.  So long as there are assets there to be realised, on a realisation of them, even at a forced sale, certain moneys can be got and that money can be wasted.  That can go on for a little bit yet but local <Col N="1569" /> finance has already broken down and the State, despite all that was said with regard to treachery when certain suggestions were made, has been forced to come to the assistance of the local councils in the way indicated to them by the so-called traitors many months ago.  If local finance has broken down and if it goes further in its breakdown and has to be helped by still further subsidies from the Central Fund, are we far off the day, even although there are still some assets to be realised, when central taxation will also show that it has come to the last point, that saturation point has been reached, that nothing further is to be expected and that we are at that horrible point which the Minister contemplated when he spoke on the Public Economies Bill?  We raided the Road Fund last year for a certain amount of money; we forestalled payment on the roads and we forestalled employment on the roads.  We hurried on the roads for work last year men who, if the Road Fund had been left alone, would have been secured in employment for years to come on the annual expenditure that has to be met on the roads. It could not bear any raid this year and the Minister announced further that, to his regret, taxation on incomes and property had now reached saturation point and that not another shilling was to be expected from them in the way of revenue.</P>
    <P>We are borrowing this year.  We are borrowing on the strength of one completely foolish proposition and borrowing, in the second case, in a way that may be proper but only if the local authorities are going to be charged so much for the moneys lent to them from the local loans account as will remunerate the service of the money given to them, and, if that happens, they will not thank the Minister for the moneys paid out of the Local Loans Fund.  Alternatively, it is going to be lent out at a rate that will not remunerate and, unless we are going to make provision for meeting the service of the debt from the Central Fund, it is bad, and deliberately bad, borrowing.  But, still, we can borrow this year.  There may be people foolish enough to believe that these <Col N="1570" /> funds are worth something as securities. There may be money extracted in various ways from the people but, with the Minister's warnings before the community, his neglect of the Road Fund this year, which shows that nothing more is to be got from it, his inability to reduce taxation, his frank statement in the Seanad that taxation could not be reduced and his definite announcement that property and incomes can bear no further taxation, he is presenting not a very attractive proposition to the people of the country when he asks them to let him borrow money on the security of the Local Loans Fund about which he has given no information, and on the security of another fund which has merely been described by name but no indication given of how the fund is to be built up and what is the security of the moneys pouring in to build it up and, under these circumstances, the Minister, in his last appeal to the Dáil here, said that we have very nearly got to the point where the necessities of life have to be taxed.</P>
    <P>Tea&mdash;which in this Budget becomes a necessity for the purposes of the Minister's argument&mdash;sugar, tobacco&mdash; these are what the Minister warns us he will have to fall back on next year unless he can get his reductions in taxation by cutting down the salaries of people whom he promised definitely a year ago that these cuts would not be imposed.  That is the Budget situation as I see it.  That is the Budget situation which I have tried to present in this House almost entirely in the words of the present Minister for Finance when he was speaking of a situation in 1929 which was not anything as bad as the situation which confronts him to-day.  It will be an interesting matter to find out what answer he has got to make to his own statement as to what the factors of economic significance meant, to his own conclusion that the country was overburdened with taxation and his own remedy of a reduction in expenditure in circumstances in which he himself announced that he could not see any reduction in taxation because it would have meant a reduction in social services and that he would not stand for.</P>

So far no effort has been made to tax these companies and there is no real security for Irish people who have investments in these foreign companies.  There is I know a condition under which they have to make a deposit here of £20,000 but that is really for winding up purposes. I suggest to the Minister that a tax of 15 per cent. should be imposed on this sum of £7,000,000 which these companies take out of the country annually.

      <P>The conclusion of this debate has brought us one surprise at any rate, and that is to find that while the Fianna Fáil Party were in opposition, any argument of theirs could find a lodgment within the narrow mentality of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and could make so effective a lodgment there, that when he came to make a case against the policy which we are pursuing in regard to the excess profits duty, he could not find a better case to make than that which had been made by a then Opposition Deputy. I do not suppose that any sensible man could find any satisfaction in Deputy McGilligan pouring out the most object flattery upon him but if imitation be the sincerest form of flattery, I would suggest that when that imitation is carried to such an extent that it takes the form of repetition of the ipsissima verba of the person quoted, then it becomes nauseating. It is quite true that on occasions we did challenge the policy which our predecessors pursued in regard to excess <Col N="1573" /> profits duty.  It is quite true that when in Opposition I personally did point out objections, as I saw them, to the policy which was then being pursued, and that I did take strong objection to the fact that the Revenue Commissioners in administering this law had only power to make assessments in those cases in which they had reason to suspect, more than reason to suspect, that there had been fraud or wilful neglect.  I said that that was an unjust discrimination as between one taxpayer and another. In the speech from which I think Deputy McGilligan quoted, the speech of the 4th June, I said this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Just as this Party (the Fianna Fáil Party) stand for justice and fair dealing between this country and its neighbours, so, too, we believe that within the State justice should be extended to all classes of citizens alike.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said further that a person's liability to pay excess profits duty, if excess profits duty were to be collected at all, should not depend on the mere accident that a chance discovery had brought to the knowledge of the Revenue Commissioners some fact that enabled them to satisfy themselves that there had been fraud or wilful neglect.  I said that an unlucky individual, no more guilty than his more fortunate neighbour, could thereby be compelled to pay very considerable sums to the Revenue Commissioners. I did argue that leniency should be extended.  When we came into power I examined and investigated this matter, and found that&mdash;apart altogether from the justice of the case &mdash;upon the grounds of mere expediency because of the policy pursued by our predecessors, it was impracticable for the State to retrace its steps, and that the policy pursued during the preceding ten years in respect of excess profits duty would have to be carried to its logical conclusion.  I did make a substantial concession after a great deal of consideration for the remaining body of people who were properly liable to be assessed for excess profits duty under the then existing law, and I did say that if this concession were <Col N="1574" /> not availed of, if a full disclosure were not made, and if those people did not set themselves immediately right with the Revenue, then I should have to give to the Revenue Commissioners such power as would enable them to deal impartially with the general body of the taxpayers, and to render assessable for excess profits duty every person and every taxpayer who properly owed that duty.  As I have already indicated, I am glad to say that a considerable number of taxpayers took advantage of that offer. In almost 1,000 cases disclosures have been made, and as a result of preliminary investigation the Revenue Commissioners are in a position to say that almost one and a half million pounds of back duty will be recovered. We know that 1,000 persons do not represent by any means all of those who escaped this duty.  We also know that it does not represent by any means those who were the heaviest delinquents in this regard, that there is still a considerable number of people who should make this disclosure, and who should place themselves in exactly the same position as their confreres were placed by our predecessors who collected excess profits duty from them.</P>
    <P>Are we going to allow to escape further those people who, first of all, as I have already stated, because they were more cunning and more fortunate than other unfortunate individuals who were in exactly the same position as regards the Exchequer, have hitherto escaped paying what they properly owe, and who secondly have refused to take advantage of the concession which was offered to them last year?  Are we going to let them get away with what properly belongs to the State, and let them get away with it at the expense of every taxpayer of this community, direct or indirect, who does contribute to our revenue?  Is there any man, whether he be a businessman or a public servant, who has to pay income tax and has no escape, who is going to take upon his own shoulders, willingly and readily, the obligation to compensate the State for the losses which it suffers at the hands of those taxpayers for whom Deputy McGilligan <Col N="1575" /> speaks?  Under this dispensation the true patriot is the man who pays what he properly owes.  That, I may say, was the principle laid down by our predecessors when they were on these benches, when they were charged with the collection of the revenue and had the responsibility of providing for the public services, but I take it now that the policy of the Opposition in this matter is &ldquo;If any man can defraud the State, if any man can swindle the State, if any man can deprive it of a just due, then we will stand up and defend that man and we will make sure that the honest taxpayers of the country make good his default.&rdquo;  Is that the new policy of Cumann na nGaedheal in this matter?  Remember that in 1923 Deputy Cosgrave, who was then Minister for Finance, said in his speech which is reported in volume 3, column 546 of the Dáil debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Finance Bill is, in certain respects, much more exhaustive and far-reaching in respect of certain particulars than has been the practice here.  A good deal of criticism of it has been printed.  The Press has taken up the question of certain steps that are supposed to be taken in the Bill to get in income tax.  It must be remembered it is only fair to those who are paying, loyally and with a due sense of their civic responsibility, very considerable sums into the Exchequer in respect of income tax, that they have got some rights, and that it is due to them, as well as to the State that every person properly chargeable to this particular tax should pay his quota... For one reason or another for some years past certain people have evaded the payment of this tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave, then Minister for Finance, went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In any case, no matter who the individual was, who owed money in this respect, he cannot be allowed to gain that advantage over his less fortunate brother who paid his way either since we took over the affairs of this country or who paid previously. There is no real injustice, but there is a good deal of interested criticism of these proposals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> Deputy Cosgrave again went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why should he be allowed to escape?  The unfortunate man with several children, living in a small house, paying more than his quota to the upkeep of the State, is to be mulcted and made pay more than his quota in tobacco or tea because the other man is released.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Taking the argument that because certain people failed, whether out of a sense of patriotism or otherwise, to pay those taxes to the British, they should now be relieved of the obligation of paying them altogether, whatever force there may have been in that argument was taken out of it and was destroyed when for over ten years a contrary policy was pursued, when considerable sums of money, amounting to over £5,400,000 in the case of income tax assessed prior to 1922-3 and £1,663,000 in the case of other back duties, were collected from the taxpayers in the years 1922-3 to 1931-2 by our predecessors: collected by them in these years and spent by them in these years.  That was the policy which they had initiated and maintained.</P>
    <P>Despite what Deputy McGilligan described as the very pungent speeches made by the Opposition in the years 1928 to 1931, I say that whatever opinions we may have held previously we were faced with this position that we had either to reverse that policy from the very beginning and repay to those taxpayers the money that had been collected and squandered by our predecessors, or else we had got to pursue their policy to its logical conclusion and make every person who properly owed back duty to the State pay it to the State.  Every argument and every point that Deputy McGilligan made against this Government, because of its policy in relation to these particular taxes, is an argument and a point made against himself and those who were his colleagues in the former Government here.  It is they who are responsible for the position which exists to-day. I have had the facts put before me in connection with these matters, and I deny that any man is being harassed. Taxpayers have come to me to complain about proceedings taken against <Col N="1577" /> them by the Revenue Commissioners, and to ask to have their affairs investigated.  I have had those complaints investigated, and, having had them investigated, I deny that any man has been harassed.  If any man has been unjustly or unfairly dealt with, he has been unjustly and unfairly dealt with because, once more, of the policy initiated by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government when it was in office here.  It is upon the heads of Deputy McGilligan, of Deputy Cosgrave and others of their colleagues that the speech Deputy McGilligan made here to-day recoils.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is necessary for me to say very much more in reply to the speech to which we have just listened.  Most of us who listen to Deputy McGilligan's speeches nowadays have come to the conclusion that the Deputy has a gramophone mind: that when once a record has been made the Deputy is set working by those other members of his Party who are responsible for the conduct of the debate in this House until he can repeat <i>ad nauseum</i> what has been said here.  Every speech of the Deputy, as I say, consists very largely of the repetition of speeches that were made either by myself or by some other member of the Government Benches.  It is time that the Deputy would display a little originality and devote, if he is going to take an active part in the proceedings in this House in the future, a little mental exertion to putting a sound case, if he has any case at all to make, before the House.</P>
    <P>I am told that I am squandering the assets of the State.  If the Deputy had read a little more of the speeches which we made when in Opposition he would have noticed that one of the things with which we did charge the Government of which he was a member was that when £400,000 were received by it for shares in the Land Bank, £400,000 which ought to have gone to reduce a public debt of the State, that it was utilised by the then Minister for Finance to defray the ordinary current expenditure of the State, and that that was clearly a case of dissipating the assets of the State.  The Deputy will not find in any of the Budgets for which <Col N="1578" /> we have been responsible any case to parallel that one, and when he talks about our dissipation of the assets of the State we know that that is a mere empty phrase with nothing behind it.</P>

      <P>Possibly it is because the Deputy realises the fate that would be in store for him if he tried to understand these matters that he has devoted no study to them.  If I may come back.  When we, in Opposition, ventured to criticise on occasion the policy of the Cumann na nGaedhael Government in regard to the national finances we were told that we were damaging the country's credit.  Deputy McGilligan is not inexperienced.  He was in office for a considerable number of years.  He was Minister for Industry and Commerce and a member of the Executive Council, and he knows very well what a delicate matter public confidence is, and how easily an ill-considered and baseless utterance on the part of a prominent public man may damage the national credit and the national finances.  Yet to-day in his speech upon the Finance Bill, when I suppose the considered judgment of the Opposition in regard to our financial policy may be supposed to be expressed, Deputy McGilligan got up and stated, first of all, that we were borrowing upon the security of certain funds and then went on to say that there may be people foolish enough to believe that there is some security in these funds.  I suppose by that Deputy McGilligan wished to convey the impression that he did not believe there was security in these funds.  I take it that is what the Deputy really meant. <Col N="1579" /> I do not suppose for a moment that he believed it.  At any rate, he wished other people to be under the impression that he did not think there was any security for these funds.</P>
      <P>What are the funds in question? They are the Local Loans Fund upon the security of which and for the purpose of which we are borrowing this year £1,600,000.  Is there no security in the Local Loans Fund?  Are we not justified in certain circumstances in borrowing for the purposes of that Fund?  I am sorry I have to put the questions in that rhetorical form across the House to Deputy McGilligan because I should like Deputy McGilligan to answer that question and to hear if he says &ldquo;no, we are not justified in borrowing £1,600,000 for the purposes of the Local Loans Fund.&rdquo;  How did he condone the action of his colleague the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Blythe, who, year after year, borrowed considerable sums for the purpose of that Fund?  After all, we must assume, particularly in regard to financial matters, that the action of the Minister for Finance represents the considered policy of the Executive Council as a whole, and that any member of the Executive Council who does not agree with the policy of the Minister for Finance, is bound, if he wants to retain his honour as a politician and public man, to resign his seat on the Executive Council and is bound to say that his reasons are that he believes that the policy then being pursued by his colleague is such as to mislead the people who would be foolish enough to believe that there is some security in the Local Loans Fund.  Deputy McGilligan, as I have told the House, was a member of the Executive Council whose Minister for Finance announced to the Dáil every year&mdash;not for one or two years&mdash;but every year for nine years&mdash;that they proposed to borrow considerable sums of money for the purposes of the Local Loans Fund.  But Deputy McGilligan was silent on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan condoned this unjustifiable action of the then <Col N="1580" /> Minister for Finance in borrowing this money as we must conclude from the words he used in this debate.  What weight is to be given to any argument put forward by a Deputy whose past has stultified him in his present attitude in that way?  The Deputy is no fool; he is no simpleton, and we know that when he tried to convey to the Dáil and country that we were doing something wrong, something which could not be justified, he did not believe it himself.  He must have felt that the policy which we were pursuing was a sound one and that we were doing nothing which, if people properly understood it and properly realised its significance, would damage the financial soundness and integrity of this State.  But knowing that, that was the impression he wanted to create.  Any weapon is good enough for Deputy McGilligan to use if he wishes to injure the Government, to impede the Government or to defeat the policy of the Government which is engaged in building up the economic and financial strength of the State so that this people will in its Government be able to stand up for its full rights as a nation.  I think I have wasted more time upon Deputy McGilligan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In that connection I must have been in the same frame of mind as Deputy McGilligan was when he began his speech.  He had to go back to a speech made here in the House in 1930 in order to make his case.  He had to go back to a case made by a Deputy here who was then unaware of the extent to which the country had been committed by the policy pursued by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government with regard to <Col N="1582" /> the collection of excess profits duty. So long as I am in public life I will always be willing to live and learn.  I have learned that the position has been so prepared by the policy pursued by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government that there is no possibility of going back on it.  We were willing to come here and relieve those people consistent with the admission of the principle of relieving people from fresh obligations in this matter, provided that we were able to satisfy ourselves that they were coming forward to give assistance to the State and that that assistance to the State in this matter would be commensurate with the concessions we were making.  A considerable number of people came forward so as to help us to put an early end to the special staff instituted and set up by our predecessors, and to enable us to see a time when all our commitments and obligations in this matter would be settled.  We have met these people in that spirit.  But there are other people who have refused to give us any consideration.  They refused to give any consideration for the concessions given; they refused to meet us in any way in this matter, and for any penalisation arising from that I say upon their own heads be it.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech, stated that he hardly knew where he was.  I thought the interruptions might have caused him not to answer certain questions that were put to him.  He addressed certain questions here which may or may not have been rhetorical.  I would like to remind him that the questions put to-day were with regard to the advisability of borrowing upon two securities&mdash;one, local loans, and the other, land annuities.  Deputy McGilligan indicated that the desirability of borrowing on local loans depended on the rate of interest at which loans would be advanced to public bodies. The Minister appeared to indicate that Deputy McGilligan denied the legitimacy of borrowing on the security of local loans under any circumstances.  If the Minister would state what the Government propose to do in regard to remunerating those loans, whether they <Col N="1583" /> are going to charge an interest to local bodies that would cover all that, one would be in a position to decide whether or not it would be right to borrow.  With regard to land annuities, the Minister did not tell us why he feels justified in borrowing on the strength of their security.  If he would give us answers to those questions we might be able to reply to the questions he addressed to this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will refer to the answers which I have given to a number of Parliamentary questions which were put down during the past 12 months in regard to the rates of interest on local loans and the principle upon which that rate is determined, he will observe that I have already, in anticipation, answered Deputy McGilligan's questions.  I do not propose to repeat those answers. With regard to the security upon which we propose to borrow for the purpose of meeting certain expenditure arising out of the present economic war, as I have already indicated in my speech, we propose to borrow on the strength of the deferred annuities fund.  If the Deputy will read the Land Bill, which was circulated to-day, he will see the security which lies behind it.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to questions that he answered within the last 12 months.  That was the period following on a statement he made last year.  Last year he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As to whether our contribution to the Local Loans Fund should be regarded as normal or abnormal, there may be some room for argument. In view of the fact, however, that the fund is now being mainly used to finance public health works and housing schemes, which, the former particularly, cannot be said to yield a full economic return, it is my opinion that these contributions should now be regarded as a provision which should normally be made out of revenue.  Otherwise we shall be compelled to continue the same high charges for loans from the fund as have hitherto prevented many local authorities from proceeding with necessary public works.  As this year's contribution to the fund, however, will be made out of revenue of an unusual and, perhaps, nonrecurring character, the question will remain open for another year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now is the time to answer the question.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Industrial Credit Bill. The purpose of this Bill, as may be seen from the title, is to make provision for the formation and registration of a company having for its principal object the providing of industrial credit.  Normally, there are three ways in which industrial credit&mdash;credit for the purpose of establishing new industries or manufactures&mdash;might be provided.  The first, which relates to the ordinary <Col N="1588" /> short-term credit or accommodation which an industrial concern requires from day to day is provided by the banks in the form of an overdraft. The second is a guarantee which might be given by any corporation or organisation, including the State, in relation, generally, to a certain, specific form of share-issue and for a considerable period of years.  So far, in this country, that has been more or less adequately covered by the existing Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts. The third&mdash;the provision of capital which those who propose to initiate a new undertaking or a new industry have to secure&mdash;in countries where the existing financial organisation is adequate, is generally provided by underwriters or issuing houses or promoting syndicates, representing persons, or groups of persons, having considerable financial resources.</P>
      <P>In this country, hitherto, for one reason or another, it has generally been, even under the most favourable circumstances, very difficult for new projects to secure adequate financial backing.  That section of our people which had money to invest has hitherto generally fought shy of native enterprises. This Government realised, as our predecessors also did, that that was a considerable handicap in carrying out any proposals or any policy to develop this country industrially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To meet that position, the former Government assisted the Industrial Trust Company.  I do not propose to go into the history of that project. For one reason or another, it was not successful.  I should say, in that connection, that the reason for its failure will not be found in a too-ready willingness to invest in native enterprise, that, rather, the cause of its failure will be found to be a readiness to invest in foreign enterprise.  I merely mention that to emphasise that our predecessors were faced with the same difficulty which confronts us owing to the fact that, even under the most favourable circumstances, our people are not ready to chance their money in new Irish Industrial concerns. It is possibly because of this that the financial organisations which exist elsewhere&mdash;issuing houses and <Col N="1589" /> underwriting companies&mdash;are not to be found here.  There might not be a fruitful field for them here.  Consequently, the only agency to which those who propose to enter upon a new undertaking in this country can turn are the existing banks.  The banks naturally fight shy of placing the funds with which depositors entrust them for short terms in undertakings the outcome of which is uncertain and the investment in respect of which would be, of its very nature&mdash;even if success were at last to attend them&mdash;be for a very considerable period, possibly as long as the company or undertaking might continue to operate.  It is felt, however, that some Governmental action is necessary if this gap in our existing financial organisation is to be filled and that an undertaking having for its principal object the providing of industrial credit and amongst whose other activities will be, in the words of the memorandum:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the acquisition, underwriting, holding, selling and otherwise dealing of, or with, shares, stocks, debentures and other securities issued by any company registered in Saorstát Eireann&rdquo;</P>
    <P>should be set on foot.  This Bill proposes to give effect to the Government policy in that matter.  As will be seen from the Bill, it is provided that the capital of the new Corporation shall be £5,000,000, which shall be divided into shares of £1 each, or of such other denomination or denominations as shall be specified in the memorandum, and be issued from time to time, as the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, shall determine.  Section 5 of the Bill confers on the Minister power to underwrite and take up such portion of the share capital of the company as is not subscribed by the public.  It is clear from this, therefore, that the intention is to allow the public to participate in this company to the extent to which the public indicates its readiness to do so, and that, so far as possible, the functions of the Government will be confined to the initiation and launching of the project, and the control and <Col N="1590" /> management of it, until such time as the public show that they are ready to step in and relieve the Government of its duties and responsibilities in that regard.  As I have already said, the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company, the leading provisions of which are set forth in the Schedule to the Bill, will make it clear that one of its principal objects will be the granting of loans to, and the acquisition, underwriting, holding, selling and otherwise dealing of or with shares, stocks, debentures, and other securities issued by any company, registered in Saorstát Eireann under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1924 whose principal object is the carrying on in Saorstát Eireann of any trade or industry.  I should like to make it clear, however, that because it is the desire of the Government that, ultimately, the control of this company should be taken over by the Irish investing public, the Memorandum and Articles of Association will endow the Corporation with very wide powers and with such powers as will enable them to fulfil all the functions with which a privately owned and controlled undertaking elsewhere might be charged.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill proposes to make a charge upon the Central Fund of the moneys that, from time to time, may be required to meet the payments to be made by the Minister to the company. Sub-section 2 of that section gives to the Minister power to borrow for the purposes of providing these moneys. Sub-section (3) provides that the principal and interest of any securities issued under Section 6 and the expenses incurred in connection with such issue shall be charged on the Central Fund.  Sub-section (4) makes it clear that any moneys raised by securities issued under the section shall be placed to the credit of the account of the Exchequer and shall form part of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that all dividends, bonus and other moneys received by the Minister in respect of shares of the company held by him shall be paid into the Exchequer.  Section 8 gives to the Minister power, so long as he holds any of the shares of the company, to <Col N="1591" /> exercise all or any of the rights and powers from time to time exercisable by the holder of such shares.  Section 9 gives power to the Minister, if at any time he sees fit&mdash;and he will only see fit when the public evince a willingness to take up the shares&mdash;to hold these shares for such length of time, and, when he sees fit in the circumstances indicated, as I have said, to sell these shares.  Section 10 provides that no alteration in the Memorandum of Association or Articles of Association of the Company which is, while the Minister holds any shares of the company, made without the previous approval of the Minister after consultation by him with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, shall be valid and effective.</P>
    <P>Section 11 imposes upon the company the obligation to furnish within 90 days after the end of every accounting year a balance sheet to the Minister for Finance for such accounting year duly audited by the auditor of the company, and also a profit and loss account for the same accounting year similarly audited.  Sub-section (2) of that section provides that the balance sheet and profit and loss account shall be drawn up in accordance with the regulations to be prescribed by the Minister and contain, among other things, a summary of the capital, assets and liabilities of the company, together with such particulars as will disclose the nature of such assets and liabilities and the manner in which the value of the assets was arrived at.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) provides that the company shall on demand furnish to the Minister such explanations as the Minister may think proper to require in respect of any balance sheet or profit and loss account furnished in accordance with the section.  Sub-section (4) provides that a copy of every balance sheet and profit and loss account furnished to the Minister shall be laid by him before each House of the Oireachtas within one month after such balance sheet and profit and loss account are furnished to him.  Sub-section (5) provides for penalties in the event of the failure of the company or any director, manager or other <Col N="1592" /> officer of the company to fulfil the obligations imposed by this section. Sub-section (6) gives the Minister general power to make regulations prescribing any matter referred to in the section as prescribed by regulations made under the section.</P>
    <P>The Schedule provides, in paragraph (1), that the Memorandum and Articles of Association shall be subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance after consultation by him with the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Paragraph (2) provides that the Memorandum of Association shall provide, among other things, that the name of the company shall be the Industrial Credit Company, Limited, and that the registered office of the company shall be in Dublin.  It sets forth the principal objects of the company, which, as I have already stated, shall include the acquisition, underwriting, holding, selling and otherwise dealing of or with shares, stocks, debentures and other securities issued by any company registered in Saorstát Eireann, under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1924, whose principal object is the carrying on in Saorstát Eireann of any trade or industry, and shall also include the lending or advancing money upon such security as the directors of the company may think proper to any person engaged in or proposing to engage in Saorstát Eireann in any trade or industry for the purposes of establishing the carrying on, or extending such trade or industry.  It also provides that the liability of the members of the company shall be limited, and that the amount of the share capital of the company shall be £5,000,000 which shall be divided into shares of £1 each, or such other denomination or denominations as shall be specified in the said memorandum.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (3) provides that the Articles of Association of the Company shall specify the number of directors, including the chairman of the company, and that the number so specified shall be seven or five.  Paragraph (4) provides that the Articles of Association shall provide also that, so long as the Minister holds not less than one-half, in nominal value, of the issued shares of the company, <Col N="1593" /> then in case the number of the directors is seven, four of them shall be nominated by the Minister from time to time as occasion requires, and that in case the number of directors is five, three of them shall be nominated by the Minister from time to time as occasion requires.  It also provides that the chairman of the directors shall be nominated from time to time by the Minister.  The purpose of this is to provide that, so long as the Minister holds the majority of the shares of the company, he shall have power to nominate the chairman and a majority of the board of the company.  Paragraph (4) also provides that the company shall have power for the purposes of the company to raise money by means of debentures, subject to two conditions: (1) that the amounts so raised shall not exceed at any time the paid up share capital of the company, and (2) that debentures ought not to be issued without the consent of the Minister so long as the Minister at any time holds more than one-half of the nominal value of the issued shares of the company.  Paragraph (c) provides that, &ldquo;so long as the Minister holds any shares of the company, no person shall be capable of being appointed auditor of the company unless the approval of the Minister to the nomination of such person to the office of auditor has been given.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will thus be seen that while the Memorandum and Articles, so far as they are outlined in this Bill, are intended to ensure that the company will be given very wide powers and great freedom of action in its operation, at the same time full provisions have been made to ensure that the Dáil will at any time be able, if it so thinks fit, to raise matters relating to the conduct of the company; that the Minister, since he has power to nominate a majority of the members of the board so long as he has a majority holding in the company, will be in a position to be held by the Dáil responsible for the general conduct of the company and for anything that has been done by the company; and that if the company for any reason is not successful, either due to the inefficiency of <Col N="1594" /> its directors, or to the unwisdom of the investing policy which it pursues, the Minister can be called to account here in the Dáil for such failure of the company to fulfil its proper functions, and, if necessary, any changes which such criticism of the Minister in the Dáil may show to be desirable can be secured by the pressure of public opinion.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill is designed to fulfil the function which our predecessors thought was not being fulfilled by the existing organisations in this country and for which they launched the Industrial Trust Company.  This undertaking, as will be seen, is of much greater magnitude, though in essentials. its functions will be the same, and it is thought that its share capital should be fixed at the sum of £5,000,000.  One of the reasons why a much larger undertaking than our predecessors launched is thought to be necessary is that the projects which this company may have to finance at the outset will be of much greater magnitude also. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking on one of the stages. of the Finance Bill, indicated to the House that, in addition to proposals for the establishment of the cement-making industry here, for the extension of the beet sugar manufacturing industry&mdash;for the preliminary expenses of the formation of a company for which the House has already provided the sum of £15,000 by means of a supplementary vote and with regard to which it is proposed to lay detailed proposals before the Dáil before the House adjourns for the Summer Recess&mdash;there are under consideration proposals for the development of the mineral resources of the country, for the establishment of a paper-making industry, for investigation into the possibilities of the manufacture of power alcohol and for a considerable number of other projects, many of which may be of an experimental nature and most of which, because they are new and novel undertakings in this country, will not be likely to appeal to the general investing public, but which, nevertheless, it is the opinion of the Government, if anything is to be done to develop this <Col N="1595" /> country industrially, must be undertaken and carried out by some organisation.</P>
    <P>It is the intention to offer for public subscription the shares of those undertakings which will be launched for the purpose of carrying out those new developments and it is necessary, in order that the necessary finances may be secured, and that the success or failure of the schemes should not be made dependent upon the somewhat uncertain taste of the Irish investing public in regard to native concerns, that provision should be made for underwriting any issues that may be made by the undertakings to which I have referred.  One of the principal functions of the Credit Corporation to be established under this Bill will be to underwrite those issues.  I should not, however, like the House or the country to understand that the operations of the new Corporation will be confined merely to Government projects. Proposals initiated by any private group or by any individual for the establishment of new industrial undertakings in this country will be considered, examined, and investigated by this company, and if it is decided that the financing of these undertakings should be carried out by the formation of a public company and an issue of shares then this company will step in to underwrite and take up such of those shares as might not be subscribed for by the general public.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Government that the board of this company shall be manned by persons of the highest standing in the commercial and industrial life of this country, but they will be persons who will be required to devote a very large part of their time to the affairs of the company. It is also our intention to lay a specific obligation and responsibility upon every member of the board in regard to the affairs of the company. That intention is indicated in Section 11 (5) of the Bill, to which I have already referred, which makes every director, manager and other officer of the company responsible for any default in complying with any of the provisions of this section, including <Col N="1596" /> amongst other things the giving of such information and explanation to the Minister as may be required under sub-section (3).</P>
    <P>At this stage I do not want to stress the necessity of placing this specific responsibility upon those charged with the conduct of the new Industrial Corporation. The magnitude of the enterprise which it will be called on to finance, the size of the resources which have been placed at its disposal, involve a proportionate personal responsibility upon those charged with the handling of it.  Of one thing I would like to assure the House and the country that men will be placed on the board, not because of political affiliations, or anything else, but because of their proven capacity as businessmen, and as managers of industrial enterprises. I do not think I need say any more, except to emphasise again that the Corporation to be established under the Bill will fill a gap in our financial affairs which was recognised by our predecessors, and for the lack of which the Government has been greatly hampered in carrying out its industrial policy hitherto.  We hope that the establishment of this company will complete the link in the chain; that what has been wanting in our existing organisation will be filled; that, as hitherto, the banks will be free to devote themselves to the provision of short-term accommodation; that the Government under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts will be called upon, we hope, to a more limited extent than hitherto, to guarantee the capital raised by existing undertakings for the extension of plant, and that there will be now a source to which people who have sound propositions can turn for financial assistance, which will enable them to place these propositions in a satisfactory way before the Irish people, and enable the Irish people to have the opportunity of investing in sound and satisfactory Irish undertakings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would have been better if the Minister had made the last part of his speech when introducing this measure.  Even with the information we got in the latter part of the speech, it is obvious that the <Col N="1597" /> directorate of the new Industrial Credit Company will have a fairly stiff task. In interpreting the Minister's speech, and from reading the Bill, I take it that when an industry is started, if it has Ministerial backing, this Industrial Credit Corporation must furnish the capital, while somebody else keeps an eye on the public money invested.</P>
      <P>Normally the position of an investment or industrial credit corporation, or an issuing house would be to appraise the value of undertakings, to see how far it was likely that the purpose of organisation was being carried out, whether a profit would be earned, and to see that there would be little risk in investing money in them. So far as this industrial credit corporation is concerned, is any discretion to be exercised in connection with what the Minister said regarding the Government's industrial policy?  Looking back at the attempts made over the last ten years to help industry we find that a very considerable sum of money &mdash;a considerable sum for a relatively small country&mdash;was guaranteed by the State, without political interference of any sort, on the recommendation of a body of business men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather intrigued by the Minister's reference to the directorate of the new company.  In the past, business men were employed, or were invited to undertake the examination of particular proposals put before them, and they did so while carrying on their own business, allocating as much time as possible for public purposes.  In this Bill we are invited to consider a directorate of a company with a capital of £5,000,000&mdash;a very big sum of money &mdash;and we are told that we can get a directorate which will have to devote a considerable portion of their time to the business of this industrial institution, without having had any previous experience of that kind.  It is idle to say that we have men with such experience.  We have not, even amongst bankers.  The banking system here is one which deals with banking in a strict banking sense.  They simply give to their customers money that they get from depositors.  That is banking, conservative banking.  It can be condemned, in so far as the expansion of business is concerned, but, when it is <Col N="1598" /> examined, and when we look at what happened during the last couple of years in other countries&mdash;and, above all, perhaps, in the most progressive country in the world&mdash;when we see how safe the people's money with bankers here was, we are inclined to thank Providence or tradition or something else for the banking system we have got.  At any rate, if the money was not used to the best advantage it was not lost.  People can go and draw out what they put into the banks here, but in other countries they are unable to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister was correct in saying that we have no machinery, no institution and no facilities such as other countries possess in connection with the development of industry. When the money was required and could be profitably employed here it was found, in almost every instance, for big industrial experiments.  There are to be four sugar beet factories costing £300,000 each.  Then there is the cement factory.  I venture to say that it is unlikely that more than half a million will be invested out of the £1,750,000 required.  The Minister mentioned other matters, which I do not think would absorb more than £2,500,000.  Even the £5,000,000 for a corporation such as this, if put before the people, will stimulate advances from it.  To be a success this Corporation has to keep in mind the necessity for regulation in connection with industrial agitation or industrial experiments.  The powers in the Bill are very wide.  I was astonished at their width when I read them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The principal objects of the company shall include the acquisition, underwriting, holding, selling and otherwise dealing of or with shares, stocks, debenture and other securities issued by any company, registered in Saorstát Eireann under the Companies Act, 1908 to 1924, whose principal object is the carrying on in Saorstát Eireann of any trade or industry, and shall also include the lending or advancing money ... and so on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the main purpose.  That is the reservoir through which the streams of money must flow to all these industrial <Col N="1599" /> concerns in which the Government is interested.  I have observed in connection with the expansion of industry in most countries that the most healthy expansion is that from small growth in large manufacturing companies, bodies, trusts or anything of that sort.  I have seldom seen, in the last couple of decades, any great organisation starting out with its large plant and all the rest of it from a big start rather than from slow growth.  Practically all the big industrial ventures in England have been of small growth, and some of them even within the lifetime of living persons.  In America much the same thing took place.  There were subsequent amalgamations and so on and the best results are usually to be found from expansion of the smaller institutions.  Why?  Because the personal touch is there.  The larger a concern gets the less personal control and touch there is, and it is much easier to expand an existing institution than to lay the foundations of a big one.  We had no better example here than the big electrical undertaking in respect of which it was necessary to found a big control with extensive works in all parts of the country.  We have, as I say, a very big responsibility in this Bill placed on the directorate&mdash;a directorate without any previous experience of the extensive operations in which it will have to engage in connection with a matter of this magnitude.</P>
    <P>We have, then, a push on them to make money available for all these industrial concerns.  Is it to be part of the business or management to look after the money that has been invested in these particular places?  Does it mean that if we have a director of the Industrial Credit Corporation investing money, say, in one of the sugar beet factories, that it must get a proportion of the directorate and have to look after that money?  Does it mean that they have to go into the cement company and so on all round the various industries that are going to be established? If it does, I rather fear that the number of directors will not be equal to the demands that will be upon them.  I sense, in the first instance, <Col N="1600" /> a very great difficulty in getting a directorate of five or seven persons in this new business, bearing in mind the huge responsibilities there are and the small pittance there must be for them. A company with £5,000,000 capital would, I should say, exceed the entire paid-up capital of all the banks that we have got.  If it did not exceed it, it would possibly be only £1,000,000 short.  Examine, for a moment, one board of seven directors running a business of that size.  If it has to look after the channels into which it will put this money, the Minister must surely appreciate the enormous responsibility there is on the directorate in this case.  That is a matter which may require further consideration.  I very much fear that we have not got the men of experience, but they may learn as they go along.  We have the talent, the adaptability and the suitability but experience counts in these matters and it is of very great importance indeed that there should be experience, not alone in ordinary industry, but in finance, and, even, in the giving of advice to those who are going to be interested in the industrial expansion of which the Minister has given us an outline this evening.</P>
    <P>To come to the second portion, the Minister dealt with the details of this measure as they are rather than with the reasons as to why they are in the form they are in.  Fifteen thousand pounds is to be made available to enable the flotation of this company to take place.  That money may be repayable and I presume from sub-section (3) of Section 3, it is intended that the money will be repayable.  Section 4 sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>No issue of the share capital of the company (other than share capital issued to subscribers of the Memorandum of Association of the Company) shall be made at any time, unless the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has authorised such issue.</P>
    <P>I do not understand what is meant by that.  I cannot see for the life of me what necessity there is for either the Minister for Finance or the Minister <Col N="1601" /> for Industry and Commerce being approached on a matter of that sort. The capital is to be £5,000,000.  I presume that those who will sign the Articles of Association will not take up the whole of it, and even if the Minister takes up some&mdash;let us assume that £2,000,000 were subscribed&mdash;£1,000,000 from the Minister and £1,000,000 from outside, which is an optimistic calculation&mdash;they have to go to the Minister every time they want half a million pounds or a quarter million pounds to get his sanction for a further issue. I do not know what were the particular reasons for introducing that section.  I do say that if this company gets a very big subscription of capital, which I doubt&mdash;and I say that, now, without any political bias of any sort or kind&mdash;I think it would be a misfortune because, in the first place, people would be looking to them for a dividend.  What is the position of the money market to-day?  First-class paper is one quarter per cent.&mdash;I do not know what it is to-day, but in the last few weeks it has gone down from a half to a quarter&mdash;so that if they got a couple of million pounds they can employ it at only one quarter per cent. and that would not be a good investment.</P>
    <P>The fifth section is quite understandable and provides that the portion of the shares not taken up will be taken up by the Minister.  In regard to Section 9, if the Minister sells shares in this company, and he can, at any time, sell shares, what is the sense of having Section 11 with all the penalties on the directors that there are in connection with it?  If the Minister is out of this business altogether and is not involved in any of the investments, why should he have any power over private people's money?  What is the meaning of it?  Is there a particular reason? Is it that he wants to keep close touch with an organisation of that sort, that it must be a semi-Government institution? If I had my way, I would have it as apart and separate from Ministerial control as it would be possible to have it.  What is the position going to be?  The Minister is going to ask, six months after this company is started, why this industrial investment <Col N="1602" /> corporation has delayed for three weeks in furnishing an answer to the Connemara Goldfields Company on the application by them for £50,000 share capital or something of the sort. It is going to hinder the whole business. I rather think that the directors of this company would resent any such exhibition of the business affairs of the company before Parliament.  They are not in a position to reply.  Three or four days before a question appears on the Order Paper here, there is a notice of it in the <i>Saturday Herald</i>, the <i>Sunday Independent</i> or some other paper in relation to Connemara, Lettermullen or the Rosses.  Deputy Anthony might ask why it was money was not being put up for Rushbrooke, where there is plant and an opportunity of getting in some business right off, and where it will not cost a huge sum of money to put up the various lathes and other instruments necessary for shipbuilding, ship-repairing, or anything of the sort.  There is nothing in this Bill, so far as I can judge, likely to benefit Rushbrooke and Deputy Anthony might ask that question.  Is that going to lead towards a better handling of the affairs of the company?</P>
    <P>At one time I made out the cost of preparing an answer to a question put to me in regard to a matter of this kind and the information at my disposal showed that it cost about £25.  It was not a political question; it was a question in regard to a census of companies or something of that kind.  The answer to such a question probably would be that the subject was under consideration and the local comment on that will be &ldquo;Yes, everything is being considered but nothing is being done.&rdquo; I would suggest to the Minister that if the business of this company is to be dealt with by question and answer in this House, it will not be helped in that way.  If the business of such an organisation is to have any chance of success, it should not be canvassed in this House.  Year after year in this House on the Vote for the Minister's Department, all the sins of omission and commission, the cost of the staff and perhaps the interest on the moneys and so forth, will be threshed out.  The <Col N="1603" /> Minister will remember, from his own experience, that about two years ago there was a financial collapse in Great Britain.  There was a shortage of money and nobody knew what was going to happen next day or from day to day.  Two years ago it was possible to employ money at almost any price but to-day one might say that it is almost dirt cheap.  It can be had almost at one-quarter per cent.  Surely in a situation like that, it would be far better to start on a small scale and to let the directorate grow with the company.</P>
    <P>I believe the company is far too big to start with.  It would be far better to start in a small way than to push the money out to anybody who wants it and to think the more that is pushed out the better the results will be.  I cannot understand, if the Minister sells his interest in this Corporation, what right or title he has to anything in it.  I say that no matter what Government happens to be in office it would be a deplorable business, to have the affairs of a great corporation such as this made the sport of politics or criticism in this House.  The management of the Corporation will be a source of considerable difficulty to the directors.</P>
    <P>I do not see what there is in the Articles of Association which would give what we might call autonomy to the outside subscribers in the event of the Minister selling his shares.  Under Section 9 he can sell all or any of the shares.  There are seven directors, four of them, including the chairman, being nominees of the Minister.  What is going to happen if the Minister sells his shares?  I should say that the shareholders themselves would have the right of coming in and of keeping on the four directors nominated by the Minister if they so desired.  Personally, I do not like changes in directors, but if the company is to continue, at any rate, those who are paying the piper have the right to call the tune.  If they pay their money there is no justification in the Minister's retaining the right of nomination.  One of these directors might die or, to use the elegant expression of the draftsman, by the effluxion of time, he might go out. <Col N="1604" /> Does the Minister nominate other directors then?  Under the section, as it stands, the Minister is bound to nominate, but surely it would not be held to be good business that in these circumstances he should continue to have the right of nomination.</P>
    <P>I think that in the first place £5,000,000 is too much to invest in an undertaking of this kind.  The trouble is that I do not see the likelihood of a big public subscription, and then the undertaking starts off badly. Secondly, there will be enormous difficulties in the management of this Corporation.  Even if there were only a million and a half involved, this is new work.  It is, in essence, a sort of specialised work.  Taking into account how a businessman's time is taken up at the moment, you would be asking far too much if you asked him to devote much more than a couple of hours a week to work of this kind unless there was very generous remuneration given to him.  May I say that it is unlikely there will be any great desire on the part of business men for a position such as this with all the responsibilities and the criticism which it will entail? Thirdly, I do not think that this Corporation should be bound to invest money unless there is a substantial investment on the part of outside people in an undertaking.  I would regard a substantial investment in one of the new companies as almost equivalent to the growth of the industry into a very much bigger concern.  I forget the exact phrase in the Gospel&mdash;the Minister is very adept in these quotations&mdash;but I think it is that &ldquo;where one's treasure is there one's heart lies.&rdquo;  Much the same thing might be said in regard to financiers and industrialists who undertake to establish new business.  I would prefer to see these companies grow from small beginnings.  Our experience in the past has been that a big undertaking is less likely to succeed than a small undertaking which has the elements of growth within it.  To that end I would suggest a smaller directorate, who will make a study of all phases of industry and make it a whole-time work.</P>
    <P>I see a difficulty in expecting any <Col N="1605" /> businessman to leave what he has already got to take up something which is very largely an experiment. If it succeeds nobody will be better pleased than I.  I should like to see business and industry in this country expanding enormously, but I doubt very much if an institution such as this will be very successful in this country. We have had only two examples of conducting industry&mdash;firstly, by private enterprise, and, secondly, on the Russian model.  We have also had experience of municipalities engaging in business, and in these cases they had advantages which private enterprise had not.  They had to supply something to a market in which nobody could compete against them, but even with that big advantage, it has not been found that municipalities who engaged in business were particularly successful.  There were gaps of one kind or another.  To ensure the success of this undertaking there should be freedom from blemishes or infirmities of this nature at this early stage.  We should not in the early stages of the undertaking let these matters be discussed here.  A short time ago, when we were discussing the Bill to extend the Trades Loan Acts, objections were put forward to having balance sheets published, but any shareholder of this company can get them.  He is entitled to them.  As a matter of fact, quite a number of them are published in the Press, particularly balance sheets of such institutions as banks.  If there is to be that reticence on the part of the Minister in connection with ordinary companies, why should we have a single item of all this business exposed here? I do not think it is sound.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a couple of points that are not quite clear in the Minister's statement.  Does he propose to float this £5,000,000 company, raise the capital, and then proceed to go out for something to invest the money in, or does he propose merely to get recommendations for this company, that they should assist certain industries, and then, as they require money, float their own capital? The Minister has mentioned how hard the directors will be required to work, and the close attention they would have <Col N="1606" /> to give to the business, under sub-section (5) of Section 11.  Section 11 deals, apparently, with the obligations to furnish balance sheets to the Minister, and I do not think there will be very much labour involved for the directors in the furnishing of the balance sheets.  I should like to ask what type of director the Minister has in view. Is he somebody who would be employed whole-time?  If so, I take it he is going to be remunerated adequately. He has made no mention of what idea of remuneration he has in mind.  There appears to be a certain number of undesirable features about this Bill, or at least features that might become very undesirable.  Apparently this company will practically be required to undertake the underwriting on promotion of Irish industrial concerns that are brought to their notice.  Some of those may be very big concerns, such as the cement industry.  We are all familiar with the discussion that ensued on the cement industry, and I think it is perfectly plain that whatever happens the public are not going to get cheaper cement than they got heretofore.  This Industrial Credit Corporation, or whatever title will be given it, will be practically a promoting company, or, as some people might describe it, a share-pushing company. Will the position be something like this, that a company will come along to this Industrial Credit Corporation, or whatever you like to call it, and the Industrial Credit Corporation will float their shares on the market?  The company that they have promoted will possibly be manufacturing some type of goods which can be imported into this country, and to which the Minister will have been induced to give some measure of protection.  I am assuming that this company goes on for some time, and has not been doing very well. It occurs to the Industrial Credit Corporation that this particular company that they have promoted must receive some fillip and they will accordingly apply to the Minister for a fillip in the shape of an additional tariff.  When that additional protection is granted the company will commence to do well. Will the Industrial Credit Corporation unload its shares on the market, and <Col N="1607" /> will the additional protection that they got be withdrawn by the Minister at a convenient season?  I suggest that that is one of what I might describe as the undesirable features of the too close association of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce with industries, where they have practically the making or the breaking of them in their hands.</P>
      <P>There is another feature of this corporation's activities that I should like to suggest to the Minister.  How far would this provide cheap and easy money in order to enable companies to be formed to compete with old-established institutions, or old-established companies that are operating in this country?  I have not very much fear, in an equal contest, as to who will survive, but I do not know who is to be the judge as to whether the services rendered to this country by a particular branch of industry are adequate, or whether there will be cheap and easy Government funds available in order to compete with those industries that are already established.  If it is going to be open to people to appeal to the Minister to start a particular industry in their particular section of the country I am afraid that the Minister, possibly against his better judgment, will be forced into a number of enterprises which he might be better advised to keep out of.  There is another phase of this industrial activity that I do not know how far the Minister and the Government are taking note of.  With all these tariffs, some of them desirable, some of them undesirable, some of them possibly necessary, some of them unnecessary, the cost of production along all lines is being forced up, and they are only increasing the difficulties of companies that will be started in the near future to manufacture successfully during the present difficult times.  I should like to put that aspect seriously before the Government, as to how far they are increasing recklessly the cost of production of new enterprises, and also of the old ones, by the present policy that they are pursuing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I am interested in has been touched upon by <Col N="1608" /> Deputy Dockrell, the question as to how far the new company will have responsibility for the creation of industries. Will it be expected to create companies for the development of particular industries which will become subsidiary to it?  If I interpret the purpose of the Bill correctly the company will have that function.  Wherever the Government sees an opening for an industry, particularly an industry of national importance that is not being engaged in by private enterprise, the Credit Corporation will have the function of seeing that such an industry gets under way.  It will follow the line of endeavouring to promote a company to engage in that industry, and such a company may become subsidiary &mdash;not necessarily&mdash;to it through the investment by the Credit Corporation of a portion or perhaps all of the capital required.  It would look to me as if such a function were a necessity, if the Credit Corporation is to fulfil the purposes it is expected to fulfil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, with regard to the production of minerals in the country, it is not likely that private enterprise will engage in that line of business. At the same time it might appear to the directors of the credit corporation that the opportunities, for instance, for sulphur mining in the country are sufficient to justify the existence of an industry of that kind, and that it would be both desirable and useful to create a company for sulphur mining and for the mining of some of the other minerals that are known to exist in the country.  Questions of that kind will be asked by great numbers of people who are interested in the mineral development of the country, and by many who are interested in this Bill because of its potentialities for good.  Another question that Deputy Dockrell, and, I think, Deputy Cosgrave touched upon that seems to me to be of importance was this: the difficulty that the directors of the company will be in, those who are businessmen, in regard to their relations to the Government.  Take, for instance, such a question as that of financing a hire purchase business.  It is known that there is an opening at present here for a company to engage in the business of hire purchase finance.  I do not think <Col N="1609" /> there is any company at present engaged in that business.  I can see difficulties arising there as between the direct representatives of the Government and the people who would be independent of the Government for the reason that the development of a hire purchase business in the country, the raising of money for it, would involve questions which really should be settled by this Dáil, and which should be matters for discussion by it.  I would like to know whether the Minister can say, with regard to a question like that, whether the company would be entitled to consider such an investment on its merits without regard to its social reactions.  It is obvious that you could have a finance corporation here for the development of hire purchase which would be a most attractive opening purely as an investment, but which the public might consider, or at least the best informed sections of the public might consider, would not be a desirable innovation from other points of view.</P>
    <P>I can see difficulties of that kind facing the directors and I can see other difficulties as well&mdash;in this way: that the Government, I think, will have to take the directors into its confidence with regard to its intentions on such questions as tariffs. The directorate will naturally have to know when faced with the prospect that a particular industry would be successful, provided it was given fair protection, whether it can be taken that the Government will grant such protection and what degree of protection it will grant, in the event of the proposal receiving general approval.  These are difficulties that are bound to arise with regard to any proposal, but in my opinion they will be small compared to the great advantages that the promotion of such a corporation as this must mean to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill&mdash;this piece of green paper&mdash;is really a Parliamentary prospectus that is being presented to us.  It is a prospectus seeking a sum of £5,000,000 from the country.  There is nothing in the prospectus to indicate, except in a <Col N="1610" /> very obscure form, what all this money is to be used for.  If this prospectus was put on the public market it would be called &ldquo;a bucketshop prospectus&rdquo;, but the fact is, that the Minister for Finance being behind it it escapes that name.  There is no information presented to us.  In the background there will be the Minister for Finance. He will be in an unassailable position. It matters not whether he controls half the shares in this huge undertaking or whether he only has a £1 share, for the simple reason that if he controls more than half the shares he can appoint four directors, while if he only owns a £1 share the four directors may not be appointed without his approval.  Therefore, the Minister will be in a very strong position indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really a big investment-holding company, and it requires tremendous expert training to carry on an institution of the kind.  We have seen, during the big crises on the exchanges of the world in the last three years, that some of the most cleverly run and most shrewdly administered concerns have gone down simply because they went into a business much bigger than they had previous experience of handling.  From this £5,000,000 company, of which the Minister in the background will be in complete control, numerous offshoots are to take place, interlocking with this holding company. Directors are to be appointed. I presume they will walk in for a couple of hours in the afternoon on two or three days a week, or perhaps on every day of the week.  They will look into, investigate and govern the decisions taken by this huge show.  The Minister for Finance will be in his office, and he will have to be approached and asked whether he approves of this, that or the other, because the company will not be able to do anything without his approval. There is nothing before the Dáil to show what is going to be done with this £5,000,000&mdash;as to whether, say, the cement industry would require a capital of £350,000 or £500,000; whether technical experts would be engaged, whether the board of directors in connection with that particular undertaking <Col N="1611" /> would be men of long experience, men whose training and experience would be an assurance that the interests of the shareholders would be well looked after, and that the balance sheet published was prepared on conservative lines, and that an honest dividend was paid.  If the Dáil had such information before it, it would be for Deputies to say whether it was worth considering and whether it was worth voting money for this holding-company.</P>
    <P>We could come along and then go into the question of the £1,250,000 for sugar beet.  But we have nothing to go on in the case of sugar beet for the simple reason that the £400,000 capital to produce 20,000 tons of sugar in Carlow is and has been nothing of a business nature whatever.  We could take each separate item under which this huge industrial or commercial undertaking of £5,000,000 would reasonably be able to get the confidence of the House for this money if we had, as close as possible, the facts and figures potentially in the business which this company is to carry out.  I do not know much about this Bill.  There is nothing here which can give ground on which one could get up and make a constructive effort at criticism.  It is just so many paragraphs in print, each of which works in towards the Minister for Finance. I have no objection to this working-in towards the Minister for Finance, for it is an important thing if £5,000,000 is to be floated that the representatives of the people who are in possession for the time being should naturally have a watchful brief on behalf of this House.  I say that because there is always the danger here that when this flotation is made a big lot of it will have to be taken over by the Minister for Finance.  It may not be so but at the same time it may, and therefore there may be a deficit of a very big nature.</P>
    <P>Underwriting is a big business in itself.  Now £5,000,000 is to be underwritten by this new company.  I may be wrong but that is how I read it. I am not sure.  The flotation will be <Col N="1612" /> fully taken care of by the Government if the money is not fully subscribed. Then there will be other items.  Will these be written down as preliminary expenses?  The next matter is the underwriting of the other or subsidiary companies which may be floated, and not only these but the holding company.  If the Minister is not able to get the financial support that he wants, will he not give an opportunity to others at any rate for the subsidiary companies that may be floated?  It is very hard to quite understand a huge thing like this, without any real sound statement.  I am only feeling and groping my way. I hope when the Minister comes to reply he will go more fully into details. It is essential that we should know where this enormous sum of £5,000,000, which may not be required, is to be raised.  Perhaps only £1,500,000 may be required; for the board of directors and those behind them may think that the majority of the companies to be started are not feasible.  However, in the meantime, large sums of money may be required.  What are they to be used for?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I only saw this Bill for the first time a few minutes ago, and I have not the advantage of having heard the observations of the Minister for Finance on it this afternoon. I will confine my comments on it to a very few words.  In principle I am glad to see that something is being done to make it easier for Irishmen to invest in Irish industrial enterprises. We know that there has not been for the Irishman who genuinely wishes to invest money in Irish enterprises a sufficient range of such enterprises in which to invest.  We know that there is a particular need for small industries in this country, and these are the industries which cannot float capital issues successfully.  It is in such cases that this Bill may be of the greatest advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the shares of this company held, as far as possible, by the public and not by the Government. I should like instead of the shares being held by the Government to see them held by individuals. <Col N="1613" /> What I really wish to point out is that the prospects of the company are very much impaired by the existence of the economic war.  If the Minister for Finance really wishes to make this scheme a success, both as regards getting capital into it at the start and also as regards getting industries that are going to be helped to succeed, the first thing to which he should devote his attention is to induce his colleagues in the Executive Council to make a settlement of the economic war.  Another matter to which he might also attend with advantage is the very considerable alarm which is being caused in the country at present to people with any experience of business or with anything to lose by the kind of propaganda&mdash;ignorant, stupid and violent propaganda going on throughout the country with regard to our banking system.  I am perfectly certain that the Government do not believe in this propaganda or approve of it.  It is receiving some encouragement however from irresponsible elements in their Party and is a serious obstacle to raising money from individual citizens for this company and to the success of such enterprises as this Bill may bring into existence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have got some little trouble in quite understanding the finances of this Bill.  I see, of course, in the Bill that there can be a capital of £5,000,000 for what I would call the ordinary shares, and that there can be debentures up to, as far as I can gather, another £5,000,000. Therefore, in fact, there may be altogether £10,000,000 at the disposal of this body.  I do not see anything in the Bill, nor do I gather from the opening statement of the Minister, how much of this £5,000,000 is to be floated originally.  Are we to have a flotation of the whole £5,000,000, or is it to be by smaller sums, and when is that flotation to take place?  A company is to be formed and £15,000 is to be expended in the formation of the company.  I see that certain persons are to float a company, but I am at a loss to understand how it is to be done. Who will they be?  Will they be nominees of the Minister?  Who will <Col N="1614" /> take the original work of flotation, and for how much is the original flotation to be?  I presume the Minister has all that information.  Of course it would be very difficult for the Minister or anybody to know how much the public will take?  Suppose there is a flotation.  Is the Minister to outline how a large company like the sugar beet company and such companies that are practically public are to be entirely financed by this company? The first issue will have to be probably very large, and I would like to know if that is not taken up, is the Minister going to get the sum of money necessary to float the company and to have it invested there by him in ordinary shares?  On what terms does he expect to get that money?  I have read Section 6, and I see by that section that any money that the Minister wants shall be charged upon the Central Fund.  It must be borrowed from the Minister in some way.  The Minister is to produce out of the coffers of the State probably one or two million pounds.  There is the power in the Minister to appoint directors.  Then the Minister envisages that at some time the State will have considerably more than two or probably three million pounds invested in that company.  From where is that money to come?  That money cannot be saved out of the ordinary revenue. Is it the intention of the Minister to float a loan.  I see that he may bargain with the Bank of Ireland, and the Bank may advance money to him; but at what rate and on what terms is he to borrow?  We have not been told any of these things by the Minister.  It may involve the State in a very serious loss.  Suppose you put up this £5,000,000, or a large proportion of it, the Minister will have to borrow it at a very considerable rate of interest, because it will be a long term loan. Suppose there is not a demand for the money which the corporation may anticipate there will be.  Suppose some of their investments do not turn out happily, and there is money lying on their hands, how are they then going to invest it?  At what rate of interest are they going to advance their money to various companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1615" /> As regards the underwriting, there may be a very considerable loss.  Underwriting is one of the biggest gambles in finance.  You undertake to underwrite a company, getting a certain percentage profit on your underwriting undertaking.  If what is underwritten is all taken by the public, everything goes well, but you may underwrite a flotation which the public do not like and you may have these shares on your hands and, instead of a considerable profit from underwriting, you will find that the underwriting has been a loss. It requires persons very skilled in these matters to undertake these financial arrangements.  As the Minister stated, there are practically no underwriters in this country.  There are very few persons with experience of how underwriting should be done, what risks a skilful underwriter will run and what risks he will not run.  It seems to me that if this starts off with an immediate £5,000,000 you will have more money than you will want for a considerable time.  I hope that will not be the case, but that is my belief.  That money will be on your hands and, though you will not be completely prevented from investing it outside, at the same time I think you are likely to have the bulk of it lying on your hands with nothing else to do except to put it on deposit receipt in a bank.</P>
    <P>Seemingly your principal object will be buying shares.  Of course, you can invest it in other ventures if you like. I have no doubt there will be subsidiary objects.  It seems to me this business may turn out very unprofitably indeed, unless it is worked very gently and very quietly at the start.  It will require to become a great success from the start, taking no risks.  I presume the object of the Minister will be that the ordinary Irishman, or woman, who desires to invest money in Irish industry will not make a choice individually but will say: &ldquo;Here is the Industrial Trust Company.&rdquo;  If it has a board of directors in which the investor has confidence, the investor will decide to lodge his money with that company. He will come to the conclusion that the company has experts who would know much better than he would how money <Col N="1616" /> ought to be invested.  Suppose this board makes mistakes in the beginning and money is lost, and suppose it does not pay a good dividend to the shareholders, the public may lose confidence in it.  If the Industrial Trust Company does not pay a substantial rate to the shareholders, they will be very annoyed.  If there is a poor rate of interest you may be certain that will do a great deal of harm to the promotion of Irish industries.</P>
    <P>This is a two-edged sword.  If it is successful it will be a help to Irish industry, an enormous help; but if it is a failure, or not an outstanding success, it will do a tremendous amount of harm to Irish industry.  If a great investment company with Government backing is not able, by its investments in Irish industry, to make a profit, the man in the street will say: &ldquo;If that body is not able to make a profit, there is not much hope for me if I invest my money in Irish industrial enterprise.&rdquo; I hope the Minister will succeed in getting a board of really competent men in whom the public will have complete trust.  I hope the board will go on very slowly at the commencement, taking no risks.  It will have heavy responsibilities upon its shoulders, and it will have the possibility of doing harm as well as good to Irish industry. I hope when it is established it will work in such a manner that it will do good and not harm to Irish industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing has emerged clearly from the debate, and that is that the need for a company such as it is proposed to take power under this Bill to establish is widely and generally recognised.  It is to the details of the project which we are submitting to the House that criticism has been principally directed.  I think in that connection I had better deal with the points raised by Deputy Cosgrave.  The criticism might be reduced to two heads, first as to the figure at which the capital of the company has been placed, and, secondly, as to the provisions in the Bill which will, to some extent at any rate, subject the operations of the company and the conduct of its directors to the scrutiny of the House.  On the question of the capital of the company, this <Col N="1617" /> has been placed at £5,000,000.  It has been clearly foreseen that the undertakings which the company, even in its initial stages, will be called upon to finance, are of considerable magnitude. I referred to some of them.  There is the new sugar beet undertaking; possibly, though not probably, a new cement undertaking; possibly, also, but not probably, proposals for the reestablishment of the paper-making industry; possibly, and probably, the establishment of an undertaking to manufacture industrial alcohol from vegetable produce, and probably, also, an undertaking to develop the mineral resources of this country.  Now, whether the company will be called on probably, or possibly, to undertake the financing of any one of those projects, they are all contingencies for which we must, in submitting the Bill to the House, make provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new sugar beet undertaking will possibly be floated for something like £2,000,000.  The cement manufacture will require about three-quarters of a million; the paper undertaking about half a million; industrial alcohol about half a million, and mining about £1,000,000, making up something like £4,500,000 projects which the company might have to undertake. And this by no means exhausts the possibility of industrial development in this country.  We must leave a considerable margin, therefore, for new projects which may, from time to time, be submitted to the Government, and by the Government submitted to this House, and for the underwriting of which, in due course, the Industrial Credit Company may have to undertake responsibility. Therefore, I suggest, that in all the circumstances, the figure of £5,000,000 which has been taken as the ultimate capital of the company is not excessive.  Because the capital of the company has been fixed at £5,000,000 it is not to be assumed, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and some of the other speakers have assumed, that the whole of the £5,000,000 will be offered to the Irish public immediately.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney himself has given us some very sound reasons why that should not be done: that it may be somebody would have to take responsibility for the loss of interest which <Col N="1618" /> those who might subscribe that money might suffer during the period it was lying idle and unused in the account of the company.  Accordingly it is not the intention of the new company to ask the Irish public to subscribe this capital at once.  The issue of shares will be made, as I think I clearly indicated in my speech in introducing the Bill, from time to time as they are required by the company for the use of the company.</P>
    <P>While I am on that point, I might possibly go a little further and deal with some of the criticisms which, I think, were made by Deputy Dockrell. He asked whether the company would be required to undertake the underwriting of all concerns brought to its notice.  The first point that arises there is: brought to its notice by whom?  If it is an undertaking which is brought to its notice by the Government under the provisions of a statute passed by this House, the Government would naturally have to be responsible for the underwriting of any shares in that company which the Government felt should be offered to the Irish public. I want to make that point clear, and I also want to make this clear, that with that reservation the company is going to be in an absolutely independent position to deal with, and to consider on its merits, any project that may be submitted to it.  Therefore it will not be bound to undertake the underwriting of all concerns brought to its notice.  I said the company would be bound to undertake responsibility for underwriting of certain undertakings that might be brought to its notice by a statute of this House.  One of these, for instance, would be the sugar beet undertaking.  I do not wish to commit myself, definitely, to a statement at the moment in relation to the proposed sugar beet concern.  But this is how I contemplate the financing of that concern should be undertaken. An issue of shares will be made to the public.  The amount, first of all, will be very much as already indicated.  The issue of shares will be made, and of that issue the Minister for Finance, under powers conferred on him by statute of the Oireachtas, will take up a certain proportion.  The balance will then be <Col N="1619" /> submitted to the public, but as it will then be the definite policy, not merely of the Government but of the Oireachtas which passed the Act, to establish a sugar beet industry in this country, the Industrial Credit Company, to be floated under this Bill, would then be bound to underwrite that portion of the issue which was offered to the general public.  Now, I do not think there can be any objection to that.  Bearing in mind that the Minister for Finance has provided, in the first instance, portion of the capital that will be required for this new undertaking, the general public will be asked to subscribe.  The public who subscribe to the new undertaking will have that fact in mind.  When they do subscribe they will take the risk, equally with the Minister for Finance and the Government, involved in such an undertaking.  Bearing in mind that the Government feels that the new project is one necessary and desirable in the best interests of the country, the directors of the sugar company will naturally be concerned to make the new undertaking as great a success as may be, and, therefore, the new undertaking will have every possible opportunity of succeeding.  That fact will, I think, to some extent, counteract the hesitation that investors might normally feel if asked to assist in underwriting an issue of a general investment house which would have as one of its chief functions the underwriting of issues made in the circumstances that I have indicated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell also asked will a company come along to the new corporation, and will they put shares on the market.  Naturally, any person who thinks he has a feasible project, if he cannot secure proper backing for that project in any other way, will come to the company and the company will consider that proposition on its merits, and on its merits only, unless it is one of the particular type to which I have already referred.  Whether it be one of the particular type to which I have already referred or whether it be a project initiated purely by private enterprise, it will be the <Col N="1620" /> general policy of the company, in accordance with what Deputy MacDermot has already said, to place, so far as it possibly can, the issues of any undertakings which it may underwrite in the hands of the general public so that as large a section of the general public as possible may be interested in securing the success of the new ventures.</P>
    <P>If any one of these ventures is not panning out exactly as it was hoped it would, Deputy Dockrell asked would it be possible for the Industrial Credit Company, in order to give a fillip to its own bantling, to go to the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as the case might be, and ask for a tariff, so that the subsidiary company might get the necessary fillip and that the Industrial Credit Company might have an opportunity of unloading its shares on a guileless public.  I can assure Deputy Dockrell that any proposal of that sort would receive very short shrift from any member of the Executive Council and, particularly, from the Minister for Finance.  Let the Deputy throw his mind back to the debates that took place in regard to the imposition even of the most innocuous tariffs&mdash;tariffs that everybody admitted would be good and beneficial because of the new industries which might be easily established or the existing industries which might be easily preserved and developed with their aid.  Let Deputy Dockrell consider the amount of Parliamentary time necessary to get the simplest tariff through this House, apart altogether from the stream of criticism it has to withstand, and he will realise, as everybody will realise, that no Minister for Finance would place himself in the position in which he would be placed if, in addition to all the criticism on normal grounds which he might be subjected to, he would also have to face criticism on the hypothesis to which Deputy Dockrell has given utterance.  How could any Minister for Finance face the Dáil if he felt he was to be subjected to charges of that sort, that he was, in the phrase of Deputy Minch&mdash;a very ill-applied and ill-chosen phrase&mdash;going <Col N="1621" /> to assist the Industrial Credit Company in performing what would be virtually the functions of a bucket shop.  No Government would venture to do that and remain in office for 12 months, because public opinion would be outraged by it.  No matter how rigid Party discipline might be, I feel that there would be a sufficient number of honest, public-spirited men in any Party to overthrow the Government or the Minister responsible for so outrageous a proposal as Deputy Dockrell outlined.</P>
    <P>On the question of the definite control which the Minister for Finance proposes to exercise in the initial stages of this company and the limited control which, under Sections 10 and 11, he will continue to exercise even after he has divested himself of a majority holding in the company, I should like to say a few words.  This is a problem of extreme difficulty.  I referred, in introducing the Bill, to a previous venture by our predecessors&mdash; the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland, an undertaking in which a not inconsiderable sum of public money was invested.  In the flotation of that company, the Government of the day divested itself, so far as it could divest itself, of all but the barest responsibility for ensuring that the duties of the directors to itself as a shareholder in the company would be fulfilled. There, you had a company in which the directors were given the fullest possible autonomy.  Yet, looking at its history, nobody can say that that experiment was a success.  Those of us who have studied the inner history of it might be driven to the conclusion that one of the reasons that company failed was that so great and far-reaching a measure of autonomy was conferred on the directors and that an opportunity was not given in this House to scrutinise, from time to time, the operations of the company. Accordingly, it seems to me that experience here shows us that it is unwise&mdash;even if it were expedient, I do not think it would be justifiable where so large a sum ultimately is involved as five million pounds or, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney suggested, possibly ten million pounds, with debentures <Col N="1622" />&mdash;that we should take up the same attitude towards the Industrial Credit Company as was taken up towards the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland.  Therefore, we feel that since the Minister for Finance must, in the early stages at any rate, subscribe almost all the issued capital of the company, there should be given to the Dáil, from time to time, on the Vote of the Minister, an opportunity, if it so desires, to call the Minister to account for the actions of his nominees on the board of this company and that those who accept the responsibility&mdash;admittedly, heavy responsibility, carrying with it, of course, commensurate remuneration&mdash;should be made to feel that as they, possibly, will not be much subject to that great controlling influence which Deputy Cosgrave referred to when he said: &ldquo;Where one's treasure is there one's heart is also,&rdquo; at any rate, they will know that what they do will be subjected to scrutiny, possibly of the most searching kind.  As we are entrusting to individuals large sums of public money to administer, those individuals must be made to feel their full responsibility for the administration of these moneys.  That is why we have provided here in Section 11 that the company shall furnish not merely a balance sheet and a profit and loss account, but also, under subsection (3), shall furnish to the Minister on demand such explanations as the Minister shall think proper to require in respect of any balance sheet or profit and loss account.  Naturally, the explanations which the Minister might require might extend to every activity of the company which was reflected in the balance sheet or in the profit and loss account presented by the company.  On the other hand, it is not intended that the Minister will exercise a day-to-day supervision over the board.  The board will be given the fullest discretion and, as I have said, full responsibility will be placed on them and they will have to accept full responsibility for the results of their action, with the knowledge that what they do or what they do not do may be criticised here in the House, and that the Minister will have to defend or condemn in the House what they do or do not do.  I do not think there <Col N="1623" /> is any provision or any principle which we could substitute other than that of compelling the members of the board themselves to make heavy investments in this company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore asked will the new company be responsible for the creation of new industries, and he went on to say that, in his opinion, the creation of new industries should be an essential object of the company. I should like to make it quite clear that that is not the function of the company.  Its function is to finance new undertakings, when they are submitted to it, or existing industrial undertakings, but only if it is satisfied that the undertakings have a reasonable prospect of success and if it is satisfied that they will, if given a fair chance, show that they are suited and necessary to the needs of our people. But the creation of new industries, as apart altogether from the establishment of industrial undertakings to carry on existing industries is, I submit, first of all, something for private enterprise and, if private enterprise fails, then, as has so often been stated by the President and other members of the Executive Council, it is for the Government.  But this new Industrial Credit Company will be what its name implies&mdash;a credit corporation, something which will provide long-term credit for industrial undertakings. It is not contemplated that it should have at its disposal all the specialised knowledge that would be necessary to start new enterprises in this country.  That specialised knowledge would have to be provided, in the first place, by private enterprise and, if private enterprise does not rise to the occasion, then the Government will have to step in, as it is stepping in with regard to the beet sugar manufacturing industry.</P>

      <P>If I may be permitted to interrupt the Minister for a moment, may we take it that this company will only assist undertakings which, in addition to other qualifications, can be relied upon to be thoroughly well-managed?  The question of management is, of course, enormously important.</P>

      <P>Yes.  That point was covered, I think, by the remark I made when I said &ldquo;undertakings which had a reasonable prospect of success.&rdquo;  I do not think that any undertaking, no matter what the other circumstances might be, would have any prospect of success unless it were well managed.  Deputy Moore also said that the company will have to know what is the Government's policy in regard to tariffs.  It is not the intention of the Government to take this concern or any other concern into its confidence in regard to tariffs.  The company, when enterprises are put up to it for consideration, will have to examine them and consider them and determine its course of action in the light of the facts as it sees them at the moment.  For instance, in a case like that of the beet sugar industry a Bill will quite clearly set out the intentions of the Government in regard to a tariff upon imported sugar.  Possibly, in the case of industries which could not succeed unless a tariff were guaranteed for a definite time, the promoters of the industry, before they approach the Industrial Credit Company at all, will have gone to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He will have consulted his colleagues and made up his mind, first of all, as to whether the industry is one which could be assisted by a tariff and as to whether a tariff should, in all the circumstances, be imposed.  Having secured the assent of the Executive Council to it, he will have informed the original undertaker in the matter what his intentions are.  Armed with that information, the undertaker will go to the Credit Company, if he must, and secure from them the financial assistance he requires.  In that way, possibly, the Industrial Credit Company might be aware of the intentions of the Government in regard to tariffs, but there will be no formal communication by the Government of its intentions to the Industrial Credit Company except in so far as it is expressed by a statute of the Oireachtas.  I should not like it to go out to the public, however, that if the new Credit Corporation makes an issue of the shares of any company, no <Col N="1625" /> matter what, that <i>ipso facto</i> because the issue has been made the public are to assume that a tariff either will be granted in regard to this particular industry or maintained in regard to the industry.  Obviously, neither a government which, at most, is in power for five years or for the period from one Dáil to another, nor an industrial credit corporation with no responsibility whatsoever to the Dáil except in the indirect way I have indicated, would be able to give an undertaking with regard to the future fiscal policy of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather sorry to hear the speech of Deputy Minch.  I think I would not be unfair if I were to say that of all the speeches which have been made on the Bill it is the one which has the least justification and the one which has been the least helpful.  I think it would be a terrible thing if it were to go out to the public that the proposals submitted here in this Bill, which the Deputy quite erroneously described as a prospectus, were to be called a bucket-shop prospectus.  We are very anxious to attract the money of private investors into this company.  We are anxious, as I indicated in my opening statement, as soon as the Irish public show that they are prepared to shoulder the responsibilities and the risks involved in an undertaking of this kind, to transfer that undertaking to them.  I think that one of the things which would defeat that very desirable object, an object to which Deputy MacDermot gave his benediction in what he said on the Bill, one of the things that would impede us in doing what we think, with possibly every other section of the House, ought to be done in this matter, would be a statement such as was made by Deputy Minch.  I should like people to realise that this is not a bucket-shop enterprise; not a catch-penny enterprise; that the Government are prepared, if necessary, to put every pennypiece of the £5,000,000 into it, because somebody must accept the initial risks in an undertaking of this sort, so that the deficiency which has hitherto existed, and which has been universally admitted in this House to have hitherto existed, in our financial organisation, <Col N="1626" /> will be repaired, and that Irish industrialists will have here for new Irish enterprises, or for the extension of existing Irish enterprises, the same facilities as are enjoyed by industrialists elsewhere.</P>

      <P>May I just put two questions to the Minister?  I should like to know how the Minister proposes to raise this £5,000,000 or whatever may be necessary?  Is it to be done by Treasury bills or how?  It seems to me to be a rather difficult problem.  I do not see how it can be raised by Treasury bills or short term loans, if you are going to make a permanent investment.  Another thing I should like to know is this.  The Minister said that if any Act was passed in this House establishing a scheme then it would be absolutely essential for the company to invest in the scheme.  Take the one item which the Minister says must be financed by this company, that is the scheme for the sugar beet industry.  It is admitted on all sides that the sugar beet industry cannot be carried on profitably unless it is heavily subsidised, it must be heavily subsidised.  Suppose the company came to the conclusion that the Government were not subsidising sufficiently the beet undertaking and that, therefore, it must be a failure, will the company still be compelled to invest in it?  Remember, they are not investing merely Government money; they will be also investing for private persons.</P>

      <P>As to the question how the money is to be provided, I do not think that it is necessary for me to commit myself to raising this money in any particular form.  Naturally, as the Deputy says, since the investment will be a long-term one, if the money has to be borrowed it will have to be borrowed upon long-term conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally it would not be raised on Treasury bills, but I do not wish to commit myself to an undertaking if the company required money <Col N="1627" /> from time to time, and it was not opportune to float a loan, that I should not provide money by Treasury bills, if necessary.  You cannot be issuing loans in dribs or drabs of a quarter of a million, a half a million or one million, as required for temporary short-time financing.  If it is necessary Treasury bills will be used, but, ultimately, however the money is provided, it will be provided by long-term loan.  As to the other question, as to what this company will be expected to do in regard to undertakings established by any statute of this House, I do not anticipate that any of the very great difficulties which the Deputy suggested would arise in that connection at all, because, naturally, when the Bill establishing a new undertaking is submitted to the House the Minister responsible for it in the first instance will have to disclose to the House what he anticipates will be the total sum required for the new undertaking; will have to disclose the amount which he proposes to invest in the new undertaking, and the House will have an opportunity of saying what amount of the capital it is anticipated will have to be taken up either by the general public or the underwriting house.  That matter will be discussed and debated here, and the House will probably have to come to an agreement as to what will be a fair proportion in all the circumstances. The issue will then be floated.  As I have indicated, the general public will have been made aware of the fact that the Government intend to establish this industry and the industry will have to be established upon such conditions as in the judgment of this House, which is fairly well representative of the general public, will give it a fair or reasonable opportunity of success.</P>

Therefore the new Industrial Credit Company will only be asked to undertake what would be a fair commercial underwriting risk for any company asked to underwrite the shares of such an undertaking.  There is nothing in this Bill guaranteeing anything in regard to the shares of this undertaking; it is not intended that there should be.  It is not intended to relieve investors who desire to participate in a venture of this sort from any of the risks which would normally attend such a venture.  So that, as I said, if we are asking them to undertake what would be a fair commercial underwriting risk, we are not imposing any undue obligation upon private investors in a concern of this sort.</P>

I simply and solely expressed that opinion without implying that I looked upon this as a bucket-shop issue.

      <P>I understand that there is a great scarcity of slates especially in the Gaeltacht, where houses are being built.  A great many builders are held up because they cannot get supplies.  I am informed that free <Col N="1630" /> grants for houses cannot be given unless Irish slates are used.  I hope the Minister will look into the matter to see if it is possible to convenience these builders.  I know houses in which the stone work and the timber work has been finished for a couple of months, but the builders are still waiting for slates.  Something should be done to remedy that state of affairs.</P>
      <P>A large number of appeals affecting old age pensions are pending, up to 200, I understand, in County Mayo. These appeals were sent in last October, November and December but the poor people are still waiting for decisions.  I know several cases where the applicants have died since the appeals were sent in.  I reminded the Minister about this matter previously in questions, but I got the usual stereotyped reply, that the Department was too busy, or had an insufficient staff.  The Minister might now be able to borrow some staff from the collection branch of the Land Commission.  I do not know what the people there have been doing for the last five or six months.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of money has been spent on roads out of relief schemes and unemployment grants. I understand that the roads dealt with were already under contract.  The roads that want looking after are not roads under contract, because they are in perfect condition, but bog roads, <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads, as well as roads leading into villages which are not under contract.  The Department has done nothing for that class of roads.  In the next grant I hope the Minister will include these roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of money has been spent on sewerage schemes in the West.  Some of the Boards of Health state that they have sent on plans and specifications for other schemes, but that the Department has held them up for a year or more.  In Claremorris plans for a sewerage scheme were submitted, the cost of the work being inside £1,000.  The Board of Health gave the necessary approval by passing the statutory resolution, but the county council state they heard nothing about the matter since from the <Col N="1631" /> Department.  As 15 new houses were erected in Claremorris last winter, for which no sewerage accommodation is available, a danger arises from the lack of the necessary sewerage extension.</P>
    <P>Complaints are also made about the delay in building hospitals.  It appears that arrangements were made by the county council and the board of health to build hospitals in the county, particularly in Claremorris. The plans were approved by the Board of Health and were forwarded to the Department some time ago. Nothing has been done since.  Even the sites for the hospitals have not been acquired.  I hope the Minister will see his way to expedite these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to emphasise the point raised by the last speaker, and to say that it is only fair to the building trade, and to the country generally, that there should be an equivocal expression from the Minister in reference to the use of Irish slates.  I am in a position to know that the Minister is aware that no matter what money is put down, when ordering Irish slates for delivery within the next three weeks, the builder is not going to get them. Probably he would not get them within the next three months.  I know of a case where a dozen terrace houses were being built within the last six weeks.  The material for the first house controlled what was to go on the last one.  The builder was anxious to use Irish slates.  He tried Killaloe, Carrick, a quarry in Wicklow, and finally Donegal.  He could not get any slates from the first three places.  A traveller from one of the principal firms of builders' providers in the city assured him that he could get Donegal slates if he did not mind using small slates 11 x 8 in.  The builder agreed and prepared the roofs to receive 11 x 8 in. slates.  As the lathing for such would be very close the builder decided to sheet the roofs.  Having gone to that expense the traveller informed the builder that there were no slates on hands.  Although the Dublin firm wrote and wired to the <Col N="1632" /> slate quarry they could get no reply. In order to get on with the work, and not to have to turn 50 or 60 men away, the builder then ordered Bangor slates and he had not to wait 24 hours for all the blue Bangor slates he wanted.  This State is providing money for alleged slate quarry men. I do not know if that portion of the matter relates to the Department of the Minister for Local Government but, in any case, the Minister has that information and he can bring it, at the meetings of the Executive Council, before his colleague of the appropriate Department.  While the State is giving money to run those quarries, the policy of the State of using Irish slates, with which I agree, is providing customers.  Having provided the finance, the Government also provides the customers for these quarry workers, and yet we cannot get delivery of the goods.  I was speaking recently to an authority on Irish slates&mdash;I do not mind stating who he is; he is the architect to the Dublin Corporation&mdash;and he informed me that he had it from better authorities than himself that, in the Killaloe area, there is a slate which is better than the best known British slate.  The best known British slate is what is known as &ldquo;Westmoreland Green&rdquo; but he informed me that there is a nicer and a better slate at one-third of the price in that seam from Nenagh to Killaloe.  These people are getting money and getting customers for their product and yet men are idle.  There is no use in labouring it.  I am sure the Minister will inquire into that aspect, the industrial aspect, of this matter.  From the building standpoint, surely it is manifestly unjust, that, if a builder does all, from the business standpoint, that can reasonably be expected of him, to procure the Irish product and if he cannot get it, and if a wait would upset his whole business and throw his men out of employment and, perhaps, bankrupt him&mdash;and I am sure the Minister would be one of the last persons to do an unfair act though if I were talking politics I might say the exact opposite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not think the Deputy was here or I would not have said it.  In business matters, the Minister is a reasonable man, and when a fair case is put up to him he will deal with it on its merits.  There is another matter on which I would not speak of the Minister in such glowing terms and it is the manner in which he is handling grants from his Department.  It struck me, from the correspondence which passed between the Minister and the County Council of Dublin, that the Minister looked upon agricultural grants as some kind of a dole to agriculture, that, at some time or another, a charitably disposed Government said: &ldquo;We will give a gift to agriculture to keep it from growling or we will give it a dole as it is in a bad way.&rdquo;  I should like to remind the Minister that the agricultural grant, in its origin, was not a dole.  The agricultural grant had its origin in the fact that, when our ancestors got their lands as tenants at will from the landlords, they contracted, as part of the tenancy, to pay rents and, broadly speaking, the landlords contracted to pay half the local rates.  That system obtained up to the passage of the Local Government Act of 1898.  In that Act there is a section which indemnifies the landlords.  They have not to pay any more, but the Government assumed the landlords' responsibility and, for the first time, that responsibility of the landlords is called an agricultural grant.  Strictly speaking, however, it was a landlord relief grants.  It was never a farmers' relief grant.  It was given to meet a liability that, heretofore, was met by the landlords and not by the farmers.  I hope that my friend, Deputy Kelly and others, who boast of many generations with an outlook circumscribed by the City of Dublin, will drink that in.</P>

      <P>Under that Local Government Act of '98, the agricultural grant was standardised at half the rate on agricultural land for the year 1898 and, although the rates increased every year, up to 1924, that agricultural grant remained stationary at that rate.  Even though we had a common Exchequer with Great Britain up to 1922, in <Col N="1634" /> Britain they got an agricultural grant not standardised at the rate that obtained in 1898 or 1896, when, I think, their Local Government Act was passed, but actually half the rates on agricultural land each year was met by the British Government for Great Britain and, in 1923, 75 per cent. of the rate was met by the British Government. In 1928, 100 per cent. of the rate in Great Britain was met by the British Government.  For the time we had a common Exchequer with Great Britain, if agriculture in this country got the same treatment by way of agricultural grant as agriculture got in Great Britain, agriculture here would have received £16,850,000 more in grants and, if the land purchase system had not taken place and if the landlords had to foot their liability up to 1922, the landlords would have paid that sum and the farmers would have benefited to that extent.  I hope that the Minister will not look on the agricultural grant in future, as, apparently, he has in the past, as a kind of dole to the farmers. It is a debt due by the landlords or the successors in title to the landlords.  The British Government was first and our own Government succeeded the British Government, so that the Minister should realise that the agricultural grant is not a kind of relief to the farmers.  When he took office he found that the original agricultural grant had been doubled.  In 1924, roughly £1,200,000 was given for the relief of rates on agricultural land and he found, just before he took office, that £75,000 more had been given making, roughly, £1,950,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, sir, it was not.  It was the result of the agitation of the farmers organised by the Agricultural League and, when President De Valera thought it was coming over, he put down a motion in this House asking for £1,000,000&mdash;nothing else would relieve the position of agriculture in 1931, but to increase the agricultural grant by £1,000,000.  At the time when the agitation for derating was coming to its climax&mdash; when this Government came in it reached its anti-climax&mdash;it was <Col N="1635" /> common knowledge that relief was coming.  The extent of the relief was not known, but was expected to be about £1,000,000.  President De Valera, obviously trying to anticipate events and in the hope of advancing the interests of his Party though they had done nothing to advance derating except to promise it&mdash;as was promised by President De Valera himself in Collooney in May, 1929&mdash;</P>

      <P>This was to respect the law.  This was to remind the wreckers <Col N="1636" /> that they must not wreck, to quote the words of President de Valera in College Green.  This was to keep the wreckers quiet.  He tried afterwards in an appeal to put out the wreckers, but the appeal passed by unheeded. The wreckers were not put out.  I wonder who has broken the law?  I wonder is it these alleged wreckers, or the Minister for Local Government?  The country wants to know where we stand in the matter of local government.  On the 1st February last the county councils received a stock circular from the Minister's Department saying that it was proposed to hold the triennial elections for the county councils for this year at the usual times&mdash;between the statutory limits of the 23rd June and 1st July&mdash;and asking the county councils to state what date would suit. The Dublin County Council suggested 28th June, and then there was a long silence until the end of May, when we got another circular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other circular stated that it was not proposed to hold the elections in June this year, but that they would be held in November.  Apparently the Minister was not aware of the clause which the late Mr. Tim Healy got into the original Local Government Act fixing the holding of those triennial elections in mid-summer, instead of mid-winter.  The Minister, being a hardy bird, wanted these activities in mid-winter.  In that circular, along with the postponement to November, it was also stated that the election of chairman of the county council, which it is mandatory on the county council to hold between 23rd June and 1st July, was not to be held this year, until after the elections in November. At our meeting in May we queried this circular, and the question was discussed&mdash;was the Minister serious about it?  The Minister's circular on that matter carried no more weight than if the circular were posted up by a man in the street.  He had powers, if he exercised them to make an Order fixing the date of the elections within the limit of July of next year.  He did not do that act which it is prescribed by law he should do.  He told the county councils they were not to elect their chairmen.  We sought counsel's opinion on the matter, and counsel's opinion <Col N="1637" /> to the Dublin County Council was to the effect that we should hold our statutory meetings between the 23rd June and 1st July and elect a chairman in the absence of an Order from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Local Government Department knew what the Dublin County Council was doing. They knew the nature of the advice which they got from counsel, and yet they did not make the Order or the Order has not yet been made.  If that advice to the Dublin County Council is right, if the Dublin County Council, acting on the advice of counsel, is right &mdash;that it was mandatory on them to hold the statutory meeting under the Act between the 23rd June and 1st July, and elect a chairman&mdash;then what about the other 26 county councils who did not hold a statutory meeting?  Are these county councils legal bodies?  If it was a statutory obligation on one council to hold a statutory meeting and to elect a chairman, it was equally mandatory on the other county councils to hold a statutory meeting.  There is only one council in the Free State who held a statutory meeting.  Not only does the Minister know that, but it is upon the Minister's advice that no statutory meeting was held in the case of the other 26 counties.  He comes now and asks £800,000 to administer local government, but notwithstanding that 26 out of 27 county councils have not functioned according to law, does he say that they are legal bodies?  If they are local bodies what is the need for the farce of electing a chairman annually?  I hope there will be public-spirited people in the other 27 county council areas to take mandamus proceedings against the Minister and make him obey the law. Perhaps next time I have the pleasure of confronting him here it is he, and not I, who will have the Bill for £222 19s. 1d. in his pocket.</P>

      <P>See the good example we set.  See all the law we taught the Front Bench.  We are promised a big drive in housing by the Minister&mdash;the housing of the working-classes.  My friend, Deputy O'Kelly&mdash;or Deputy Kelly, as he objects to the &ldquo;O&rdquo;&mdash;is strongly interested in that point of housing the working-classes, particularly the cellar dwellers.  I am equally interested.  I am also interested in housing the agricultural workers, who get 24/- a week or less.  At the present time there is a scheme before the Minister for about 900 cottages for rural County Dublin, to house the agricultural labourers.  The spokesmen of the Government, including the Minister for Finance, that well-read, well-fed and well-bred gentleman who adorns those Front Benches&mdash;unfortunately he is absent at the moment&mdash;have gone around the County Dublin and at various cross-roads have told the agricultural labourers: &ldquo;Why are you living in bad houses?  It is your county council is at fault.  The money is there: you have only to ask for it?&rdquo;  Let the Minister work out what a cottage for an agricultural labourer would cost, even though his Department meets 60 per cent. of the cost, at the rate he is advancing money.  Only to-day, in a minor scheme, we had approval from the Minister's Department for 27 cottages &mdash;a minor scheme or the trimmings of a larger scheme which we have put through.  We are paying 5½ per cent. for that money.  I hope, when the Minister is concluding this debate, he will be able to promise us cheaper money.  If he is able to promise cheaper money he will solve the problem which I cannot see solved without cheaper money.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to offer us cheaper money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take even the cottages that came before us to-day, which the Minister Department sanctioned in the course of the week; I forget the amount involved, but it is at the rate of 5½ per cent. <Col N="1639" /> No local authority can build a cottage for an agricultural labourer and let it to him at a price he can afford to pay if money cannot be made available at less than five and a half per cent. What case can the Minister make for five and a half per cent?  He is aware that the Dublin Corporation borrowed money at £4 8s. 6d. per cent. last year, and it could be borrowed more cheaply now.  He knows that the British Government is borrowing money now at two per cent. on long-term loan. Why cannot we get money for housing the working classes at two or three per cent.?  Pious hopes of building houses, and the mythical houses that have been built on political platforms, may fool people at one time, but they will not fool them all the time.  The housing problem is a financial one, and the only way to solve it is by getting cheaper money.  In the City of Dublin we have facilities for getting cheap money.  We have our own separate credit in the city, and if a sensible corporation maintains that credit it can borrow money at market price.  The rural local bodies have no such borrowing power.  They have no authority to borrow.  They have no authority to issue stock as the Dublin Corporation have.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister of a matter that he probably is aware of. Just about a year ago, when the Dublin Corporation decided on working the extended Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, passed in 1931, we asked the Minister for money.  We asked him for a quarter of a million pounds, and he refused.  He said: &ldquo;I will give you £50,000, and the rate will be five and a half per cent.&rdquo;  We promptly refused that for two reasons, that £50,000 was hopelessly inadequate, and that the rate of interest was too high.  We then put a loan on the market.  We were getting half a million pounds for ordinary capital works in the city.  We added to that £50,000, and we borrowed that money at £4 8s. 6d. per cent.  We have an anomaly in house building and purchasing around the suburbs of Dublin.  Take Upper Ballymun Road, for example.  One end is in the city, and the other end is in the county.  The Board of Health is working the Small <Col N="1640" /> Dwellings Act, as is the Corporation. A man who wants to buy a house in the county end has to pay the Board of Health five and a half per cent. for the money, plus charges for administration, while the man who buys a house ten yards down the road, within the city portion, can borrow money from the Corporation at £4 8s. 6d. per cent., plus charges of administration.  In the one case you have the credit of the State; in the other case you have the credit of the Government, for the Board of Health cannot float a loan. I am not urging that it should get that power, although some local authorities think they should have it.  It is a matter that does not exactly come into this discussion.  I have an open mind on it, and do not want to interfere. The point is that the Dublin Corporation is able to provide, has provided, and is providing money for house building and house purchase within the City of Dublin cheaper than the Government has provided money for house building and house purchase anywhere.  I am sorry that the benches behind the Minister are so thinned out of all the statesmen and orators who tell us of the thousands of houses the Fianna Fáil Government have built since they came into office.  We heard in the campaign that was carried on of the thousands that were built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking, and I am quite enough here.  I hope that the back benches opposite will get filled up, that my argument will be replied to, and knocked out, if that is possible.  I know the Deputies opposite will not attack it, and that it will not be knocked out because it cannot be.  I am stating facts.  We were told about the thousands of houses that were built since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office.  I want to say that in the City of Dublin they were built on money raised on the credit of the Dublin Corporation on which our Party held a majority.  The Dublin Corporation, by the good administration of our Party, was able to provide money, aye in millions, for house building and house purchase at one per cent. cheaper than the Government were able <Col N="1641" /> to supply money.  Would the Minister tell me if he has given as much as one £5 note to any local authority to operate the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act under 5½ per cent.?  The Dublin Corporation have put up £400,000 at £4 8s. 6d. per cent.?  The housing schemes they are carrying out are financed by money at the same rate within the city, while the agricultural labourer in the county has to pay 5½ per cent. on the money the Minister provides.  If the Dublin Corporation is able to provide money at 4½ per cent., why are the Government not able to do it?  There is no use in telling us that there is any amount of money available for housing unless it is available at the market price, and 5½ per cent. is not the market price now.  No local authority can use that money to carry out large schemes of building without inevitably bankrupting itself if it has to pay 5½ per cent for it.</P>
      <P>If the housing problem, particularly in the rural parts where the local bodies have no power to borrow money in the open market, is to be solved, it can only be solved by the Government putting cheap money at their disposal. I hope the Minister will not reduce&mdash;I am sure he will not&mdash;the amount of money that he proposes to give for housing.  I would be glad to see him increase it.  From my experience of housing administration in the County and City of Dublin, both by the Board of Health and the Corporation, the housing problem cannot be solved, especially in the county, unless money is made available at a cheap rate, and it cannot be made available either under the Labourers Acts or the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts except through the Minister.  It is for the Minister to get the money for the local bodies at a cheap rate and hand it out to every county body to build houses for the workers: to help people who want to build houses for themselves under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, I may say that the only industry that gives any considerable employment at the present time in the City of Dublin is building.  I guarantee that it is giving more employment in Dublin than the 300 odd factories <Col N="1642" /> that we hear so much about from the Front Bench are giving.  These 300 odd factories are like the agricultural markets that the Minister for Agriculture speaks about but will not let us know where they are.  The building of houses is giving more employment in the City of Dublin at the present time than all the new one-horse factories that have been established since the present Government came into power. My colleague, Deputy Minch, has flown.  He wants some of the factories that we have in Dublin brought down to Kildare.  As far as I am aware, if he got a present of the lot of them he would not have much.  There was one big factory near my place&mdash;Gallaher's factory&mdash;but since the present Government came into office it has been closed up.  Deputy Minch had in his own constituency a specimen of one of the factories that we very frequently hear boomed here&mdash;a sausage factory. Well, the Deputy can keep that.  I do not know whether he has it now or not.</P>
    <P>What is keeping the building trade going in Dublin?  The money that is being made available by the Dublin Corporation for housing.  The builders who are giving employment in the building trade in Dublin are known as speculative builders.  They build a few houses and sell as they go on.  If the sale of new houses ceases, then they have to cease work.  They are men of limited capital.  What helps the sale of houses in Dublin is that the Corporation provides 80 per cent. of the purchase price.  That 80 per cent. has been made available by the Corporation floating a loan at £4 8s. 6d. per cent.  There is a charge of 10/- for administration, but there is no charge in the way of a profit.  That is what is keeping building going in Dublin. One per cent. on top of that would stop building in Dublin, and it is I per cent. on top of that that represents. the best the Government can do.  If the Government want to help people who are making a great effort to help themselves in buying their own homes, it would be well, I think, for the Minister to think out a solution by providing cheap money for building, taking perhaps a little more risk than the 80 per cent. in making advances.  I know that <Col N="1643" /> the Act provides for 90 per cent., but the Minister will appreciate the danger of a local authority taking an all-round 90 per cent. risk.  I may inform the Minister that although I am interested in building, as a corporator I opposed going beyond the 80 per cent. margin because I hope to see the Act extensively worked.  If it is extensively worked it might be very serious for the Corporation, as a result of a depression in business or some other cause, to have a lot of house purchasers thrown on its hands, people who were not able to pay their instalments.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should try to devise some means of increasing the percentage and let the State shoulder some risk.  He will appreciate that it would be a very serious matter for a local authority to undertake a bigger risk than the present 80 per cent.  If the Minister could have a scheme that, say, the local authority should have first claim of 80 per cent. and the national authority would take another 10 per cent. or 15 per cent., as a second charge, so to speak, on the property, thereby reducing the money that the house purchaser is to find to about 10 per cent. or 5 per cent., it would be going a long way to solving the housing problem.  I believe such a system operates in the big cities in England. Such a system would solve the housing difficulty for the working classes, too. As the Minister is aware, as an ex-member of the Dublin Corporation, there are people living in houses built by the Dublin Corporation for workers and let at 12/- to 15/- a week.  There are people occupying these houses earning £6, £7, £8 or £9 a week.  If such people were facilitated to purchase their own homes by the State, the local authority advancing between 90 per cent. or 95 per cent. of the actual market value of the houses, they would buy their own houses instead of taking up the houses occupied by the workers.</P>
    <P>There are many other points that I would like to raise, but if I raise too many points I am afraid the Minister will get away and not answer the salient points.  I will just go over them again.  I want to stick him to the <Col N="1644" /> agricultural grant.  I hope he will not fall into the mistake into which he has so often fallen of looking on this as charity.  It is a debt that is owed to the farmers, and if everybody was to pay his debts down in the line of succession this is a debt due by the Minister as successor to the landlords. Of course, I do not mean that personally. I mean it in reference to his office.</P>
    <P>There is another point with which I should like to deal, and that is the question of Irish slates.  I do not suggest that the Minister should relax his efforts in pushing the use of Irish slates and Irish material, but I do want him to consider the case where the producer of the material has not obviously done his part and where the people who wanted to use that material have done all that could reasonably be expected of them.  But they could not use the material because it was not available when wanted.  The Minister has discretionary power in that matter, and I am sure he will use it in the right way.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to tell us whether the Dublin County Council is a legal or illegal body, and whether the other twenty-six county councils are legal or illegal bodies.  Surely the whole twenty-seven county councils cannot be legal if the Dublin County Council is in a different position.  If one is right the others are not.  I hope the Minister will tell us which is which.</P>
    <P>There is another point, and that is in order to facilitate the local authorities both in urban and rural areas, it is up to the Minister, as soon as he possibly can, to provide cheap money on loan to the local authorities.  If the Minister wants his grandiose housing schemes to get beyond the architect's office, or even to get as far as the architect's office, he must deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>The last point is to consider whether the Central Government should not shoulder some of the risk anyway that the local authorities are asked to shoulder under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, and thereby increase the percentage of advance that would be made to house purchasers and consequently <Col N="1645" /> diminish the cash payments required from the house purchasers. The question of building is a question of the builders getting the houses off their hands.  There is no trouble in building your house, but it is hard to get paid for it.  There is no trouble in producing an article of any kind.  The whole trouble is to get a market for it. Anybody who has any business experience knows that.  The Minister can do the whole thing on the lines I have suggested, but the principal point of all is the provision of cheap money. I hope the Minister will refer to that and hold out a substantial hope that cheap money will be made available for local authorities, urban and rural, in the near future.  If he can do that regardless of the number of houses that have been built he will have gone on the right road and the longest possible way that anybody has yet gone towards solving the housing problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (Clare) Mr. P. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might, if he can spare a moment after answering Deputy Belton's questions and problems, devote a minute or two to the few minor points I want to put before him.  I want, in the first instance, to refer to the milk distribution scheme and ask him if he can indicate what machinery he is setting up by which investigations can be conducted and the scheme carried out in a proper fashion.  The sanitary authorities are now, I understand, to be the authorities for distributing milk.  I want to point out that in a lot of cases there is not that machinery necessary for the proper investigation at the disposal of sanitary authorities.  Take an urban district, for instance.  The sanitary authority there has not available the services of the home assistance officer. It has no machinery by which it can say who are entitled to the milk. Under the county sanitary system the home assistance officer is not always the proper officer to administer this. In many cases it will be difficult to make the necessary investigations to see that a proper distribution is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to labourers' cottages, I know that the Minister has got into a good deal of difficulty with reference to Irish material, and I quite see the <Col N="1646" /> point that a good many people were not able to get Irish slates in the building of their houses.  Possibly there will be a difficulty in getting Irish materials for cottages, but there are in many places in the country the kind of material that could be used and that would give employment if it were used in the construction of these labourers' cottages.  For instance, a certain percentage of them might be erected of stone and a certain percentage of them might have their back kitchens flagged instead of having title or cement floors. There are many places where there are flags available by which the kitchen could be stone-flagged.  In my own county there is available a certain quantity of stones that are quarried and ready for use, and I think the Minister ought to indicate to the authorities that these flags should be used in the way I suggest.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that one is boosting one's own district.  One has to boost one's own district, and this is the only way you can get a Government Department to realise that there are opportunities in that district. There are opportunities in Clare at the present time for the production of flag stones.  They are far better flooring than some of the floors I have seen in houses both in urban and rural districts. If you want to have your kitchen clean and kept clean, you have got to brush it, and in brushing it, in the case of a cement floor, you raise dust and you have a bad atmosphere, whereas if you have flags you will not have that difficulty and you will have none of that dust that is so injurious to the membranes of the children in the house.  I know that already the Minister has done something in that direction.  He has done a good deal, I know, with one authority that was likely to do anything in the matter. I would like if he would do more.  I would like if he would get the local authority in the county and some other local authority also to use a percentage of these local materials.  That would get some people employment in the area.  I believe the Minister's intention is to give as much employment as possible.  Where these things are available for building, that is the place to start giving the employment.  Where <Col N="1647" /> grants are made in the matter of erecting county institutions, there ought to be no unnecessary delay in releasing the money and starting the work.  We have a distinct grievance in County Clare.  We have a big unemployment problem, and the Minister should see to it that when grants are available this scheme should be put into operation at once with the object of relieving that unemployment.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to road-making. Road-making is becoming more or less a national concern, and probably that is the correct form it should take.  Most of our county council yards at present resemble a miniature Harland and Wolff's, with machinery of all kinds&mdash;stone crushers and all sorts of things.  Farmers are selling stone walls to county surveyors for the purpose of supplying materials for road-making.  Surely where quarries are available&mdash;and they are available in practically every county&mdash; it ought to be possible for the Minister, when grants are made available for road-making purposes, to insist strongly that the road material should be quarried so as to give more employment. The Minister ought to give attention to these matters.  By so doing he will extend employment, and, in some cases, relieve local rates.  He will, at least, have the people doing something that is reproductive. Finally, I would like to know if there is any information available regarding the probable cost of immunisation. Has the Minister considered the extension of that scheme, and has he considered whether it would repay the cost?  I believe it is necessary at present, and there is a good deal of opinion hardening in the direction that it might be desirable to have the scheme extended.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling. Deputy Belton tells us about the number they are going to build.  He says they will build 900 this year.  Why are they able to build them?  Because this Government has made it a practical proposition to build them; the Government is putting down 60 per cent. of the cost of building them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason why Deputy Belton's Council is building 900 labourers' cottages.  He knows very well that if Cumann na nGaedheal were in power for the next 20 years there would not be a labourer's cottage built in the country.  This is a point I would like to sink home on Deputy Belton.  He came in here wrapped in the cloak of a Party that for the last ten years left plots vacant and left labourers without houses.  He came in here to advocate that policy.  We are building 1,200 labourers' cottages in Cork. We are getting £250,000 for their construction and the Government are contributing £150,000 of that amount.  That is the main reason why we are able to build them.  When Deputy Belton complains about the agricultural grant that is one of the things we should remember.  We lost something between £45,000 and £50,000 in the reduction of the agricultural grant, but we gained £150,000 for the erection of labourers' cottages with the guarantee that if we build 1,200 more cottages next year we will get another grant of £150,000.</P>

If they had been elected as a Government at the last election they would have built  labourers' cottages, and if they were the Government to-day Deputy Belton would be defending their action in building no labourers' cottages and providing no money for housing.  He told us all about the agricultural grant.  He started tracing the history of the million pounds given here, but he knew little about that.  He told us about the Agricultural League, as if anybody in this country takes notice of half the leagues that spring up in Dublin.  These leagues are like snow in the sun, they melt away under its first rays.  I do not know how many leagues Deputy Belton started.</P>

      <P>I would like the Deputy to tell the House the reason why there were 900 labourers' cottages built in County Dublin this year and why none were built for the ten years previously. I know that there are 1,200 built in Cork, and none during the period that Deputy Mulcahy was in office, and I know the reason why.  I know that appeals were made to Deputy Mulcahy when he was in office to give the agricultural labourers some chance to get sanitary houses, and he turned a deaf ear to that appeal, and he also turned a deaf ear to the appeal of the small farmers.  When we made appeals to Deputy Mulcahy, when he was Minister, to give the small farmers some grant to keep the rain from coming down upon them in their hovels, Deputy Mulcahy had a special clause brought in, specially framed, to see that agriculturists, whether farmers or labourers, gained nothing out of the money from the Central Fund here. Deputy Mulcahy took care of that.</P>

It is rather amusing to hear Deputy Mulcahy on wages.  The town of Cobh benefited under Deputy Mulcahy's rule to the extent of £1,000 in five years and that town got £4,500 last winter.  Deputy Mulcahy makes out that the men there were working when he was in office. They were not.  It did not matter then whether a man had been idle for ten years, five years or three years or whether he had a wife and six or seven children or not.  A young jackeen who had come out of the National Army after three months' service was entitled to a preference over a man who had been idle ten, five or three years.  That man might have a wife and five or six children but the preference would go even to an unmarried man.  The men have, at least, fair play now.</P>

      <P>I regret that I was taken as doing that.  I had no intention whatsoever of challenging the ruling of the Chair.  I am sorry I was led away by Deputy Mulcahy's interruptions. Those are the two points with which Deputy Belton dealt.  I am anxious that the Minister should take note of a couple of matters which I shall deal with as quickly as possible.  One is the delay in his Department in issuing sanctions Another is the very great delay in regard to reconstruction grants.  Reconstruction forms are sent up to the Local Government Department and are delayed there for months. Nobody hears anything about them, and an applicant does not know whether he should proceed with the building of his house or not.  There is too much delay in regard to these matters, and it is delay for which nobody can stand.  A man who fills a form of application for a grant for a new house or a grant for reconstruction expects to get word within a couple of months as to whether he can proceed with the work or not.  He should have not to wait until next year or until Tibb's Eve.  We expect that the Local Government Department will not be so lax in future.  If it is, there is only one way of curing it.  That is to hold the Minister here until 11 o'clock on a couple of nights, answering questions on the adjournment.  We hope that we shall not have to adopt that course, and that whatever the cause of the delay is will be rectified.  We do not want to be writing five or six letters. one after the other, to the Local Government Department asking when an applicant's house is going to be inspected, or when he is going to get a grant for building.  A man who is anxious to start building operations in April or May should not be kept waiting until November.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry stated that, under the Cosgrave Government, <Col N="1655" /> there were scarcely any houses built. I should like to tell him that under the Cosgrave Government in 1923&mdash;immediately after the Civil War&mdash;one of the best grants ever given for housing in this country was provided.  That was that for every £100 or £1,000 a local body would subscribe, the Government would give a free grant of double the amount.  If a rate of a shilling in the £ were struck by a county council or urban council for housing, the Government would give a free grant of double the proceeds of that rate.  I happened to be chairman of an urban council at that period, and I should like to tell the Deputy of the co-operation we got from the Party to which he belonged.  A circular was sent out from the Local Government Department, and the advice of the followers of the Deputy's Party was: &ldquo;Throw it in the wastepaper basket; we will not co-operate with those traitors in Merrion Street.&rdquo;  That was the co-operation Deputy Cosgrave got.  As Deputy Belton said, he has done good work in bringing the Deputies opposite in here because now there is decent co-operation.  We will co-operate and help in every way as regards the building of houses.  But to say that no houses were built until the Deputies opposite came in here is a bit of a joke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Local Government is responsible for the supervision of the expenditure of a good deal more money than is shown in this Estimate.  The two big things done by this Government since they came into office in 1932 have been done by this Department&mdash;the passing of the Housing Bill, which came into operation in October, and the passing of the amending Old Age Pensions Act, <Col N="1656" /> which scrapped the red-tape regulations which prevailed under the Minister's predecessor and which prevented many deserving people over 70 years of age from getting what they were entitled to&mdash;the maximum pension allowance of 10/- per week.  I should like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that he has at his disposal in his Department&mdash;a well-organised Department with a very efficient staff &mdash;the necessary number to enable him sympathetically to administer the Housing Act and the Old Age Pensions Act.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Belton encouraging the Minister to go ahead with the policy enshrined in the Housing Act of 1932.  I am certain that if he had been ten years a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party he would not have criticised the Minister in the language he did this evening.  At all events, before attempting to do so, he would have looked up the housing record of the Cumann na nGaedheal Ministry and compared it, if he were able to get the figures, with the record of this Ministry since they came into office in 1932.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had been continuously a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party for ten years he would have hesitated before he criticised the Minister for failing to take advantage of all the opportunities for house building.  You can pass the best measures possible, but if not sympathetically administered they prove useless to the people whom they were intended to benefit.  I have only a limited experience&mdash;the same perhaps as any other active Deputy in the House&mdash;in answering communications addressed to me in connection with applications for grants under the housing scheme, but there has been an increase in such applications, and also a very large increase in the number of applications for pensions under the Old Age Pensions Act.  There is a certain amount of delay in dealing with these applications which, I think, is <Col N="1657" /> due to the fact that the sections of the Department concerned with the administration of these two Acts have not at their disposal the necessary number of staff to do the work of dealing with the applications within the time in which it should be done.  If that is the case, I think the Minister should give an assurance to the House that any further staff that may be necessary will be forthcoming in so far as these Acts should be administered in a proper and sympathetic spirit.</P>
      <P>Grants are available for the carrying out of public health works to a greater extent, I am glad to say, under the Fianna Fáil Government than they were available under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  I should like to ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he could say, when he is replying, what is the amount that will be made available out of the Relief Vote, passed by the Dáil last week, in order to enable local authorities to undertake the carrying out of sewerage and waterworks schemes.  I understand that the Minister has promised that he would allocate a higher percentage for the carrying out of such works than his predecessor allocated.  Could the Minister indicate what is the minimum percentage allowed to local authorities for the carrying out of public health works and also what is the maximum, if there is a maximum, in connection with applications of that kind?  I am aware that a number of such schemes are under the consideration and have been for some time past under the consideration of the Minister's Department. Now that the Vote for the relief of unemployment was passed last week, I hope no further unnecessary delay will take place on the part of the Minister's Department in conveying this information to the boards of health, who can undertake this kind of work better at this time of year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's Department is responsible for the setting up of two Commissions since the Minister came into office.  The purpose of one of these Commissions was to inquire into the conditions under which it might be possible for agricultural labourers, living in labourers' cottages, to purchase their houses.  I should like to <Col N="1658" /> know from the Minister what is the cause of the delay in publishing the report of this Commission which, I understand, was submitted some time ago to the Minister's Department for that purpose.  The reason I ask is that during the course of the last general election it was stated in a paper, which has the ear of the Minister, that an Interim Report had been submitted.  As a result of that report, certain suggestions were thrown out in the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; as to what was likely to be done by the Government following the recommendations contained in the Interim Report.  Now that we know the Final Report has been submitted to the Minister some time ago, I think Deputies are entitled to have it circulated at the earliest possible date. Perhaps the Minister will say in his reply when it is intended to circulate the report and when the Government expect to put the policy, recommended in the report, into operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for the setting up of another, and, perhaps, equally, if not more, important Commission; namely, a Commission for the purpose of drafting a scheme or schemes for the provision of pensions for widows and orphans.  Again, I am informed that the report of that Commission is in the hands of the Minister's Department and has been for some time.  The members of this Party and, I am sure, the members of all Parties in the House, as well as the people in the country, who were promised a scheme of this kind by the Minister for Finance, would like to have access to the recommendations of that very important body at the earliest possible date.  I notice that the small amount set aside for the travelling expenses of the Housing Board is much less this year than the amount which was provided last year. Am I to understand that it is not the intention of the Minister or his Department to allow the Housing Board to go around as and when required, or what is the meaning of the reduction in the very small amount allocated for that body this year as compared with last year?  I think it is very desirable that the members of this very important body should go where <Col N="1659" /> and when possible and meet the boards of health as a body and give them whatever information they have at their disposal in order to expedite the operation of housing schemes on a more extensive scale than up to the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The boards of health know more about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not admit that. Deputy Belton, of course, is a member of what he, no doubt, regards as the most important board in the country.  I am satisfied that the Housing Board, as a result of their access to Departmental records, have information at their disposal which would be very useful to members of a board of health, and I hold the view&mdash; I may not be correct in it, but I think I am&mdash;that the presence of members of the Housing Board at meetings of the boards of health would give far greater encouragement to these bodies to go ahead than perhaps the presence of a minor official of the Minister's own Department.  With regard to the housing policy of the Minister, in so far as it concerns the provision of material to be used in the erection of houses&mdash;I know that I may be speaking as a voice in the wilderness in making the suggestion&mdash;I think that encouragement should be given, where possible and where the material is available, to local bodies to build houses of brick rather than of cement.  There is one urban council in my constituency, the most progressive council in the locality, which always insists when inviting tenders for houses that they should be of brick or stone.  I think the Minister may know that that particular body has built houses of brick which has been got from a local brickyard.  The cost of the erection of the houses by brick is not any greater than it would be to build the same houses with cement, and the result is that in this year it has led to the opening of an old brickyard and given a lot of employment.  There are four or five brickyards in my constituency, and I think it would be advisable that the Minister at least should not discourage any such cases where the local body can get material within a reasonable <Col N="1660" /> radius and at the same cost as cement or stone.  I am not an expert on the question of house building, but I have heard some very prominent medical men, who are members of this House, say that a house built of brick has a longer life and is healthier to live in than one built with cement blocks and things of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter that it is desirable I should bring under the notice of the Minister and, particularly, under the notice of his Parliamentary Secretary who has been dealing with this particular matter. There has been a dispute going on in the County Offaly for the past four years as to the site upon which a local county hospital should be erected. For the past one and a half years, however, the question at issue is the simple one as to whether it should be built in this field or that field.  I have reason to believe that the Parliamentary Secretary has made a very careful study of this question and I believe he has seen deputations representing the board of health, or different sections of the board at least two or three times in connection with the issue in dispute.  The matter I am concerned with is the necessity for the erection of a proper county hospital when the money is available and also for the erection of suitable district hospital accommodation in the same county.  The people who are looking for and entitled to have modern hospital accommodation are not concerned as to whether the hospital will be erected in this field or that field. This particular county board of health is involved in the payment of heavy charges for people who have to be sent to Dublin for treatment as a result of the failure of the local authority to agree to the scheme for the expenditure of this money.  The money is there.  The sick poor are entitled to the accommodation.  The workers who are looking for work are <Col N="1661" /> entitled to the work and no better work could be undertaken.  I, therefore, suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, and it is the view of the majority of the local people, that having studied all the facts and figures, and having the expert knowledge which he undoubtedly has as a medical officer, he should take such action without further delay as will enable that very necessary work to be started without any further squabbling between the different sections of the board of health as to whether the hospital, which is so urgently necessary, will be built in this field or that field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been very little criticism levelled against the Minister or his Department.  I am not going to offer any criticism, because the Minister, since he came into office, has done a good deal by way of helping with housing, and he has been ably assisted by his very efficient staff. There is, however, a matter to which I should like to refer, which has been already dealt with by Deputy Davin, and that is in connection with bricks. We, in Dundalk, are very near the Border.  Unfortunately, at the moment there are no bricks manufactured locally, although some years ago bricks of a very fine quality were manufactured there and at an economic price, which is the main factor with regard to bricks.  At the same time, in Northern Ireland there are many brickyards at present manufacturing large quantities of bricks of good quality&mdash;ordinary stock bricks&mdash;which could be delivered in Dundalk and towns immediately adjoining the Border at a price varying from 63/- to 70/- per thousand.  The price asked for ordinary stock bricks manufactured in the Free State, as far as my information goes, is in the neighbourhood of £5 per thousand.  Even allowing that the average price of Northern Ireland bricks is 70/- per thousand, there is a difference of 30/- per thousand between that and the price of bricks manufactured in the Free State.  That difference of from 30/- to £2 in the price would mean for an ordinary house, which would take 15,000 to 20,000 bricks to erect, that <Col N="1662" /> there would be an increased charge for rent, if such a house were rented by a public authority, of anything from 1/6 to 2/- per week, which is a very important factor when one considers the capacity of people to pay high rents at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the other point of view which I should like to put before the Minister, and that is the very large number of craftsmen who have followed the trades of bricklayers and stone masons.  It is a very ancient craft. The craftsmen engaged in this trade have been responsible all down through the ages for erecting great buildings in different countries, buildings which have excited the admiration not only of the people who lived in these particular countries but also of the people who happened to visit them.  If this system of forcing people to use cement as the chief commodity in the erection of the houses as against brick or stone is persisted in, there is a great danger that in a few years we shall have no bricklayers or stone masons in the country at all.  Again, as Deputy Davin pointed out, there is a very serious difference of opinion not alone amongst architects and engineers, but also amongst medical men, as to the relative value of cement houses and brick houses.  The general opinion amongst the ordinary public is that a brick house is much drier than a concrete house.  Anyone who has any experience of building knows that it is very difficult to make a flat roof of cement waterproof.  If you walk along the streets on an ordinary damp day, even when it is not raining, you will notice a sort of sweat appearing on footpaths made of cement.  That also occurs in kitchen floors made of cement. You can visualise what it means to little children coming down on a cold winter's morning to a kitchen with a cement floor.  According to medical testimony, it has been the cause perhaps of a great increase in that terrible disease, tuberculosis.  I would impress upon the Minister the advisability, if it is at all possible, of allowing public authorities to erect brick houses when they are willing to do so. The difference in the cost of erection of a brick house and a house built of solid concrete or concrete blocks, say, 4½ by <Col N="1663" /> 4½, with a cavity between, is very slight.  The difference in the cost would be from £10 to £15, and I know from experience that, as far as the people of Dundalk are concerned, they are prepared to pay 6d. a week extra for brick houses as against concrete ones.  I know that the Minister's policy, representing that of the Government, is &ldquo;all out&rdquo; for increasing industries in the Free State, a policy with which, to a certain extent, I agree, still, in connection with house building the Minister might, without militating against the manufacture of bricks in other parts of the Saorstát, allow a certain quantity to be imported from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The same argument holds regarding the prices of other commodities used in the erection of houses.  I am bringing these facts before the Minister, because I know that he is doing all he possibly can to have houses provided as cheaply as possible, in order that the rents may be low.  Sometimes, I think, he does not get that co-operation that he should get from all concerned in the building of houses.  It is with a view to assisting him that I suggest it would be no harm if he, or some of his officials, gave some attention to the great difference that exists between the cost of timber in Northern Ireland and in the Free State.  As regards mouldings, floorings, scantlings, and timber used in the manufacture of windows and doors, the difference in cost is enormous.  It is possible to import timber for these articles from Northern Ireland, and to pay the duty, and to have it cheaper than it can be got in the City of Dublin, or in any other city in the Free State.  The same may be said about slates.  It is well known to everyone who reads the newspapers, and who takes an interest in local affairs, that as regards the supply of Irish slates, the thing is a joke.  Where orders were given to Irish quarries six or eight months ago, there is no hope, even to-day, that they will be fulfilled.  I am not decrying the work of the Irish quarries. I know that they have been inundated with orders from all parts of the country, and that it is impossible for <Col N="1664" /> them to meet the demand.  That being so, the Minister there, as in the case of bricks, should consider the question of allowing a certain quantity of slates to be imported, so as to enable builders, or private individuals, whose operations are being kept back on that account, to proceed with their work.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has experience of the building trade knows that any little delay means more cost in the erection of houses.  Once a builder starts with his work he likes to have the stuff coming along in rotation, because delay means that the work is going to cost him more, and incidentally the person for whom the house is being provided. I hope the Minister will give these matters serious consideration, especially in the case of bricks and slates.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said regarding the erection of cottages.  I am not going to dwell on that now, except to say, in answer to Deputy Corry, that I would like to see the rate of interest as low as possible.  It is not easy sometimes to secure that.  The Minister has to borrow the money, and sometimes he has to pay a rate of interest much higher than he would like to pay.  I cannot see much hope of a reduction in interest charges at present unless, in the near future, it is possible to float a loan, which would enable local bodies to reduce interest charges by one per cent. or two per cent.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputies who made a comparison between the number of cottages built by the late Government and by the present Government, I would remind them that some years ago, when the late Government was in office, it was much more difficult to build houses than it is now, even though it is difficult now.  The rate of interest some years ago was much higher, and the cost of building was higher than it is now.  I would go as far as to say that if houses had been erected on a large scale some years ago an intolerable burden would have been placed on the finances of the State, as well as on the people for whom the houses were built, in the form of higher rents.  When making a <Col N="1665" /> comparison of the houses built by the present Government and by the late Government many circumstances have to be taken into consideration.  I take the view that all Governments would like to build as many houses as possible, because they know very well that good houses are essential for the welfare of the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that numbers of tenants of houses built by public bodies would like to purchase their houses.  It seems that under the last Housing Act passed by the Government urban councils are precluded from selling the houses to the tenants. As these bodies were empowered to do so in previous Housing Acts, a certain amount of dissatisfaction exists.  I know that to be the case in Dundalk. The Minister was in that town lately opening new houses&mdash;I am sure he was pleased with his visit, as we all were&mdash; and I think one of the matters referred to was the question of the purchase of the houses by tenants.  As far as I know the tenants are anxious to purchase in the same way as the tenants who occupy houses erected under previous Acts.  As ownership creates a spirit of civic responsibility, it would be appreciated if it was at all possible for the Minister by order to allow urban authorities to sell these houses.  It would relieve local bodies, such as urban councils, from a heavy item of annual expenditure on repairs. If a person knows that his house will be his own he will take greater interest in it, and will carry out certain repairs at much less cost than they could be carried out by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Some confusion exists as to whether persons who are not drawing home assistance at present will be entitled to a supply of free milk under the milk scheme.  I do not know if the Minister for Finance has decided that question. I do not think the Minister has made any regulation as to whether persons who are not receiving home assistance are entitled to free milk.  I know that next September the carrying out of the scheme will be entrusted to the authorities in the urban areas, and that other changes will be made.  Pending that, I would like the Minister to let the House know what is the exact procedure <Col N="1666" /> regarding the distribution of milk.</P>
    <P>I have not very much more to say except to mention, in reply to Deputy Davin, that I do not think that a housing board would be of much assistance to public bodies.  I think that public bodies will be able to carry on very well.  The only thing that I can see that militates against housing at the moment is the cost, and there, again, I would like to see a little more co-operation in endeavouring to reduce the cost of building.  That seems to be a point that is not adverted to by very many people.  It might be a rather unpopular point, but it does seem strange that the cost of house building to-day should be three times what it was in pre-war days.  What the cause is I do not know.  I know that the State is doing all it possibly can, and I think that there should be some reduction in the cost of building.  It would be to the interest of all concerned and might make for more continuity.  It would also, amongst other things, mean more constant employment and more houses.  The Government has done its part and I think the general public should do a little as well in order to help this very worthy object of the provision of houses for the people.  I hope the Minister will do all he can to meet the points I have raised, especially in regard to the imports of bricks and slates.  They are two very important things in connection with the erection of houses.  Bricks and slates are two building commodities, at the moment, which are agitating the minds of those engaged in house building in the towns situated along the border, and I hope the Minister will give that matter favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>A great variety of matters has been dealt with in the course of this debate.  I do not know whether I am expected to go, in detail, into every one, but I will try to cover as many of them as I can.  First, with regard to the question of housing, it is undeniable that there are a great many more houses being built, especially by local authorities now than hitherto, and my ambition is to see more built.  I think I can say for the Government <Col N="1667" /> that, whatever money is required to finance, under present laws and regulations, the building of houses will be forthcoming for local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Several Deputies have mentioned the subject of the material used in houses that have been built or that are being built.  We have no idea at all of prohibiting anybody who is getting a grant from us, or whose house is being financed out of Government, or local funds, from building it of brick, stone or cement.  We make no regulations on the matter except one and that is, that the cost of the house must be reasonable.  If a local authority desires to build in brick, and if it can produce a house that compares reasonably in cost with the cost of the house of cement&mdash;whole cement or cement blocks&mdash;we will not put any obstacle in the way of such a local authority or individual.  The same is true with regard to stone and there have been, in the last year, housing schemes&mdash;I cannot say how many&mdash;in which brick was entirely used and there have been one or two cases in which stone was used&mdash;so far as I remember, in West Cork.  It is all a question of finance.  We are anxious to have houses built and the more houses, as I said already, that are built, the better we will be pleased, but, if the cost is going to go up by £15, £20 or £30 a house, as it might in some cases, in building in brick or in stone, it becomes a serious consideration where you have to build a large number of houses and where you have thousands of people clamouring for houses.  I think Deputies have read, as I read, of a meeting held in Cork, within the last few days, at which a couple of hundred houses were available and a thousand people were clamouring for them.  So long as there is such a terrible dearth of housing accommodation and money is not very flush, even with the Government, we have to measure out our money and scrutinise every penny to get the best value we can and build the greatest <Col N="1668" /> number of efficient and proper houses. Remember, also, that the rents that people have to pay for these houses is a serious consideration.  Every £10 added to the cost of a house is a serious consideration in the rent.</P>
      <P>Bearing these considerations in mind as to the cost and the rent, I should like again to impress on the House that we have no desire to hinder anybody in building of any building material he wishes, provided he turns out a reasonable house, according to the plans and specifications approved of, and at a cost that will bear comparison with other types of houses. Deputies have mentioned the subject of the cost of money.  That is a subject that gives us a great deal of reason for thought and consideration.  Money has been dear&mdash;money for local authorities, for housing purposes and for public health purposes&mdash;but, unfortunately, the money that is now being given out on loan to local authorities by the Government, through the Minister for Finance, has had to be borrowed, as Deputy Coburn rightly said, at a high rate of interest.  I do very sincerely hope from my own particular point of view, and from the Departmental point of view, particularly with regard to housing and public health schemes, that when the next loan comes to be floated by the Government&mdash;I do not know when that will be but the Minister for Finance might be able to tell us&mdash;the money will not have to be borrowed at a high rate.  Deputy Belton says that the money market is cheaper now and I believe, or, at, least, we are told, that he is a great authority on finance.  He says that money can be got at charges two per cent. cheaper now that it could be got a year or two ago.  I hope that will turn out to be true.</P>

      <P>If it is true, it will certainly have a very beneficial effect on housing in the country and in stimulating public authorities to build more houses and to go in more for public health works as we would like to see them doing.  It is not true to say that the high rate of interest is responsible <Col N="1669" /> for housing being uneconomic.  If there were no such interest at all to be paid on the money loaned for housing, housing for the working classes, for the poorer classes, would still be an uneconomic proposition for local authorities and for the Government in these days.  Take an example.</P>

      <P>In respect of a house costing £500 on which no interest has to be paid, the repayment of the principal per annum of a loan for 35 years will cost £14 5/- per year.  Repairs will cost £2&mdash;that is a very low figure&mdash; insurance 4/6, rent collection and other minor charges, say, 15/6 per year.  That gives a total of £17 5/- per year or 6/9 a week for rent.  The poor people in Dublin, the working classes who are getting houses to rent, are not able to pay 6/9 and the local authority and the Government have to come in with subsidies.</P>

      <P>I stand by them and the Deputy will have plenty of opportunities of correcting them if he is able to do so.  We are quite anxious to get cheap money, as anxious as the Deputy is.  I am sure he is anxious. He is building houses.  I do not know, but let us say he is financing them out of loans.  He may have to borrow money.  I am not suggesting he has not enough capital, but let us say he has to borrow money.  The money market, being as it is, has naturally a very important bearing on the number of houses he can build and even perhaps on the quality of the houses he is building.  It has certainly a very important bearing for the people who will occupy these houses when the houses are there.  I do hope that in the course of the next year there will be a considerable drop in interest rates. As the Deputy reminded us, money has been got in the City of Dublin and <Col N="1670" /> in Cork within the last couple of months at much cheaper rates.  Not lately, perhaps, but within the last six or eight months, in Dublin money has been got at a cheaper rate than for a number of years.  If the present economic conditions continue it is quite possible that the rate of interest on loans may be still lower by the time large loans come to be floated next year.  If so we shall all benefit.  The people, especially the poor people with whom we have to deal, in housing will, let us hope, benefit most.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy was interested in the improvement of county homes, the buildings, at present, he says being cheerless and desolate.  We are very much interested in the same subject. We should like to see better types of buildings, better accommodation inside the buildings, and better equipment&mdash; equipment of a brighter kind and not the old-fashioned workhouse appear ance that so many of our county homes even now have.  An effort has been already made in County Cork to introduce a new treatment for these aged and infirm people who are usually the inhabitants of the county home, and we are watching the developments of that with great interest.  We are hoping that the example given in the Nazareth Home near Mallow will be such as to induce other local authorities to improve the surroundings as far as county homes are concerned, and perhaps to model themselves on the excellent example given by the Nazareth nuns in the home of which I have spoken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the question of housing, several Deputies mentioned the delay in the giving of grants for reconstruction and grants to private individuals for the building of new houses.  When the present Housing Act came into operation late in the autumn of last year, we were absolutely flooded with applications from private individuals for grants.  Probably 100,000 forms were sent out to people who applied for them to make applications for reconstruction grants and other grants.  It was certain then that we had not a staff big enough to deal as rapidly as we should like with these applications, with the inspection of sites and other matters to which it is <Col N="1671" /> necessary to attend, so that these grants could be made available quickly. Since the Act came into operation we have very largely increased the staff. Even inside the last month, six new temporary inspectors have been put on to speed up the work of reconstruction inspection.</P>
    <P>I believe Deputies will find that, as time goes on, there will be, as there has been already to a certain extent, a considerable speeding up of the work of inspection both in the case of reconstruction and other housing grants. Some Deputy complained of delay at Local Government headquarters, in the giving of sanctions to plans.  There again we have had a considerable increase of work, but I do say that no unnecessary delay has arisen in the Housing Department with regard to the sanction of plans and schemes of housing.  Where there has been delay, if the matter is enquired into, it will be seen that the delay has very frequently arisen from bad handling.  I know cases in which plans have to be sent back to architects and engineers as frequently as half a dozen times.  That, of course, caused delay.  If officials of local authorities would be more careful in drafting their plans and in seeing that these plans comply with the regulations, there would certainly be less unnecessary delay on all sides in getting the work in hands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy, as did some other Deputies also, spoke of delays in regard to old age pensions claims.  There again I have to make the same explanation for delay.  Last year when the Old Age Pensions Bill was passed it meant that probably an additional 10,000 claims came into the Department. There are at present, I think, something between 8,000 and 9,000 cases of appeals awaiting hearing.  We are getting through them as rapidly as we can.  It has happened before, as it happened this year as the result of the passing of the new legislation, that a modification or an amendment of the law brings people to raise cases that have been decided before, or cases that have been dealt with already.  In any case a great many claims, some old cases, some new cases&mdash;people who <Col N="1672" /> would not ordinarily have been entitled to an old age pension or who would now, because of the amending of the law, become entitled to a pension at a greater rate&mdash;have been made and these claims are being examined.  That necessarily means delay.  You cannot always rush in and increase your staff or you cannot always get people who are technically qualified to deal with matters of that kind in a hurry.  If you do increase your staff, at the end of the year, when you have disposed of the large number of claims on hand, you have got a staff of hands for whom you have no work.  We have to bear all these factors in mind.  The appeals are being examined as rapidly as possible and there will be no unnecessary delay in dealing with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell asked about the Town Planning Bill, a subject that has been very frequently mentioned here since I came into the House.  On many occasions I asked questions myself as to when the Town Planning Bill would be introduced.  I have to say that I hope to be able to introduce it for First Reading before the adjournment, and I trust the House will not be disappointed once more.</P>

      <P>Wait until you see this Bill.  A good deal has been said on the subject of slates.  Slates have given us a lot of trouble since the 1932 Housing Act was passed.  I think it would be the wish of the House that we should, as far as possible, push Irish manufacture, and see that our houses are built of Irish material.  We are trying to do that as far as we can, but we are certainly hampered in so far as slates are concerned.  The output is not at all commensurate with the demand.  Wherever it has been proved to us that people have tried to get Irish-made roofing material, and have not been successful, we have&mdash;unwillingly, but we had to do it&mdash;issued permits to those people to get material made elsewhere than in the Irish Free State.  The full output from all the slate quarries is being used up.  We have asked the Minister for Industry <Col N="1673" /> and Commerce to look into the matter and see how slate production can be increased and speeded up.  We know that the matter has been under examination over a number of months, but so far, strange to say, although there is a fine field for investment of capital in slate quarries, there has not been the activity by our capitalists or investors that we should like to see.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nally complained of delays in public health schemes in his area. In particular, he mentioned the Claremorris sewerage scheme.  I understand that the Department is not at all responsible for the delay that the Deputy referred to there.  Certain plans were sent up to the Department and could not be approved of.  That fact was made known long ago to the local authority concerned, and they were asked to send up amended plans that would harmonise with the general sewerage requirements of the town. The Department is still awaiting the submission of those plans.  As soon as we get them they will be rapidly dealt with, and, if they are suitable, approval and sanction will be sent on to Claremorris.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony referred the other night to the subject of sewerage in Blarney.  The Department are waiting for the Cork Board of Health to make up their minds on that scheme.  As soon as the local authority has made up its mind on the matter&mdash;there seems to be some difference of opinion locally&mdash; the Department will lose no time in doing its share to help along that public health project, as all other public health projects, as far as money is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coburn and some other Deputies were interested in the milk distribution scheme.  The Deputy is aware that last year, and up to 1st October, the scheme is that the milk be given to the children of families on home assistance in each area.  The experience gained in the last year has shown that that, perhaps, was not the best possible way of distribution, and that people who would not like to ask for home assistance but who would be entitled to and could make very beneficial use of the milk for their children were excluded.  We have decided to <Col N="1674" /> recast this scheme, and after 1st October the distribution of the milk will be in the hands of the local sanitary authority.  Where there are county medical officers of health the organisation will, I believe, be easily attended to.  It will not be so easy and will involve much more patience, trouble and attention in the counties where there are no medical officers of health. There, too, the new organisation will be set up, we believe, and will be in good working order by 1st October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly. Deputy Hogan mentioned a matter of particular interest to his own neighbourhood, and perhaps of interest in other places, the question of the use of fiagstones.  I have been hearing a good deal about those same flagstones since I came into office.  I have had I do not know how many letters from Deputies for the County Clare and other individuals impressing upon me the beauty and utility of the County Clare flagstones. We know that they are very useful, and certainly have been in times gone by used to a very considerable extent for flagging the City of Dublin. They are not so used now to any great extent I believe.  I think the Deputy is aware that we did call the attention of local authorities in Clare and surrounding counties to the value of those flagstones, and as opportunity arises we will perhaps be able to do the same again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have covered fairly well all the points that were made.  Deputy Coburn mentioned one point on the subject of the sale of the houses built by local authorities, to the tenants. There are difficulties there, where the houses are the subject of a very heavy subsidy by the local authority.  If the Government gives 66 per cent. of the loan, and perhaps the local authority subsidises in its own way, it would hardly be right&mdash;especially when our urgent desire at present is to build houses for the lowest paid workers, and for the really uneconomic people&mdash; to sell those houses to people who would have money to buy them.  Our <Col N="1675" /> anxiety at present is to build houses for the people who cannot do anything for themselves in the way of provision of money.  The Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act we do hope will be used for the provision of houses for the type of people who are able to buy their own homes.  Deputy Belton asked the Government to increase their own responsibility in so far as the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act is concerned.  I do not think the Government are called upon to do any more than they have done in that way, except in so far as it may be possible, at a future date, to provide cheaper money.  The last Act that was passed enabled the local authorities to give up to £1,000 on loan to help individuals to build their own houses, and to give them up to 90 per cent. of the value of the houses.  I think beyond that it would not be fair to expect either the Government or the local authority to go.  The local authorities have not, as a rule, taken full advantage of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act in giving up to the full 90 per cent. to the borrowers.  But that is a matter for the local authorities.  We would not like to interfere with them in their discretion as to how much they should give to their own citizens, but I would urge again on local authorities that have the power to do so, but have not yet adopted the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, that it would be a good and wise thing for them to use the Act and put it into operation: to use the laws that are available to scatter that money amongst their own people and encourage them to build and own their own houses.  As Deputy Coburn and other Deputies said, the greater the number of citizens who own their own houses the better the civic spirit will be, and the better and healthier their own homes will be, too, I believe.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say if in the near future he can promise that there would be any reduction in the interest charged on loans to local authorities for doing sewerage and waterworks schemes?  As I pointed out on previous occasions on this Vote, a great deal more work could be done by local authorities so far as such schemes are concerned if a lower rate of interest had to be paid on loans obtained from the Local Loans Fund.  I would like to know from the Minister if he can hold out any hope to local authorities that, say, before the end of the year he will be in a position to have a lower rate of interest charged on such loans.  I think the Minister will agree that more work of this nature, work of a very valuable kind that contributes directly to the health of the people, would be done if a lower rate of interest were charged on the loans, and that a great many more local authorities would take advantage of the facilities provided under the Local Loans Fund.</P>

      <P>I would like to have some information from the Minister with regard to this Vote in view of the proposals in Sections 12 and 13 of the Land Bill circulated to-day.  Under these two sections a certain amount of arrears under the Land Acts is to be liquidated.  We know that up to this when people who had purchased their lands were not <Col N="1680" /> prompt in meeting the payment of their annuities to the Land Commission the sum represented by their default was deducted from the grants made to the local authorities.  Now under the Land Bill certain of these arrears are to be cancelled.  I want to know from the Minister if a sum representing the amount of the cancelled arrears will be made good to the local authorities? The position with regard to loans advanced by the Board of Works to farmers also comes under the new Land Bill.  I want to know if in the case of current loans the interest charged is in accordance with the price of money to-day, or is it being maintained at what was the standard rate when the loans were made?  Owing to the high cost of money over the last fifteen years, numbers of farmers throughout the country have been held up, in fact one might say prohibited from carrying out improvements on their holdings, such as the erection of fences and out-offices. I would like to know from the Minister whether or not money is being advanced now at the current rate of interest or at the rate that prevailed during the inflation period?</P>

      <P>I did not quite get Deputy MacMenamin's references to Section 13 of the new Land Bill but, in regard to the point which has been raised by Deputy Corish, I should like to say that I feel that, possibly, it would be beneficial, as I have already indicated in the course of the Budget statement of last year, that the interest chargeable upon local loans should be reduced.  I say that for the reason that I think it would be possible in that way to stimulate local authorities to carry out public works of a nature which, otherwise, they might not be inclined to undertake.  Unfortunately, an examination of the position of the local loans has shown that the case is a much more complex one than might appear at first sight; because, obviously if there were to be any departure from the principle which hitherto has been followed in regard to this matter, and if loans were to be made available from this fund at anything less than the rate of <Col N="1681" /> interest which the Government itself would have to pay for this long-term borrowing we would have to consider not merely new applications for advances from that fund but also advances which have already been made, and considerable readjustments would have to be made in regard to the repayment of moneys already advanced.  Apart altogether from the fact that the Government has not yet floated a long-term loan on its own account, I have been unable to determine what would be, in the present circumstances, the cost and what would be an equitable charge for borrowings from the Local Loans Fund.  As moneys which hitherto have been borrowed from the account of that Fund have been borrowed at from 4½ to 5 per cent., I have been compelled to charge, so long as advances have been made out of these loans, rates which would be related to them. When, however, it becomes necessary for us to go to the public again for another loan, and if we are able to raise that loan on the very favourable terms which I now anticipate we shall be able to secure the money, I will look into the whole matter again and see whether adjustments cannot be made in accordance with the terms of the statement I made on the Budget in 1932.  With regard to Section 13 I did not quite get Deputy MacMenamin's point.  Perhaps he would make it again.</P>

      <P>The point is that under Section 12 of the Bill all arrears in excess of three years are going to be liquidated altogether, to be forgiven. They are to be forgiven with regard to the general Land Acts. Under Section 13, with regard to the purchase annuities payable to the Commissioners of Public Works, a similar provision applies.  Moneys have been retained from the Agricultural Grant representing those arrears under these two Sections 12 and 13.  Now I want to ask the Minister will these moneys that have been retained, or that will be retained when this Bill becomes law, be put to the credit of the local authorities?</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any reply to the representations made recently by local authorities that they should get some relief in the payment of loans which they had contracted with the British Government to pay? They claim that they are entitled to relief just as much as the rural authorities and they ought to get a reduction the same as the land annuitants are getting.  Some of us are getting resolutions from them every day.  All the urban local authorities in my constituency are making representations.  I should like if the Minister would state what are the intentions of the Government and whether it is their intention to give relief to the urban authorities?  These loans were made by the British Government and the urban authorities think that when the loans are being collected from them and not sent over to the British Government they are entitled to some relief.  I should like to know whether the Minister is going to give them any relief?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to challenge the ruling of the Chair at all, but may I ask, with all possible respect, whether any rule of procedure has been rigidly enforced in regard to a Minister concluding a debate in Committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>During the consideration of Estimates, which are discussed in Committee on Finance, there is no definite rule of procedure that the Minister should conclude, but, on looking through the records of eight years, I found only one instance in which the Minister did not conclude when called upon to do so. Although the House is in Committee, some finality is required in the matter and I definitely called on the Minister to conclude on this occasion as no Deputy offered to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that the questions now arising are questions arising out of the Minister's answer and it is customary when a Minister has concluded on an Estimate to have questions raised on the details of the Estimate.  As a rule what happens is that the general question of the Estimate is first debated and after that there is more or less a desultory debate on details, even after the Minister has concluded.  If I may say so, that has been the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to upset, or even to attempt to upset, the practice which has been declared by the Chair.  If I may say so, I think it is quite right.  But when there is no evident desire to prolong a debate unnecessarily, and when the members of the House, following a Minister's speech, wish to ask certain question, or, if necessary, to make a short statement, I think that has always been allowed unless the Chair saw quite clearly that there was a desire to obstruct or unnecessarily continue the <Col N="1685" /> debate.  I do not think there is any evidence of that in this instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>Anyway, this is a matter that I can easily raise again on the Appropriation Bill.  As a matter of fact, I am giving notice to the Minister now that I will raise it again on the Appropriation Bill; but so that the Minister may be better advised as to how to answer, I am afraid I shall have to put the point now.  The Minister, in the course of his Budget speech last year, said that the question as to whether local loans moneys should be funded or not was a matter for argument. He did say, with regard to his own proposals, that it was not proposed to continue the old practice of charging a remunerative rate, and under these circumstances he thought local loans moneys should be met out of Revenue. We are not now meeting local loans moneys out of Revenue; we are going to borrow.  Therefore, I assume from his own statement of last year and the correct finance he prided himself on <Col N="1686" /> that there is going to be charged this year the full remunerative rate to county councils.  That question has not been precisely answered, even to Deputy Corish.  I am asking it now and I intend to press for a reply on the Appropriation Bill.</P>

      <P>It is quite appropriate to raise the matter here.  This particular Committee was appointed in April, 1932, to inquire into and report as to a scheme of widows' and orphans' pensions and the probable cost of such a scheme.  I suppose the Minister will give silence as his best answer if we ask where is the report of the Committee, where is the scheme, and where is the provision for the widows and orphans over whom the Minister used to mourn so much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like brawling from so well-behaved, or at least so well-brought-up a Minister as the Minister is.  The Committee of Inquiry into Civil Service was appointed in June, 1932, to inquire into and report <Col N="1688" /> on the organisation of the Civil Service with special reference to the arrangements for ensuring efficiency in working; the general standard of remuneration of civil servants; the age of retirement from the service; and the methods by which arbitration can best be applied for the settlement of questions relating to pay and other conditions of service.  The Minister told us on the &ldquo;Cuts&rdquo; Bill that he had four reports from four different Commissions set up to inquire into Civil Service matters.  He has kept them all to himself.  We have not got a hint of what the reports contain or what aid they give to the Minister in coming to conclusions.</P>
      <P>I would like to recall his mind to the speech he made in 1929 to which I referred him to-day.  In it he said he thought there should be big administrative economies and not &ldquo;a mere skimming of the surface, taking only the scum of waste.&rdquo;  His best efforts so far have not been productive of very great economies.  Why can he not do something that will bring us in a million? I will remind him again of his election promises.  In the advertisement which got him his position in the present Government there were various promises.  &ldquo;Here is what a Fianna Fáil Government can and will do for you.&rdquo;  In relation particularly to the Civil Service we had a definite promise.</P>
