      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether in view of his declaration of policy on April 23rd at Arbour Hill he will inform the Dáil what forms and symbols now existing in or arising out of the Constitution are regarded by the Executive Council as inconsistent with Ireland's right as a sovereign nation and whether early steps will be taken with a view to their removal.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement mentioned by the Deputy had reference to all those provisions of the Constitution which, in accordance with the British interpretation of the Treaty of December 6th, 1921, were imposed on the Provisional Parliament sitting as a Constituent Assembly and have never been freely accepted by the Irish people.  Many of them are inconsistent with the present status of the Irish Free State.  One is being removed to-day, and legislation will be introduced in the near future to remove others.  The remainder will be removed according as opportunity presents itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if it is intended to introduce <Col N="390" /> proposals for legislation whereby relief of the able-bodied unemployed will be administered out of central funds through the medium of the Employment Exchanges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state why unemployment benefit is not being paid to Richard O'Rourke, Springvalley, Enniscorthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>On a claim which he made on the 28th December last, Mr. Richard O'Rourke of Springvalley, Enniscorthy, received 25 days' unemployment benefit.  Those payments exhausted all the contributions to his credit in an account which he opened with the Unemployment Fund on the 2nd July, 1932.  In filling up the form, which was the starting point of that account, he answered in the negative a question as to whether he had previously obtained an Unemployment Book.  His answer has since been proved to have been incorrect, for he had obtained a previous Unemployment Book and opened an account under the name of &ldquo;Richard Rourke&rdquo; in 1929 to which 28 stamps were affixed.  Subject to the statutory conditions, he is entitled to further benefits in respect of those contributions, but he has furnished evidence of unemployment for one day only subsequent to the receipt by him of the 25 days' benefit already mentioned.  Payment will be made for this day on application to the Branch Manager.  There are further contributions due but unpaid in respect of former employment.  Legal proceedings were taken against the defaulting employer but the sheriff has so far been unable to realise the decree which was obtained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that on licences issued by his Department to individual importers in County Donegal to import bakers' flour free of duty, household flour has been imported and supplied at cut prices by those individuals to selected customers to the grave detriment of their commercial rivals in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is not aware that bakers' flour imported into County Donegal under licence has been sold as household flour and supplied at cut prices to selected customers in the areas concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, if the Minister had read the question a little more carefully he would realise that his answer does not apply.  I asked him if he is aware that on licences issued by his Department to individual importers in County Donegal to import bakers' flour free of duty, household flour was actually imported and sold through the country at cut prices to the detriment of trade rivals.  I have drawn the Minister's attention to this and have communicated with him in writing and asked him if he has taken any steps to send any of his officials down to the area and ascertain whether or not the facts that I allege are true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no information that the allegations made are well founded.  Even if we had, there is no means at our disposal to remedy the situation.  No question of further licences can arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that if he issues a licence for the importation of one commodity duty free, and that licence is used for quite another commodity and for quite another purpose, that he has no remedy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That position has not arisen.  At least, it is the first time I have heard of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will see from the question that I have asked him&mdash;if he is aware that on licences <Col N="392" /> issued by his Department to individual importers in County Donegal to import bakers' flour free of duty, household flour has been imported by these licensees and supplied at cut prices to selected customers to the grave detriment of their commercial rivals in that area.  That is a specific question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And the answer is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister to investigate it.  Will the Minister take steps to make further inquiries as to whether or not these allegations are true?  I can assure the Minister that if he takes such steps, abundant evidence will be made available to his Department to prove that the facts are as stated.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he proposes to make any provision for sailors who have been rendered idle in consequence of the economic war in view of the fact that their unemployment insurance cards being stamped with English stamps they are not entitled to draw benefits in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>So far as the seamen in question are domiciled in the Irish Free State and employed on ships registered in the Irish Free State, they come within the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act as fully as other workers, but seamen domiciled in the Irish Free State are not insured at all against unemployment while employed on ships registered in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and do not pay contributions. I can only understand the Deputy's reference to books being stamped with British stamps, on the assumption that in the case of certain seamen contributions were paid for them in error.  In such cases, I am of opinion that the men concerned could claim repayment from the British Fund of their share of the contributions.</P>
      <P>Unemployed seamen will have the benefits of whatever provisions are made from time to time for unemployed workers generally, both insured and uninsured, and it has not been possible to make any exceptional provision for special classes of which seamen are only one.</P>

      <P>The Goldsmiths' Corporation of Ireland performs no duties for the State as such, but it assays and hallmarks gold and silver wares and carries out other functions incidental thereto, in the interests of the community generally.  The Government exercises no supervision or control over, and has no responsibility for, the activities of the Corporation, nor is there any representative of the Government on the governing body.</P>
      <P>The Charter of the Corporation has been examined in my Department and it is not proposed to introduce legislation to amend the present position. No representations have ever been made for new legislation, but I am always prepared to consider any proposal on the subject.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Introductory Notes to the Programme for Infants in National Schools, page 22 of the Report and Programme of the National Programme Conference.  I am sending the Deputy a copy.</P>
      <P>The official requirement of the programme is that the work of the infants' classes between the hours of 10.30 a.m. and 2 p.m. is to be entirely in Irish where the teachers are sufficiently qualified.  All teachers holding bilingual or higher certificates are regarded as sufficiently qualified, but the possession of such certificates is not regarded as an essential qualification.</P>
      <P>To meet the circumstances of the period of transition through which we are passing, a teacher who is able to teach Irish but is unable to use Irish as a medium of instruction is to teach the language as a subject for one hour a day at least, and is to use Irish as much as possible as the school language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>On this particular stage of the Bill one wonders whether any advantage would accrue from again drawing the Minister's attention to three blots which appear on the face of the measure.  On the Committee Stage we draw attention to a rather <Col N="402" /> serious innovation contained in the Bill in that it interferes with the capital of a company without having any reference to the shareholders or proprietors of that particular company. It was pointed out to the Minister when the Bill was before the House on previous occasions that this is a very serious interference with the rights of citizens and public companies and we mentioned that as far as we were concerned it was without precedent in Parliamentary procedure that interference of such an important character should take place without any reference whatever to the shareholders.</P>
      <P>In the interregnum between the Committee Stage and this Final Stage I was anxious to know from the Minister if he had pondered on the importance of the implications involved in the clauses dealing with these items and I would like to know if even now he would not reconsider the problem and treat it in a manner somewhat similar to the way he has dealt with voting for directors.  The Minister will remember that in that connection he referred the matter to the Board to draw up a scheme and submit it to his Department within a period of six months.  Could not some similar arrangement be made with regard to the reduction of capital and then, if the company does not take steps to satisfy the Minister within a reasonable period, there would be some justification for parliamentary interference, where there is no justification at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next blot one would like to draw attention to is that it has been pointed out to the Minister that it would be exceedingly unfair if the baronial guarantee, at present paid by the State, amounting approximately to £48,000 and which, under the 1924 Act will fall on the railway company next year if not at the end of this year, is allowed so to fall.  Perhaps the Minister will reconsider the hardship such a burden will impose on the railway company in the present strained state of its finances.  Perhaps he will see if the period could not be extended over which this liability would be carried by the State rather than have it thrust on the railway company in <Col N="403" /> the serious circumstances in which the company finds itself to-day.</P>
    <P>The third point upon which I would like information is with regard to the loan which the L.M.S. Company gave the old D.S.E.R. Company.  We had a considerable discussion on this point when the Bill was in Committee and also on Second Reading.  We pointed out how unfair it would be to withdraw the director nominated by the L.M.S. Company from the board of the Great Southern Railways Company. We pointed out that if, as a result of that withdrawal, the railway company was to become liable for the immediate payment of £100,000, we thought that would be very unfortunate accruing, as the liability would, from an action of the State rather than from an action on the part of the railway company.</P>
    <P>We were all glad to see that within the last few days the Minister had an interview with the Chairman of the L.M.S. Company.  I hope that as a result of that interview the Minister will be able to tell the House he has satisfactorily arranged the difficulty to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with Deputy Good's remarks.  I desire to protest against certain items in this Bill and, in particular, to emphasise one point in connection with Deputy Good's point, namely, the curtailment of the capital of the debenture holders of the company. That is a most serious step for the Government to take.  Debenture stock is not part of the capital of the company.  As the Minister knows, the debentures form merely a debt on the company.  The interest on the debenture stock is a perpetual obligation on the part of the company.  The debenture holders have no voice whatever in the management of the company.  They have no vote.  They lent money at a contract rate of interest.  The Government proceed to break that contract between private individuals and a private company.  They proceed to curtail and cut down obligations undertaken by the company for the use of money secured on the assets of the company at a contract rate of interest. The debenture money is on an entirely <Col N="404" /> different basis from the ordinary capital of the company and the Government are taking one of the most serious steps possible when they break the contract.  It ought to be the duty of the Government to maintain the sanctity of private contracts.  They are doing the very reverse.  I feel I cannot let this Bill go through its Final Stage without making at least this protest against that step in particular that is involved in the passage of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading of this measure the Minister was informed from various parts of the House that this Bill and the Road Transport Bill would not solve the country's transport problem.  It is not likely that in the presentation of any proposals of the sort which come from the Minister they will get that consideration here which the complications of the particular services seem to require.  The complications of the particular services do not lend themselves to settlement in this House.  These two measures, notwithstanding what the Minister may say, will not improve the transport problem.  To a certain extent they stabilise it as it is so as to give the Minister an opportunity of correcting and lessening any further complications that may arise in connection with the services; but they do not solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have stated, any proposals which come before the House have to be dealt with by members of the various Parties, having constituents interested in any one or other of the various forms of transport activities and Deputies are likely to be canvassed in connection with whatever proposals may come forward.  On the Second Reading I mentioned to the Minister what appeared to be a practical way of bringing about a solution of this whole question.  He has in his Department, certainly, two officials who would be quite capable of sitting down to consider and resolving the whole question along with an associated accountant, an engineer with a knowledge of transport and an engineer having a knowledge of railway transport.  My suggestion <Col N="405" /> would be that that committee would have full power to examine the whole question bearing in mind the idea that the railroads should form the main transport agency; that the main consideration was economic transport; that they would be entitled to consider in respect of any recommendations that they would make the claims that persons might have in respect of compensation; what compensation properly should fall upon the transport agencies; and what compensation ought to be paid by the State.  That committee could produce in effect a Bill which would be a schedule to a single clause Act giving it the force of law and putting it outside of the competence of Parliament to consider it; keeping Ministerial control out of the recommendations and viewing them and considering them solely from the point of view of economic transport, having in mind the maintenance of the railway organisation as the particular agency for transport in the country, not ignoring the fact that a new form of transport has extended transport throughout the country, is extending it and is likely to still further extend it.  That should form the main subject of this committee and I think that granted such a proposal as I have put to the House, even the House itself would vote with an overwhelming majority in favour of it.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the measure itself at its best and its worst.  At its worst it stabilises things as they are at the present moment and we cannot ignore the fact that for about ten weeks there has been a loss of £600,000 in railway receipts.  The Minister thinks this Bill will remedy that.  I am optimistic but not quite so optimistic as the Minister in that connection.  Only one thing can improve the receipts of the company, namely, normal conditions here and the extension of the business we had. If this state of affairs goes on for the whole year and if the loss for the whole year be at the same proportion I find it difficult to see where the debenture interest, even at the reduced rate will be found.  From my examination of this measure the <Col N="406" /> debenture holders have still rights. Their rights are not limited except as far as the value of their holdings is concerned.  I think they still have rights and if they still have rights and if these rights are maintained a new element can enter into the situation.  Under the statutory rights they can take over the concern.  They are in the position of mortgagees not shareholders.</P>
    <P>I think the cutting down of the capital value of the company has been a little unfortunate.  We have had no information regarding the proposed terms of reference submitted by the directors to the firm of accountants which made this proposal. The question that has been raised by Deputy Good about the payment of the baronial guarantees would only arise if there was a dividend in respect of the preference stock.  I believe it is preference stock these people hold.  I think it would be difficult to find out what holdings of stock should be allocated to shareholders in the baronial lines.  It is a fact that the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway Company which was not as sound a proposition as the railroads from the financial point of view have done very much better in this connection. They have got something at any rate.  These two Bills to my mind make no great contribution towards the improvement of transport.  While saying that I express the hope that they will but I wish I could have more confidence in expressing that hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the financial reconstruction scheme is concerned I think it was unworthy of the Minister that he deemed it advisable to intervene in the way he did. I say that for two reasons, first, that the course adopted with reference to the debenture holders is, I think, unprecedented and may later on lead to developments which will be highly undesirable; secondly, I believe the Minister himself has admitted that the construction scheme stands self-condemned by the absence of equity which characterises the way in which some of <Col N="407" /> the preference stocks referred to in the schedule have been dealt with.  I understand it is the intention of the Minister to remedy in the Seanad the apparent unfairness which I pointed out at earlier stages in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In connection with reconstruction I would remind the Minister of the suggestion that I made to him that he should by statute empower debenture holders to act as a body, that he should offer them and the shareholders of the company benefits such as they are getting by this legislation and give them a Government guarantee for a large development loan, if the debenture shareholders and the shareholders would put up to him a drastic voluntary reconstruction scheme.  I believe that along these lines he could get a better reconstruction scheme and at the same time he could put in hands work on the railroad systems of this country which would absorb very large numbers of unemployed men, work which would produce real and enduring wealth for the State as a whole.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good has referred to the interviews that have taken place recently between the General Manager of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  So far as I am concerned the Minister's attitude in that matter gives me no ground for complaint if he is prepared to say that he will indemnify the railway company against any losses in which national policy may involve the company.  I submit to him again that it is neither just nor equitable on the grounds of national policy to make the Great Southern Railways liable for an undetermined sum unless the Government is prepared to indemnify them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, the question of standard revenue remains unsecured and I invite the Minister between now and the time when he will be steering this Bill in the Seanad to examine closely the question as to whether the Bill in its present form may not result in the Railway Commission dealing with the standard of charges in a way which neither this House anticipates nor desires.  Under Section 8, there are provisoes for the discontinuance <Col N="408" /> of train services.  It was in connection with that section that the Minister was heard to make his classic remark that he wanted no deputations pestering him if he made up his mind to close a line, that he wanted to hear no growling from a town or small community, and that he would dispose of any branch lines that did not commend themselves to his favourable consideration. I remind him now that he ought to change his tune when dealing with that side of the question and remember that where a town or district is prepared to make up the difference between what would be the economic and uneconomic running of a branch line they ought to be allowed to approach the Minister and place the facts of the case before him, and that they ought to be allowed to make an offer, whatever it may be, to preserve their property in the particular town the railway serves and which they want the railway to go on serving.  All I am asking is that the Minister should hear them and withdraw his previous declaration, that the door would be slammed in their faces if they attempted to approach his august presence.  I have no doubt that, in the Seanad, much will be done by the Minister to improve this Bill.  I do not despair that he may yet produce a financial reconstruction scheme on sounder lines and to greater advantage by his well known and distinguished art of persuasion and negotiation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it is painfully obvious that the speech we have just heard from the Leader of the Opposition was delivered without any previous thought or consideration whatsoever.  Deputy Cosgrave occupies a fairly important position in this House and his contributions are expected to be the outcome of thought and to represent the combined wisdom of his Party.  We expect a serious contribution from him; we do not expect such a contribution from Deputy Dillon.  We know that Deputy Dillon is completely ignorant on the subject of transport, but Deputy Cosgrave, as the then <Col N="409" /> Leader of the Government, was responsible for the passage by this Dáil of the main Railway Act preceding the measure now under discussion&mdash;the Act of 1924.  If the speech we have heard from him now is an indication of the measure of consideration that was given to the drafting of that Act, it is no wonder we have a transport problem.  The Deputy said that these Bills will not solve the transport problem.  He might have gone further than that.  The transport problem we are trying to deal with is a legacy which this Government has inherited from Deputy Cosgrave's Government. The Deputy might have indicated in what way he would solve the transport problem.  Is his solution of the transport problem on the Statute Book? He was President of the Executive Council for ten years and his attempts to produce a solution of the transport problem led to the chaos of which everybody is now talking.  What would he have done if, by any misfortune, he had continued in the Presidency of the Executive Council? He does not say.  The only suggestion we had from him&mdash;an inane suggestion&mdash;was that some officers of my Department should be appointed a Commission to go into the problem and that we ought to do whatever that Commission decided upon.  The particular officers of the Department whom the Deputy indicated have been giving this matter continuous consideration, have been sitting in committee continuously upon it and the full benefit of their advice, experience and information was available to the Government when determining the introduction of this legislation.  If the Deputy's view is that the sole responsibility for devising a means of solving the transport problem that he left behind him rests upon the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should do no more than introduce a one-clause Bill giving these recommendations the force of law and saying that they must not be criticised by any members of the Dáil&mdash;if that is the Deputy's view, then we have an indication of the way these matters were considered when <Col N="410" /> he was responsible for the consideration of them.</P>

Whatever parts show wisdom and sense are, no doubt, the products of the officials; the rest are the Deputy's own. Only he could have introduced them. It is the situation created by that Act and the attempts to amend that Act that produced the situation with which we are now trying to deal.  The Deputy says that this Bill will merely stabilise things as they are and that it is not going to solve the problem.  Nobody else suggested that it is going to leave things as they are.  That occurred only to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>May I remind the Minister that the chaotic condition of the railroads has not been inherited by him, but has been created by him. Look at the reduction in the receipts of the railroad company between now and this time twelve months.  Did the Minister inherit that?  The President of the Executive Council is laughing at the joke.  He has very little sense of humour, but that was too much for him.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should look at the figures.  It is all the worse when he says it, but he will improve with time.  I would impress upon the Deputy his responsibility as the Leader of the Opposition.  He has not been long in Opposition, but when he is there for a few years more, he will appreciate the responsibilities of an Opposition.  Before he comes and makes what purports to be a considered contribution to an important measure he should, at least, find out something about it.  I suggest that he should go to anyone who has the slightest knowledge of transport, even a junior official in the railway company, and attempt to find out what these Bills are likely to do, and to see then if he is prepared to repeat his statements, that the Bills will make no change, and will only stabilise things.  Not even Deputy Dillon suggested that.  We have had a suggestion from Deputy Good that the question of the reorganisation of the company's finances should have been referred to the Board, and that if at the end of six months the Board had not produced a satisfactory scheme, then this Bill might be introduced. That is precisely what happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board is responsible to the shareholders not me.  It is more than six months since I met the Board and told them that if they wanted legislation introduced of the type embodied in the Road Transport Bill and the Railways Bill, a reorganisation of the company's finances would have to take place at the same time.  I told them that and they agreed with it. <Col N="413" /> I asked them to go ahead and to take whatever steps they considered necessary to get that reorganisation of the finances carried into effect.  I told them I would much prefer that the only legislative proposals that would have to be introduced would be those necessary to enable them to give effect to their own decisions.  They did not take action as rapidly as I thought they would.  Ultimately they went to an eminent firm of accountants and produced in my office proposals by that firm for the reorganisation of the company's finances, and, in relation to the major stocks, these are the proposals in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I said that it was unprecedented for parliamentary procedure to interfere with the share capital without consultation with the shareholders. I say that there has been no consultation of any kind with the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways. No scheme has been submitted to them.

I am quite prepared to say that in the national interests I believe this legislature has a right to interfere whenever it thinks fit to ensure that the equipment in this State will be kept at a degree of efficiency to serve the purpose of all citizens.  Would there be anything wrong in introducing here proposals for the nationalisation of the railways?  If we had introduced proposals for the nationalisation of the railways do you think the value fixed upon the various classes of stocks and shares would be that which is set out in the Schedule of the Bill, having regard to the market quotations since the famous Railway Act of 1924?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals for the major stocks are quite fair and reasonable and are a necessary corollary for any scheme of reorganisation designed to put the effective control of all forms of transport in the hands of the Railway Board.  There is the question of the minor stocks, and Deputy Dillon with his usual conceit talked about my being prepared to admit that some changes are necessary since he pointed out the injustice.  He did nothing of the kind.  If he will read the debates again he will find that he <Col N="415" /> did not discover any question about the minor stocks until other people had made several speeches about them.</P>
      <P>We had a suggestion from Deputy Good that the State should continue the payment of approximately £48,000 which was received by the Great Southern Railways Company each year since 1924, and which ceases next year, in consideration of the fact that the baronial guaranteed shares were changed into preference shares of the Great Southern Railways Company. There is no liability on the company as yet arising out of the transfer of these shares.  Any injustice done was done to the owners of the baronial guaranteed stock, who got only preference shares of the company in exchange.  Despite the fact that the Great Southern Railways Company got £48,000 it paid no dividend in this year on the preference shares to the persons who formerly owned the guaranteed stock.  That injustice was perpetrated by the Party opposite, for whose policy I am not responsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter upon which opinions would differ.  There was a suggestion in Deputy Dillon's speech that where a town was prepared to make good the loss on the working of a branch line it should be allowed to do so.  That is an interesting suggestion.  I would like to hear the views of the local authorities in the towns concerned.  When baronial guarantees had to be paid there was quite a different outlook on the question of closing down branch lines in these districts.  A number of deputations came to my predecessors asking that particular lines should be closed down so that the baronial guarantees would not have to be continued.  If you have particular districts prepared to revert to the baronial guarantee position, in respect of branch lines, there will be a new situation in the future, in which some of us might change our views concerning these branch lines.  At the moment the position concerning branch lines is that <Col N="416" /> they will be closed down only when it is quite clear that the people concerned do not want them and are not using them.  If the people in any district show clearly that not merely do they want branch lines operated but are using them, then they will be kept there under, the powers conferred by this Act.  But where, for a long period of time, they show undoubted preference for road transport, and if reports show that trains leave and arrive every day carrying no one, then there is no case whatever for putting on the railway company the obligation to maintain lines which no one wants but which, at present, it is required to do by statutory enactment.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the loan which was given by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway to the Dublin and South-Eastern Railway Company, the liability for which was transferred to the Great Southern Railways in the Amalgamation Act of 1924.  Again I want to say that the position in that respect has not been changed by this Bill.  Whatever liability was acquired by the Great Southern Railways Company in 1924 still continues, and continued throughout the intervening period.  According to the terms of the agreement that liability would appear to be a liability to repay upon six months' notice the amount of the loan, until January of this year, and to repay on demand after January.</P>
      <P>Whether the London, Midland and Scottish Company would have exercised that power, to require repayment, so long as it had a representative on the Board is a matter of opinion.  The legal position in that respect is not changed.  The repeal of the Railway Directorate Act, 1924, merely puts the position exactly as it was when the Amalgamation Act was passed, and any question concerning that line, or the granting or the receiving of traffic facilities by the railway company, is a matter for discussion between the representatives of that company and the London, Midland and Scottish Company.</P>

      <P>You never could tell. These Bills are going to effect a substantial improvement in the transport position that will make possible a transport organisation that can be maintained on an economic basis.  That opinion is shared by everybody who knows anything about the transport problem, whether associated with railways or road transport or those who have given the matter study without practical experience.  There is, in all <Col N="418" /> quarters, a unanimous welcome for these measures.  It is only those who have shown by their actions and by their words that they know nothing at all about them that wasted time in criticising these measures.</P>

That is what we set out to achieve and that is what these Bills will achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to oppose this motion.  This is a matter that has been very fully discussed on previous occasions.  It is a matter of a breach of the Treaty.  We do not intend to go into it now except to say that in the case of a treaty, the fact of one party to that treaty claiming the right to interpret it without regard to the agreement of the other parties, makes the international position of relations between countries based upon contractual arrangements quite impossible. It would mean that the only sanction as between nations hereafter, as far as I can see, would be war or some warlike act.  When two parties come together and purport to make a treaty, no one party can claim they have the right to interpret it or distort it as may suit their convenience.  There is another point.  The President indicated at a Party gathering a couple of weeks ago, and again in reply to a <Col N="423" /> question to-day, that he proposed changing the constitutional form of this State and abolishing the Treaty from which this State took its being, in piecemeal fashion.  Now, I am no upholder of the theory of mandates. I think when a Government is elected by the people, the Government has itself to decide what is best for the lives of the people, but I say that it was an outrage against ordinary honesty for the Government to seek power to abolish the State as it exists and create a new State without making it clear to the people that that was going to be done as a result of the election. Supposing it were right to do that, it seems to me if this piecemeal transmigration of the Free State into some sort of republic were to be agreed to, the last way by which that should be done is by this abolition of the Oath.  I have said before that I personally objected to that clause of the Treaty which insisted upon this Oath, because I regarded it as something of an insult to the people of this country as it implied that unless outside pressure were put upon us we, in this country, being an inferior people to all other peoples, would perhaps come here to legislate and to make laws binding upon the consciences of other people and hold that our own consciences should be unbound.  If we are going to have this piecemeal evolution from one from to another, why should we begin with the abolition of the Oath?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we abolished the various details and would up with the abolition of the Oath, there might be some rectitude in it but what are we doing now?  The President will agree that the Government of which he is the head is the Government of the Irish Free State. He, I think, feels stronger, if possible, than I do on the necessity to have authority in government and on the moral rights of that Government to demand from the citizens loyalty and obedience to the law.  During that period of evolution, if that Oath is maintained, if that proper position is maintained that, as long as this State remains the Free State, and, as long as the present <Col N="424" /> Government is the present Government, and, as long as the King is part of the Constitution of this State, then, irrespective of this Oath, the duty that the Oath sets forth is binding on everyone of us and not merely on members of the Dáil, but on the people walking about the streets.  It seems to me that taking this step, as the President is doing, is the clearest justification I know for the British Government insisting on having that clause in the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The President, by this Act which he has brought in and which he now proposes to pass, is clearly, as he is performing a positive act in order to create that situation, proposing that, in this country, the State of which he is the head has not the right to claim loyalty and obedience and fidelity from its people.  If that doctrine of his is sound, then we are here in a state of anarchy.  How does this State exist except by the assent of the people and by the insistence of the Government that there shall be that obedience to law that is implied in that word &ldquo;fidelity&rdquo;?  I, on national principle, must oppose this.  I know that the President has appealed entirely to ignorant prejudices and to the more ignorant sections of the community and, by playing up the past, has created what I might call a sense of untruth amongst the people, a disregard for truth, a mental cowardice, a refusal to face up to fact and he has certainly got a certain amount of support in the country for the abolition of this Oath.  He, as head of the Government, must recognise that if we, coming in here to legislate, do not owe fidelity and obedience to this State and to those sections which form the Constitution, the Executive Council, the Governor-General and so on, if the Government has no right to insist on that, by virtue of what does the Government govern?</P>
    <P>Is the Government proposing to make the laws passed in this Dáil effective in this country solely through the means of the material sanctions under its control, such as the army and the police, or does the Government, although it abolishes this Oath, recognise that its own members, the <Col N="425" /> members of this Dáil and every citizen of this State, are bound under a law which is not mutable as the ordinary laws we pass are but, under an immutable and unchanging law, to give that loyalty, fidelity and submission to law which we, coming into the Dáil, so far have asserted in a set form that we accept?  I cannot understand, although I do not propose to argue about the President's general policy, why it is&mdash;he talked to-day about various things which were objectionable, presumably, to the Irish people, and which he proposes, some in the immediate future and some as opportunity arises, to abolish by legislation&mdash; he begins with the Oath.  By some short or long time, we are going to come in here with free consciences, refusing to recognise authority in the Constitutional authority in this country, and, at the same time, are going to impose laws on the people of this country and to enforce those laws through our police, and, if necessary, with the assistance of the military, and are going to enforce those laws to the very point of taking life.  If we do not owe the duty that we set out in that Oath, what right has the Government and its machinery to take a man's life for the transgression of law in this country?  What form is there behind law in this country?  Until we get to that form of State that is so dear, as the President would like us to believe, to his own heart, there is going to be no State here; there is going to be no real law in the country.  We are only going to have a body of men, to use a favourite phrase of Fianna Fáil when they were in opposition, a junta, controlling certain armed forces, and, having gone through certain empty forms here, in the way of discussion, voting and so on, are going to enforce laws on the people of this country, and going to pass an Act, here and now, indicating clearly to the people that the Government does not recognise that there is any virtue of authority in itself.  It seems to me&mdash;I do not want to use strong words&mdash;to justify the very worst things that were ever said about us.  The statement was made about us that we were not fit for self-government. What is the President saying?&mdash;&ldquo;Where other people are <Col N="426" /> able to organise their society, to put authority over that society, which will have the right to expect obedience and which will have power to enforce obedience, we are something inferior to all the rest of the peoples of the world,&rdquo; and although we go through the form of elections and having an Executive Council and all the rest of it, so long as we have not the right to ask of the people of this country that they will give obedience to their own law and respect to their own institutions, I must protest on every possible ground against this step that the President is taking here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was introduced and throughout the various debates that have taken place upon it, the principal argument put forward in its favour was that it would reconcile a section of our population to the existing order of things in this country. I take this opportunity to ask the President if he still holds by that argument.  Watching as carefully as one can watch as a spectator and as a student of the Press, I have been unable, from the day this Bill was introduced to this present day, to find any evidence that the passage of this Bill will draw into this House any persons who hitherto stayed away from it or will reconcile any section of the Irish population to the Constitution of the Free State who have hitherto refused to be reconciled to it.  I think that my feeling on this subject is borne out by the speech which the President made the other day and to which I alluded in a question to-day&mdash;a speech in which he put before us a long vista of further measures apparently designed in the same spirit to reconcile people whom I believe to be irreconcilable unless we go the whole distance of declaring a Republic.  If we are to go the whole distance of declaring a Republic, I take the view now, as I took the view on the First Reading of this measure, that the sooner we do it the better and that a Republic in prospect is far more damaging to the prospects of curing poverty in this country and to the prospects of curing Partition in this country than even would be a Republic in actual reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> I have no hesitation in continuing my opposition to this Bill and the whole of the National Centre Party is solid in opposition to this Bill.  We regard it as a piece of paltry chicanery which achieves no useful object.  We regard it as largely, and, perhaps, mainly, responsible for the economic war and for all the miseries that are flowing from the economic war.  We regard it as something which makes honourable, dignified and satisfactory relations with the people across the water an impossibility and regard it as something, leaving aside altogether the people across the water, which is inconsistent with any desire for decent world conditions and decent relations among the nations of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know whether the President can give us any assurance that this is really the last of the abolition of the Oath.  We have been abolishing it for so many years, but it seems to bob up again and again, and I should like to know whether this is really a funeral ceremony or not.  I myself am very tired of it.  I am opposed to it not so much for the reasons expressed as for the reason that in passing this Bill the Government is lowering the honour of this country to the level of the honour of the British Government.  We are, to a certain extent, breaking the spirit of the Treaty.  The British Government, as we know, were the first to break the Treaty in respect of Article 12. That is no reason, however, for following their example.  The British held that the terms of Article 12 of the Treaty, which said that the boundary of this State should be determined according to the wishes of the inhabitants, meant, in effect, contrary to the wishes of the inhabitants.  Now the Government of our country comes along and assures us that the words the Oath to be taken really mean the Oath not to be taken.  The Oath itself, if you look at its phraseology, is a grotesque collection of words&mdash;a concatenation of incomprehensibility.  The first part of it is quite clear and the second part means absolutely nothing.  We are asked to give fidelity to the head of the Commonwealth for two facts that <Col N="428" /> do not exist.  We are asked to give fidelity, first of all, because of an alleged common citizenship of Ireland with Great Britain.  That, according to the ordinary rules of grammar, might mean that Ireland and Great Britain are two citizens and have common citizens.  Otherwise it might mean that the people of Ireland and the people of Great Britain have common-citizenship. That, as we all know, is not true.  The great majority of the people of Britain are not citizens of this State and there are many citizens of this State, including, I think, the President himself, who are not British subjects, and so the first reason is nonexistent.</P>
      <P>The second reason is that Ireland is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.  That, as we all know, is also not a fact.  It was a fact, I believe, for a few hours on the morning of the 5th-6th December, 1922, but it is not so to-day.  The ghost of this Oath, which I believe we are abolishing now&mdash;although I am still not convinced that we are abolishing it and feel that it may come bobbing up again&mdash;certainly will haunt the present Government whenever it tries to make any agreement with our neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald has suggested that this is a direct breach of the Treaty.  It is obviously an expression of opinion on the part of the Government to break the Treaty.  It is a Bill to compel you, sir, and the Chairman of the Seanad to admit into the Chamber, and admit as a member of the Oireachtas, someone who has not taken the Oath as prescribed in the Treaty.  In my opinion, the Treaty will not be formally broken until an overt act has been committed and until a person has taken his seat and has voted in one of the Chambers of the Oireachtas without taking the prescribed Oath.  That possibility might have been upon us in the next few days had the last by-election in the Seanad turned out otherwise. That has been postponed.  I think it will be found that the British Government will consider, once that has happened, that the Treaty will be broken.  In this case, as in all other cases, an easy solution could have <Col N="429" /> been found of the interpretation of the Treaty had the British Government themselves bothered to abide by our example some years ago at Geneva.  They are now suffering, as we are suffering, from the results of the short-sightedness of Mr. Arthur Henderson and the British Government of that time.  They refused to follow our example and accept the authority of the international courts in all questions of the interpretation of treaties.  Unfortunately, the mistake of Mr. Arthur Henderson and his colleagues at that time has resulted not only to the disadvantage of his own country but also to the disadvantage of ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I should refer to the arguments that we have just listened to from the various speakers, but if I might advert to the arguments of the last speaker, at any rate, I should say that he, for one, has given one good reason why this Oath should be removed.  I do not say that it would be a sufficient reason, but it is one good reason.  That is when he described it as a &ldquo;concatenation of incomprehensibility.&rdquo;  That, I think, was the phrase the Deputy used. People who wanted to interpret it one way, could do so.  For us, the important thing was that a large section of the Irish people interpreted it in a very definite way, and the fact that the British Government imposed it as an obligation gave them very good reason for thinking that it had a very special signification.  At any rate, it has been before our people for a number of years.  Nobody can say that this Oath is going without full knowledge on the part of the Irish people that it is going.  We were elected in the last election, and we were elected in the previous election, to get rid of this Oath.  This is the last step and I hope that we are never going to hear of it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why were we interested in getting rid of this Oath?  We were interested in getting rid of it because we knew that the majority of the Irish people did not want any confession of allegiance to a foreign king on the part of their representatives.  We wanted to <Col N="430" /> get rid of it because this formal acknowledgment on the part of the elected representatives of the people, no matter how that acknowledgment might be whittled down by those who set themselves up to interpret it, meant that a large section of our people were not going to acknowledge the authority of the elected representatives of the people.  If you want to have Parliamentary institutions continue amongst an enlightened people, a people who are devoted to democratic representation, you must make sure that every section of the people have a chance of being represented without, in the first place, having to foreswear any opinions which they can legitimately hold.</P>
    <P>The opinion that a large section of our people legitimately hold is this, that they have a right to be completely free, that they have a right to determine for themselves, without any interference from outside, what their form of Government shall be, and if association with other States be suggested to them that they shall be at liberty to determine whether it is to their own interest to belong to that association or not.  If you want the authority of the elected representatives of the people to be respected by all sections of the people, then it must be possible, I say, for all sections of the people to elect whomsoever they choose to represent them.  There must be no barrier such as this Oath, there must be no test which, by bearing on their conscience, would have the effect of excluding them.  I say to Deputy Fitzgerald that the moment this Oath is removed the authority of the elected representatives here will gain a respect throughout the country that it never had before, and our object in putting this through is to get that respect.  The moment the Bill is through, there is a new situation created in this country.  Once this Bill is through, and once it is clear that every section of the people have a right and an opportunity to elect their own representatives and to send them in here to this Parliament, where the laws which are governing them are being passed, then I say there is no excuse, no reason, no justification for refusing to accept the authority of the elected representatives here.</P>

      <P>I am quite aware that there is partition in Ireland but we are here in a part of this country and we have to govern ourselves. There is only one rule under which we can have government and authority in this country and that is by allowing the people to elect freely their representatives and then to allow their representatives to decide by a majority vote what the national policy shall be. For the first time in ten years, once this Bill is through, we shall be in that position.  To hear Deputy Fitzgerald talking one would imagine that this House had authority because we were giving some formal obedience or allegiance through an oath like this to a foreign monarch.  What is the source of authority here?  The source of authority must be the Irish people themselves, and the citizens of this State, once this Bill is passed, when accepting majority rule in this House, are accepting an authority that comes directly and immediately from the Irish people.</P>

I have said directly that here the authority does not come from the allegiance to a British king.  The authority in this House comes from the Irish people. That that authority&mdash;the right to rule &mdash;originates from the Almighty we all know.  But the decision as to who will rule comes from the Irish people and the majority of the elected representatives represent the Irish people's authority in that matter.</P>

Do not examine it as it has been written by the propagandists on the opposite side.  Do not examine it with a phrase like &ldquo;irregulars&rdquo; in <Col N="433" /> your mind, which was coined at the time.  Go back and examine it.  How did the Treaty originate?  The Treaty originated and eventuated directly in the destruction of a State here which was established with the full approval and consent of the Irish people and maintained with their consent.  That was at that time unconstitutionally disestablished.  I do not want to go back into particular incidents.  We know of them.  The Pact was broken and we got into a Civil War.  During that Civil War, of course, the people who happened at the time to have power wanted to make out that they were the constitutional authority. That was denied at the time.  Going down through the whole of the period the one effort that was made by some of us was to try to get a rule by which the differences of opinion here could be settled.  Our opponents on the opposite benches during all that period tried to prevent that by insisting on representatives of a certain section of the people, before they could become effective as representatives, taking an oath which they did not want to take.</P>

      <P>We are hearing recently a great deal about the Constitution and the sacredness of this Constitution and that power, measures of force even, could be justified if the present Government did not keep to this Constitution.  The people who are writing that and saying that to-day are the people who could not see eye to eye with other people when they were holding that point of view with regard to another Constitution and another State.  As far as I and the people who have been with me in the formation of the organisation of Fianna Fáil are concerned, our outlook now is, and all the time has been this, that the Irish people themselves must be permitted freely to determine their own national policy and, in order to make such a policy possible of operation, we must make it clear that no section of the people is debarred from representation, if those people are able to get it, in this House.  That is the purpose of the removal of the Oath.  The object is to get stable, settled conditions here, to get some road along which political differences can be settled.  We have struggled for that.  What we are doing to-day was offered at the end of the Civil War to the then Government&mdash;to the members of the then administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question and other questions of that sort can be raised in their own good time. We are dealing now with one definite question to-day, and that is the removal of the Oath.  At the end of the civil war an opportunity was given to the previous administration to bring about those settled conditions in this country which I believe we are going to bring about&mdash;politically settled conditions, at any rate&mdash;to-day.  Once this Oath is taken away and once it is quite clear to every section of the Irish people that they can freely elect their representatives, that they can go to the Irish people with any policy they choose and, if they get a majority for it and can get a majority vote in this House also for it, that becomes the <Col N="436" /> policy of the Irish people and that they are at liberty to go ahead with it, those settled conditions to which I have referred will obtain.</P>
      <P>When that is so I say there is no excuse for anybody to prepare in any way for the use of force.  When people are denied legitimate rights there may be some excuse for it.  When there is no denial of these rights, then any attempt to use force or to prepare to use force is clearly a preparation on the part of people to enforce their own will upon another section of the people.  It must be clear to every reasonable person that that is an attempt to establish a dictatorship and there is no justification for it and no Government could permit that to go on unchecked.  It would be quite clear that if this or any other Government under such conditions allowed to go unchecked preparations of a military type, they would be permitting preparations for civil war.  I, for one, cannot see of what use arms in this country at the present time can be if they are not intended for civil war.  If they are not so intended, what are they for? Are they to defend the rights of our people as a whole against strangers, against foreigners?  Obviously, if the interests of this country are to be defended effectively against an outside power, they can only be defended effectively when they are defended by the body which has the authority of the Irish people behind it and can get the support of all sections of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate responsibility for defending the interests of the country must and does rest with the majority of the representatives of the people, elected in a free assembly. That must be clear.  Therefore, it seems to me, at any rate, that whatever preparations of a military character there were in the past, these preparations are no longer justified on any basis whatever.  They cannot be effective against a foreign enemy.  If any such efforts are not supported by the Government they cannot be effective. If the Government want to protect the nation's interests they can call on every citizen to come along and play his part in the national defence.  If the arms are <Col N="437" /> not for use to defend the country against an outsider they must be for use at home, and it is quite clear that any Government would be guilty of a grave dereliction of duty if it were to permit any such thing to go unchecked.</P>
    <P>Personally, I believe that the vast majority of the young people of this country who were looking for the attainment of the rights of this country in the past in arms will see now that, if the rights of this country are to be achieved by arms, then they can only be achieved by arms under the direction of the elected representatives of the people and not otherwise.  It is for that reason I have said on every occasion on which I referred to the importance of removing the Oath&mdash;it is for that reason I said to Deputy MacDermot on another occasion&mdash;that I am perfectly certain that when this Oath is gone it will be possible for all sections of the people to advance their political views and make this country as free as they want to.  When they can do that through political institutions, they will use these institutions and will not dream of resorting to force, and I say that, even though here and there you may have a few people who may say otherwise.  That is only natural.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the President again.  I interrupted him already but I should like to ask him is he aware that there is a very active recruiting campaign going on at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is an active recruiting campaign in all directions, on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I object to them in all directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have to do as a Government is to see that this recruiting does not become a danger. If it is used for political purposes and as a political organisation, and if we are satisfied that there is no danger to the elected authority of the people here it is all right.  Of course different people may think it a danger at different stages.  If it does seem to the Government to become a danger, <Col N="438" /> then it is the duty of the Government to stop it and use whatever resources they have to stop it.  As I have said&mdash; I believe I know the Irish people and the young people of the country just as well as others&mdash;once this Oath is removed you will have a complete change of attitude on the part of the people of the country.  I know that the Republican movement, when we started Fianna Fáil, was divided because a large number of people who opposed us at that time never dreamt that we could get to the position that we have got to to-day when the Oath is removed.  There would have been quite a different attitude then, if it were felt to be feasible.  If there are quite a number of people who want to go further, we too want to go further. If there are people who say they will not be satisfied unless there is a Republic for the whole of Ireland, well, they are entitled not to be satisfied with less, and they are entitled to ask for a Republic for the whole of Ireland with all their might.  What they are not entitled to is this: to assume to dictate by force to the majority of the people.  They are not entitled to do that, and the Government would not be doing its duty if it permitted that. Why we have been striving to remove this Oath for the past ten years is because we wanted to bring about that position of political stability in this country&mdash;that everybody who had reached manhood in the country should come out and stand and demand that every section of the people should obey the laws made by the majority of the representatives of the people.  But as long as there was a barrier there which made this not the Parliament of the whole people of this part of Ireland, but a Parliament for a section of the people, then we could not with any effect go out and preach and maintain that the authority of the majority of the representatives should be upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The moment the Oath is gone a new position is created here.  We will continue to have differences of political opinions.  Why should we not?  Some will hold one thing is good for the country and some will hold another thing.  Why should we not hold different views?  The main thing is <Col N="439" /> that we should be able to resolve these political differences by peaceful means, not by armed force.  That is the position we will have got to when this Bill is passed, and I say it was well worth all the trouble and anxiety in order to bring that position about.</P>
    <P>Partition has been referred to.  I know this country is divided.  The question is are we, in this part of Ireland, able at the moment to assert our authority over the whole country?  We are not.  Have we the right to do it? I say the people of the whole of Ireland have a right to rule themselves in their own way.  We have a difficult political problem to deal with in Partition.  The first step in dealing with it is to get ordered political conditions here, such as I believe we are going to have the moment this Oath Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I believe further that the passing of this Oath Bill is not a violation of the Treaty and if it were a violation of the Treaty to get that Oath Bill passed I, for one, would violate the Treaty because of the importance it would be to the Irish people to have settled conditions. No outside people has a right to keep us at each other's throats by insisting on a thing of that kind.  If the Treaty had to go in order to get that Oath removed, then I would say &ldquo;Away with the Treaty.&rdquo;  But, as it happens, I for one believe, and I am supported in my opinion by lawyers as good as any, that in removing that Oath we are not violating the Treaty. We are simply exercising a right which we have, even under the Treaty, under our present status.  That has been the attitude of this Government during the whole of this controversy.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the Civil War and to the conditions under which this State originated.  There will be people for some time&mdash;we do not expect a change altogether overnight&mdash;who will use the arguments that were applicable some time ago and will not be applicable to-morrow or the day after. That sort of thing happens all the time. We cannot help it.  We have only to be patient until we show that these arguments do not hold.  I referred to the Civil War because I wanted to point out that the conditions under <Col N="440" /> which it was fought led to a wrong type of thinking.  Propaganda that was used by those who were here at that time, and who wanted to win and wanted to get their views accepted, had its effects.  I believe we are going to have clearer thinking from to-day on, and that what really matters&mdash;namely, that the majority of the representatives freely elected are henceforth going to be the sovereign authority in this country&mdash; will be clear from the statement to which Deputy MacDermot referred in his question this afternoon.  That statement was that it is the intention of this Government to remove all the causes of annoyance&mdash;everything that would appear to conflict with the sovereign right of this nation to govern itself. We have to keep in mind the aim of bringing about unity in this country. We shall be in a better position to do that after to-day, because we shall be better able to resolve our own difficulties in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope that I, for my part, will never have to return again, even in argument, to the conditions of the Civil War.  I hope when this Bill is passed that I, for one, will be able to refrain from dragging into our debates here the circumstances of that time.  We have a wonderful country here.  We can do a great deal with it.  If we all try to work, giving fair recognition to other people's different view-points, if we all try to work for that objective of making this, what we want it to be, a great nation, then we will succeed.  Those who say that we have not the whole country here can work as hard as they like for unity.  The harder they work the better we, and every good Irishman, will be pleased with it.  The harder such people will work to bring about complete freedom of the whole country the better we will all like it.</P>
    <P>What we do want is no longer to be divided by things imposed from without. If we make up our minds that we will stand together against any outside threat of any kind, any outside interference, I think we shall have gone a very long distance towards achieving the ideals for which so many Irishmen gave up their lives.  There are men on both sides of this House who understand <Col N="441" /> what I mean.  They know that even this State, such as it is, could never have come into existence, that such liberties as there are could never have come into existence but for the sacrifices made by Irishmen who gave up their lives for Ireland.  That being <Col N="442" /> so, I think all of us here should do our best to put aside the differences of the past and to work so as to make of this country what the men who died for it would like it to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this motion passes, I desire to draw the attention of the House to a few points, one of which I adverted to while the Bill was in progress, and one which I apprehended when the Bill was under way. I believe that the provisions of this Bill are calculated seriously to increase the price of Indian meal to the producer and live-stock raiser in this country, if and when the present economic condition ceases to operate and the ordinary flow of trade is resumed.  I believe that the operation of this Bill is going to impose a serious burden on the poorest section of the community in the Gaeltacht, who have been in the habit of using Indian meal as food-stuff for human consumption.  While I do not yet despair that the Minister will meet this situation, I have yet to see him taking any constructive steps to that end.  Lastly, I desire to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that the restrictions which have been imposed under this Bill upon the importation and manufacture of flour in this country are resulting in something which I can only characterise as plunder of the consuming public by the <Col N="449" /> flour millers in Ireland.  I suggest to the Minister that quality for quality the commercial value of bakers' flour at present, during a given quarter, in this country is 23/- per sack, and for the same quality of flour the Irish millers are demanding 27/6 and, in some cases, up to 28/6.  It might be argued by someone unfamiliar with the trade that when that price is asked there is nothing to prevent any merchant from importing flour and paying the duty. Anyone who is familiar with the trade knows that it is not a practicable proposition to import small quantities of bakers' flour from the other side.  I have mentioned this matter on more than one occasion in this House, and I think the Minister will agree with me that action on the part of the flour millers, calculated to raise the price of bread on the people, is indefensible and scandalous, if that action is taken for the purpose of inflating their profits. I do not propose to say that we should allow any British combine to wreck the milling industry by selling at a figure which is below the cost of production. I recognise that that danger existed when this legislation was first introduced, and I warned the Government then, and I warn them now, that we can pay too heavy a price for the protection of the Irish milling industry. If the Irish millers are prepared to play the game, and charge a fair margin of profit, then it would be reasonable to give a fair chance to any control designed to protect the Irish milling industry from destruction by British concerns.  But at the same time the consuming public of this country is being held up and unjustly charged from 2/- to 4/- per sack too much for flour.  The consuming public have no remedy against the millers.  I suggest the time has come when the strongest possible action should be taken by the Executive Council to put an end to what is a scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be suggested by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the machinery provided in the Control of Prices Bill is now, or will be very shortly, available.  The machinery provided in that Bill is absolutely worthless for control of this kind of produce, and for this reason: Let us <Col N="450" /> assume to-day that the miller is getting 4/- a sack too much for flour, and proceedings have started with a view to having the price fixed.  Long before the necessary evidence can be accumulated, and the case brought to a final hearing before the Prices Commission, the situation may be entirely altered.  Exchange conditions may operate; all sorts of extraneous matters may enter into the situation, and by the time the decision is given the damage will have been done.  I know the Control of Prices Bill has a somewhat elaborate provision in order to compel people to return money that they got by overcharging, but anybody, with any practical experience of trade, knows that such a provision as that affords no adequate protection against the kind of overcharging going on at present.  Few people who are victims of overcharging would care to risk the expenditure, and the vast trouble that an appeal to the Control of Prices Commission would involve.  I have no confidence in the Control of Prices Commission to deal with such a position as that to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I state here, publicly, that the Irish millers are at the present time charging from 3/- to 5/- per sack more than is a fair price for bakers' flour to-day.  I invite the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture to make enquiries on this matter from those conversant with the trade, and if they do, I think they will find that every responsible representative or economist in this country will confirm what I have said, and I suggest that the time has come for immediate and drastic action to put an end to what is becoming a public scandal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We already discussed this Bill at considerable length.  We have spoken against the principle of the Bill, and pointed out that the Minister not only did not answer our arguments but did not attempt to answer the points made against the principle involved in this Bill.  The Bill was subjected, both here in the Dáil and also in the Seanad, to a great deal of detailed criticism, but the Minister made no attempt not <Col N="451" /> merely to answer but even to grasp the points put forward against the Bill.  The Government from the start took up the line that the Bill embodied their policy but they did very little to justify the line that they took up.  They made it quite clear, during the different stages of the progress of the Bill, that they were, practically speaking, determined not to answer the criticism put forward.  We find the Bill objectionable from many points of view.  Perhaps this is an instance of an extreme leap in the dark, but it is rather late now to criticise the Government for one leap extra of that particular kind.  We did not even get any kind of adequate answer from the Minister or the supporters of this Bill as to what ultimately the Bill was likely to cost, either in the way of subsidies, or administrative cost.  We have no idea as to how much might be involved if the Government is successful in inducing some people in this country, by means of subsidies, and against their better judgment, to adopt the plan of the Bill.  Evidence that it is against their better judgment is explained by the subsidy, and by the uneconomic character and policy in this Bill.  No attempt was made to find exactly what it would cost the community as a whole.  We have simply here another instance of the general policy of the Government to come to the assistance of one particular class of the community.  I do not believe that this policy will justify such an attempt. In order to do this they are taxing the general public.  The burden will be placed upon every class of the community but will fall with greater weight upon the poorer classes.  As a result of the increased price flour, for instance, must cost the consumer more. The cost of living will go up from what it otherwise might be as a result of this Bill.  We get plenty of instances in the case of Governmental policy of that vicious circle of tariffs and bounties which are put on to counteract each other.  Each of these measures tries to limit, to some extent, the damage to a certain class of the community by a previous measure.  Deputy Dillon referred to one particular matter <Col N="452" /> that aroused a good deal of attention in this House in the course of various debates and that is the increased cost of Indian meal, especially to those who use it for human food in the western portion of the country.  Undoubtedly in my own constituency it is used, mixed with flour, to form bread.  The Minister has not given us any figures to refute the statement made in the Seanad by Senator The McGillycuddy that, as a result of the price of the stone bags and of the extra labour in packing that is necessary to fit in with the Minister's wishes, the price of meal has already increased from 10½d. to 1/2 a stone.  This again is but another instance of the fact that the real financial burdens in the way of taxes that the country has to bear are not by any means altogether revealed in the Budget.  We will be told what the tax burden of the country will be; that will be revealed to us perhaps next week; but there are other burdens that do not appear in the Budget, and that are quite as real and very often heavier than some of the taxes.  Indirect taxes hit everybody.  Possibly people may not feel them as acutely as direct taxes, but at least they know they are taxes. Here you have a burden; you have an increase in the price of an article of human food, used largely by the poorer classes of the population, especially in the west.  That increased price is due to the policy of the Government.  It will not appear as an increase in taxation for which the Government is responsible, although it is directly traceable to the policy of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon says he does not despair&mdash;it is quite obvious, of course, from his speech that he does despair&mdash; of getting the Minister really to appreciate the seriousness of this particular problem for the people involved.  It was quite obvious from the course of this debate that the Minister was determined not to give way in the slightest in connection with this particular matter.  He says he has power under the Bill.  That is not what interests us.  Unfortunately, what interests us is that it became quite apparent during the debate that even if he had power under the Bill he was determined not <Col N="453" /> to use it.  Further, this mixing proposal may have some effect in increasing the price of grain in certain districts higher than it otherwise might have been.  That may or may not be true, but I think it is apparent that in certain counties&mdash;and those the poorer counties, like the county I myself represent&mdash;it means a direct loss.  This Bill, in every one of its clauses, means a direct loss to the people of the county I represent.  Quite true, it may be concealed from them.  The Government agent does not come down, get into personal contact with them, and demand the money from them; therefore they may overlook the fact that under the Government's policy they are out of pocket to a very considerable extent.  I see very little benefit that this Bill can do in a county like that, either in its wheat growing provisions or in any other provision.  I have opposed this Bill and feel it necessary to oppose it still.</P>
    <P>There is one question which I put to the Minister last time.  Perhaps he has had time to look into it since then.  He may say that it is not a practical question. What I want to know is whether in fact, as the Bill stands, it is an illegal act for the ordinary farmer to mix feeding stuffs in his own house for the purpose of forming a mixed feeding stuff for his own cattle.  The Minister said, I think, on the last day that that was not &ldquo;manufacture,&rdquo; but it became quite apparent in the course of his answers that it is what was meant by manufacture in other portions of the Bill if it is done elsewhere.  If it is manufacture, done elsewhere in other premises, it does not change its nature as a process because it is done in the farmer's house.  The Minister may say that there is nothing whatsoever to interfere with the farmer mixing feeding stuffs in his own homestead for use to his own cattle.  That may be true; that may be the intention; but I suggest that the Minister ought not lightheartedly, merely because he does not intend to enforce the law, declare that certain things which he knows the farmer will do are illegal.  I admit that he may have no intention of interfering with the liberty of the individual farmer so far as that is concerned, but, <Col N="454" /> unless there are provisions elsewhere in the Bill allowing the farmer to do that, I suggest that on principle it is a serious thing to declare an action of that kind illegal when the Minister knows it will be performed by most farmers.  The principle is bad, unless there is provision to deal with it in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister in connection with this Bill before it is finally out of hands.  It will be remembered that on the introduction of the Bill the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that, if we milled in this country the total quantity of flour needed for our requirements, all the additional employment that would be given in the mills would amount only to 153 hands. The stoppage of the importation of flour has to a great extent been in operation for the last six months.  We have not ceased to import some quantity of flour, but we have stopped the importation of it to a great extent, While we have not absorbed anything like the number of 153 extra hands in the milling industry, we have put some thousands of people out of employment as a consequence of the partial stoppage of the importation of foreign flour. I think this is a point which has not been sufficiently stressed in connection with this Bill in any of its stages.  I think the Minister has discovered by this time that the labour content of the milling industry is practically the lowest of any industry whatever. Furthermore, the stoppage of the importation of flour has removed from the Irish millers' minds any fear of competition in quality.  The result is that the bakers of this country are now forced to take any sort of flour that is given to them, at any price whatever that is charged to them.  I am not going to enter into the question of the increased price, which has been dealt with by Deputy Dillon, but I know from experience that we are forced to pay more for a worse class of flour than we were accustomed to handle.  In the ultimate analysis the consumer is paying more for an inferior article.  How this condition of things is going to be <Col N="455" /> remedied when we are going to mill all our own flour from all our own wheat is very hard to imagine; and it is fearful to visualise the situation that will arise when the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture in conference shall have to decide on what, in this country, can be produced under the title of millable wheat.  It is evident that feeding-stuffs have also increased in price to the Irish farmer.</P>
      <P>While they have increased in price they have deteriorated in quality.  In fact the difficulty at the present time for many millers is to get rid of the offals at all because owing to the condition of things that has been brought about in this country by Government action the demand for feeding-stuffs has gone down to a very low level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to raise the question of the want of discretion which in my opinion the Minister has shown in giving licences to mills in pushing forward the policy of increasing the milling capacity of Irish mills.  Certain parts of the country are over-milled.  The capacity of the mills is now equal to the total local consumption in these places but there are certain portions of the Free State, particularly in the West, where there are no mills at all.  These regions have to be supplied with their flour requirements from the eastern and southern side of the State.  Dublin especially has to supply in a great measure the wants of the West.  I think you have in Dublin very excellent mills, mills which are capable of great development and are turning out very excellent flour but, if I am correctly informed, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has resolutely set himself against not only helping these mills here in Dublin to increase their output but he has actually refused them any extension of their licences that would enable them not only to increase their output but to give increased employment in the port of Dublin, while at the same time licences for mills and for additional capacity have been issued in portions <Col N="456" /> of the country where already the milling capacity is quite equal to the requirements.  There is another matter, that while we are in the position of not being able to supply all our requirements from Irish mills, a certain amount of flour is being imported under licence.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the desirability where these licences are granted of stressing that the licensee should take on the responsibility for that licence himself. In other words what I want the Minister to see is that that licence can not be transferred to another person for a consideration because in some cases licences have been auctioned.  They have been sold to interested persons at so much per sack thereby increasing further the cost of the flour to the baker who eventually gets it and necessarily increasing the price of bread made from it.  I am sure the Minister has no intention whatever of allowing a condition of things such as that to prevail.  I would ask him in issuing these licences in future to insist and to see that the licence is not disposed of by the person to whom the licence is granted.  I think there is nothing further in connection with the Bill that I wish to comment upon except to say that I believe it is going to be a very costly Bill in administration. It is going to be costly to the nation as a whole.  With regard to its increasing employment, I am afraid it is going to have the very reverse effect.  I further believe in regard to feeding-stuffs and food for the people generally, the general tendency will be to give us an inferior article at very much enhanced prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill as far as I can judge by the statements I have heard contains two terrible faults.  One is that it was brought in by a Fianna Fáil Minister and the second is that it is of benefit to the farming community. These are in short the main complaints about it.  We hear wails and complaints every day from the benches opposite about the conditions of the farmers.  The Bill, which increased the price of the farmers' barley this year by something like 4/6 <Col N="457" /> to 5/- per barrel, and increased the price of the farmers' oats by something like £2 per ton, of course ruined the farmers, like everything that Fianna Fáil did will always ruin the farmers! That is the complaint.  When I was on the opposite benches, I made repeated attempts to get the Cumann na nGaedheal Executive Council to do something to give some measure of protection or relief to the farmer who is tilling his land and giving employment in the tilling of it but they would not; he should go to the wall.  They were only interested in the bullock rancher.  We urged for instance that a particular class of farmers were suffering a very grave injustice for a number of years.  Their lands were valued under Griffith's valuation as grain-growing lands.  On that account the valuation of their lands as compared with dairy land was doubled. I know that farmers in different portions of Cork County, each of whom could carry 20 cows easily on their farms, had their valuation fixed at £50 each while a farm of the same carrying capacity in East Cork had a valuation of £150.  The farmer of course has to pay rates according to his valuation but Cumann na nGaedheal had no remedy for the grain-growing farmer.  He could go to the wall.  They were not going to make any attempt to get a market for his barley.  No, they could not interfere with Guinness.  They were not going to get a market for his oats here.  The large shipping interests should be protected.  That was the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been the position of that farmer this year or last harvest? The price of the best barley in the English market was 10/- to 10/6 per barrel.  The price here was 14/6 to 15/- per barrel as a result of this Bill.  The price of the best white oats in the English market was £4 10s. 0d. per ton.  The price here was £5 10s. 0d. to £6 15s. 0d. per ton but of course that was of no interest to those whose only concern was bullocks.  Then we had Deputy O'Neill's complaint.  We hardly know how to please him exactly.  He complains of the bad flour that is at <Col N="458" /> present being sold by Irish millers. Apparently Irish millers do not know how to mill flour.  You have to go across the water for somebody who knows how to mill flour for us.  He complains about the manner in which licences were given.  Deputy O'Neill is the owner, I think, of a fine mill which is lying idle.  I suggest that, for the benefit of the people of the West, about whom he talked, he ought to get that mill going and give a little employment in it.  Perhaps he could mill good flour in it.</P>
    <P>He also said that the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated here that the total additional employment would be 153 hands next year.  I seem to have got most of them.  In fact, I was patting myself on the back when I heard Deputy O'Neill's statement, because our flour mill in Midleton, which was working half time, is now working overtime and has 17 extra hands employed. Our flour mill in Mallow, which was also working half time, is now working overtime with a large number of extra hands employed.  Our flour mill in Clondulane, Fermoy, which was closed by Cumann na nGaedheal, is now working overtime and employing 40 hands, so that I seem to have got 77 out of the 153 in East Cork alone, and I think I should pat myself on the back a few more times as a result.  One hears the most peculiar statements from Cumann na nGaedheal Benches on all these matters.  On the one hand, they complain that the farmers are broke; that they have no hope of surviving and that they are going to the poorhouse every day, and, on the other hand, we have them, day after day and week after week, voting against every Bill brought in for the benefit of the farming community.</P>
    <P>I could not exactly follow Deputy Professor O'Sullivan's case.  I do not know the quantity of Indian meal at present being used for human consumption in some parts of this country but I would suggest that rolled white oats is cheap and it makes a good oaten meal and it is better than Indian meal.  They will be benefiting the Irish farmer by using their own oats.  It is a most extraordinary thing that this Bill, as I said at the <Col N="459" /> start, has only two faults: (1) that it was brought in by a Fianna Fáil administration, and (2) it is giving some benefit to the farming community, that is, to the farmer who tills his land and who employs labour&mdash; the very class of farmer who was completely ignored for ten years in this House.  I welcome the Bill, and I am glad that it is going right through now.  I can see the benefits that will accrue from it to the tillage farmers of East Cork and of the rest of the Twenty-Six Counties who till their land and employ labour on their land. I have very little sympathy with the complaints I heard about it to-day, for those complaints were dishonest on the face of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the principal objections raised against this Bill is the danger of an increase in the price of maize to the poor people on the west coast and in Donegal.  As Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has admitted, there are safeguards in the Bill if the Minister wishes to use them for the benefit of the people.  So far as the Bill itself is concerned, we could not go any further unless we were to put in provisions which would compel the Minister to allow maize, free of duty, unmixed and so on, into those areas.  On the last occasion on which we discussed the Bill, I said that, as soon as we had the Bill through and got our regulations drawn up and got the Bill into working order, in the course of a few months, I would get a report from our officers in those districts and that I would go further than a Minister usually goes when he says that he will consider such a report.  I said that I would act on such reports.  I think we will all admit that these officials working in those areas are in touch with the people.  They know what the people require and they will give an unbiassed and fair report when asked for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is, however, that these people in Kerry, and in Donegal in particular, have been using the mixture for some time without any complaint.  When I tried to get figures <Col N="460" /> as to the increased cost of pure maize in Kerry and Donegal as a result of the regulations compelling the traders to sell pure maize in one-stone bags, I was told that it was very difficult to get the information because the people were using the mixture.  The people are using the mixture and are not complaining, and evidently it is one of the matters to which Deputy Professor O'Sullivan referred yesterday, on which the people are silent.  So long as they remain silent, apparently satisfied, we, for our part, are getting better results under this Bill than we expected at first.</P>
    <P>There is a complaint also of great profiteering in flour.  Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Neill spoke of this profiteering in flour, and I think both spoke of an increase in the price beyond what was fair of 3/- to 5/- a sack.  As Deputies know, the tariff on flour is 5/- a sack apart from the licence.  That means that an importer can bring in flour without any licence at all if he is prepared to pay 5/- per sack, so that, if this contention of an increase from 3/- to 5/- over the fair price is true, there is no doubt that flour would be coming in here and jumping the tariff because everybody admitted, before this scheme was put into operation, that flour was being imported at an uneconomic price. Deputy Dillon says also that it is calculated to raise the price of bread.  It does not matter very much to the consumer of bread what may be calculated, so long as it does not raise the price of bread.  Deputy Professor O'Sullivan said that we were trying to induce people to grow cereals against their better judgment.  That is rather a peculiar statement which I find it hard to understand, because after all, if we give a certain subsidy on wheat, we tell the people exactly what they may expect to get for wheat of average quality and fit for milling.  We tell them what they will get for it in any month they may wish to sell it during the next cereal year and, if they then use their judgment as to whether they grow wheat or not, I do not see how we can say that it is not their better judgment.</P>
    <P>We are not persuading them by any <Col N="461" /> undue influences.  The thing is there and it is for the farmer to decide whether he will grow wheat just as he consideres the growing of barley, beet, tobacco or anything else. He knows what he will get for wheat and for beet.  He may take a chance on what he will get for other things, such as potatoes and so on, and he can use his judgment as to whether he can grow wheat or not. There is no compulsion on him to do so.  We are asked what is the cost to the community as a whole.  I think the way in which we have to look at this matter with regard to the community as a whole is that, if we were, up to this, importing £4,000,000 worth of wheat and wheat products&mdash;that is, at last year's price&mdash;and if, say this year we are to cut down that by half a million pounds and to import three and a half million pounds worth and to grow half a million pounds worth at home, there must be a gain to the community as a whole.  Whether that is distributed equally or justly amongst the different sections of the community is another matter; but for the community as a whole there is a gain of half a million pounds because the community as a whole have to pay out for the import of that article this year £3,500,000, as compared with £4,000,000 last year.</P>
    <P>A different matter was raised by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan in his next question, however.  It was that we have tried to come to the assistance of particular classes at the expense of the whole community.  That may be true.  It may be true that we have tried to benefit classes, such as butter producers or grain growers, at the expense of the whole community; but if it is a defence to quote precedents for the matter we have precedents for doing so in practically every other country in the world at the present time.  Practically every country in the world, I think, has had to do something for different industries and different producers to help them against unfair competition from foreigners.  I do not know of a single country that has not had to adopt some measure of protection for its own industries and producers.  Many countries&mdash;most countries, I think,&mdash;<Col N="462" /> have export subsidies also.  Other countries have internal subsidies such as we have in the case of wheat.  In fact, if we are to take the case of the European countries at the present time, it will be found that the majority of them have given a guaranteed price for wheat more or less on the lines we have here.  There may be some difference as to the details, but it is more or less on the same lines.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan also says that every remedy we bring in is a remedy to repair some damage done by some previous measure.  That is a thing that we will have to examine in detail.  I do not know if it is true, but certainly it is not true that every measure we bring in is a measure to repair damage done by this Government.  The Cereals Bill, for instance, cannot possibly be put down as a remedy to repair damage done by us.  It may be a remedy for damage done by our predecessors in office, or for their neglect of their duty.  It is primarily, of course, to repair the damage done by the British Government when they repealed the Corn Laws which had been passed previously and had got a certain amount of corn grown in this country.</P>
    <P>We have been accused, also, with not answering the arguments raised against the Bill.  I do not know if any argument was raised against this Bill that had any substance, except a few put up here to-day again.  The principal argument used was that it would put up prices and, secondly, that we would have an inferior article.  That is the argument that is always raised by Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies against anything that may be done by Fianna Fáil.  That argument is always raised&mdash;the argument that the Irish manufacturer or the Irish producer will not produce as good an article and will charge more for it because he is not as honest as the foreign manufacturer, or producer.  We tried to point out that the Irish manufacturer, or producer, is just as honest and just as good at his business in producing an article and that we can produce as good a manufactured article or agricultural product here as any other country with which we are in competition, and that our people&mdash;the maize millers, for instance <Col N="463" />&mdash;will be just as honest as the manufacturers of compound feeding-stuffs in Liverpool or Great Britain generally. I am afraid, however, that pointing out this is no use and that whatever we may say, the occupants of the benches opposite will still believe that there is no business honesty in this country, and that you must import compound feedstuffs from Great Britain if you want to get an honest mixture.  Their argument is that if it comes from there it must be right and that the British manufacturer will not send anything except the pure article and at a competitive price.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill also joined in this argument and said that we would have an inferior article and at a higher price.  He said that the Irish millers can do what they like now because they have no longer the competition of the British mills.  He said that as long as they had that competition they had to keep down their price to a fair level because, of course, the foreign producer always sold at a fair price and that now that the competition is removed they can engage in dishonest practices and charge what they like for their flour.  He said that we got good flour because, again, the British supplied good flour; but now that their competition is removed the miller can turn out anything he likes because he has not the honest British miller competing against him.  How could anybody answer these arguments adequately in order to satisfy Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy O'Neill and others that we would have as honest and as competent men in their business on this side as in Great Britain?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill says the feeding-stuffs have increased in price, and then he goes on to say that we had dealt with the flour mills in such a way that they cannot get rid of their offals at all at any price, because we have made such a mess of it.  He says that the feeding-stuffs are going up in price and the offals are to be had for nothing&mdash; that the flour millers cannot sell their offals at any price.  That is the sort of balanced argument from Deputy O'Neill all through.  In the same way, he said that we had not placed mills <Col N="464" /> in proper places, that we had placed none in the West and that in giving out licences for flour mills proper discretion was not used.  On the other hand, he said that we were calculating to put 153 additional men into employment if we built flour mills but that we had put thousands of men out of employment at the ports and other places.  There is a complaint from Deputy O'Neill that we built our flour mills in the big cities and ports, such as Dublin and Cork, but not in the West; and there is also the complaint that because we did not bring all into the ports thousands have gone out of employment. How are we to remedy that?  The Deputy did not suggest a remedy.  The only remedy one could see as a logical remedy from his argument was that we should not build mills at all and that instead of employing 153 additional men we should employ thousands at the ports by importing.  If we were to pursue that argument logically, surely, if we were looking for employment for our people and that Deputy O'Neill was our only adviser, we should close our mills and relieve unemployment in that way.  But, surely, we could close our maize mills, too, and give a lot of employment at the ports importing maize.  If we were to pursue Deputy O'Neill's figures a little further we should close the other types of mills also.  It appears so ridiculous to think that if you import the flour and distribute it you will employ thousands, but if you mill it and distribute it you will not employ these people at all.</P>
    <P>I was asked one other question which was raised by Deputy O'Sullivan before, and that is whether the mixing of meals on a farmer's premises is illegal. The point was raised by Deputy O'Sullivan before, but I thought it such a far-fetched point, if you like, that I did not look it up in the meantime. Assume that the Minister and the judges have lost their commonsense to such an extent that the Minister will bring a farmer before a judge and say, &ldquo;This man is mixing meal on his own premises,&rdquo; and that the judge would convict him.  We have, at least, power under the Bill to licence the farmer to do this mixing if the thing appears to be illegal.  The Deputy admits that <Col N="465" /> the present Minister would not bring a farmer to court for mixing grain on his own premises.  I could not imagine any Minister, no matter what Party he might belong to, being so bereft of commonsense as to bring a farmer to court for such an offence.  As I said, if a Minister did so I could not conceive any judge losing his commonsense to such an extent as to convict such a farmer.</P>
    <P>Some of the matters covered by this Bill have been operated in a provisional way up to the present.  That matter, for instance, of mixing.  To come back to the west coast.  Up to the present we could not possibly make any exceptions, because we were operating the mixing scheme under a provisional <Col N="466" /> order.  When the Bill becomes law, however, we have power to make regulations, and if the outdoor officials of the Department of Agriculture advise us that in any particular area on the west coast there is hardship under this mixing scheme from the point of view of getting maize for human consumption we have ample power to make the necessary regulation to deal with that area.  I have no objection to giving the undertaking that I gave on a previous occasion, that if the officials of the Department in any area report to me that a relaxation or change in the regulations is necessary I shall have no hesitation in acting on that report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to speak on this measure on Friday last, when I was told that progress had to be reported.  That put out of my mind what I intended to say.  This being Wednesday, I am not able to remember what I was thinking about last Friday; I never think about the same thing every day in the week.  There is no evidence to show that at any period before the introduction of the Sweepstakes any man, woman or child who required hospital treatment was refused it.  That being the case, I read with some astonishment the report of a dinner held at the College of Surgeons on Saturday night.  The President of the College, proposing the toast of prosperity to Ireland, expressed the firm belief that the days of the voluntary hospitals were over.  I went through other newspapers to see if there was an expression of regret by any of those assembled at the dinner because the days of the voluntary support of hospitals were over, and I could find none.  I submit, with all respect to the learned gentleman concerned, that the majority of the hospitals, certainly in Dublin if not throughout the whole of Ireland, were founded on the voluntary principle and sustained by it through many generations, even in very difficult times and under very hard circumstances.  I should have thought that there would be some expression of regret on the part of men so closely identified with hospitals all their lives, but there was none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I am speaking against this Bill is because, in my opinion, the Government should not have made these sweepstakes permanent.  I know that certain difficulties presented themselves because of legislation previously enacted by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  Nevertheless, I do submit that the principle of sweepstakes, certainly permanent sweepstakes, is not a principle that should have been supported by our Government here.  I am not opposed to sweepstakes at all.  But I do not <Col N="469" /> like that they should become a portion of our national life and national policy in the future.  It is perfectly open to every man, rich or poor, to back horses and to take part in any form of sport he wishes.  I am not against that.  I believe the poor man has a right to back horses and to go to races as much as the rich man.  Absolutely as much right.  But what I do object to is the permanency of this thing, which will give a certain amount of imprimatur to sport.  What I mean by &ldquo;sport&rdquo; is money-making sport. I am getting fairly well on in years but I think I will live to see money-making sport a big business in this country, a business which is going to bring out every effort of men's minds, efforts that should be directed to far higher and greater things.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing to find the progress that this money-making sport business has made in recent years.  I remember the time when it was just an incident in a man's life, and no more, to go to the races now and again and that sort of thing.  In a special race such as the Derby or that class of race in England, he backed a horse.  But it was no more than that.  Gradually in recent years it has risen to be a very big thing indeed.  Why, you see in the newspapers every day that more than half of their contents is given over to sport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Even half of the newspaper is given over to sport.  It is there in front of us.  From the early Spring to the late Autumn there are races every day in the week and from the late Autumn to the early Spring there is football, so that the whole year round there is nothing but sport Having regard to what one hears about people wanting a lot of money and all this thing about sport putting money in one's pockets, it is no wonder that <Col N="470" /> the temptation is spreading to all classes of people.  Now we have the Government here giving a permanence to sweepstakes.  I wish&mdash;but I do not think my mind is subtle enough for it&mdash;to differentiate between the man who backs horses and the man who gambles.  I have seen in the dictionary the meaning of the word &ldquo;gamble&rdquo; is to play for money.  I believe that in gambling and in the extra forms of gambling there is still a remnant who play for sport.  I am speaking of the sport that has got into men's minds every day of the year, the desire and the wish to have cheap money and to take part in the various forms of sport.</P>
      <P>I could give hundreds of examples of it.  I will just give a couple.  Last Friday when I left this House to open my shop at 2 o'clock in the day, a well-dressed elderly woman came and said to me: &ldquo;Could you tell me the name of Steve Donoghue's mount in to-day's race?&rdquo;  She was no more a sportswoman that I am a woman.  I gave her the name of Steve Donoghue's mount in the day's race and I asked her would I put paper and cord around it so that she would not lose it on the way home.  She grew very indignant and left my shop very angry at the idea of being received in such a discourteous manner.  If any of you here want Steve Donoghue's mount, or Canty's mount, or Beary's mount, or Gordon Richards' mount or any other mount will you consult me by appointment, and I will give them to you. My fame has spread through my connection with the Turf, for you may believe it that for the last three years or less I have been the recipient of various communications enclosing to me letters for the Sweepstake people, saying they saw my name in some newspaper or some directory, and asking me would I be good enough to have this delivered to the Sweepstakes' office as they were afraid of sending direct through the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One man, especially, from Canada, and his name is Kelly, sends me two letters previous to each Sweep.  In each of the letters there is always enclosed a birthday card wishing me a happy birthday and there is also a very small <Col N="471" /> coin to defray the postage.  The coin is of no use to me.  I could not buy a stamp for it in the Post Office because if I presented that coin in the Post Office the assistant would look at me very suspiciously.  It would be absurd to bring the coin to Cook's and my conscience will not allow me to give it in charity.  The only thing I can do with it is to give it to the new political association which the people over there are forming.</P>
    <P>There is another correspondent of the same name of Kelly from South Africa who sends me enclosures for Sweepstakes.  He, I think, described himself in one of his letters as &ldquo;agent,&rdquo;&ldquo;trader&rdquo; or &ldquo;commercial traveller&rdquo; Evidently he was inducing the natives in that portion of the world to buy Sweepstake tickets, because he told me in his second letter that I would not believe the interest the people there were taking in Dublin now. That took a good deal of worry off me because I was always anxious that the natives of South Africa would think well of Dublin.  His communications have ceased.  Probably he sold the tickets to the natives and these chaps seeing that they were not getting quick returns or that they were getting no results from their investments in the Sweepstakes have ceased to give their money to Kelly the traveller, the trader or the agent, who probably had to shift his quarters elsewhere.  These things are very funny in their way, but it only goes to show how far this wish for easy money engendered by this class of business and this class of sport has gone.</P>
    <P>The very last letter I got, a few months previous to the last sweep, was in this form:&mdash;&ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;I send you enclosed and if I pick a horse would you be good enough to say that you sold me the ticket in Dublin, because if the people out here know that I picked a horse there will be a lot of people watching me and I will not be able to get a prize.  If I back a horse I will reward you in very good style.&rdquo; If his reward is in keeping with what he used to send me by post there is certainly no fear of my celebrating, and I am certain I would go home <Col N="472" /> sober.  He concludes the letter in this way:&mdash;&ldquo;Hoping that I will pick a horse, Yours faithfully.&rdquo;  I do not know whether he picked a horse or not.  I hope that those who vote for this Bill will &ldquo;pick&rdquo; a horse until the horse is bare.  I could mention many of them who do not go in for sport but who are really evidently out for easy money by money-making sport.</P>
    <P>That is the reason that I oppose this Bill.  I shall not vote for it.  That does not matter one way or another but it matters a great deal to me and the class I represent because, amongst the working classes, this desire for easy money is growing apace.  I am sorry for it because it will bring in its train greed, selfishness and envy.  These are very serious matters, especially for those charged with any responsible office regarding government in this country. The voluntary hospitals have, up to this, done remarkably well.  The memory of those who founded and sustained them should not now be overclouded by big money.  That is what has happened. Otherwise, there would be some reference at this dinner of the College of Surgeons on Saturday evening to those who helped the hospitals, as I said before, for generations.  I hope sincerely that the future of the hospitals will be as good and as beneficial, especially to the suffering poor, as has been their past history.  If the old order is now changing and yielding place to the new, I hope the new order will be as beneficial to suffering humanity in connection with hospital work as the old order was.  I cannot help thinking&mdash;it was not so long ago since I read of it&mdash;of the efforts of a valiant woman, scarcely a hundred years ago, who, with tremendous faith, with a subscription of £50 and with a promise of £5 a year and four patients, established a hospital in this city which has become not only a credit to the country but, I might say, a credit to Europe&mdash;that is St. Vincent's Hospital. When I think of what that valiant woman did with such slender support, I hope the new order there, at any rate, will be as beneficial as her work was.  I mention her achievement in this assembly with great pride and <Col N="473" /> satisfaction and, with all my heart, bear tribute to her memory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertEDavitt" hpid="Dr. Davitt Dr. Davitt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Davitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the staff of one of Dublin's voluntary hospitals, I feel I must say something in connection with this Bill.  It would be absurd, at the outset, to hold that there was nothing good in the Bill.  For instance, I think that the section referring to the probability of provision being made for future research is a very good section.  Clinical research, as distinguished from laboratory research, is a type of work to which sufficient attention has not been paid in this country.  If it is the intention of the Government to help on clinical research under this Bill and not lose sight of that aspect in the more technical laboratory side, I should be thoroughly in favour of the Bill so far as it affects that particular point.  I gathered from the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary the other day that the policy of the Government is to aid the cities to become big centres for medical teaching and for medical advance. Many of the country Deputies will probably contend that that is not fair to the county and district hospitals. Owing mainly to the moneys already distributed from the sweepstakes, the county and district hospitals have had more funds at their disposal, and I do not think that as much good has accrued from that as one might have expected.  I am not a surgeon&mdash;I am a physician&mdash;but many surgeons have told me that decentralisation, so far as it has gone, has adversely affected the treatment of surgical cases in the county and district hospitals, owing to the fact that in many instances it is carried out by non-specialists.  As everybody knows, it is very hard to be perfect in any job when you have a lot of other jobs to do at the same time. The time of a surgeon who is attached to a county or district hospital may be taken up in various ways&mdash;apart from surgery&mdash;which keep him from becoming efficient in that particular branch of medicine.  As a result of that, treatment which is not sufficiently expert is applied in certain cases&mdash; especially surgical cases&mdash;to patients, with the result that they have to come up to Dublin later to get that treatment <Col N="474" /> corrected.  If it is the tendency of this Bill to centralise specialised teaching and specialised treatment in the cities, I think it is a very good tendency.</P>
      <P>What I do not like about the Bill is the retrospective portion of it.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, on the last day on which the Bill was discussed, pointed out that when the previous sweepstakes were before the public, money was asked for under almost a guarantee that a certain percentage would be applied to the relief of certain hospitals.  That money has now been collected, and the Government intend, judging by this Bill, to use it for other purposes.  If the purposes, in their opinion, are good purposes, that does not take away from the fact that they are breaking contract with the public. This affects the hospital managing committees.  They have entered into commitments.  That has been pointed out already, but it is no harm to emphasise it.  Contracts have been made with builders and others on the assumption that the hospitals in question would have a certain amount of money at their disposal.  They were entitled to expect that they would get these moneys from the distribution of the funds now held up.  They have no guarantee that they will get any portion of these moneys, and naturally they cannot be blamed for being extremely restless, in view of what may occur to the commitments and contracts into which they have entered.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, or to put him off the trend of his speech, but he is developing a line of argument against the Bill that is really not applicable in the circumstances.  It is admitted that many of the participating hospitals have embarked upon schemes of construction and equipment, on the assumption that certain moneys will be made available to them, as a result of the sweeps that have already taken place.  I think it only right to say that it is the intention of the Government, and the Minister for Local Government, to advise the Minister for Justice to release certain moneys that have already accrued in respect of two sweepstakes, the Grand <Col N="475" /> National and the Derby of 1932.  As far as I understand, the committees of the associated hospitals will be quite satisfied with the release of these moneys, and it is hoped to reach agreement with them for any scheme of extensions they carry out as a result of the disbursement of these moneys, and that they will, as far as possible, fit in ultimately to the co-ordinated plan we hope to put into operation.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if there is anything of that kind in the Bill? There is no such pledge in the Bill and, as far as I understand what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, that applies to two sweeps only.  It does not apply to the breach of faith with the public in the third sweep.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney suggests, that does not affect the principle.  The Government, by this Bill, are going back on the contract they made with the public. To-day the Parliamentary Secretary has been kind enough&mdash;and we appreciate his kindness&mdash;to offer a certain amount of these moneys which have accrued to the hospitals, in order, more or less, to keep them quiet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Davitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, it is theirs by right.  Why was this retrospective section introduced into this Bill? When the Parliamentary Secretary found it necessary to meet a deputation from the hospitals I believe he promised that one million would be released for division amongst them. I am very glad to hear that.  I was not aware of the fact until now.  That being so, the introduction of this section in the Bill is a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a good deal of discussion on the last day regarding the admission of patients to hospitals.  Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Dowd spoke on the question, and it has also come up for discussion in the Press.  There may be instances&mdash;and to-day I heard of a certain instance&mdash;occurring where, owing to stupidity, either on the part of an official, a nurse, or someone <Col N="476" /> connected with a hospital, a patient who should be admitted was not admitted.  These mistakes will occur, because as long as man is man you will have the human element entering, and an error of the kind occurring.  Nevertheless, I say that Dublin hospitals do not refuse beds to poor patients. Very often they put up extra beds for special cases.  What I mean by special cases are those where the point is made by a doctor outside, or by a subscriber, or maybe by patients coming in, that urgency demands that they should be admitted, after it is made quite clear that they cannot be admitted to another hospital with celerity.  I have often seen a bed put up specially, at inconvenience, and in a manner that would encroach on the proper space for patients in a hospital ward, in order to receive such a patient at short notice.  That results very often in complaints being made by the patient afterwards, that the ward was overcrowded.  Many poor patients do not understand that while a ward may look big it will only contain a certain number of beds, if it is to conform to public health regulations and public health considerations.  There are many instances of patients who are known as &ldquo;hospital birds.&rdquo;  I have seen a great many examples of patients who were, as it is popularly known, &ldquo;swinging the lead,&rdquo; by trying to get in.  I know one example where a poor man was in a certain hospital and was very bad.  The man beside him in the ward said to him: &ldquo;How do you like this place?&rdquo;  My friend said: &ldquo;I like it all right.  I did not come here for amusement.  I came here to be treated.&rdquo;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the other patient, &ldquo;this place is not nearly as good as it used to be; the catering has gone down terribly.  I think I will drop over to the Meath for a fortnight.&rdquo; There are many of these cases put through the Dublin hospitals. You will find men who want a rest using every possible effort to get in either through a subscriber's influence or who, through misrepresenting their symptoms at the out-patients' department, are taken in by the house-surgeon on duty, on the principle that <Col N="477" /> there might be something wrong. Such patients occupy beds in the wards which properly should be given to other patients.  Needless to say, they are usually evacuated as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dowd referred to the stigma attaching to the Union hospital. Knowing the poor people of Dublin I have no hesitation in agreeing with the statement, that there is a stigma attaching to the Union hospital.  But the Deputy proposed a most extraordinary remedy.  He suggested that a large central hospital should be provided in Dublin, in which specialised treatment would be available, which the poor could call their own.  Then the Deputy said that union hospitals have always been a failure, because a certain stigma attached to them, and that patients were reluctant to go into them for treatment.  The provision of a big central hospital solely for the poor would mean that anyone who went into the big hospitals would be immediately segregated from those who went to the other hospitals in Dublin.  You would be merely making a huge union hospital, and the stigma, instead of departing would become greater with the size of the hospital.  You would have exactly the same dislike on the part of the poor patients to such an hospital as you have at present to entering the Union hospital.  I do not think that you can better the system where poor patients are treated side by side with patients who pay a certain amount, whether that amount is considered reasonable or not.  Poor patients do not like to be called or to be treated as paupers.  If a patient can get treatment in a hospital which is not supposed to be for the poor alone, and if the stigma of pauper is not applied&mdash; the feeling may be due to human weakness, but it is a thing which exists and which we have to recognise in the system in vogue&mdash;that might meet the case.  Of course in the voluntary hospitals in Dublin poor patients are treated side by side with patients who are paying something&mdash;it may not be much.</P>
    <P>With regard to the remarks of Deputy Kelly which, although not <Col N="478" /> exactly on the same line, bore at least some resemblance to those of Deputy Thrift, about raising money by gambling, I do not think that anybody pays much serious attention to that kind of argument.  It is said that sweepstakes are demoralising, but I do not see what demoralising effect the investment of ten shillings in a sweepstake ticket for the benefit of the hospitals could have.  There are far more demoralising things going on at the moment and little attention is paid to them.  There is a great deal in the Bill that deserves commendation.  No objection could be made to the provision for a thorough examination of the accounts of the hospitals, because when public money is being distributed, in such large amounts, no one can object to representatives of the public, appointed, if you like, through the Government, seeing how this money is dealt with and whether it is being used to the best advantage.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party in bringing forward on this, and on a previous occasion, the treatment of the poor in the Dublin hospitals, did a great national service.  In spite of the speeches we have heard about the wonderful treatment the poor get, and despite all the statements made by people connected with the hospitals in the Press, it is a well-known fact that the poor in the Dublin hospitals get callous and scandalous treatment. They are looked upon as a class apart, as a kind of pariahs.  I, who have some knowledge of the subject, desire to avail of this occasion, to raise my voice in protest against their treatment, and to hope that there will be a change in that direction because of the large amount of money these hospitals are getting through legislation passed by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to be a member of a board of public health.  We have occasion to send patients to various Dublin hospitals for different kinds of treatment. We pay&mdash;it was ridiculed in a previous debate on one of those Hospital Bills&mdash;an adequate sum for the maintenance and treatment of those patients.  We have heard from them repeatedly&mdash;and all their statements <Col N="479" /> cannot be false&mdash;of the callous treatment they get from the staffs of the hospitals.  Consequently those who first ventilated this matter, as I said in my opening statement, are doing a national service.  I know, in some of those hospitals, patients after serious operations have been thrown upon a bed and left there for hours without a drink of water.</P>

      <P>This Bill is very necessary.  It tightens things up and makes for good administration of the huge sums of money that have been placed at the disposal of the hospitals in this country.  Deputy Davitt spoke of breaches of faith and referred to something Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney had said, but Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, when he introduced the original Sweepstakes Bill, did not believe the hospitals would benefit to one-tenth of the extent that they have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was during the tenure of office of his Party that the Bill was introduced and passed, and, as Minister for Justice, he administered the Bill, and I say that he did not believe, and no member of his Government believed, that the hospitals would get one-tenth of what they got since that Bill was passed.  Even if the Sweeps ceased at the present moment the Dublin hospitals would have been well away with the huge sums that they got from previous Sweeps, and there would be no breach of faith whatever with the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davitt has spoken about decentralisation and that, as a consequence of decentralisation, certain surgical operations were a failure. But I would point out, subject to correction by the Parliamentary Secretary, or some one who has a more intimate knowledge of the matter than I have, that there has been, practically, no centralisation yet in the Free State, <Col N="481" /> as a result of the moneys at the disposal of the local authorities.  I think, with the exception of the County Mayo, my own county is the only one that has attempted to go in for hospital reconstruction as a result of the grants we got under the Sweepstakes Acts.  It will take two years before our reconstruction is complete.  I do not know if the Mayo hospital reconstructions are completed yet.  There is one thing I would point out as a result of the new conditions that are to be: We will be enabled to accommodate a far greater number of poor patients. We will be able to provide on our own premises a house surgeon.  The whole matter will not be left in the medical officer's hands.  We will have a better staff, a better operating theatre and other equipment which is necessary in a modern hospital.  Decentralisation would be a blessing to us and I take it it would be a blessing to every other county and would save the ratepayers hundreds of pounds.  The fact in connection with the county hospitals is that we have perforce to send patients to Dublin hospitals, because we have not the accommodation for them, even for very minor operations that the surgeons attached to those county hospitals are quite capable of performing.  Decentralisation, when it comes about as a result of the grants made already and those about to be made, will be a blessing in every area.</P>
    <P>There is another matter&mdash;perhaps it is not exactly in connection with this Bill&mdash;to which, with the permission of the Chair, we might be permitted to refer.  There is a section here which deals with employment in the manufacture of tickets, and the manufacture of the paper for the tickets.  This whole Sweepstakes business exists because of legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  The principle in employment which the Government stands for, namely, employment for the most necessitous, should obtain in connection with the giving of employment in the Sweeps.  I would like to see an amendment to this Bill insisting on that.  We had recently an indication in the Press that certain people interested in employment in the city were going to picket the Sweepstakes offices, <Col N="482" /> because of unfairness in the giving of employment.  Deputy T. Kelly has referred to the growing greatness of this business.  I do not see eye to eye with the Deputy on this Sweepstakes business, but I do agree with him that the power of those people is immense, and that with the growth of the Sweeps it is increasing.  People outside say that they are greater even than the Government.  Those people should be brought to realise that they exist and have their being because of facilities given by the passing of certain legislation in this House, and that in the employment they give they have a duty to the unemployed.  It is a well-known fact&mdash;I am not going to mention the names of individuals here, any more than I would mention the names of hospitals, because I am in a privileged position&mdash;that in some cases three or four people out of the same wealthy family are in positions in the Sweepstakes offices.  Those people are not mere hewers of wood or drawers of water; they are not merely girls on 30/- or 35/- a week who address envelopes. It is a well-known fact that the wives of servants of the State, of officers serving in the National Army, and of members of the Gárda Síochána, are in big positions in those offices, whilst qualified people, fit to fill those positions, go abegging through the streets of Dublin, and of every city in the Free State.  The people in charge of the Sweepstakes offices should be brought to their senses by the Department of Justice and the Department of Local Government.  They should be made to realise that they exist because of special facilities extended to them by the Oireachtas, that in the giving of employment they should be fair and just, and that they should not act in a high-handed fashion, or with the favouritism which has distinguished them up to the present.</P>
    <P>There is one other point mentioned by Deputy Davitt about the Union hospitals.  He quoted my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd.  While what they say may be true about the Dublin Union Hospital, those Deputies who know the working of the county hospitals in the various counties will agree with me that there is no stigma attached to <Col N="483" /> them now.  Since amalgamation took place under the First Dáil the only complaint against county hospitals is that they are crowded over their capacity, and nobody thinks there is any stigma attached to going into them.  The extension of them, and the building of new ones under this Bill, will be a blessing to everybody concerned.  I welcome this Bill.  I would like to see it more rigid in its clauses so as to provide for more control and supervision by the Government.  Deputy Fitzgerald came in with an interruption a few minutes ago, which gave us to think that those people were above the law&mdash;that they were something which existed and had no origin in a Bill like this.  This Bill should be even more rigid to control the activities of those people, to remind them that they are responsible to this House for their conduct, and to ensure that the money is spent in a proper, systematic fashion that will do the greatest possible good to the greatest possible number of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not enamoured of the Minister's Bill.  It provides in the first place for, I might say, an almost excessive Ministerial control of the sweepstakes in general, a control which cannot be justified in the light of the success of previous sweepstakes. Up to this, the sweepstakes have been running rather smoothly.  There has been very little expressed dissatisfaction either with the allocation to hospitals, the control of the funds, or the manner in which the people who actually carried out the sweepstakes did their business.  Deputy Kennedy said a moment ago that, in his particular county, there was a hospital set up or augmented to such an extent that they were going to have new buildings, new nurses, new doctors and several other facilities, and that provision would be made for them.  Provision was made for them by the very facilities that were expressed in the Act which the Minister is now amending, or in fact changing altogether in its scope.  There was an examination of the needs of all the various hospitals that applied for relief, and there were <Col N="484" /> a number.  There was a careful examination made of what they needed in the way of buildings, staff, etc., and the endowment necessary to carry on the work when the grants had ceased. All this was arranged for under the old Act.  Deputy Kennedy seemed to assume that the new Bill would lead to improvement in his hospital.  There is no assurance that it will.  It is all in the lap of the Minister whether he sees fit to increase the benefits that accrued to the hospitals under the previous Sweepstakes Bill.</P>
      <P>The most lamentable clause in the Bill is that which makes it retrospective in respect of the allocation of certain funds.  The Minister might at least have left alone the sweepstakes that were authorised under an Act of this Dáil, which were carried out correctly, which were considered by the Hospitals Committee set up to consider sweepstakes and appointed by the hospitals concerned, which after that consideration were put into the hands of the people who carry out the sweepstakes, the Hospitals Trust Committee, and by them advertised all over the world.  In these advertisements they guaranteed that by the expenditure of a certain sum, the subscriber was in fact subscribing a certain sum for certain hospitals, for the provision of prize-money and a certain sum for expenses.  The purpose for which subscribers contributed their money was definitely stated.  Any departure from that definite contract is, if not illegal&mdash; the Minister proposes to make it legal &mdash;certainly immoral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the specific purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The specific purpose was that a certain sum would be allocated to certain hospitals.  The Minister is going to upset that now by making the Bill retrospective.  He has to go hat in hand to the Hospitals Committee themselves and make half an arrangement to encroach on the fund, robbing them of proceeds which should go to two of the hospitals. There were four or five concerned.  He has no more moral right to divert this money from these two than he had from the other three.  There is no moral justification <Col N="485" /> for a departure from a specific contract made in writing, which passed before three or four separate committees and which was finally put before subscribers, telling them that their money was to be utilised for a certain purpose and that purpose only. This is a departure from any honest amending legislation.  We have had retrospective clauses in many Bills but I venture to say in no Bill has there been a retrospective clause which so violently and immorally impinged on the working of a previous measure where it was well worked as this.</P>
      <P>I notice that none of the Deputies on the opposite benches who intervened in this debate spoke in glowing terms of this measure.  Deputy Dr. O'Dowd spoke for a considerable time and his only contribution to help the Minister was a series of pious hopes that the Minister would do this or that in respect of the Bill.  He was not able to point out a single clause in the Bill which would help, except the Minister in his wisdom desired to give assistance to the various hospitals.  There was nothing in this Bill as there was under the old Act to ensure that certain benefits were to accrue to particular hospitals. There is nothing in the Bill such as the Labour Party and other Parties fought for under the old measure.  That is the provision that a certain proportion of the beds in hospitals should be reserved solely for the poor.  There was a provision in the old Act that at least 25 per cent. of the beds should be reserved for the poor.  Where was the necessity for eliminating that provision in this Bill?  Again, we are left to the tender mercies of the Minister to see that effect is given to what was specifically stated in the measure he is now amending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is possibly some good in the Bill.  Personally, I would want a microscope to see it, as far as it is an advance on the other Act.  I am opposed to the Bill mainly and principally because of the one clause that makes it retrospective.  I believe there is no justification in the mind of any Deputy who has studied the Bill for making this clause retrospective.  The fact that the Minister has had himself within the last 24 hours to enter into <Col N="486" /> an agreement with the Hospitals Committee giving them something, in part is an admission that he himself is not a believer in the retrospective clause.  I hope that at another stage the Minister will accept an amendment to wipe out the retrospective effects of the Bill and accept also some other amendments which will make the Bill harmonise more with the needs of the hospitals and with the desires of subscribers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this Bill principally from the point of view of the aim I endeavoured to secure when I was associated with the introduction into this House some months ago of a certain Bill.  That Bill had for its object the checking of grave abuses that existed in many of the hospitals which benefited under previous schemes or which were likely immediately to benefit.  It might be no harm to mention again some of the cases we had in mind on that occasion. The cases did not concern entirely the very, very poor.  Provision was available for such patients, but the abuses concerned the very considerable number of people who from time to time need hospital treatment, but who are not entitled to free medical relief. I took the case of a small farmer or his wife or children who could not pay two guineas or three guineas a week in a hospital.  They could pay, perhaps, 15/- or £1 a week.  I think I demonstrated to the House on that occasion that here, in the City of Dublin, which is so free from reproach as well as one could judge from the speeches made here this evening, there were hospitals that absolutely declined to accept patients, although such patients were not anxious to be treated as free patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one case, a patient was anxious to pay £1 a week but when the hospital authorities saw that there was a chance of such people being sent in through the agency of the board of health, thereby netting for themselves £2 or £3 a week from the rates, they advised the patient to go back and to be sent to the hospital through the agency of the board of health.  I pointed out that there was one hospital <Col N="487" /> in the City of Cork that absolutely declined to take a patient of that kind at all.  They absolutely shut their doors to all patients except those who could pay the ordinary fees charged in the hospital.  There was no place for the wife of the small farmer or for a member of that farmer's family or for himself, even though he offered, and was willing to pay, the most he could afford to pay in any hospital.  That type of case could not be regarded as a case to be dealt with through the agency of the board of health and people in that position were nobody's children.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the manner in which the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister met us on that occasion. The Parliamentary Secretary was sympathetic and willing to understand our needs and he promised that a full and comprehensive measure that would deal with very many more aspects of this whole question than we were capable of enshrining in the small measure that was put before the House at that time would be considered. Since that particular time, there has been no change in the policy of at least one hospital in Cork City, and, while I make reference to that hospital with regret, I want to pay a very well deserved tribute to the other hospitals in Cork City and to many hospitals outside Cork City which have benefited under the Sweeps scheme and which have very loyally carried out, and more than carried out, any obligations that were put on them to provide for certain types of patients.  Within the last three or four weeks, it came to my notice that an applicant for the blind pension who had to obtain a certificate from a certain hospital, or from a certain type of specialist in a certain hospital, was unfortunate enough to travel 40 or 50 miles to Cork to have the necessary examination carried out with a view to obtaining a certificate to enable him to qualify for a blind pension.  It would probably take ten or 15 minutes to attend to that particular case in the hospital, and I know two or three cases where such people were turned away from the hospital because <Col N="488" /> they did not take the necessary steps to have their cases sent through by the county board of health.</P>
    <P>I think it is a scandal that poor people should be treated in that way, and I do regret not to find any definite provision for dealing with abuses of that kind in the future.  I quite appreciate the Minister's desire and the Parliamentary Secretary's desire to see that the hospitals are at the disposal of all classes in the community whether they are in a position to pay or not, but I want the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to believe that their job in drawing the line as tightly as they can to check abuses of this kind in future, or the job of the immediate authority they establish over the hospitals, is going to be very difficult and I would like to have the position made very much clearer in this Bill than it is. I would sympathise with and support the plea made by a Deputy who has already spoken that the provision for retaining 25 per cent. of the beds in the hospitals for people who could not pay more than 10/- or 15/- a week should be again put into this Bill.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will, at a later stage, sympathetically consider an amendment to that effect. It is very necessary.  They may not be very many but, no matter how tightly this Bill is drawn, there will be certain hospitals in the country that will endeavour to evade its provisions, and, I say it advisedly, to obtain all the money they can under any scheme that will be put forward while shouldering as little of the responsibilities of that scheme as they possibly can, so that I should like to see this particular provision very tightly drawn, and not alone very tightly drawn but very closely watched afterwards.</P>
    <P>I am not quite in agreement with the suggestion that we ought to have larger hospitals in the cities and less development in the smaller hospitals in the country districts.  Reference has been made here to the stigma of pauperism that attached to certain hospitals under the control of the county boards of health.  I think that, to a great extent, that disability has been got rid of.  The local district hospitals and cottage <Col N="489" /> hospitals, as we know them now, have done a great deal, by the manner in which they are run, by the manner in which they were constructed and planned&mdash;and I confess that I was not very optimistic about this matter some years ago, but I am willing to admit that I was quite wrong&mdash;to do away with that prejudice and stigma.  As a member of a county board of health, I have found that people who are in a position to pay are sensible enough to avail of the excellent facilities many of the district hospitals now afford for the treatment of cases that formerly had to be treated in big central hospitals.  It is, perhaps, too late to convince the Parliamentary Secretary on this matter, but I think he might, even yet, give some little consideration as to whether it would not be a wiser policy to develop, encourage and assist in every possible way the district hospitals and cottage hospitals.  They are doing excellent work, and they have been fortunate enough to get into their service, in a great many places, very able surgeons who are doing an extraordinary amount of good work. He will find, as his predecessors found, that the centralisation of hospital services is not a step that is very cordially received by a great many people in the country.  I would prefer to see the policy that was enshrined in previous local government administration, of developing the smaller hospitals, continued for the present. There may have to be some extensions made in the larger areas, but I think that the unit in the matter of good, sound local government administration ought still to be the district hospital or the local cottage hospital.</P>
    <P>These are the two points I would like to mention in connection with the Bill.  We shall have an opportunity of discussing them on a later occasion.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply would be good enough to advert to them and to throw some further light on our little difficulties. If the objects that were sought to be attained under the previous Bill can be attained in any other way than the way we indicated in that Bill, I think we will be very satisfied and very pleased, but <Col N="490" /> experience has taught us to be very cautious in a matter of this kind and to make sure that we leave nothing undone to check abuses that, undoubtedly, have crept into a certain number of the hospitals with regard to the treatment of people who were borderline cases and who were not, strictly speaking, poor law cases but people who could afford to pay very little.  I commend these points to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary and I trust that he may be able to give us some further information on the matter in the course of his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesIvanMcGuire" hpid="Mr. J.I. McGuire Mr. J.I. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.I. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill for several reasons, all of which I do not propose to elaborate. When these Hospitals' Sweepstakes were first legalised in this country, the sole justification for their legalisation was that they were created for charitable purposes.  The charitable purpose for which the sweepstakes were legalised was that of providing the hospitals with very badly-needed money.  The present Bill puts the supervision of the way in which that money is going to be dealt with entirely under the control of the Minister.  As we all know, money which was segregated for the purposes of the hospitals for a number of sweeps was, to a certain percentage, the exact amount of which I am not aware, raided by the present Government for the general purposes of the Exchequer.  I am told that that is not so.  It is whispered to me from behind. But that is my impression&mdash;that a certain percentage of moneys going to the hospitals has been taken or is going to be taken by the present Government and used for the general purposes of the Exchequer.  It seems to me that one is entitled to suspect that this present Bill, in so far as it puts the control of these moneys entirely under the care of the Minister, is framed for the purpose of enabling him to keep the expenditure, so far as it is directed towards the improvement of the hospitals, as low as possible, with the object in view, of course, of attracting as much as <Col N="491" /> possible of the money to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I had not meant to contribute to this discussion at all except for a speech which was delivered a few minutes ago by Deputy Kennedy.  Deputy Kennedy made the suggestion that the Minister should see that the employees of the Hospitals' Trust&mdash; of the Sweepstake organisation&mdash;should be drawn from a certain class of the community, the unemployed class.  That is typical of a number of suggestions which I have heard made here from both the Fianna Fáil Benches and the Labour Benches since I came into the Dáil.  In other words, because a man is unemployed and badly in need of money, that is to be the sole criterion by which one is to go in order to decide whether or not it is he or someone else who is to get the job.  Deputy Kennedy appeared to forget that the sweepstakes are a huge business proposition and that the organisers of the sweepstakes have made a colossal success of that business proposition.  The suggestion of the Deputy is that when they are deciding what hands they should take into the Hospitals' Trust in order to carry on this great machine of sweepstake work, they should have regard, first and foremost, to the pecuniary position of the applicant for the job. The Deputy absolutely ignores the necessity, first of all and primarily, regarding the capabilities of the person applying for the job to perform that job.  I know of a case in the City of Cork where a doctor's daughter was given a job in the sweepstakes.  She was given a job in the foreign department. About a day afterwards a picket was put outside the sweepstake office in that city and an outcry was raised because a doctor's daughter was given a job.  The picket, however, was removed after a very short time when the ringleaders of the agitation were asked to produce a girl who could speak four languages and write and conduct a correspondence in four languages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be far better if the Government were to keep their hands out of the business side of this proposition. I do not wish now to discuss the proposition <Col N="492" /> that it is not part of the function of the Government to interfere in the business life of the community, but I think it is patent, and will be patent to everyone, that the great success of this sweeps organisation certainly entitles it to be left alone to go on, as it is run, on the most successful lines possible.</P>
    <P>There is one other reason, which I should like to mention, for my opposition to this Bill.  As I understand the position, it was pointed out to me a few days ago, when speaking to the governor of a hospital in this city, that arrangements had actually been entered upon and that big contracts have been entered into with firms in Ireland for the construction of buildings in connection with some of the largest hospitals in this country.  These contracts have been actually completed. As has been pointed out already here in debate to-night, money was raised from the public on the understanding that that money was going to be used for hospital work and for hospital work solely.  I may misunderstand the position, but if my informant is correct&mdash;the governor of this hospital to whom I have already referred&mdash; he tells me that schemes which they have had on foot are now about to collapse by reason of the provisions of this Bill.  That is a very serious matter from the point of view of the hospitals of Dublin to-day, and I would certainly impress upon the Minister the necessity of looking into that difficulty and of giving it every consideration before this Bill proceeds to its final stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I really cannot understand the opposition to this Bill when I try to examine the various points of view put forward by those who state they are in opposition to it.  The last speaker, Deputy McGuire, my colleague from the South City, has given very many reasons why he objects to the Bill.  I am afraid that I must confess, after listening to him, that I believe that he, first of all, does not know what the Bill is about and, secondly, that he does not understand the situation from his own personal experience of, particularly, the city hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> First of all, I am in full accord with this Bill and I am in full accord with it not only from the provisions or expressions enshrined in the Bill but because it is completely in line with the point of view held by us on this side of the House when we were in opposition and when the sweepstakes were first inaugurated.  Deputy McGuire does not understand, first of all, that this is not a Bill to interfere with the management of the people who are promoting the sweeps as such.  As far as I can see, there is nothing in the Bill to interfere with the running of the business of the sweeps as such. The purpose of the Bill is to try to control the manner in which the money that falls to the hospitals is to be appropriated by the various hospitals and in what manner it is to be spent. I have a little experience of various hospitals in this city.  I am on the governing board of a hospital and I know, from my own experience, that it would be far better if the Government were to take even a greater interest, legislatively, in the matter.  Deputy McGuire does not know the difficulties that confront the governors of hospitals. In the first instance, I should like to inform the House that nobody at all anticipated that the success of this Hospitals Trust would be anything like near what it has been and what it still continues to be.  No hospital ever thought that it was going to get during the whole lifetime of the sweepstakes what it got, as a matter of fact, out of a single sweepstake. When they got this money they decided to erect buildings and to make certain structural alterations and when they had got so far in this they found that they would have to invest a certain amount of the money coming in to meet the expenses which would arise from the upkeep of the additional facilities. Other things came up also.  Everybody is human, from the nurse up to the doctor in charge, and everybody saw for themselves the improved conditions under which they could live and under which they could give facilities to those who came into the hospitals.  I can see in the country districts every hospital thinking of the same thing and having a multiplication of facilities <Col N="494" /> which might not be necessary if there was proper co-ordination through some central authority.  I am satisfied that if an hospital is going to get certain money the money should only be granted, as is provided for in the Bill, according to the requirements of the hospital and the surroundings of the people it will be called upon to cater for.</P>
    <P>Deputies have made remarks about certain hospitals treating certain people in a certain manner and there has been a lot of public comment. From my experience of the many hospitals with which I am associated, as representing the Corporation on the boards, I cannot accept as an absolute fact that there is any ground for suggesting that hospitals have not done and are not doing all they possibly can for the poor.  Complaints were made to me in one or two cases by members of the Corporation.  On investigation, however, I found that it was not the hospital that was at fault but the person who made the complaint and that in fact the statements made were exaggerated.  It is not fair for Deputies to make these bald statements without having previously investigated them to find out if there was anything in them.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGuire laid stress on the fact that there was a suggestion made by Deputy Kennedy that the Government should see that, as far as possible, unemployed persons were given a preference for employment by the Hospitals' Trust.  Perhaps the Deputy does not know that the Government have already made representations to that effect, and that the Hospitals' Trust now engage all the people they possibly can through the labour exchanges.  As far as I know, that complaint arose from the fact that a lot of persons were employed there who were not in need of it, and who were doing work that could easily be done by unemployed persons.  That position has been rectified to a great extent, and is continually being rectified. I know that if any Deputy were to write to the Hospitals' Trust suggesting a person for employment he would get back a printed form which goes to every applicant stating that the Trust have decided, at the request of <Col N="495" /> the Government, I think, to employ anybody who is not a specialist in a particular branch through the labour exchange.  They are able, as a matter of fact, to-day to select their employees on merit, because they hold examinations and vacancies are now filled from the successful candidates.  At one time there was some reasonable ground for the complaint made by Deputy Kennedy, but efforts have been made to remedy that as far as possible.  I cannot understand Deputy McGuire saying that he objects to the Bill, and as a legal gentleman, giving as a reason that the Bill is doing something which it does not in fact intend to do, and does not seek to do; that it intends to interfere in the business side of the Hospitals' Trust.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesIvanMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I was dealing with Deputy Kennedy's speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGuire said he would not like the Government to interfere in any business or to go into business in any way.  I am sorry he was not here some years ago when the Government decided to go into business and, in fact, went into business and is in business to-day in competition with taxpayers and rate-payers, inasmuch as it opened up shops in competition with these people and carried on advertising out of the taxpayers' money.  I would have been glad to have his support then, and I hope I shall have his support when the occasion arises.  I hope he will join with me then in putting the Government out of business when it comes to competing with taxpayers and rate-payers. Another reason was that he did not want any interference with the hospitals.  They were to be given this money to spend in any way they liked. There was to be no suggestion as to whether there was a multiplication of facilities or a lack of facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesIvanMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must have misunderstood the Deputy's English and I think it would be very hard to suggest <Col N="496" /> that I would misunderstand a colleague from my own constituency. I would ask the Deputy really to state what his objections are.  If he had any practical experience of hospital work, beyond calling at the hospitals on the eve of the election canvassing and getting the nurses photographed with him, if he went there when the governing body sits and decides all the day-to-day things which crop up, I would like to hear him speak.  The course the Government is taking now is to regulate this huge sum of money and see that it will be spent in a way which will be of lasting and real benefit to the people for whom it was intended.  As I said, the difficulty that cropped up after the passing of the original Act was that the hospitals found themselves wealthy suddenly and they were able to embark on huge schemes of structural alteration and the acquisition of surrounding premises.  As a matter of fact, the suggestion was made in the Dáil by some Deputy that steps should be taken by the Government to see that for whatever additional expense was entailed in the shape of extra upkeep provision should be made out of this money.  I can only speak of the city hospitals which I know of, and I can say that they have been very judicious in that respect.  They realise that if for any reason the sweepstakes were to be stopped, or if they were not so successful as they have been, and if the money was to cease to come in, a position might be reached when the upkeep of the hospitals would either fall on the taxpayers or they would have to fall back on the system of voluntary subscription, which was never satisfactory from the point of view of giving the hospitals all they needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to direct the Minister's attention to a point that I have had in my mind for a long time.  I should like him to take note of the desirability of getting the hospitals to work together from the point of view of exchanging experiences.  I am talking of the voluntary hospitals in the city and the desirability of having some kind of central body through which there could be an exchange not only of <Col N="497" /> apparatus that hospitals might have but also of the technical skill of some of the eminent and very efficient medical men that they have on their staffs.  I do not know if it would be feasible now, but if we could get to the point of having more intercourse between the various hospitals professionally, as well as from the governing point of view, you would give an opportunity to the younger doctors and students of getting a far wider experience in the various branches of medicine than is available at present. At present some hospitals are renowned for their treatment in a particular medical branch and the students acquire extra knowledge by being in these hospitals.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, other hospitals are eminent in other branches of work, and I was hoping to hear that some thought would be given in that regard. I do not suggest there should be an amalgamation of hospitals.  I know that that is beyond hope at the present time.  One might almost suggest that we would like to see an amalgamation of Trinity College with the National University.  Conditions are as far apart in some of the hospitals. There should be some system of bringing about intercourse between medical men and the hospitals in such a manner that treatment could be, in a sense, exchanged.  There are hospitals in which certain cases are dealt with and patients are changed from one hospital to another for the purpose of special treatment.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill makes a start in the right direction, and anybody who has any desire to see this huge amount of money applied in a way that will give a lasting and really charitable benefit to the poor will find that this Bill gives every indication of going in that direction.  I cannot understand the opposition to it.  I would like to know if there is any means of saving the hospitals and the medical profession from a certain class of patient who is well able to pay for medical attention but who takes advantage of the dispensary system. That type of patient is examined and gets a bottle of medicine for one shilling, just as if he were an ordinary <Col N="498" /> poor person, while, in fact, he can well afford medical treatment.  Many hospitals have had to treat as poor people persons who are well able to afford treatment.  The hospitals cannot at the moment stop this abuse. I do not know whether the Minister has power under this Bill to suggest some means of restricting that practice.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear some real opposition offered to this Bill, if there is going to be any opposition.  As it is, suggestions are suddenly brought forward here without any previous consideration.  Deputy McGuire sought to base his opposition on the suggestion that the Government is interfering with the running of sweepstakes, a thing which it is not doing at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>While I disagree with my colleagues and others as to the underlying principles of sweepstakes, I cannot but agree with the underlying principles of this Bill.  The sweepstakes, as we know them to-day, have achieved very different results from what the most optimistic Deputy in this House imagined when we passed the original Bill.  The hospitals now find themselves in possession of very large sums.  The late Government appointed Commissioners to see that those sums were wisely spent.  Those Commissioners have done an amount of useful work.  When they were appointed I do not know that any of them had very much experience in hospital work, but during the three years that have elapsed since they were appointed I know that more than one of them has travelled a considerable part of the Continent acquiring experience in hospital administration so that they might more efficiently discharge the duties and responsibilities attaching to the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a great opportunity of doing an amount of good in connection with our hospitals, and I am anxious that we should rise to the occasion and make our hospitals such that they will be the admiration of medical men from all parts of Europe. Knowing something of the hospital problem on the one side and of the <Col N="499" /> finances that are available on the other side, I am quite satisfied that there is a great opportunity to do something useful.  But it does appear to me that the success of this scheme will depend almost entirely on the administrators appointed under this measure.  I do not know the number the Minister intends to appoint.  The Bill says they shall not be less than three.  I do not know what the maximum number will be.  All our experience points to having small committees. I think we will all agree that a small committee of practical men would be best fitted to discharge the many responsibilities that will fall to the committee under this piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>One problem that has been the subject of a great deal of discussion in our city during the last six or seven years has been the question of centralisation.  We have in this old city of ours some twelve to fourteen general hospitals, all discharging similar duties.  The aims of these hospitals are to get all the funds they can so that each one may be a complete entity.  I do not think that is a proposal that will appeal to men of experience and knowledge as a solution of a big problem of this character. I think men who have studied this problem will agree that from the point of view of training the medical men of the future and from the point of view of the patients who occupy beds in these hospitals, everything indicates a centralised scheme as being the most efficient.  There is now an opportunity of achieving that ideal. In the past that ideal was widely discussed and very largely agreed upon by medical authorities, but the difficulty lay in financing such a large problem.  The sweepstakes have provided funds that would enable a scheme of that character to be carried through there if the trustees should so decide.  In order to get the best results which would satisfy the old desire out of this opportunity, we must get really the best men to guide us.  And where the Minister is going to look for those supermen, men of very special knowledge, men of wide <Col N="500" /> training and wide experience I do not imagine at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Good women would be better than bad men.  I hope at all events when we come to look for such men that Party politics and other considerations of that character will not enter into their selection.  I hope the Minister will rise above such questions and appoint men on their own abilities and their special knowledge of the particular problem with which they have to deal.  I referred a moment ago to the fact that trustees had been appointed some three years ago to deal with the existing problem.  I learned with regret in the last few days that these trustees, who have acquired as I said considerable experience in the discharge of their duties, have now been set aside and three other trustees appointed in their places.  I have only heard that within the last few days and I do not know whether it is so or not.  That is the Hospitals Committee, the men who are discharging the duties at the moment of advising on the different hospitals, men whose duties as discharged in the past have been very similar to the duties which we hope these men should discharge in the future.  From my reading of the Bill I think that is so.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would advise us on that point.  What I am anxious to impress on the House is this: I do not know whether in connection with these appointments Party politics have entered into the problem at all but it does appear to me that our Ministers are influenced considerably by these considerations.  Whether, however, the members of the Hospitals Committee, who discharged these duties during the past three years have been set aside for good reasons I do not know, but I do hope that the men who have been appointed in their places are men who know more about the problem than they did.  What I want to impress upon the Minister is this, let us get three, four or five men if that number is necessary who will be capable of dealing with this problem in the way we would like to see it dealt with.  As I said in the beginning of my remarks, <Col N="501" /> we have a great opportunity and I hope we will rise to the occasion in a good way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think, listening to some of the speeches delivered here, that the hospitals in the city and country were Government blessings, that they were established by the Government, that they were having the running of them and that only for the Government there would be no consideration for efficiency or for the patients or sick persons from one end of the country to the other.  Now the facts are that the hospitals in bad times and under trying circumstances found themselves unable to provide the accommodation, treatment and other assistance that the suffering people of this country had been supplied with by these hospitals for a very long time. It was in this set of circumstances that a number of governors came before some members of the Executive Council then in office three or four years ago.  They put to the Executive Council the absolute necessity for some special dispensation of wealth if they were going to continue or to keep their doors open.  In these circumstances, although there was very strong opposition to sweepstakes and so forth, it was found that the money could not be provided from Government sources and that they ought not to be actively prevented from presenting to the Oireachtas a Bill which would enable them to raise money by sweepstakes.</P>
      <P>When one hears now that the hospitals have got huge sums of money and that they are very wealthy, one would expect that most of their troubles would have disappeared.  In the light of this measure we are still in the possession of the information that they have plenty of money.  Whether that is a fact or not I am not in a position to say.  I doubt it very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that I do not like this measure for very many reasons.  The principal of such reasons that I have against it is that there are 26 sections in the Bill, and out of the 26 sections there are two sections devoted towards the making of grants to these hospitals out of the funds, and another application for grants out of the Hospitals <Col N="502" /> Trust Fund.  They are the means and they are the supplies for the hospitals. The other 24 sections refer to various provisions of one sort or another, and to various regulations, committees, the persons to be employed, precautions to be taken and so forth, but so far as the hospitals are concerned only two sections. Observe the mind behind the framing of this measure.  We find that this new Hospitals Commission or Trustees, or whatever it is called, are to enter into possession of any moneys that are not yet disbursed.  Then the Minister proposes to deal with distribution of these funds which were collected under special circumstances, and under the guarantee of the governors and bodies representing the various hospitals.</P>
    <P>One would have imagined from the course of the discussion here that in the very difficult circumstances in which the hospitals found themselves in keeping open at all, that some tribute at least would have been paid to the various committees managing these hospitals; that some tribute would have been paid to the great services rendered by surgeons and medical men who freely gave a good deal of their time, and whose whole concern in their work is to have their hospitals a credit to their profession, a means of providing for the relief of suffering, the cure of disease and the other infirmities from which people suffer.</P>
    <P>Have any of those professional men and others who contributed so much of their time, so much of their genius and so much of the gifts that God gave them, been consulted about this measure?  Looking at it then one would have thought somebody sat down with a hostile notion in his mind towards the hospitals.  There are in the Bill two sections about the distribution of the funds, and then so many sections qualifying, regulating and so on.  The Minister may accept or reject any report made to him by the Hospitals Commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister may, apart altogether from the report, entirely on his own initiative make grants to the hospitals. I presume he does it under some <Col N="503" /> direction or some recommendation from somebody other than the Hospitals Committee or Trustees that are set up under this Bill.  There are two sets of Commissions&mdash;Trustees and Hospitals Commission.  There is suspicion even there.  Not satisfied with the bodies the Minister creates or with the bodies set up by the Minister himself, in addition to all this, it is not necessary to have in this case any professional assistance or advice as to how the distribution of the moneys is made to these hospitals.  It is not a good system, it is not a wise system.  It is not a system which if one were parting with his own money, or one making a will would follow. He would get some medical person or another; he would get some advice as to how the money would be spent if he were interested in the treatment of humanity.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Dublin hospitals are much better off than ever they were, that they have more money coming in than anybody had ever anticipated.  That is not quite correct. A letter appeared recently over the name of a governor or surgeon of one of these institutions, pointing out that his hospital had been at a disadvantage rather than an advantage as a result of the sweepstakes.  A book was given or lent to me some time ago by a member of this House.  Deputies on the opposite benches, or their friends, burned it a few years ago.  An account was given in that book of the first hospital established here in the eleventh or twelfth century by a man called Robert Le Palmer, a Dane. It had accommodation for 50 beds. In the course of an inquiry held into the Dublin hospitals in 1854, the question of that particular hospital came up for consideration. It was confiscated during the time of the Reformation.  A witness was asked what became of the property.  The property was seized by the Crown and sold.  Various people got it.  He was asked what about Guy's or St. Bartholomew's, or some other hospital in England.  He said that was also seized, but handed over to trustees and since maintained as a hospital.  There is no double dose <Col N="504" /> of sin in having a hospital endowed with money.  But a great mistake is made if, by reason of a huge experiment such as the sweepstake, large sums of money have come in from the charitable or speculative public for the assistance of the hospitals and the hospitals are worse off than they were because of its being held up.  In the letter which I have referred to it is stated that the sum deducted from the hospital in question is about £7,000 a year.  It may be £7,000 over two or three years, because it is some time since I read the letter.  Let us examine the position of that hospital having regard to the deprivation of these sums of money.  It is not the only hospital concerned.  I have heard of another hospital which had grants from the local authority and the Government amounting to £3,500.  What capitalised sum would be necessary to place that hospital in the same position as it was before its finances were interrupted by this shower of gold which, some people say, has come its way. £70,000 at 5 per cent. would be required to place that hospital in the position it was before the interruption.</P>
    <P>Going further through the Bill, I find that according to Section 24 (5) &ldquo;no grant out of the Hospitals Trust Fund shall be made or applied for or towards the future maintenance of the grantee.&rdquo;  According to sub-section (6) the expression &ldquo;the grantee&rdquo; means &ldquo;the hospital or organisation to whom a grant out of the Hospitals Trust Fund is made under this section.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; means &ldquo;ordinary day to day support and upkeep properly chargeable to income.&rdquo;  The expressions &ldquo;past maintenance&rdquo; and &ldquo;future maintenance&rdquo; mean respectively &ldquo;maintenance before and maintenance after the making of the grant out of the Hospitals Trust Fund in relation to which the expression is used.&rdquo;  In this Bill, provision is made for the endowment of a bed.  The endowment of a bed, I presume, would connote the maintenance of the bed. But if my interpretation be correct, no sum of money can be given to a hospital for future maintenance.  What, then, is the position of those hospitals which have been in the privileged position <Col N="505" /> of getting a few thousand pounds from Government funds which have been stopped by reason of this shower of sweepstake money which has come in and which, they say, they have not received?  Deputy Good has referred to the work done by the committee. The committee has done very useful work.  It has, at least, established standardised accounts, so that we now know where we are.  Very different accounts have got to be kept by different hospitals.  It is very easy to criticise the hospitals and to say that they do not give treatment to this, that or the other person.  Is there as much energy, determination and philanthropic effort used up by the persons concerned in looking for subscriptions for the hospitals as there is in criticising them?  There is scarcely any more expensive institution than a hospital and hospitals cannot give help of any sort or kind unless they get funds from some source.  By reason of the sweepstakes and of the conclusion people have come to that huge sums of money are available to the hospitals, public and private subscriptions have dried up.  I understand that the Minister is now going to let loose the sum of money which has been dammed up.  It is about time.</P>
    <P>There is mention in the first section of the Bill of the provision of money for medical research&mdash;a very interesting subject.  Perhaps the best contributors to it&mdash;I do not know whether I am right in chronological order or not&mdash;were Corrigan of Dublin, Pasteur of France, and Banting of Canada, the discoverer of insulin.  There was also a well-known German whose name, I think, was Von Lichtenberg.  There was also a Viennese who specialised in splints, Bohler.  It is rather interesting that not a single penny of research money was spent on any of these remarkable, providential discoveries.  That is very remarkable, indeed.  I should like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary can give us any indication of the results achieved in respect of the sums of money that have been spent on research.  These results ought to be available.  There are very rich research organisations in various parts of the <Col N="506" /> world, not excluding the Rockefeller Institute.  It would certainly interest me and, perhaps, a number of members of the medical profession if we could get some indication of the result of their labours.  I hope no laymen are to go into this business of medical research.  I am not expressing professional views upon it; I am simply stating historical facts.  I should be glad to have professional information on the subject, if available.  The Bill, as I said, has 26 sections and two of them are concerned with the hospitals.  The rest are concerned with new schemes of organisation and with reorganisation. The two which make reference to the hospitals disclose as many obstacles in connection with the distribution of the money as facilities. Everybody is agreed that our hospitals ought to be well equipped.  Equally important to the equipment of the hospitals is the maintenance necessary to allow them to be run.  There is not much use in having a Rolls Royce car if you have not oil or petrol or a person to drive it.  Similarly, if we are to look after the sick and infirm poor and alleviate suffering, we ought to see that these institutions which were running so well up to two or three years will not have their operations interrupted. I oppose the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to support this Bill because it will give the Minister power over moneys for the hospitals before being distributed. Under Section 24 the Minister will have power to make it a condition that a certain number of free beds will be available for small farmers, small shopkeepers or tradesmen who are unable to pay the charges demanded by the Dublin hospitals.  In my constituency we pay £5,000 yearly to the Dublin hospitals.  One poor person who came up to a Dublin hospital and offered to pay £1 weekly was advised to go back and to get in through the board of health.  During the last ten or 15 years I have never received a complaint regarding the treatment of patients in the Dublin hospitals.  I will certainly pay a tribute to the hospitals, and to the surgeons connected with them, both as a member of a public body and as one who has <Col N="507" /> been a patient.  I was a patient in two Dublin hospitals and I saw the surgeons giving their time and their skill regardless of whether they were poor or private patients.  The Wicklow Board of Health sends large numbers of patients to Dublin, and it has never received any complaints. I hope the Minister will consider the position of areas in close proximity to Dublin and that he will not be led away by appeals from public bodies to have large central hospitals.  While minor operations are performed in district hospitals the Minister should not consent to the building of large hospitals near centres which have as skilled staffs as there are in Europe, such as is the case in Dublin.  If a patient has to undergo a big operation that patient goes to Dublin, where there are specialists to deal with special complaints, instead of to an hospital where one man is supposed to be a specialist in all diseases.  For that reason I object to large hospitals being built in close proximity to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who voted for the previous Acts did so in the belief that there were to be free beds.  A hospital in my constituency received a very large sum of money, and, as a result, they are paying secretaries, and doctors, but the Board of Health have to pay for patients sent to that hospital&mdash;The Countess of Wicklow Hospital.  We have to pay two guineas a week for poor people sent to Dublin hospitals by the Board of Health, notwithstanding the large sums that these hospitals received from the sweeps. I believe that under Section 24 the Minister will have power to make it a condition, before any grant is given to hospitals, that a certain number of free beds will be available, or that there will be moderate charges for people who are poor or semi-poor, such as small farmers, small shopkeepers or tradesmen.  Deputy Briscoe pointed out that a certain number of people who were not poor availed of the hospital treatment given in Dublin.  People in the country have not that privilege.  The hospitals have to be paid two guineas weekly for <Col N="508" /> patients who are sent to them.  Now that large sums of money are to be distributed amongst the Dublin hospitals I want to know will the poor people in the country districts get advantages similar to those that the poor people in Dublin receive.  I am not going into the question of the employment given in the hospitals sweep.  That is a matter for other people.  As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, no tribute has been paid to the surgeons or to the hospitals. One Deputy suggested that the Labour Party brought forward the case of a patient who had been left without a drink of water after an operation. I do not think any member of the Labour Party brought forward such a charge.  As one who is a member of a hospital board, and who has been a hospital patient, I would like to pay a tribute to the surgeons, to the hospitals and to the nursing associations in Dublin.  I never saw any discrimination made between a poor patient and a private patient.  I hope the Labour Party will not be associated with the serious charge that was made by a board of health against the hospitals of the City of Dublin.  In his reply I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will explain the working of Section 24.  If I interpret it correctly the Minister will have power to make certain conditions, and to make the hospitals agree to the terms he suggests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of the Bill, as outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary, which I deprecate very much, and that is where he spoke of the general tendency to centralise hospitals in big centres and to have them run on big lines.  He instanced Stockholm, where it is contemplated having one hospital for something like 1,500 patients, and Copenhagen where a hospital was contemplated for the treatment of about 1,000 patients. This is another instance of the terrible trend towards centralisation in this country.  I think we have proof that centralisation leads neither to efficiency nor economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to hospital treatment we have an example of the difficulties that arose over the amalgamation of what <Col N="509" /> were called the old union hospitals. I thought that tendency had been changed, to some extent, and that latterly there was an inclination to develop local cottage hospitals.  In this matter I hope the Department will go carefully into the question. I think the Minister will find that big hospitals are inclined to be run as big factories are run, and in a very unsympathetic fashion.  They are likely to be de-humanised.  With the money that is going to be at our disposal we should run our local hospitals in a very efficient way, and, at the same time, in a sympathetic and human way.  I deprecate very much the tendency outlined in the Bill to look towards more centralisation. I hope that will not be carried into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would, in his reply, deal with the question, as to how this Bill is likely to affect voluntary contributions to the hospitals.  I have heard nothing but admiration for the Bill from people connected with the management of hospitals.  I heard practically nothing but admiration for the provisions of the Bill, but I heard certain criticisms regarding Section 22 (5):</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for the National Hospital Trustees to solicit contributions to the Hospitals Trust Fund, but the said trustees, may, with the consent of the Minister, accept any such contribution in money which is offered to them without such solicitation....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criticism I heard was that such a section, more or less, discourages voluntary contributions so far as Hospitals Trust Funds are concerned, that the phrase &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; seems to imply that such contributions are not welcome, and that they are not considered desirable by the Parliamentary Secretary.  From that is arising the fear that voluntary contributions to the hospitals for maintenance and ordinary running expenses may suffer. There is a possibility that the Hospitals Commission, in distributing moneys at its disposal, will take into account <Col N="510" /> what each hospital is receiving in the way of voluntary subscriptions and that the hospital for which hard work is done by that means, or which might receive a legacy, during the year, is going to suffer in its grant from the Hospitals Commission.  The effect of that possibility would be that there would be a substantial reduction in voluntary contributions to the hospitals and not merely so, but, also, that where a great amount of voluntary effort is made in the way of organising entertainments, and so on, for the benefit of the hospital there may be a falling off.  I heard that point raised by people who are full of admiration for this Bill and regard its provisions as extremely sound.  I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would deal with that point because that is the only direction, so far as I know, in which apprehension exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add a few words to what has been said by Deputy Everett and Deputy Murphy on behalf of the Labour Party in connection with country patients sent to Dublin.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should make better provision, or special provision, in the Bill, for country patients. Deputy Everett said that patients sent to Dublin hospitals from the County Wicklow cost the County Board of Health £2 2s. 0d. per week, per patient.  In a great many cases patients sent up by the Wexford Corporation cost 10/- or 12/- per day which is considerably more than £2 2s. 0d. a week.  Wexford Corporation sending patients to Dublin hospitals finds it costs 2d. or 3d. per £ in the rates each year.  No doubt with a little trickery a great number of them could be sent through the County Board of Health, but owing to the fact that certain regulations have to be observed, and that people have to make themselves paupers within the meaning of the Act, a great many people avoid going through the procedure necessary.  I suggest that special provision should be made for country patients.  The Hospitals' Sweeps were inaugurated on behalf of the country generally and while I <Col N="511" /> do not want to set Dublin people against the rest of the country I suggest country patients should get the treatment they deserve seeing that these sweeps were contributed to generally all over the country.</P>
      <P>I should also like to take this opportunity of suggesting to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should urge on the county boards of health the necessity there is of proceeding at a faster rate with the hospitalisation of the counties generally.  In Wexford there is a lot of talk about the provision of a new fever hospital.  For the last two or three years, both in the time of this Government and the previous Government, I had occasion to draw attention to the fact that Wexford town was left without a fever hospital.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that a town with 12,000 inhabitants should not be left without a fever hospital. In my opinion fever is cloaked because of the fact that the nearest fever hospital is 23 miles away.  I am confident that in view of the fact that parents do not like to see their children taken so far away from their homes notifiable diseases are cloaked continually since the hospital was taken from Wexford.  I do not suggest that the county fever hospital should be brought back to Wexford, but I suggest that there should be a fever hospital in each of the four principal towns of the county.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see that the boards of health should proceed to carry out the hospitalisation of the counties.  I understand the money is available and that it is only a question of agreeing upon certain plans.  I suggest that sufficient time has elapsed to urge the Parliamentary Secretary to see that the boards of health should proceed more rapidly in this matter than they are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that taking it on the whole, the Bill has been very well received in the House.  There would be considerably less discussion on the Bill if Deputies interested in it had either listened to, or read, my speech in moving the Second Reading.  In that speech I dealt with most of the <Col N="512" /> facts dealt with in the debate here to-day.  I can, of course, quite understand, and to a certain extent sympathise with, the frame of mind, and the attitude of approach, by Deputies who must oppose on Party lines any measure introduced by this Government. I can understand that position. It appears to me that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has been allotted the unhappy task of attacking this measure on behalf of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  He, evidently, had no heart in his work.  He was given a very difficult task and he did the best he could to find fault with the Bill.  But I think it will be generally agreed by anyone listening to him that his arguments did not carry conviction, and that, evidently, he was not himself convinced of the soundness of them.  In the course of his speech he said, &ldquo;When I look upon this Bill it certainly seems to me it has been designed for the purpose, and will have the effect, of sounding the death knell of voluntary hospitals in this country.&rdquo;  I do not think, if the Deputy read the Bill, and took into consideration the intentions of the Bill and the probable result of enacting such a measure, he would have made such an utterly nonsensical contribution as that.  The Bill seeks to preserve anything that could be preserved in the voluntary system.  It is generally agreed, I think, that the voluntary hospitals system has been adversely affected by conditions arising since the European War.  The increased cost of maintenance, and the failure of voluntary subscriptions, at any rate in proportion to the increased cost of maintenance, has led to the consequent necessity of increasing the revenue of voluntary hospitals by increasing the charges to private patients.  As an example of how that operated in five Dublin hospitals we find that the revenue from paying patients had risen from an average £2,000 a year, in the pre-war period, to £24,000 in the post-war period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the sweepstakes were promoted the principle of free admission and voluntary subscription had been seriously impaired, and the future of <Col N="513" /> the hospitals was seriously endangered. The sweepstakes have given those voluntary hospitals a new lease of life, and the present Bill before the House is calculated to improve the machinery, to secure better co-ordination, and to provide the necessary funds to enable those voluntary hospitals to continue to do the good work that they have been doing in the past.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that the responsibility for disbursing those moneys should not be placed on the Minister entirely free from Parliamentary control. At the present time under the existing legislation&mdash;legislation for which Deputy Fitzgerald - Kenney accepted responsibility when he was Minister for Justice in a previous administration here&mdash;the ultimate and final responsibility for the disbursement to the hospitals of the moneys accruing out of the sweepstakes rests on the Minister for Justice, after consulting the Minister for Local Government. If there was nothing wrong in having the ultimate responsibility resting on the broad shoulders of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, when he was a Minister, surely there can be nothing wrong in having a similar responsibility resting on the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I do not think that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was really sincere in a number of arguments which he advanced.  He said that not a single safeguard for the sick poor has been put in.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health has a responsibility in so far as making adequate provision for the hospital treatment of the sick poor is concerned, and in Section 24, sub-section (3) of the Bill will be found the safeguards that are considered necessary to ensure that all modern hospital facilities, and the best treatment that medical science can provide, will be made available to the poor. For the benefit of the many Deputies who did not read the Bill I will quote this sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister makes under this section a grant out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund to a hospital or a nursing organisation, he shall <Col N="514" /> specify the purposes for which such grant is to be expended and may attach to the receipt of such grant such conditions (whether to be performed before or after such receipt) as he thinks proper for securing the due expenditure of such grant on the purposes specified by the Minister or for securing or attaining any other object.</P>
    <P>That appears to me to be a much more valuable safeguard for the poor than the provision in the previous Sweepstakes Act.  The previous Act provided that 25 per cent. of the beds would be free to the poor, but Deputies will remember that in the course of time it was found that that particular provision was unworkable.  Amending Bills were introduced and passed in this House, admitting to participation in the sweeps hospitals that were not providing any percentage of their beds free to the poor.  We cannot, at this stage, estimate with any degree of accuracy what percentage of beds in any particular institution, catering for a particular class of sick people, should be allocated as free beds at the disposal of the poor.  When the Hospitals Commission have examined the entire question, and when they have so informed themselves as to be in a position to advise the Minister in regard to the allocations they intend to recommend to a particular institution, we hope to be in a position to know what percentage of the beds in that particular institution ought to be allocated as free beds for the treatment of the poor.  I believe that that is a much sounder provision, and much more likely to bring about the desired results, than the hard and fast 25 per cent. rule that operated in the previous Acts, and that was found to be unworkable in practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney complained that money collected on one pretence is now going to be diverted to other ends.  I do not know how on earth the Deputy could find anything in the Bill which would justify such a very serious allegation as is contained in that innocent looking phrase.  The money which has accrued, and the money which will accrue as a result of future sweepstakes under this Bill, will <Col N="515" /> be devoted to the purposes set out in this Bill, and the purposes set out in this Bill are the specific purposes&mdash; with very little variation&mdash;that were set out in the previous legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the purposes include maintenance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that later on.  Every book of tickets for the sweepstake has plainly printed on it, as required by law, a statement to the effect that the sweepstake is being held in aid of the hospitals of the Irish Free State.  The money is being devoted to the hospitals of the Irish Free State, and so long as the money is devoted to the hospitals of the Irish Free State there has been no breach of faith, as has been suggested, with anybody who bought a sweepstakes ticket in the past.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested in the course of the debate that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is going actually to confiscate the money that has accrued.  There is no foundation whatever for that charge, and I think the Deputies who made it know in their hearts that there is really no foundation for it.  If we waited until all the money had been disbursed, until all the voluntary hospitals had got all the money they wanted, what on earth would be the use of setting up a Hospitals Commission at that stage to advise as to how some co-ordination could be obtained amongst the existing institutions, or how far it might be necessary to provide new ones?  Obviously a halt must be called somewhere, and those people who have given any serious thought to this question will agree&mdash;if they do not agree in this House they agree in private conversation outside it&mdash;that the pity is that this Hospitals Commission was not set up at the very start, instead of setting it up now.  As I stated to-day, we realise that certain participating hospitals have involved themselves in financial embarrassments on the assumption that certain moneys would accrue to them on the recommendation of the Committee of Reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been indicated to the Joint Committee of the Associated Hospitals <Col N="516" /> by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, before the Bill was introduced at all, that we intend, as far as possible, to make good the allocations that have been promised to them by the Committee of Reference of the Voluntary Hospitals, but on the understanding that they will co-operate with the Minister in securing some co-ordination of the hospital services in this country.  While Deputies in this House have expressed considerable anxiety as to the future of the voluntary hospitals under this legislation, the extraordinary thing is that the Committee of the Voluntary Hospitals welcome the Bill and approve of the terms of the Bill.  I think if the Committee themselves are satisfied that one might reasonably expect that Deputies in this House would be satisfied, especially Deputies who are not associated with hospital administration at all.</P>
    <P>Later on Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asked the question: &ldquo;Why should the Committee start a scheme at all under the new Bill when they know that the hospitals they represent will not gain one single penny from it?&rdquo;  I suppose it is not necessary to follow such childish arguments as these in detail.  I would not deal with these matters in detail at all were it not that somebody outside the House who does not know Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney as well as we know him might take his remarks seriously and they might have a serious effect here or across in England where these utterances of an ex-Minister might be quoted to the detriment of future sweepstakes.  The Bill gives an assurance that the money will be devoted to certain purposes, and when a controlling body feel they are doing good and necessary work their schemes will be fairly dealt with by the body set up for that purpose.</P>
    <P>In column 335, volume 47, we have another interesting contribution from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  He says: &ldquo;Looking back upon it now I think that the view I took in the administration of the Bill was the right, correct and proper view and I think I may venture to say that it was crowned with success.&rdquo;  He is referring to the question of whether we should mention <Col N="517" /> in this Bill the words &ldquo;sweepstake&rdquo; or &ldquo;sweepstakes.&rdquo;  He says: &ldquo;The view I took in the administration of the Bill was the right, correct and proper view.&rdquo;  We have not departed from the wording of the Act that got such excellent results for Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney when he was Minister for Justice.  In fact, that particular section has been copied word for word.  He had many opportunities himself in the various amending Acts that passed through the House of having it in the singular or plural if he really meant what he would lead us to believe, in the course of his contribution on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I suggest, at any rate to the House, that the right, proper and correct view of the clause that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney took when he was Minister will be taken by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health when he is interpreting the same clause.  After all, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is not the only one who can take a right, correct and proper view of the clause and secure the best possible results.  I believe the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health will get the best possible results from it and take a right, correct and proper view of the interpretation of that clause.</P>
    <P>On the question of endowments and prohibition of grants for future maintenance, we have had a number of Deputies expressing some anxiety on the clauses of the Bill relating to these matters.  Under the 1931 Act it was provided that sweepstakes money should not be applied towards the ordinary maintenance of institutions established by local authorities, the intention being, of course, that the sweepstakes money would not be allocated to such relief of rates.  Section 5 of this Bill provides that no grant shall be made for or towards future maintenance, but this does not, as will be seen by Section 4 (e) preclude the possibility of endowment.  An hospital can invest its endowment in hospital buildings and equipment.  It must deal with an endowment in such a way as to provide a regular income which must be applied for the express purpose indicated by the trust to <Col N="518" /> which the endowment is subject.  It is quite possible that that section would require clarification.  We must guard against future maintenance of rate-aided institutions by sweepstakes money.  When we have that particular section further examined, if it is not clear that the section does not in any way interfere with the Minister's right to allocate grants for the endowment of beds in the voluntary hospitals we shall have an amendment brought in on these lines, but I am advised at the present time that with a correct, reasonable and proper interpretation of the clause, such as we shall undoubtedly get from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, there is really nothing to be feared in relation to that particular section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister before he leaves the point: supposing a voluntary hospital receives a grant from a local authority, as many of the hospitals have in the past, and that that grant in aid is withdrawn and the maintenance suffers in consequence, can the trustees in such an emergency provide an equivalent grant out of their funds?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>My own impression is that they can, but we shall get the matter clarified and make sure of what the position is.  Deputy Tom Kelly complained that this Bill proposes to make sweepstakes permanent. To a certain extent I suppose that is so, but it is very difficult, if we agree at all that money should be raised in this way and that it is a desirable way of raising money to solve this particular difficulty in relation to our hospitals, to estimate at this stage how long it would be necessary to allow these sweepstakes to continue before all the money would have accumulated that would be necessary to solve the problem.  That is the reason why no specific time limit has been put to the operation of this Bill. If anybody could forecast the result <Col N="519" /> of future sweeps and if we had a detailed estimate of the amount of money that would be necessary to solve the problem, we could decide, here and now, when this Bill should expire.  At the present time we cannot, and what we propose to do is to try to solve our hospital problems and, when we have done that, to repeal the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davitt expressed anxiety as to whether clinical research would be included as one of the purposes to which money could be allocated under this Bill.  The money will be available for research and it does not necessarily mean that it must be earmarked and confined to laboratory research.  There is no reason why money should not be applicable to clinical research as well. Deputy Kennedy made very serious and strong complaints about the treatment of the poor in some of the Dublin hospitals.  He referred to callous treatment by the staffs.  I do not know what steps Deputy Kennedy may have taken to check up on the accuracy of the very serious statement he made here to-day, but I would be very slow to believe that the poor would be callously treated by the staff of any hospital in Dublin, Cork, Galway, or in any other city, and I have personal knowledge of the subject and I have a long number of years' contact with these hospitals.  It is all very well for a layman to come in and say that they would not give a patient a drink of water after an operation.  It might be a very serious thing to give a patient a drink of water after an operation and, in all probability, the medical officer in charge directed that the patient should not get a drink of water. Similarly, patients come out of hospital and say: &ldquo;We are starved with the hunger.&rdquo;  It may have been part of the treatment.  It may have been necessary to diet them.  These criticisms are ill-informed and unfair and I am sorry to have heard Deputy Kennedy give utterance to such statements.</P>

    <P>The trouble with the voluntary hospitals at the present time, and the only real ground for complaint against them, is not in respect of the treatment <Col N="520" /> they have given to the people when they got them in&mdash;I do not think there could be any ground of criticism on that score&mdash;but the difficulty of getting the patients in.  The medical profession and the nursing profession are to-day as true to the traditions of their professions as they were in any age, and the services of the very best surgeons and physicians in Ireland are to-day available to the poor, as they always were without question and without asking for any fee or reward, but the trouble is (1) that the voluntary hospitals have not the accommodation and (2) if they had accommodation, under existing conditions, they cannot afford to maintain the poor free of charge.  That is what we are out to remedy&mdash;to get some co-ordination and to get some proper system to see (1) that beds are made available and (2) if a hospital is not a self supporting institution to give it such endowment as will enable it to continue to make these beds available to the poor.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.J. Murphy raised the question of including a provision in the Bill by which a certain number of beds would be made available to the people who could pay 10/- a week, a certain number available to those who could pay £1 a week and a certain number of course, would be available free Deputy Murphy, I think, did not study the terms of Section 24.  I think that Deputy Everett is now satisfied that it adequately meets the point he had in mind, and if Deputy Murphy examines the section, he will see that it is quite within the power of the Minister to say. in allocating the grant or in fixing the endowment, that so many beds shall be free, so many shall cost 10/-, so many £1, and so on.  The Minister has ample scope there to ensure that the point that Deputy Murphy intended to cover in the Private Bill he introduced can be covered.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Deputy Corish expressed anxiety as to whether any <Col N="521" /> of these beds would be available to people outside the City of Dublin in Dublin and to people outside the City of Cork in Cork.  Of course, they will. We cannot get a high degree of specialisation in our county hospitals. It is utterly impossible to have a staff in our county hospitals to deal with all forms of highly specialised treatment. The thing is nonsensical from every point of view.  We aim at having a good general surgeon in our county hospitals to do ordinary general surgical work, but nobody would be foolish enough to think that he would be a first-class physician as well, a first-class gynecologist, an expert bone surgeon, an expert abdominal surgeon, an expert brain surgeon, or an expert throat, nose and ear surgeon. The thing is foolish and impossible and we must have provision in our city hospitals for that specialised treatment to be made available to the poor regardless of where the poor happen to be situated on the map.</P>

      <P>Many of the Deputies seemed to miss Section 24 altogether and it is the most important section in the Bill.  Deputy McGuire is not here. I do not think it is necessary to follow his arguments.  I learned during the course of the debate that Deputy McGuire was a lawyer and I was very much surprised to hear it.  Being a lawyer and a man of average intelligence, which, I présume, he must be in order to become a lawyer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that explains a good deal but, surely, anyway, if he had read the Bill, he would have understood it.  It is quite obvious, of course, from his contribution that he did not read the Bill at all and I do not think that I should be expected to follow him and debate the foolish contribution that he made in view of the fact that it had nothing to do with <Col N="522" /> the terms of the Bill or with the terms of the Bills we are repealing, either. When he could not find anything in the Bill, from his limited knowledge of it, which he could criticise, he, quietly and methodically, drew on his imagination and put things into it which are not there.  That is all right for the sake of argument, but it involves considerable waste of time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore, apparently, disapproves of the section in the Bill which provides that the National Hospitals Trustees cannot solicit subscriptions. I do not see any earthly reason why the National Hospitals Trustees ought to be allowed to solicit subscriptions at all.  That is not their function, but there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the governing body of any voluntary hospital soliciting subscriptions in the ordinary way and getting all they possibly can from the charitable public, but that would be the function of the governing body and not the function of the National Hospitals Trustees.  I do not think any other points were raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The Bill is entitled an Act to amend and extend the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts, 1924 to 1932.  In the year 1924 the original Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act was introduced.  It authorised and empowered the Minister for Industry and Commerce to guarantee on behalf of the State any loan raised for a purpose approved of by him, subject to certain conditions, viz., that the raising of the loan would lead to an increase of employment in Saorstát Eireann and that the loan would be devoted entirely to the acquisition or construction of fixed assets, plant or land or buildings or the like.  The Act had certain other provisions, as, for example, that which enabled the State to make a loan where the effect of the making of the loan was likely to be a reduction in the cost of living in Saorstát Eireann.  These provisions were almost entirely inoperative.  The Act as originally introduced operated for one year only, but on each year since an Act continuing it for another period of 12 months was introduced and passed, and it is now in operation and would remain in operation, but for the introduction of this Bill, until the end of June in this year.  It would then automatically expire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the past year I have kept under examination the operation of the Act and have been endeavouring to satisfy myself whether or not the Act in its original form was worth while preserving or whether it can be amended so as to achieve purposes not possible under the original form.  It is as a result of that examination that this Bill now appears before the Dáil.  This Bill proposes not merely to continue the Trade Loans Acts for another period of five years, but to amend them in certain definite particulars.  The examination given to <Col N="526" /> the operation of the Trade Loans Acts for the past year was part of a wider examination of the general problem of the financing of industrial development here.  The nature of the accommodation afforded to industrialists under the Trade Loans Acts is of a very definite kind and certainly does not cover, or purport to cover, the various kinds of accommodation which are required by industrial concerns.  There is, on the one hand, the ordinary day-to-day accommodation or credit facilities necessary to carry the process of production and distribution from the purchase of the raw material to the sale of the commodity to the ultimate consumer.  That accommodation is ordinarily provided by joint stock banks and I do not propose to express any opinion as to whether the banks are fulfilling that particular function in a satisfactory manner or not.  On the other hand, there is the accommodation required in the form of invested capital, that is money placed in a business, not subject to withdrawal and remunerated only in proportion to the profits earned.</P>
    <P>Both these kinds of accommodation are required, in addition to the type of accommodation which is afforded under the Trade Loans Act.  I have had the whole problem under examination and, assuming that the ordinary day-to-day short-term accommodation is being satisfactorily provided by existing financial institutions, I had to consider whether or not further legislative provision was required in order to make certain that industrial development here would not be held up or prevented by the absence of financial facilities. The provision of invested capital is, of course, a matter for private individuals in the ordinary way, but in this country we suffer from a difficulty occasioned by the fact that most of our industrial concerns are small scale concerns and such concerns as a rule do not find it easy, if at all possible, to secure capital by public subscription.  It might be said that our financial equipment, speaking in general terms, is deficient in so far as that particular difficulty has not been overcome.  The means of overcoming that difficulty might, of course, be provided without the aid of any State action or without the necessity <Col N="527" /> for bringing before the Dáil proposals for legislation&mdash;and such would be by far the more preferable, although improbable, development.  That particular part of our problem is still under examination and may result in legislative proposals, additional to this Bill, being brought before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The accommodation provided under this Bill is neither the short-term accommodation to which I have referred nor accommodation by way of investment, but the provision of facilities by which industrial concerns can secure loans necessary for their development and which would be repayable in fixed sums over a fixed period of years.  In certain countries, and occasionally in this country, these loans are provided by banking institutions, but the attitude of the banks here is that the provision of capital in that form is not ordinarily the function of the banks, although at the present time they are financing, and no doubt will continue to finance, the loans which are guaranted by the State under the Trade Loans Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary that I should give a review of the operation of the Acts.  I think I am correct in saying that they were not availed of to anything like the extent which was anticipated when the first Act was introduced in 1924.  The reason for that failure to avail of the facilities afforded by the Act to the extent anticipated is one not very easy to determine. At first sight it might indicate that industrial possibilities here were so limited that the number of applications for facilities would be exceedingly small in any case.  I think there are very few people who have that view nowadays.  Certainly my experience has been that the limitation in the number of applications, the much greater limitation in the number of successful applications does not arise out of any lack of industrial possibilities, but out of other causes.</P>
    <P>A number of loans were guaranteed. In some cases these loans achieved the purpose intended.  They enabled industrial concerns to increase their production and their employment and <Col N="528" /> the results have been wholly beneficial, although the industrialists concerned sometimes have complained that the burden of the loan was much heavier than they originally anticipated.  In other cases, however, the loans guaranteed did not achieve the purpose intended and, as Deputies are aware, in some half-a-dozen cases the State had to make good its guarantee, thereby involving a charge on the taxpayers of, roughly, a quarter of a million pounds.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to initiate any discussion concerning these cases.  In relation to some of them it might be said that the failure arose out of causes which could not have been foreseen when the decision to give the guarantee was arrived at.  In other cases the giving of the guarantee was a matter of debate and criticism in the House at the time.  It is possible that a difference of opinion might exist as to whether the Act was wisely administered in giving a guarantee in these cases at all.  All these cases, however, are well known to Deputies.  Some two years ago a return was published giving particulars in relation to them&mdash; that is, the amount of the loan outstanding at the time that the recipient of the loan failed in his obligations, the amount of interest outstanding and, in a more recent return also published, the amount secured by the State on the realisation of the assets concerned.  There have been no further failures of concerns assisted under these Acts since and I have no reason to anticipate that any failures are likely to occur in the near future.</P>
    <P>In considering the problems associated with this Act, I came early to the conclusion that the limitations imposed originally in respect of the loans were unwise and unnecessary.  I refer particularly to two limitations.  Firstly, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was debarred from guaranteeing a loan to an individual; he could guarantee a loan only to a corporate body.  Secondly, he could guarantee a loan that was intended to be expended only upon the acquisition or erection of fixed assets.  He could not guarantee a loan, any part of which was likely to be used for working capital. <Col N="529" /> At first sight these two limitations appear to be necessary safeguards; but, having regard to the numerous other safeguards that can be imposed in the administration of the Act and that are necessarily imposed by the Department of Finance for the protection of public revenue, I do not think that the maintenance of the two safeguards provided in the Act is at all essential.</P>
    <P>Quite a large number of applications which appeared attractive and which, if successful, would have resulted in increased production, and increased employment here, had to be turned down because they did not comply with one or other of these conditions. I decided then that it was desirable to amend the Act by the deletion of these conditions.  I also decided that other changes were necessary if the Acts were to be made effective use of.  These other changes are largely changes in administration and do not require any legislative provisions.  I think it is desirable, however, that I should explain them to the Dáil.  Firstly, we propose to change the form of the Advisory Committee.  At present there is an Advisory Committee which consists of three businessmen who give their services voluntarily, and which examines all applications received.</P>
    <P>The members of that Committee told me that recently the amount of business that has come before them exceeded anything they anticipated when they consented to accept membership and that they are now required to give a much larger part of their time than they could reasonably spare.  The fact that all applications must be considered by this Committee of three businessmen meant at times certain delays.  It is proposed in future to have as permanent chairman a member of the Civil Service, to associate with him a panel of businessmen, and to select from that panel, in relation to every application, a separate committee of three.  Each committee will consist of the permanent chairman, a member of the Civil Service and, in addition, two members of this panel.  The permanent chairman will be able to do an amount of preparatory work which will make the <Col N="530" /> business of these committees easier. He will assist in other ways in securing speedy decisions on the applications and speedy action following the decisions.</P>
    <P>By the institution of the panel system we will be able to bring to the service of the Acts a wider variety of knowledge and experience and also we will lessen the burden of responsibility and loss of time in respect of each member.  It is intended of course that the members of the panel will act voluntarily as in the past.  At this stage I think I should pay a tribute to the services rendered by the members of the existing Committee, who despite the fact that they are men with considerable business interests have never hesitated to give either their time or attention to any application which came before them.  In the majority of the cases, we were able to act upon the information supplied by them in the light of the representations and without further inquiry.</P>
    <P>It is proposed also to change the method of administration in another particular.  At the present time, the State's security behind these guarantees consists as a rule of a first charge upon the assets of the undertaking. That is secured by a trust deed.  The preparation of the trust deed is a difficult and lengthy business.  It is also somewhat costly.  There is no reason why the trust deed should not be substituted by an ordinary debenture mortgage, which would be cheaper, speedier and simpler to bring into operation.</P>
    <P>The changes which are actually proposed in the Bill have already been indicated by me.  First of all, we propose to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to guarantee a loan to be raised by an individual.  I have never been quite clear why the original Act provided only that loans could be guaranteed when arranged by a corporate body.  I take it that the idea was that the corporate body has a more continuous existence than an individual who might die, and where difficulties might arise following his death.  It is also possible in the case of a corporate body for the State to put a director on the board if such <Col N="531" /> action is necessary to protect its interests.  Ordinarily, I think it is undesirable that the State should put a director upon the board of any company for which loans are guaranteed under the Act unless the circumstances made it desirable for the purpose of protecting the interests of the State and to ensure that action would not be taken which might necessitate the making good by the State of its guarantee.</P>
    <P>A number of applications have come to us from individuals, and although in the majority of cases these individuals have formed companies in order to comply with the Act, I do not see any reason why it should be done.  It involves a certain amount of expense and it involves a certain amount of trouble.  In other cases&mdash;these were not general&mdash;there was a natural reluctance on the part of individuals operating industrial concerns here to change the nature of the control of their enterprise.  I decided, and I found that I was supported by those who have had long experience in the operation of the Act, that we should delete that provision, and take power in future to give loans to individuals. The same examination would arise and the same inquiries would be made to ensure that the loan was likely to result in increased employment.  We have also decided to delete the provision in respect of working capital.  These are probably the greatest of the changes which it is proposed to effect.</P>
    <P>The case for restricting the powers of the Minister to guarantee loans for the purchase of fixed assets is fairly obvious.  The assets constitute the security against the loan.  Certain cases, however, came to our attention from time to time where it was quite clear that the Act could only be availed of by making arrangements which were tantamount to attempts to get round the Act and the barriers in the Act.  I can instance the case of persons who had brought machinery, had installed it in building and had come to the point of starting production.  They then found that their original estimates of construction costs were incorrect. By the time the building of the <Col N="532" /> factory had been completed and they were ready to start production, their capital resources had been depleted to such a point as made it unwise to start.  In such cases, we could not give a guarantee for a loan.</P>
    <P>It might be said that such persons would have no difficulty in getting a loan from a bank, but we did not find that to be the case.  In any event, circumstances can easily be imagined in which an industrialist might require to have a loan given to him at known terms, that is a loan repayable over a fixed period and bearing a fixed interest rate rather than that he should get accommodation on overdraft. These overdrafts might be recalled on short notice.  If such a person had come to the Department with his application before purchasing machinery, he could have got a guarantee and the same security against the loan would exist.  From the point of view of the State, the same case for guaranteeing the loan would exist in so far as production would be made possible and employment increased.</P>
    <P>We have decided to take whatever risks are involved in leaving ourselves open to receive applications for working capital, but I think it should be made clear that the operation of that part of the Act will be confined to cases of the kind I have mentioned.  It is not intended to enable firms that have got themselves into financial difficulties to get out of these difficulties.  It should be clear that the effect of the loan will be to increase employment in Saorstát Eireann.  Certain decisions have been given from time to time and have been acted upon, which meant, in effect, that the Acts are being applied if the loan operates to preserve employment or even if the only employment that is likely to be created is the actual employment of men in the construction of the factory or the installation of machinery.  But, where applications for working capital are concerned, it is my opinion that no guarantee should be given unless it is clear that the giving of the guarantee is going to increase employment in the increased production of goods here.  That alteration in the terms of the Act has also been recommended to me by those who for a number of years have had very <Col N="533" /> intimate experience of the operation of the Act.</P>
    <P>We provide that the Act will continue for five years.  I see no sense in this procedure by which a continuing Act is introduced year after year.  If these Acts are worth preserving at all, we should make up our minds that they are going to exist for at least a five-year period and that they should become part of the permanent machinery of the State so long as existing conditions continue.  By &ldquo;existing conditions,&rdquo; I mean the period of industrial development.  We provide also that no loan of less than £500 may be given. That is really inserted to save the time of the Department, because a very large number of applications for trifling amounts are made from time to time. While it has always been the practice not to give loans of less than that amount, it is not easy sometimes to explain why.  At the present time, there is one obvious reason, in that the cost of actually giving the guarantee associated with the preparation of a trust deed makes, in effect, the rate of interest on the loan prohibitive.  Nevertheless, people are prepared to push these applications and it is much better to be able to say to them that we have not got the power to give them than to try to explain all the considerations of policy which make it inadvisable to operate the Act in any other manner.</P>
    <P>We propose that there should be a fixed figure of one million pounds as the total of all the loans to be granted in the five-year period.  Judging by our experience of the operation of the Trade Loans Act up to date, I do not think it can be said that that figure is likely to be exceeded.  If it is exceeded at any time, it will be possible to introduce an amending Act but, personally, I think it will be found that for accommodation of this kind one million pounds in five years is likely to be ample, particularly if the other deficiencies in our financial organisation are made good during that period.</P>
    <P>The other provisions of this Act are of no particular importance.  Section 5 gives to the Minister for Finance himself power to make an advance on foot of a guarantee.  It is thought that it is wise to have that power, although <Col N="534" /> I do not contemplate that it will have to be exercised.  In theory, a person could get a State guarantee and be unable to negotiate the loan.  The banks have indicated their willingness to take up any of the loans guaranteed by the State.  Everything in that connection is working quite smoothly and I do not anticipate any change, so that Section 5 is likely to be inoperative to a great extent, except under very special circumstances or in the event of changes taking place which might produce the position I have indicated. For the greater part of the period during which the principal Acts were in operation loans were negotiated by the Industrial Trust Company.  When that organisation ceased to take up these loans, there was for a period certain difficulties experienced by people who got guarantees.  They had to approach finance houses of one kind or another for the purpose of getting the best terms they could.  Sometimes, they did not get as good terms as we thought they should have got having regard to the State guarantee.  The present arrangement with the banks is, however, considered to be quite satisfactory. Section 6 merely provides that the same information which heretofore had to be given to the Dáil in relation to the guarantees given under the principal Acts will have to be given in respect to guarantees given under this Act.</P>
    <P>That is the main purport of the Bill, and I recommend it to the Dáil not only on my own behalf but on behalf of those who have had experience&mdash; administrative and advisory&mdash;of the working of the previous Acts and of those who secured loans under these Acts.  I am satisfied that no additional liability is likely to fall upon the State if the same administrative safeguards are imposed in the future as were imposed in the past, while, at the same time, we will be empowered to give assistance in cases where it is not possible to give it now, but where the giving of such assistance is likely to promote the development of industry here and increase employment. That was the main intention behind the original Act and the changes made here keep the intention <Col N="535" /> unaltered.  The various provisions of the Bill can, if necessary, be discussed in detail in Committee, but I think that anybody who gives deep consideration to this matter will be unable to find any objection in principle to the changes now proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House adjourns, I wish to revert for a few minutes to the question which I put to the President to-day, and to which I received an answer that I considered vague and unsatisfactory.  I should like to say that I am not raising the subject now for the purpose of making trouble or stirring up muddy water. On the contrary, I was very much impressed by, and would like to pay a tribute of admiration to the tone and much of the substance of the President's speech this afternoon on the Oath Bill, which was germane to the matter we are about to discuss.  I do not want to say anything that would import a different tone or a different spirit into our discussions.</P>
      <P>The President made a very striking statement as to the policy of the Government at Arbour Hill on 23rd April&mdash;a statement which, so far as I know, had not been foreshadowed in any previous speech.  He said it was the policy of the Government by degrees to remove all forms and symbols at present exisiting which they considered inconsistent with Ireland's rights as a sovereign nation, so that they should gradually work up to the day when, if it was desired to declare a Republic, that declaration would be a mere ceremonial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question that occurs to one to ask is why was no declaration of policy on those lines made to the electorate at the general election, if that was then the policy of the Government, and, failing that, if it is something they have evolved since the general election, would not one have expected it to be announced to the Dáil in the first instance rather than on such an occasion as that on which it was <Col N="537" /> announced?  Then one asks one's self what are these forms and symbols? What does all this mean?  I, for one, have been cudgelling my brains to think what is involved in the statement about forms and symbols, and I cannot succeed in thinking of anything except the Governor-General.  Does this mean the abolition of the Governor-General? Is that what it means, and is that all it means, or what exactly is involved? I feel when a statement of that sort is made by the President of the Executive Council&mdash;and it was a statement that appeared to bear internal evidence of careful preparation&mdash;one has a right to ask the President to be more specific about it.  This afternoon, when I asked him to be more specific, he would say nothing except that it had reference to the symbols similar to the Oath which we are removing to-day.  I hope he will go a little further than that to-night. Up to this declaration at Arbour Hill there had not been a hint, as far as I am aware, that the Oath Bill was really only the first of a series of similar measures.  That was quite a new idea to me, that it was to be the first of a series.  Is that a policy on which we can go forward with any satisfaction? Does it not mean that, instead of preserving the tone of the President's speech this afternoon, we will have constantly recurring bouts of excitement and jingoism in this country, that we will be raising constitutional issues one after another in order to stir up ill-feeling between ourselves and the English; that we will be dealing John Bull a further blow every session so that the Government may distract attention from any internal difficulties that the country may have.  Is that the motive of the whole thing?  As I said this afternoon, I would far prefer an immediate declaration of a Republic to a policy of that sort.  I think that, both from the point of view of letting us settle down to tackle real problems, and from the point of view of preparing the way some day for the abolition of Partition and making an impression on the country's poverty, if we must purge the Republican idea out of our system, the sooner we do so the better by declaring a Republic.  As long as there is a Republic in the background, it <Col N="538" /> seems to me to be more impossible to get rid of Partition than if we actually tried a Republic and found after experience that the continued disunity of Ireland was something more intolerable, and that a Republic was something we were willing to give up in order to reunite the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>The President justified that declaration of policy at Arbour Hill by saying that it arose out of our duty to the memory of the men who died for Ireland in Easter Week.  Does it really arise out of that duty?  I did not know the men who died in Easter Week, but I honour their memory as men who died for an ideal and men who died for Irish independence.  While I honour their memory I honour certainly no less the memory of Irishmen who died for independence on other fields such as Flanders and Gallipoli.  They died for independence because they believed, as I believed, and as John Redmond believed, that the best way to secure Irish independence and the unity of Ireland was to do as they did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>As the question has been raised I may say that I got into serious trouble in the British Army, and I lost promotion, and lost other things, because I too hotly defended the attitude of the men who died in Easter Week.  But that is not saying that I thought they did a wise thing or a good thing for this country. I did not think so then, and I do not think so now, but I honour their memory none the less.  What I ask is: Is it a fact that there are two competing loyalties, that you cannot be true to the memory of those who died in Easter Week without being false to the memory of those other Irishmen&mdash;those far more numerous Irishmen&mdash;who, all over the world, <Col N="539" /> died in enterprises just as forlorn, though enjoying less spectacular publicity? It is not what is narrow and fanatical in a man that you wish to preserve the memory of for ever.  If it was you would have to adopt the gloomy theory that &ldquo;the evil that men do lives after them; the good lies oft interred with their bones.&rdquo;  I will not adopt that theory.  What they were after was not a formula, a particular method.  Methods and formulas vary.  Fundamentally, what they were all after&mdash;those who died here and those who died in Flanders and Gallipoli&mdash;was the essential independence and unity of this country, the peace and dignity of this country, the happiness and prosperity of this country, and as long as we strive according to our lights to attain these things, whether it be in a Free State or in a Republic, we are being true to the memory of these men and not false to it.</P>
      <P>I submit that our real duty to their memory is to turn our minds to constructive patriotism.  It is not the sort of thing that was done in the Northern Parliament yesterday, where a pack of fanatics slashed a picture that showed William of Orange on the same side as the Pope in a historical conflict, it is not that intolerant spirit, which, I dare say, might be reproduced down here, if we had pictures representing certain phases in the life of Wolfe Tone that conflict with popular fallacies about him, it is not that spirit or that narrowness that constitutes patriotism.  It is not by the perpetuation of class antagonisms, or by driving people out of the country, because they are not of your special political colour, as Deputy Kennedy said to-day he would like to drive me out, that you give evidence of such constructive nationalism as will enrich the country spiritually and materially.  I appeal to the President not to start us along false lines as regards our method of honouring the men who died for Ireland.</P>

      <P>We all have memories. Deputy MacDermot has pursued the same course to-day by taking up the time that the President has given me out of his own time.  I wish to say with regard to the men who died for Ireland that we honour them.  They are the nation's dead and not the dead of any political party.  As I said, we all honour them and the nation should honour them and not merely a political party.  I have only to say that if people who talk so much about constructive patriotism in this country did a little constructive work and stopped talking about constructive patriotism we would get on a little further.  We could listen to people telling us how to construct the country if they made some attempt at constructive work themselves, but it becomes a bit hard to bear when people tell us how to do the work and yet do not do any work of a constructive nature themselves.</P>

      <P>It would be much better if the energy put into this debate, and the energy put into the abolition of symbols, were put into the creating of substances, and if we had some regard to the substances which are required outside the House instead of wasting the time of the House in nonsense of this kind, and not directing our efforts to the constructive economic work that the country wants us to devote our efforts to.  I think if the President would devote more of his time, and more of the time of his Government, to economic development outside, instead of talking of symbols that he wants to eliminate one by one, he could eliminate them all as easily and as simply as the Oath was eliminated to-day.  If he had come along 12 months ago and instead of merely devoting himself to the abolition of the Oath he took the bull by the horns and publicly declared his intention and introduced a Bill proclaiming a Republic&mdash;that <Col N="542" /> could be done as easily as the Oath has been formally abolished to-day. Why the President did not do that, and inform the country of his intention to do it, instead of talking about removing symbol after symbol which he has power within the Treaty to do, and proclaim a Republic is simply incomprehensible.  Why not now take his courage in both hands and proclaim a Republic?  Why did he not do so a year ago?  There was nothing to stop him.  I suggest that we should not have this piecemeal declaration of a Republic.  Let us get away from this piecemeal business, let us face the matter at once instead of continuing in a sort of lingering death.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see how many converts we are making.  In a very short time, much shorter that I suggested at Arbour Hill, we will have all bodies in the country satisfied that the proclamation of a Republic is the right thing and I hope yet to have the pleasure of doing it.  However, the question at issue at the moment deals with the matter raised by Deputy MacDermot this morning and whether I gave a satisfactory reply to his question or not.  I maintain I did.  If the Deputy wanted to take the trouble to look through the Constitution&mdash;he was not here in the years when the Constitution was under discussion&mdash; he would have no difficulty in finding out, for himself, what exactly were the Articles to which I made reference to-day.  If he read over and examined the speeches made when the Constitution was introduced into the Provisional Parliament he would have found these Articles.  I said that the statement had reference to those provisions of the Constitution, which in accordance with the British interpretation of the Treaty of December 6th, 1921, were imposed upon the Provisional Parliament, sitting as a Constituent Assembly, and have never been freely accepted by the Irish people.  Surely the Deputy could have found out the provisions I referred to&mdash;he could have got the particular information he wants if he looked up the Debates. Lest there should be any doubt I continued further and said: <Col N="543" />&ldquo;Many of them&rdquo;&mdash;that is of the provisions imposed&mdash;&ldquo;are inconsistent with the present status of the Irish Free State.  One is being removed to-day&rdquo;&mdash;that was the Oath, and I am glad to say the Oath Bill is now an Act&mdash;&ldquo;and legislation will be introduced in the near future to remove the others.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy, if he so applied himself to it, if he really wanted to find out what was referred to, could very easily have done so.  There was sufficient information in that.  There was no hiding of anything.  &ldquo;The remainder&rdquo;&mdash;that is of those provisions that were imposed&mdash;&ldquo;will be removed according as opportunity presents itself.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether a debate on the adjournment is to be a debate on policy, but it is not a fact that I did not mention that before.  The whole policy of Fianna Fáil was made clear at its foundation.  It was made quite clear to the Irish people that we had in mind the removal of every mark or badge of inferiority, everything in the Constitution which was not consistent with the sovereign rights of the Irish people.  I instanced the Oath as having been imposed.  I have here before me a copy of the Draft Constitution which was taken over to Britain in 1922 as implementing the Treaty, and I have here, marked in red, the parts of that Constitution that were inserted on the other side.  When the delegates came back, and when they brought the Constitution Bill before the Constituent Assembly, they said that there were a number of articles in that which had been imposed.  They did not say it in such precise terms, but that was the effect of what they said, and looking through this document you can see that they were imposed.  If anybody had any doubt, he could satisfy himself quite easily by looking through that document that they were imposed.  Article 17, which we have removed to-day, was not, for instance, in that original draft; neither was Section 2 of the Act, which has also been removed to-day, and which made our Constitution subordinate to <Col N="544" /> a Treaty.  Article 66, on the Privy Council, was not in the original draft. Every Deputy in the House knows from what I said when the Oath Bill was under discussion, that that Article will also go.  In a work on international law it was referred to&mdash;I took a note of the exact terms&mdash;as a decisive mark of dependency, as a badge of inferiority.  That mark of dependency, that badge of inferiority is going to go.  It will go as the Oath went, and I propose in a very short time to bring in quite a batch of Articles of that sort which will go.  For instance, Article 41, which contains that archaic reservation of Bills, will go.  The Privy Council will go first, because it is inconsistent with the judicial sovereignty of this State that there should be an appeal from its highest court to an outside authority which does not consist of Irish citizens. That is an invasion, as I have indicated, of the judicial sovereignty of the Irish people.  That will go, and generally all those provisions that were inserted in London, and which are inconsistent with the rights of the Irish people to have just that Constitution they want themselves and not a Constitution which other people may want them to have, will go.</P>

      <P>I have made my attitude on that clear to-day.  As far as we are concerned the Irish people will be consulted before a Republic is declared.  The Articles there which we believe not to be required by the Treaty will go first, and there are some&mdash;just as in the case of the Oath&mdash;where if it is necessary to go to the Irish people to get rid of the Treaty in order to get them removed, we will do that, but go they all will.  As I said, I still hope to see the day when I will have the pleasure&mdash;as I had to-day of removing the Oath&mdash;of taking the whole batch and finally ending up by declaring a Republic.</P>
