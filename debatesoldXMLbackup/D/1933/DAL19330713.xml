      <P>Members of the Dáil will have learned with deep regret of the death of Deputy Sir James Craig, who represented the constituency of Dublin University.  Until his health began to fail, Deputy Sir James Craig was constant in his attendance and assiduous in his attention to the work of the House.  His keen interest in matters of public health and his work for the improvement of our hospital system demanded the respect of all his colleagues, while his relations with his fellow-Whips and his contribution to our debates were marked by unfailing courtesy.  I ask you, a Chinn Comhairle, to convey to Lady Craig and her family an expression of the sympathy of the Dáil with them in their bereavement.</P>

      <P>In the absence of the President yesterday I asked the Minister for Justice if he could tell the House when it was hoped to adjourn for the Summer Recess, as it had been stated earlier that the adjournment for the Summer Recess would take place about the 7th July, a date which has passed, and he asked me to repeat the question to-day.

      <P>May I point out to the President that when it was stated three months ago that the House would probably adjourn on 7th July many members on this side of the House made arrangements accordingly and were unable to cancel those arrangements. Consequently they will not be in attendance.  It is hardly fair at this stage to press measures in which probably these members are interested when they will not be present.</P>

I regret very much that it is necessary to sit on, but the work must be got through, and if the Opposition had facilitated us by not repeating unnecessary statements we probably would have been able to get through before now.  However, the work has to be got through, and if the Opposition are going to take up all the time it cannot be helped.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In order to give the Dáil and the country an opportunity of discussing the Bill on its merits, I wish to give, firstly, an outline of the general situation out of which the necessity for its introduction arose; secondly, the objects which it is hoped to achieve by means of the Bill; and, thirdly, a general explanation of the various sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the general situation, it is well known that there is a large number of uneconomic holdings in the country on which large families have to eke out an existence, and that, on the other hand, there is a very big number of ranches and estates on which there are very few people employed. If farms of 100 acres and upwards were to give employment to one man for every 40 acres, work would be created for an additional 100,000 men on the land.  All over the congested districts there are large numbers of people living on farms the poor law valuation of which is £2 or £3.  Heretofore the children in these families emigrated and helped to keep their parents by <Col N="2379" /> sending back portion of the wages they earned abroad.  Emigration has ceased completely, and an outlet must be found for the 15,000 or 20,000 additional young boys who are reaching the age when they must seek employment. In present circumstances a strenuous effort must be made to provide a livelihood for them on the land. The utter impossibility of satisfying the desires of all the people who wish to get possession of land sometimes is a nightmare to those who are immediately responsible for the division of land, but, looking at the matter broadly, we have a right to be thankful that in this age, when people are deserting the land by the million in other countries, our people are still animated by the virile and healthy desire to till the soil.</P>
    <P>There are two ways of securing increased livelihoods from the land&mdash; one is to divide it among uneconomic holders and landless men, and the other, to encourage such use of the land as will induce the owner to employ agricultural workers.  For a number of years the Land Commission have been engaged on the division of large estates.  Deputies from all sides of the House have been urging the Land Commission to speed up this work, but very few realise the legal and other difficulties which the Land Commission have to surmount before they can divide even a single estate.  If the Land Commission were to divide one million acres under the existing system, it would take about 30 years to complete the work.</P>
    <P>Apart from the division of land, the Land Commission is overwhelmed with other vast and intricate problems, such as the rearrangement of rundale holdings and the vesting and completion of land purchase.  At every step which they take to solve any of their problems they are met with serious obstacles.  For the information of the Deputies I am circulating a map of a number of typical rundale holdings which the Land Commission have been trying to rearrange, and on which one official has spent almost two years without getting agreement.  The clearing <Col N="2380" /> up of these congested slums has been neglected for ten years.  Whenever the Land Commission propose to take a few families out of a congested district they are met with bitter opposition in their efforts to secure alternative holdings for them in other districts. In many cases they endeavour to relieve congestion by the acquisition of a large farm, subject to land purchase annuity, in the immediate neighbourhood.  Before they can acquire this vested farm, if the owner declines to sell to them, they have, as the law stands, to secure for the owner a farm in another district, equally suitable and of not less market value.  In many instances they have been years trying to find an alternative farm which the owner would accept, and then only to find that the people in the locality were &ldquo;up in arms&rdquo; at the idea of a stranger getting a large tract of land in their midst.  Section 28 of this Bill will enable the Land Commission to acquire vested land for the relief of congestion much more easily and speedily.  It restricts the privilege of demanding an alternative holding to residental owners who work the lands on which they reside as ordinary farmers.  Where the farmer is the vested owner of a holding valued £2,000 or over the Land Commission can take the surplus over £2,000 without being compelled, as heretofore, to provide him with an alternative holding equally suitable and of equal market value.  If, however, they desire to acquire a holding under £2,000 value, or the whole of a larger holding, the owner can demand that he shall be provided with an alternative holding of equal market value to the holding he is surrendering, up to the maximum of £2,000 market value&mdash;the balance (if any) to be paid for in land bonds.</P>
    <P>At present, failing agreement with the owners of untenanted land which the Land Commission desire to acquire, a lengthy procedure is necessary: declaration that the land is required for the relief of congestion; publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>; hearing by the Land Commission of owner's objection; decision (after further inspection if necessary); appeal by owner; hearing <Col N="2381" /> of the case by the Judicial Commissioner; examination of the land in most cases by the Judicial Commissioner's assessor; decision of Judicial Commissioner and fixing of the price; consideration of the price by the Land Commission and decision as to whether to go on with the case or withdraw from the proceedings.  All this takes a very long time even under the most favourable circumstances.  It is necessary to make sure that legal requirements are complied with in every detail, and legal business is always slow.</P>
    <P>It has been found that the safegaurds given to home farms and demesne lands have operated to impede the work of the Land Commission in the relief of congestion.  In one case the Land Commission failed to obtain some 600 acres, on which only a few men were employed, of a protected estate consisting of 1,320 acres of good land situated in a district where the lands were urgently required for the relief of congestion.  Sections 28, 29, 31 and 33 will prevent such as state of affairs arising again.  On the whole, the Land Commission officials&mdash;particularly those engaged in the acquisition and distribution of land&mdash;have the most arduous work assigned to them of any body of civil servants I know, the difficulties of which are not appreciated by those who do not know it intimately. It is absolutely necessary to enable them to expedite their work, and the proposals in this Bill will sweep away a number of the legal and administrative technicalities that clog progress.</P>
    <P>One of the principal objects for which Fianna Fáil was founded was to establish on the land as many families as practicable.  This was also one of the fundamental objects of the old Sinn Féin Movement and of the First Dáil.  The Bill is designed to meet the needs of the present situation and to rearrange the administration of the Land Commission so that the object which the Government have in view may be achieved with the shortest possible delay.  The Land Commission was set up here when the people had very little contact with <Col N="2382" /> their governors, and when the Ministers in London had neither the desire nor the opportunity to supervise in detail its administration in the interests of the Irish people. Before the setting-up of the Free State there were a number of other Departments operating on the same basis; notably the Intermediate Education Commissioners, the Commissioners of Education, the Department of Agriculture, the Forestry Commissioners, and the Local Government Department. Since 1922 the six Departments I have mentioned, and seven others, have been reorganised to conform to the new situation.  The Bill proposes to bring the Land Commission into line with all the other Government Departments, and to give to the Minister whom the Dáil holds responsible for it the same authority over its administration and general policy as other Ministers have over the Departments for which they are responsible.  The power to determine the individuals from whom land is to be taken or to whom it is to be given or the price to be paid for it, is expected from the powers given to the Minister and will be exercised by the Commissioners. A new appeal tribunal is being set up to hear appeals against the actions of the Land Commission in all cases except such as a majority of the tribunal agree are matters of law.  In the Committee Stage it is proposed to amend Section 7 so as to provide that the lay members of the appeal tribunal shall be Land Commissioners appointed by the Executive Council instead of by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In order that lands may be divided more quickly it is proposed to give the Land Commission power to acquire lands on the basis of a provisional price so that when it is definitely decided that lands shall be acquired for the purposes of the Act, these lands can be entered upon at once without waiting for a year, or three years, or five years, until all the legal technicalities have been overcome. When the lands are taken over the price will be fixed provisionally by the Land Commission, and on this price interest will be paid to the apparent owner, until all matters of <Col N="2383" /> price and title have been finally determined.  Allotments can be made forthwith and provisional rents fixed pending the settlement of the price which the owner shall be paid.  It is anticipated that this will enable the Land Commission to distribute land quickly and give the people who need it access to the soil.  It will be a vast improvement on the present system whereby the Land Commission are compelled to spend years wrestling with legal difficulties, while the people who should be using the land are standing idle looking at it going to waste.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, dealing with arrears and revision of Land Purchase Annuities, is introduced in consequence of the Government's promise to halve all land annuity payments and to give additional relief to the lands acquired and sub-divided under the Soldiers and Sailors and 1923 Acts.  It offers to every tenant-purchaser, actual or prospective, far-reaching benefits by way of reduction in the amount of his annuity and funding his arrears.  Tithe Rent charges will also be halved where the payer is also a land annuity payer. An additional 5 per cent. reduction is given to the tenants who acquired allotments under the Soldiers and Sailors and 1923 Acts, giving them a reduction, all told, of 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>In order to relieve a large number of people who have got into arrears and give them a chance to &ldquo;find their feet,&rdquo; it is proposed to fund arrears and make them repayable in equal instalments over 50 years.  It is also proposed to forgive all arrears over three years&mdash;the result being that in very few cases will the payment of the funding annuity, plus the land annuity, amount to more than 65 per cent. of the annual payments due heretofore, no matter how many years' arrears the payer owes.</P>
    <P>So much by way of general introduction and explanation.  I shall now deal in a little more detail with a certain of the provisions of the Bill which, as Deputies will see, is divided into four parts concerned respectively with (1) <Col N="2384" /> general matters such as definitions; rules and provision for expenses; (2) changes in the Land Commission organisation; (3) changes in respect of purchase annuities and other payments, and (4) mainly with the extension of the powers of the Land Commission in regard to the acquisition and division of land.  I do not intend at this stage to take up the clauses of the Bill seriatim.  That will come later, on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part I calls for no special explanation at the moment.  It is made up of the usual necessary clauses regarding definitions, the making of rules and the payment of expenses.</P>
    <P>Part II I have already dealt with.  Its seven sections embrace just two points&mdash;first, the definition of the duties and responsibilities of the Minister and the Commissioners; second, the establishment of an Appeal Tribunal to hear and decide appeals and objections such as have hitherto been heard and decided by a single authority, the Judicial Commissioner.  The tribunal will be composed of the Judicial Commissioner as Chairman and two other Land Commissioners nominated for the purpose by the Executive Council.  I want to call the attention of Deputies to this change from the wording they will find in the Bill before them.  I shall introduce the necessary amendment at the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As regards Part III, I need not deal at any length with the funding of unpaid instalments of Land Purchase Annuities and other annual charges or with the permanent reduction to be granted in the amounts of annuities and other annual charges from the second gale day of 1933 and thenceforward, as Deputies are already familiar with the announced policy of the Government under these heads.  One innovation, however, which will be good news to some heavily involved annuitants, is the proposal in Section 12 to wipe out such arrears of annuities as exceed three years' accumulation. This is a generous gesture intended to encourage defaulters, many of whom are deserving and were unable to meet their liability because of circumstances <Col N="2385" /> outside their control.  Any attempt to recover debts so long due would merely have the effect of putting a recurring decimal on the default of the tenant purchasers concerned, and the Government propose to write them off.  We propose to apply the privilege of funding to arrears up to three years' accumulations so as to cover all sums in the nature of purchase annuities, actual or prospective.  The method of funding arrears of annuities is that the Land Commission shall ascertain the amount of arrears of annuity due on the 15th of July, 1933, in respect of each holding, together with the appropriate costs of any proceedings for their recovery, and so much of the sums so found due as shall not exceed three years' annuities with appropriate costs shall be repayable with interest at 4½ per cent. from the gale days of May-June, 1933, by means of a &ldquo;funding annuity&rdquo; payable for a period of 50 years.  The funding annuity will be consolidated with the existing annuity, so as to avoid duplication of payments.</P>
    <P>The same method is to be applied to Sections 13, 14, 15, 16, to arrears of payment in lieu of rent, interest in lieu of rent, and rent and interest payable by tenants or allottees of the Land Commission and to annuities collectable by the Commissioners of Public Works under the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870.  In all cases of default we have stayed proceedings and the costs of decrees are to be funded on the same basis as the principal debt. It must be understood, however, that these provisions do not apply to persons who are not tenants or allottees of the Land Commission&mdash;for example persons who have taken grazing lettings of lands in the hands of the Land Commission pending division.</P>
    <P>The arrears which have accumulated under all the Land Acts over all the years to the 31st December, 1932, amount to the sum of £2,972,000.  From this has to be deducted about £250,000 representing the arrears over the three years' mark which are now to be written off as bad debts.  This leaves some £2,722,000 of &ldquo;old arrears&rdquo; to be funded.  But the funding proposals also apply to those tenant-purchasers (actual or prospective) who find themselves <Col N="2386" /> unable to pay the first gale of the current year.  The collectable charge for this gale under all the Land Purchase Acts and under all heads amounts to about £2,160,000, but it is expected that an appreciable proportion of annuitants will be able and willing to pay the instalment rather than have it funded.  The total, therefore, of sums to be funded will probably come to over £4,500,000, the repayment of which will be spread over 50 years at an annuity rate which works out at about 6d. per half year for every £1 of debt so funded.</P>
    <P>So much for the past.  As regards the future, tenant purchasers generally will under Section 12 be called upon to pay only 50 per cent. of their present liability as from the gale days May-June, 1933, and this applies also to future annual payments under the heads of payment in lieu of rent, interest in lieu of rent and rent and interest payable by tenants or allottees of the Land Commission, so that tenants will not suffer any disadvantage by delays which may be necessarily incurred in putting them on a purchase annuity basis.  An exception, however, is made to the general scheme of having annuities, etc., in favour of two classes of allottees of parcels of land purchased by the Land Commission at such prices as involved disproportionately high annuities.  It is felt that in equity such exceptional annuities should be brought nearer to the common level, and accordingly it is proposed to reduce them by 55 per cent. instead of by 50 per cent.  The classes who will thus benefit are allottees of lands purchased under the Act of 1919, when the price of land was greatly inflated, and allottees of lands purchased under the Land Acts, 1923-'31, who have also had to bear a disproportionately high annuity on the prices of their parcels of land purchased at a time when agricultural prices and consequently land values were much higher than at present.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in Section 12 (3) to revise not only all existing annuities, etc., but also to revise future annuities to be set up under the Land Purchase Acts, excluding however annuities created on resales to owners.  The Bill <Col N="2387" /> includes a proposal in Section 24 to give to annuities subject to a third decadal revision under Section 25 of the Land Act, 1896, the advantage of enjoying such revision as from the 1st day of May, 1933, notwithstanding that the decadal period would not have been reached by that date.  The revised annuity will then be subject to the general reduction of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with arrears of rent due by sub-tenants on holdings vested in the Land Commission under Section 9 of the Land Act, 1931, so as to give them the same benefit which their immediate landlord is to receive under the revision clauses of the Bill.  Section 18 deals with the funding of arrears and the revision of tithes payable by annuitants and perpetuity rents and mortgages on agricultural holdings payable into the Church Temporalities Fund by occupying farmers, so that practically every class of farmer coming within the scope of the Land Acts is included in its proposals.</P>
    <P>Redemption of the new revised annuities may take place under Section 22 on much the same lines as hitherto. The amount of the redemption value will be calculated on the annuity payable prior to the revision and then reduced proportionately to the amount of revision.  The redemption money of annuities under Acts prior to the 1923 Act will be disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer as may be directed by the Minister for Finance.  Funding annuities may be redeemed in whole or in part by payment in cash of the value of the outstanding instalments.</P>
    <P>As regards the financial provisions consequent on the funding and revision of annuities, it is proposed that the deficiency in the Purchase Annuities Fund or in the Land Bond Fund arising from the revision of annuities shall not be a charge upon the Guarantee Fund, while not relieving the Guarantee Fund from liability to make good any other deficiency in either fund. That is to say, the Guarantee Fund will remain liable for any arrears of the reduced annuities payable in future.  It is further proposed that the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts relating to the contingent portion of <Col N="2388" /> the Guarantee Fund shall cease to have effect, as they have become obsolete.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in Section 26 that the charge on the Guarantee Fund in respect of deficiencies arising from the funding of annuities under the 1923-31 Acts due on the first gale day of 1933 shall be made good to the Land Bond Fund out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, to such extent as may be determined by the Minister for Finance.  All deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund arising from the revision of annuities and other annual payments are to be made good out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas; and, on the other hand, so much of a revised annuity paid into the Land Bond Fund as represents a funding annuity is to be paid thereout to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I now come to the general provisions of the fourth portion of the Bill.  In the first place we propose by Section 27 to add to the remedies for the recovery of land purchase annuities the power to issue direct to the under-sheriff a warrant for the recovery of sums due by defaulters. This will result in a saving of time in the District and Circuit Courts and will ease considerably the burden of costs on defaulters.  Under the present system the defaulter is often burdened with costs which amount to two or three times his debt to the Land Commission.  The section fully safeguards the rights and interests of the citizen, to which a man is entitled even when he fails to pay his annuity, and at the same time it saves his pocket considerable further expense.</P>
    <P>Next come some very important provisions in Section 28 as regards the acquisition of land for division by the Land Commission.  Under this head, the Bill proposes to repeal subsections 4 and 5 of Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923, and to amend subsections 2 and 3 of that section.  These sub-sections restrict the general powers of the Land Commission to acquire untenanted land for division and have become in practice a serious impediment to progress.  Under shelter of them individual owners of <Col N="2389" /> extensive lands in badly congested districts have either successfully resisted all the efforts of the Land Commission to acquire much-needed areas or have delayed their acquisition for years, and in many cases these lands were outlying farms on which there was no residence and which were being let for grazing year after year.  The right under the existing law of the proprietor or tenant of land declared to be required for the relief of congestion to demand an alternative holding equally suitable and of not less value, instead of accepting payment in Land Bonds, has been particularly difficult to meet, as of course acceptable alternative holdings are rarely available and the phrase &ldquo;equally suitable&rdquo; which occurs in clause (b) of sub-section 4 of the Land Act, 1923, has presented an almost impregnable line of defence for the owner.  The Bill proposes to eliminate the point as to an alternative holding being &ldquo;equally suitable&rdquo; and to limit the right of the provision of an alternative holding of equal value to <i>bona fide</i> resident farmers, whose holdings of land do not exceed in all £2,000 in market value, but a concession is made to proprietors of holdings valued higher than this in that they may require to be provided with an alternative holding up to the value of £2,000 and receive the balance of the price in Land Bonds.  Thus, the genuine farmer who lives and works on a holding of reasonable size is fully protected, and the right of appeal to another tribunal in case of dissatisfaction is preserved.</P>
    <P>It is proposed further in Section 28 (6) and Section 28 (5) that the declaration of the Lay Commissioners that land is required for the relief of congestion shall suffice for the purposes of the Acts and that where land is so declared publication of a provisional list as prescribed by Section 40 of the Land Act, 1923, shall no longer be necessary.  The double procedure of the declaration and provisional list is cumbersome and costly and simply slows up the work by requiring two operations to effect the one result.  The declaration of the Commissioners that land is required <Col N="2390" /> may be appealed against on questions of law or value, but it is to be final as regards the fact that the land is necessary and must be acquired.</P>
    <P>Section 29 contains proposals for avoiding delay in the taking possession of untenanted lands by the Land Commission in cases where the provisional list or declaration has been duly published and any objections disposed of, by way of the Land Commission declaring the appointed day for the lands before the price is finally agreed upon or fixed.  A provisional price would be declared, and any necessary financial adjustments made later when the final price was fixed in accordance with the existing provisions of the Land Purchase Acts (as now to be amended). Deputies who have had experience of a long interval between the provisional list stage and the actual division of untenanted lands urgently required for the relief of congestion will appreciate the necessity of such a provision as this, even though it may give a certain amount of administrative inconvenience.</P>
    <P>In Section 30 power is being sought to simplify Land Commission procedure in regard to the resumption of unvested holdings.  Here again, the principle we are adopting is that if the Land Commission require these lands in the public interest they must be enabled to get them, and speedily. A declaration or certificate by the Commissioners will in future be acted on by the court as sufficient warrant for authorising the resumption of a holding or part of a holding, and if the Commissioners require the land for immediate distribution the court will give possession even before the resumption price is settled.  In such a case, of course, interest will be payable on the purchase price as from the date of possession.</P>
    <P>It is next proposed to extend the powers which the Land Commission already possess for the compulsory acquisition of land for the relief of congestion so as to cover acquisition with a view to division among the persons or bodies mentioned in Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923.  That is to say, that the Land Commission is not <Col N="2391" /> to be restricted by a technical definition such as &ldquo;relief of congestion,&rdquo; but may, where necessary and possible, acquire lands throughout the State for division amongst uneconomic holders, evicted tenants, discharged employees, migrants, trustees for turbary, pasture, etc., suitable landless men, and so on.  And their jurisdiction in this respect is to be absolute and not subject to reference to the Appeal Tribunal, except on a question of law or value.  If the Land Commission are to distribute land rapidly and on a large scale, they must have a freer hand than they have hitherto had, and it is the purpose of this Bill to give them greater scope for their land settlement operations.</P>
    <P>Yet another restriction under the present law which needs removal is that contained in the last sentence of Section 24 of the Land Act, 1927, by which the Land Commission is stopped for a period of seven years from renewing proceedings for the acquisition of lands from which they have withdrawn from purchase or resumption, because the price fixed on appeal was too high to make resale to allottees practicable on reasonable terms.  Section 32 proposes to remove this restriction in so far as it applies to proceedings prior to the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>Another restriction on progress which Section 33 seeks to modify is the exception made in Section 24 (2) of the Land Act, 1923, in favour of &ldquo;residential&rdquo; holdings, or demesnes, homeparks and the like.  In the absence of a precise definition as to residential character, evasion has been possible on the score of a residence or mansion house which was practically derelict.  This section proposes that such derelict residences shall no longer protect lands required for division.  It further lays down that whether a holding has been let for a residence or not is now to be determined by reference to its user at the date of the passing of this Act and at five yearly intervals afterwards.  Hitherto the character of one of these residential holdings and the question of whether it came within the Land Code or not <Col N="2392" /> had to be settled by reference to its user in August, 1923, a provision which, owing to the altered circumstances of many holdings, has been giving rise to difficulties and injustice.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill is concerned with a number of points of varying degrees of importance on which further legislation is required in order to amplify existing powers of the Land Commission or to provide for certain technicalities, and I need not refer particularly to them all at this stage. I would mention, however, a few of the more important proposals.</P>
    <P>The loss of land by erosion has given rise to considerable complaint on the part of tenants who were liable for payments in respect of land which they no longer possessed.  Power is now sought in Section 34 to relieve both tenant purchasers and ratepayers by wiping out entirely the annuity charged on lands which have been permanently submerged.</P>
    <P>It is proposed under Section 35 to empower the Land Commission to review the amounts of the standard purchase annuities published under Section 9 of the Land Act, 1931, in cases where the Commissioners are not satisfied on investigation that these annuities bear a just relation to the value of the holdings and the Land Commission is being authorised to fix the annuities at the amounts for which the holdings afford security.  As the law stands, it is not open to the tenant, landlord or Land Commission to seek a variation of the standard purchase annuity on a judicial holding, and the Land Commission cannot on their own initiative reduce the standard purchase annuity on a nonjudicial holding except where that annuity has been agreed upon by the landlord and tenant.  It is not expected that the Land Commission will find it necessary to exercise in very many cases the discretion now proposed to be given to them alone, but it is expected that the conferring of this power may benefit an appreciable number of cases of known hardship.</P>
    <P>In Section 36, mill holdings which are substantially agricultural are to <Col N="2393" /> get the benefits of land purchase although the mill may be in use; so also tenanted lands excluded from previous Land Acts as being suitable in future for building ground, if not already resumed by the landlord, are, under Section 42, to be brought forthwith within the Land Purchase Acts.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in Section 37 to apply to land purchase the maxim that husband and wife are one, and so prevent evasion of the law by family ownership.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in Section 38 to amend some of the provisions of Section 44 of the Land Act, 1931, dealing with the purchase of lands held under fee-farm grants or long leases, in accordance with practical difficulties found in the working of that section. Experience has shown that some of the annuities, if fixed under this section as it stands, would be beyond the amounts which the holdings could reasonably bear, and it is now proposed that powers should be conferred to vary such annuities by fixing them at the amounts for which the holdings afford security.  It is proposed to repeal Section 38 of the Land Act, 1923, which dealt with the redemption of head rents, in order to bring this class of tenure under the one procedure in future.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in Section 43 to extend the powers of the Land Commission for the acquisition of bogs, in view of the anticipated development of the peat industry.</P>
    <P>I think I have now said enough to indicate the main purpose and provisions of the Bill, but perhaps it may be well to sum up a few of the principal features.</P>
    <P>(1)  The organisation of the Land Commission is being placed on a more definite and better working basis, and the powers and responsibilities of the responsible Minister and of the Commissioners are more closely defined and a new appeal tribunal is being established to deal with appeals from decisions of the Land Commission in those cases in which the law provides for appeals.</P>
    <P>(2)  All proceedings for the recovery of arrears due to the first gale day of <Col N="2394" /> 1933 (save in the case of the Church Temporalities Account payments where it is the first gale day after the passing of the Act) are to be stayed, unless a defence to such proceedings has been entered.</P>
    <P>(3)  The amount of the arrears and appropriate costs ascertained and a sum not exceeding three years' arrears and the costs, with interest at 4½ per cent., is to be made repayable by a funding annuity.</P>
    <P>(4)  Existing and future annuities are to be revised by 50 per cent., save in the case of annuities on resale of lands purchased under the Land Act, 1919, or vested in the Land Commission under Acts 1923-31, at the date of the introduction of this Bill, when the revision is 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>(5)  Powers are given to under-sheriffs to levy for arrears on warrant from the Land Commission without court proceedings.</P>
    <P>(6)  The Land Commission is given wider powers of altering the standard purchase annuities of holdings fixed under the 1923-31 Acts, where the question of security for the advance arises.</P>
    <P>(7)  The Land Commission is given the same compulsory powers of acquiring land for resale to persons or bodies to whom they now can resell lands acquired voluntarily, as they have already for the purpose of relieving congestion&mdash;and the powers of acquiring land for these purposes are enlarged by the removal of certain restrictions on such acquisition contained in the Land Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>(8)  Power is taken to fix a provisional price upon acquired holdings so that the new tenants can be producing the fruits of the soil while the legal gentlemen are carrying through the necessary legal formalities.</P>
    <P>I believe that the speedy enactment of this Bill is a matter of national importance and that the underlying principles should have general support. We wish to give the annuitants and other payers the immediate benefit of funding and revision.  We wish to speed up and enlarge the scope of the acquisition and division of untenanted land and to grapple energetically with the problem of congestion.  These are vital matters for the agricultural community <Col N="2395" /> and will not brook delay.  The Land Commission will have to face the big and urgent task of overhauling all their collection accounts and issuing new receivable orders in time for the November gale.  They must also make provision for a large scale distribution of land.  We shall, of course, welcome any constructive criticisms, but we are satisfied that the proposals contained in the Bill are the minimum that will enable the Land Commission to proceed effectively with the task entrusted to it and yet are the maximum that can be carried through expeditiously in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputies do not need to be reminded that agriculture is still the mainstay of our national economy.  By various enactments we have striven to encourage an increase in tillage.  Some of the proposals in this Land Bill may be considered as complementary to that policy.</P>
    <P>We must distribute the available land so as to provide a livelihood for the greatest possible number of our population and to produce the greatest amount of national wealth.  In this task we must be guided not so much by the size and value of farms as by their use and method of production. The day of the large and lazy rancher is over.  The future lies with the industrious and intelligent farmer who is alive to modern needs and conditions. He has nothing to fear from this Bill, but, on the contrary, will get every encouragement.  We look forward to a time not far hence when the land of Ireland will be economically and justly distributed and worked to the limits of its capacity for the benefit of the whole nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, makes it very difficult to discuss this Bill. This Bill is merely for the purpose of acquiring land and paying a certain <Col N="2396" /> price in bonds.  At present we do not know what these bonds will be worth, or at what rate they will be issued. That is a very important point, because the value of the bonds will, to some extent, depend upon the rate of interest at which they are to be issued. It is not indicated.  We know there are drastic measures for acquiring land but we do not know about the bonds, and that makes it extremely difficult to discuss this Bill.  With regard to the Bill itself, it is an attempt to deal with a very difficult pressing economic problem.  The Bill itself is a purely political Bill; and that is the trouble with this Government.  There are, of course, it must be admitted, a very large number of very pressing problems in this country&mdash;we need not go into that&mdash;apart altogether from the strictly agricultural problems.  Every one of them is treated not upon its merits, as an economic or financial problem, but purely as a political problem.  But on no one of these problems is there a national outlook.  There are many serious problems facing this country at the moment because of the operations of this Government.  No one of these problems has been faced honestly or from the national point of view, or with a view to its solution in the national interest.  Every one of them is faced from one particular point of view, and that is the point of view of the political expediency of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a political Bill.  I daresay it will go through.  That seems certain, as there is a majority for it.  In the main it will go through, but when it has gone through and has functioned, it will do not good, but unlimited harm and injustice to the best farmers in this country.  I am perfectly convinced of that, and when all the tumult and the eye-wash contained in the Minister's speech is over this will be found to be the net result of this Bill.  Coming to the Bill in its main provisions we find that the arrangements with regard to annuities and arrears come first.  Everybody knows the Land Commission annuities cannot be collected now and everybody will admit that they cannot be collected now.  Everyone knows, especially everyone who knows anything <Col N="2397" /> about farming, that for the last two years, since the economic war, they are unable to pay their annuities and their rates.  Anyone who denies that knows nothing at all about agriculture. In that connection I think it is nothing short of scandalous that the Minister for Agriculture should go round the country, as he is doing, repeating in every speech he has been making, for the last month, the statement that the Land Bill is coming to the relief of the farmers of the country who cannot make their land pay.  That is simply adding insult to injury.  It is simply not good enough.  I know farmers who work, who bought their land and have between 50 and 100 acres.  They did not get that land soft and they did not get anything from anybody.  They bought it through their own work and the work of their sons, by denying themselves and by working efficiently, employing the best methods and in that way were able to buy out their own land.  They did not hesitate to make sacrifices.  They worked hard and they always paid their way.  At the present moment the real bitterness to them is that for the first time in their history, or in their father's history, they are not able to pay their way.  And we have the Minister for Agriculture, who, at the moment, is getting a soft living out of politics, starting out and telling the people in the country that the Land Bill is a way out of their difficulties.  He tells them sarcastically that the Land Bill is intended to give new life to farmers. Nobody can pay his annuities and if things go on as they are nobody will be able to pay.  I suppose there must be some way out.  But we, on this side of the House, did not make these difficulties. The Government opposite made them.  I am perfectly convinced myself that the economic war could be ended, but I am also perfectly convinced now that President de Valera has no intention of ending it.  I put the whole blame for the economic war upon the Government at the present time.</P>
    <P>Anyway, it is there and farming cannot pay.  Nobody can pay their annuities and people have got into arrears and there must be some way <Col N="2398" /> out of the difficulty.  But look at what you are doing.  I know people who in 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, and 1928&mdash;comparatively good years when there were very few arrears and when farmers could make farming pay&mdash;spent their money having a good time, who allowed their sons to do the same thing during that period, who were more interested in the question of the Oath or the Treaty or in political issues than in their farm or in agriculture generally, and who piled up arrears year after year when they could pay them.  Side by side with them, I know people on worse land&mdash;and every Deputy here with any experience of the country knows it also&mdash;who might have started in debt, but who were paying their way every year and paying their annuities every year.  Those two classes of people reached the year 1931, one with six, seven, eight or nine gales in arrear, and the other with his annuities paid up-to-date through the sweat of his brow and brain.  These two are living side by side.  One of them had to go into arrears for the last two years.  He could not pay his way.  He could not pay the Land Commission. He has to pay all that back now with interest at 4½ per cent., I think, and the other man has all his arrears, with the exception of those three years, wiped out.  Could there be anything more demoralising?  Nothing could be more demoralising.  That is the real injury that the Government has done in this country&mdash;the moral injury.  They have put a discount on thrift and honesty and they have put a premium on softness and dishonesty and on every form of weakness.</P>
    <P>I know a man myself with whom I had a certain amount of influence and, by reason of that influence, I forced him to make what he regarded as very heavy sacrifices in order to pay arrears in 1928, 1929, 1930 and 1931.  He paid them.  He was not a good farmer and was not inclined to pay them, but for certain reasons, into which I need not enter, I used my influence to make him pay these arrears and he did pay them.  Now he will not look at me when he thinks of how he could have got out of it and of what he has lost. <Col N="2399" /> When one thinks of that picture, look at the demoralisation you have caused. I admit that something must be done and that you may be solving the problem financially by this means, but you are demoralising the farmers.  I am quite certain that no farmer can pay even half the annuity in November except a farmer who goes out to make money in some other way.  He will not make half the annuities out of the land under present conditions unless he does something else and gets the money to pay his annuities in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly&mdash;or a solicitor. No man at the present moment, under present circumstances, unless in some very rare case where he has a special market or where he is living near a town and can get something extra for some of his produce, can make half the rates and annuities out of his land. Everybody who has any knowledge of conditions in the country knows that. You will have to face up to this problem again, and I hope it will be faced up to with more honesty than has been the case so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come on now to the question of acquisition.  The problem of congestion is a very serious problem.  I forget at the moment the number of congests undealt with up to the present time; but there is certainly a great number in Connemara alone. There are thousands of cases there undealt with, and it is the same all over the country.  There are probably 20,000 or 30,000 cases to be dealt with. Everybody knows that the most drastic Land Bill in the world, even with absolute confiscation and cutting down holdings to a level not even contemplated by the Fianna Fáil Party, would not be adequate to deal with this problem.  But such as they are, these congests are the real problem and they are entitled to be dealt with first.  What is happening in this Bill?  You are accepting landless men quite apart from herds and other suitable <Col N="2400" /> persons.  That is good politics, I admit, but it is rotten economics and rotten national administration.  I have seen a few landless men dealt with by the present Government, as they have power to deal with them, since they have come into office; and what did they give them?  They were forced by the exigencies of the situation, by the shortage of land and the number of congests, to deal with the landless men.  They gave them, in fact, uneconomic holdings, and instead of dealing with so many congests in place of these men, they simply added to the number of congests and I make bold to say that will be the administration of this Bill also.  You will have a certain number of landless men under this Bill &mdash;I do not care how much land you confiscate&mdash;getting uneconomic holdings and you will be going back to the agricultural standards of living of 1848 because these men cannot live on such holdings, and you are taking away the only genuine labour market they have, namely, the efficient and bigger farmer. The general effect will be to depress the standard of agriculture generally much lower than it is at present, and probably to about the level in which it was in 1870; I will not go back as far as 1847.  That is only done for political reasons.  I know perfectly well that Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches will probably get up and say: &ldquo;Deputy Hogan is against dealing with landless men, but we will deal with them.  We are going to see that every young men coming up from the country will have a chance to acquire land.&rdquo;  You know that it is good politics to talk that way, or you think it is good politics, because no matter how ignorant you are there is not a single man on the opposite benches who does not know perfectly well that you cannot even make a beginning of dealing with this problem of the landless men by land purchase. You know that in each district, no matter how drastic your administration is, not 100 of these cases can be dealt with unless you come along and deal very much further with it and come down not to the £2,000 worth or the £1,000 worth of land but to the £500 worth of land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2401" /> It is my opinion that the real driving force behind this Bill in the benches opposite and also amongst the electorate is not so much that the people in favour of it expect very much out of it for themselves, but that they believe that even though they are not going to get much out of it, they will have the marvellous consolation of knowing that the other fellow will be stripped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The supreme pleasure!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly&mdash;the supreme pleasure, to quote a famous authority, of knowing that the other fellow will be stripped.  I believe that the Land Bill is drafted from that point of view. I think it is a rotten point of view.  I think it is a weakening point of view. I believe you are leaving this country worse off than ever it was before, and that this Land Bill will go a long way to continue that condition of things. Every time you have tackled a big problem you have tackled it in a most demoralising way.  Under the Land Act of 1923 there was an attempt to deal with the very difficult problem of congestion, and at the same time to preserve the security of tenure the Irish farmer had struggled for and, in fact, achieved since 1880 and even before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was provided there that when once land was purchased by the State and re-sold to the tenant the tenant had fixity of tenure.  It was realised that in certain circumstances it would be necessary, where congestion was very severe to take up land of that sort, but in order to preserve all the fixity and security that was there, it was provided that that man should get an equally suitable and not less valuable holding elsewhere.  That safeguard is now definitely taken away.  Remember this: we began there in 1881 and we reached that point.  We are beginning there now and we will go back to where we were.  There are people on the opposite Benches sneering at my speech and the point of view behind it.  The day may come when they will not sneer, because that process now begun will go further than they think and lead farther than <Col N="2402" /> they think.  I never saw anyone who cried so loudly afterwards as the person who sneered when he was safe. It is always the way.  That safeguard is now wiped away.  What have we instead of it?  The owner of £2,000 worth of land, in the opinion of the Land Commission&mdash;I shall come to that later on&mdash;is entitled to a holding of equal value provided the holding is residential.  Look at what that means. A.B. has a holding of 20 acres with his house on it on one receivable order. His father had that before him and he was a hard-working man.  After the father's death he worked it and then bought 50 acres within a half mile of his place under another receivable order.  The Land Commission can come down now on him and take the other 50 acres.  That is the law as it stands in this Bill.  That is the best type of farmer in the country&mdash;the sort of man that made Scotland, that made every country, the pushful hard-working type, the man who has a little holding and buys more land.  He is not looking for anything soft from the Land Commission.  He has been making money out of stock or tillage or other things, while other people have been spouting, and he has been able to buy 40 or 50 acres outside. Even though that land is vested in him, he has no rights because the Land Commission can take it up.  That is the position.  This Bill, according to the Acting-Minister for Lands and Fisheries, is going to encourage thrift and hard work.  Could anyone work if that is the treatment he will get for it. As I say, such a man is the best type of farmer and, moreover, that sort of farmer was the agent of the Department of Agriculture through the country everywhere.  The Department of Agriculture would be sterilised without him.  He was their agent everywhere.  He was the first man to get a premium bull, the first man to take up manuring.  If the local instructor wanted a new variety of mangolds grown, or something like that, that man did it for him.  If he wanted a manurial plot that was the man he went to.  He was the right type of farmer, whether he was Fianna Fáil or Cumann na nGaedheal.  That <Col N="2403" /> is the sort of man that is now going to be penalised.  He has no safeguard under the Bill.  This Bill, that was calmly introduced to us as something to uplift and encourage thrift and work, is going to do nothing of the kind. That unfortunate man, of course, need not bother whether his land is taken for congestion or for landless men&mdash;he has no rights at all&mdash;the best type of man in the country.</P>
    <P>Then other safeguards are wiped out. There was a safeguard that certain classes of land, such as residential holdings, home farms, building ground and so on, could not be taken while more suitable land in the neighbourhood was available.  That safeguard is wiped out.  Why should that safeguard be wiped out?  What was it?  The land was segregated into different classes&mdash; demesne lands, home farms, purchased land, residential holdings, land suitable for building.  It was provided that if such land were to be taken it could only be taken if no suitable land, not coming within these classes, were available. That safeguard is wiped out.  Why do they want to take that class of land if there is other suitable land available? Why should that safeguard be wiped out?  To save trouble&mdash;wipe out everything; give ourselves and the appeal tribunal a free hand.  Is there to be any consideration for the owners? After all, they have not yet reached the stage when they are a frankly Bolshevik or Communist party.  Who are the owners who are to be affected by the Bill?  They may be comparatively small farmers and amongst them the most hard working and best farmers in the country.  Yet that safeguard is wiped out completely and no reason given and no reason even suggested.  I fail to conceive why it should be wiped out.  There was another safeguard&mdash;that that land could only be taken for the relief of congestion.  That has gone too.  That, to my mind is a purely political gesture and, if it is to be operated at all, it will be merely operated for the purpose of creating more congests.  That is the net result.  That is the position of the Bill with regard to the acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2404" /> Now let us come to its administration. The Bill itself is bad enough, badly drafted enough, and, obviously, very ill thought out, because I do not believe that all these considerations were present to the minds of the people who drafted it.  It is certainly very badly conceived and thought out, but bad and all as it is, it has to be administered.  Who administers it? Not the Land Commission, mind you, but really the appeal tribunal.  Who are the appeal tribunal?  A High Court judge and two nominees of the Government.  They need not even be members of the Land Commission and, as far as I can see, they cannot very well be members of the Land Commission, because they must be men who will have nothing to do with the cases which they are expected to hear&mdash;that is as far as I can make out.  There are to be two nominees of the Government, in other words, of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Some of the Ministers opposite have some legal training, some legal instincts and conceptions. I put this to them; is it not a perfectly monstrous proposal that you should have two removable non-judicial functionaries dealing with questions like that?  It can only be done on the assumption that the people whose property is being dealt with have no rights or equities.  I want you to remember that the people you are dealing with now are not the lazy graziers that the Acting-Minister spoke of.  Whoever else you may deal with, you are taking power to deal with the best, most hard-working, and most enlightened farmers.  Surely they should have some rights.  I put it to the Minister for Justice, who is a lawyer, that they should have some rights in this matter.  If I have a dispute over £25 I can have a district justice to try it; a judicial functionary who will give fair play, and who is not removable.  If I have a dispute about £200, a Circuit Court judge can try it.  If I have a dispute about a sum over £200.  I can go before a High Court judge.  But, if my property, which I spent all my life building, or the property of my neighbour, is being taken and interfered with, who hears the case, who adjudicates on it? <Col N="2405" /> Two nominees of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Do not sail away on the point that I am attacking civil servants.  I am not.  Supposing they were civil servants; is there no distinction between a civil servant and a judge? Why does the law provide that judges should be irremovable?  Is that provision in the law an aspersion on civil servants?  The duty of a civil servant is to obey a particular Minister, and to be his agent.  That is his duty, and none other.  He may differ from him, but it is his duty to obey him.  Assuming that other men were established for the purpose, and brought in, do you think you are going to get the semi-judicial fair play from them that you would get from a judge.  By asking that, I am not casting aspersons on their character.  The experience of centuries in every country has shown that it is absolutely essential to make a judicial personage irremovable and independent of the Executive Council. Here £1,000 worth or £10,000 worth of your property or my property is to be taken, your whole future and the future of your children is to be interfered with, and you are completely at the mercy of two removable nominees of the Fianna Fáil Party. It is a shameful proposal; it is absolutely monstrous.  Do you not trust your judiciary or what is wrong?  Of course I will get lectures on that also.  I will be told that I was the first to make this suggestion. That is what the judiciary are there for, to have somebody independent to deal with those matters.  How are you going to make the distinction?  Look at it another way?  A. B. is a farmer; he has 200 statute acres of land or maybe 300.  He employs eight or nine men.  He has fine stabling. He might feed 60 or 70 cattle in the winter time.  He has built the stabling he has put in the plant; he has put up a yard and establishment for the purpose of farming that amount of land. What is to happen to him?  A hundred acres of his land is to be taken. He is to be left burdened with buildings, stabling and everything else far too big for his work.  Possibly, <Col N="2406" /> Deputies do not appreciate that point. Any farmer who is farming efficiently will appreciate it.  I will be told that his land will not be taken.  I do not believe it; I do not trust it.  That particular man is entitled to have 200 acres of land, just the same as a man is entitled to have a good shop.  His family have grown accustomed to the standard of life on that land.  He is a good employer.  A hundred acres of that man's land is to be taken. He is to be left with the remainder, and with buildings, establishments and machinery suitable for a 200 acre or a 300 acre farm, a lot of them paid for out of an overdraft.  What does he get?  He gets bonds.  He gets bonds instead of cash.  That cannot compensate him.  He has to pay annuities; he has to pay rates, and he has got to get rid of two or three of his men.  What have you done to that man, and what have you done to the country?  He has six or seven men, and he will have to get rid of three of them.  The land you take from him will not give much more than three holdings.  You will have done all that gross injustice, and you will have really nothing for it.  No one will be contented, and you will have done nothing to increase production.</P>
    <P>I think this is a thoroughly bad Bill.  I think it is a scandalous Bill in some of its provisions.  I think it is aimed at fooling the country into believing that all the landless men of the country are to be dealt with, and fooling the country into the belief that land purchase is going to be much more expeditious as a result of this Bill.  I think it is not the right way of dealing with this property.  I do not think this particular Bill can be improved very much, but there are some points of detail which I should like to deal with on the Committee Stage.  I do not intend to deal with them now, as the Bill is too long.  I will only say that this Bill is the most useless Land Bill ever introduced in this House.  It will effect nothing except destruction.  It will shake security as no other Bill has ever done before.  It will put people out of employment when the administration is all over.  It will effect no real purpose. <Col N="2407" /> No matter how drastically you administer that Bill, very few people will be effectively dealt with.  If there are more than a few, you can only deal with them on the basis of reducing their standard of life to something like what it was in the year 1878.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I suppose I, a landless man, am entitled to speak on a Land Bill.  I suppose that as such I should be expected to sing a paean of praise in favour of the proposals that are embodied in this Bill.  I was waiting, in my capacity as a landless man, to hear the tune that I expected to be sung by the backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party in praise of the provisions that this beneficent Government has embodied in this Bill as presented to this House. They were silent; no note of praise of this Bill has come from the backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We may draw from that fact our own conclusions, and the country may draw from that fact its own conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hogan has just pointed out the fact that this Bill is badly drafted, ill-conceived, and ill-considered.  I think in my time I have never read a Bill presented to this House that was so badly drafted, so badly conceived, and so ill-considered.  The outstanding feature of this Bill, as Deputy Hogan has pointed out, is the fact that throughout practically every section of it, and certainly in every Part of the Bill, the dominant note is a political one.  We find in Section 6 a provision which at first sight would appear to be entirely needless, and which would consequently bring people to consider what exactly was behind it.  In that section it is provided that in reference to the matters with which the Land Commission in the future shall deal, except three or four matters set out and called excepted matters, the officers of the Land Commission, the Land Commissioners, and the members of the appeal tribunal, other than the judicial commissioners, are to act on the orders of the political Fianna Fáil Minister.  What was the necessity for that particular provision? Under the law as it stands at the <Col N="2408" /> moment the Minister in charge of the Land Commission, the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, has the general direction and control of the Land Commission, and of the officers of the Land Commission in the exercise of their administrative and executive duties.</P>
    <P>Why the necessity for this particular section, were it not for the purpose of making it clear to the followers of the Fianna Fáil Party in the country that this Bill is going to be administered as a political Bill and for political purposes, and is going to be administered for the benefit of the followers of Fianna Fáil alone?  Section 6 is bad enough as it stands.  Deputy Hogan has pointed out the monstrous provisions of Section 7 dealing with the appeal tribunal.  It is certainly a new orientation in judicial matters and political thought in this country that this House should be asked to give its vindication to a provision enabling the legal rights and liabilities of the people in the future to be dealt with by the nominees of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries.  The Acting-Minister for Lands and Fisheries in opening the case for the Bill to-day told the House that he intended on the Committee Stage to introduce an amendment to Section 7 enabling the Executive Council, instead of the Minister, to appoint the members of this tribunal. If any proof were needed that this Bill has been ill-conceived and improperly thought out, the fact that the Minister responsible for bringing the provisions of this Bill before the House had to admit that in one of the most important particulars it was not at the moment properly drafted or considered, is a clear indication that this Bill was hurried and brought into the House at this juncture without proper consideration and proper drafting in order that the Fianna Fáil political Party could be in a position to make speeches to their followers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It would be a joke if it were not so tragic a joke to see under the provisions of Section 7 that two nominees of the Minister are to be responsible in the future and are to be entrusted with the determination of the legal rights and liabilities of the owners of property <Col N="2409" /> in this country.  But there is even a bigger joke in the provisions dealing with the Appeal Tribunal.  The Judicial Commissioner is the only legal man on this tribunal and we find that any point of law which has to be decided by this tribunal has under it to be decided by the Judicial Commissioner, but before he gets seisin of the point of law for his consideration, these two nominees of the Minister or of the Executive Council have to decide that there is a point of law involved, and having solemnly given this decision, they allow the Judicial Commissioner to determine it himself.  The meaning of that is plain.  In any place the two nominees of the Minister or of the Executive Council in hearing a case, in which they have got their orders from the Minister for Lands and Fisheries in accordance with Section 6 of the Bill, are to decide the case in a certain way. That is the meaning of Section 6.  The Minister for Lands and Fisheries orders them, in pursuance of his powers under Section 6, to decide the case in a particular way.  They find that they cannot carry out their Ministerial orders and political functions because there is a point of law involved; and the two of them determine, forthwith, that though there is a point of law involved there is in fact no point of law involved and they do that in order to oust the functions of the Judicial Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it was through hurry or speed or through bad drafting that the Acting-Minister for Lands and Fisheries had to tell the House to-day on the Second Reading that he was under the necessity of bringing in an amendment to Section 7 on the Committee Stage.  I partly guess that the reason for that suggestion is, as the Attorney-General has perhaps told him, that the entire provisions of Section 7 are unconstitutional.  If the Bill is passed into law as it stands at the moment, it will be set aside by the independent tribunals of this country, unless the present Government decide that it is unnecessary in the interests of their land policy to set aside these independent tribunals themselves.  It would be interesting to see what change that amendment will put in it.  It will be interesting to see <Col N="2410" /> if this section is left as it stands, even with the amendment, that it is the Executive Council and not the Minister who will appoint these nominees. It will be interesting to see how long the provisions of Section 7 are to be allowed to remain unchallenged.  It will be still more interesting to see what amendment will be brought in by the Acting-Minister now that his attention has been drawn to the fact that the provisions of Section 7 are in absolute direct contradiction to the provisions of Article 64 of the Constitution. I am sure that the Attorney-General has fresh in his mind the decision in the case of Lynam and Butler where the exercise of certain powers by the Land Commission was considered.  The Attorney-General will tell him if he has not already told him of the bearing of that Section 7 as it stands.</P>
    <P>Every Bill, every measure and proposal that has been brought in by the present Government has one outstanding feature&mdash;that it produces insecurity, uncertainty, and, in almost every case, injustice.  We pointed out in other measures before the House the injustice that is being worked and the uncertainty that is being produced in this country.  Deputy Hogan has, in more detail and in better language than I could hope to use, drawn the attention of the House to the insecurity of tenure which is going to be produced by this Bill.  It is limited to what the Minister calls farmers working a reasonable acreage and farming in a proper way.  In that connection I was reminded of the old tag: &ldquo;Large fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite them, and little fleas have lesser fleas and so on <i>ad infinitum.</i>&rdquo; We will find that when this Bill is operated for a while and when the 100-acre farms are divided into 30-acre farms and the Fianna Fáil Party have presented their followers with whatever political advantage they can derive in their solution of the land problem, that the lesser fleas will come back to the 30-acre farm demanding that it be divided into a 15-acre farm, and there will be no end of this problem.</P>
    <P>Instead of giving this House and the country a solution of what is admittedly <Col N="2411" /> a big problem, this Bill only adds to the difficulty and creates an entire set of new problems for future generations to tackle.  In many respects it is quite apparent that this Bill has been ill-conceived and ill-considered. I should like to direct the attention of the House to Section 28 (3) (a).  I do not know whether the provisions of that section are deliberately designed or not or whether it is the deliberate intention of the Minister to do what the present intention of that section does at the moment.  I say that because as it stands that section can only do one thing and that is that if a farmer carrying on farming on a farm of less value than £2,000 carries it on in a way which the Minister or his nominees think is not a fit manner for a farmer to carry it on, the Land Commission may, on the direction of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, acquire that particular farm and, having acquired it, may retain it and give the owner of the farm nothing whatever in return.  Section 28, as it stands at the moment, is nothing but a pure piece of confiscatory legislation.</P>
    <P>It is utterly immoral and unjust and it enables the Land Commission, in the circumstances I have indicated, to take a farm of land from a particular individual without compensation or without exchange of land; in fact, without giving him anything whatsoever in return.  I challenge the Attorney-General to say whether that section is open to any other construction than the one I have put upon it.  It may be that is the deliberate intention of the section.  If so, no more Socialistic, Communistic or Bolshevistic measure has been introduced into this House. We had it on the highest authority that it is quite contrary to moral principles to take land without giving any compensation or any return for it.  That is what Section 28 does.</P>
    <P>I listened with considerable amusement to the Acting-Minister for Lands and Agriculture putting forward his justification of the proposals contained in Section 27.  The amusement I felt at the way he put forward those proposals arose from the fact that, when I was considering what justification he <Col N="2412" /> would present to the House for the iniquitous proposals contained in the section, I came to the conclusion that he would dress it up as a measure designed for the amelioration of the tenant purchasers and in relief of possible liability for costs.  That is what he has done.  In point of fact, what has actually been done on the Acting-Minister and on the Executive Council is that the officials have put across on this democratic Government, this Government of the people, a bureaucratic, reactionary proposal that on two occasions they tried to put across on me and on my colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  I wish to say that I protest against the Deputy's statement.  I deny that the officials have any responsibility for this Bill.  This Bill is introduced by me on behalf of the Executive Council and I take full responsibility.  If the Deputy has anything to say, let him say it to me, or to the Executive Council.  We will answer him.  He should leave out the officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether that is a point of order or not, but whatever kind of a point it is, I would like to emphasise that there is no Deputy here who has greater experience of the officials of the Civil Service or of their loyalty and efficiency than I have.  There is no Deputy who has a greater respect for their loyalty and efficiency than I have.  I would be the last person in this House to attack any single one of these officials.  It is a recognised trick of the present Executive Council, when a Deputy is attacking their reactionary measures, to try to draw a red herring across the trail.  It is now suggested that I am attacking officials when no such attack was ever intended or could be made, having regard to the experience, the loyalty and the efficiency of the Civil Service.  I have made no attack on the officials, but I have made an attack on the Minister who brings in Section 27 under the guise of a democratic proposal when in reality it is one of the most reactionary proposals that was ever brought here.  He brings it forward here under the guise of a proposal <Col N="2413" /> to ameliorate the conditions of land annuity defaulters.</P>
      <P>This proposal is brought in by the Government for the purpose of short-circuiting court proceedings.  If any Deputy gives the slightest consideration to these proposals he will see that they tend to bureaucracy <i>in excelsis.</i>  That is the aim of this so-called people's Government, this so-called Government of democrats.  The proposals in that section of the Bill amount to this, that the Land Commission is entitled to say: &ldquo;A land annuitant has defaulted and we have not the duty, the same as any other individual in the State has the duty, of going into the public courts and proving our claim.  We have just to sign a document and hand it to the sheriff for execution.&rdquo;  I will await with interest the number of actions that will be brought against county registrars and sub-sheriffs if an attempt is made to put these provisions into practical execution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know why it is that, while in every case where proceedings have been brought by the Land Commission to recover land annuities such proceedings, if pending, are to be stayed, and, if prosecuted to a final decree, are to be discharged, in reference to those cases where a defence has been put in the proceedings are to go on.  We find that provision in Section 12 and the following sections. We got no explanation from the Acting-Minister as to the reason for that particular provision.  Are we to draw the only conclusion that can be drawn, that it is because defences were put in during last year either by the Party to which we belong, acting on behalf of land annuitants who are being pursued in the most bitter fashion by the present Government for annuities they were unable to pay owing to the policy and actions of the Government, or by some organisation representing the Centre Party?  Are we to draw as the only conclusion we can draw from those provisions, that because political parties presumably were helping those land annuitants last year to defend themselves against the Government in their tyrannical efforts to extract the full amount of the land annuities from defaulting tenant purchasers, the Government <Col N="2414" /> think they are supporters of either the Centre Party or the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and they are not going to get the relief given to other tenant purchasers who happen to be in arrears?</P>
    <P>There can be nothing said from start to finish for any particular provision. It is a confiscatory Bill.  It is another manifestation of the policy of the Government in bringing about insecurity, uncertainty, and injustice. As Deputy Hogan pointed out, it is a Bill which has its basis entirely in politics.  Were we cynically inclined, we would welcome this Bill, not for the provisions it contains, not for the effort that it is supposed to make to solve the problem which admittedly exists, but because it is a political measure and, as a political measure it will bring tremendous political disadvantage to the Fianna Fáil Government. For every landless man they put into a holding they lose his vote and they lose ten or twelve votes belonging to the landless men they will fail to put on land under this Bill.  We should, for that reason, welcome this Bill.  Although now brought in as a political Bill, in a few short years it will work out in a way that will astonish the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Acting Minister for Lands and Fisheries read a long statement to-day when introducing this Bill.  Then Deputy Hogan got up and made hay.  One would have expected that someone would rise to meet the case that was made by Deputy Hogan.  It is a source of no surprise to me to discover that the Fianna Fáil champions of the Land Bill, 1933, are determined to reserve their oratory for as late a stage as possible.  It seems to me that the task they will have in making any defence for this measure is one which none of them will be envied in having. There is one salient point in respect of this Land Bill, and it is this.  If the Bill becomes law, fixity of tenure is finished in this country.  Those people in the country who are old enough to remember the Land War, and those of us who were brought up in the Land League atmosphere know, <Col N="2415" /> from the point of view of the people, and from the point of view of the State, the paramount importance of fixity of tenure and how greatly it was treasured by the people.  They knew its worth and the fundamental difference it made to the farmers in every part of this country the day they were given security in their own homesteads.  Fifty years after that has been secured for the people it is to be taken from them.  They are going to be told they need have no fear, that though that fixity of tenure is gone, they can trust Fianna Fáil which loves the little man to do everything in the interests of the small farmer.  The people of this country are beginning to learn how much value they should put upon the promises of Fianna Fáil.  By the time they are finished, with this Bill, when it passes into law, they will learn to distrust this Government for evermore.</P>
      <P>There is an old practice, when you have a victim in contemplation, to invite him to your house, to entertain him royally, to masquerade as his friend and at the conclusion of the proceedings to give him a dose of poison and dispose of him.  It was an astute and potent process from the poisoner's point of view.  This Bill, for no apparent reason, a Land Purchase Bill, is meant to implement President de Valera's intention to halve the land annuities.  That is the process; that is the gilt on the gingerbread, and we do not find the poison until we look for it.  If this Government meant to do justice by the small farmers and the large farmers, who have been reduced to destitution in the last 12 months, they would do as they were asked to do, suspend the collection of the annuities altogether until the economic war was over.  They are halving the annuities after creating a situation in which no man in the country can earn half the annuities not to speak at all about the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in this Bill is taking complete control of the Land Commission except with reference to four exempted matters.  The farmers in this country will be told that the Minister <Col N="2416" /> scorns to interfere with anything wherein it might be suggested that the slightest personal consideration, from the Party point of view would enter into it.  All that is to come to the appeal tribunal, through the Land Commission.  And we then discover that the appeal tribunal is to consist of the Judicial Commissioner, who has been effectively hamstrung and rendered ineffective, and two lay commissioners whom the Minister can appoint.  He has power to choose suitable men for the jobs he wants done.  Indignant protests will be made. &ldquo;Do you suggest,&rdquo; it will be asked, &ldquo;that any officer of the Irish Land Commission is amenable to any suggestion of that kind.&rdquo;  This Bill does not speak of existing officers.  The world is wide and the capacity of the Government to appoint extra civil servants is endless.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that the appeal tribunal shall consist of the Judicial Commissioner and two lay commissioners whom the Minister shall appoint.  On all the questions of fact their word is final and if any appeals are pleaded on point of law the Judicial Commissioner must first convince one of the lay commissioners before the matter can come for decision before him at all.  The Minister for Lands and Fisheries has also grown solicitous lest the people of the country should pay costs of proceedings brought by him against them by appeals to the law courts.  He is going to kill that appeal; and he is going to save the people the expenses of the law courts.  The implication is I think that only fools go to the law courts.  Once the Government cuts in the judges do not count.  We are told it is only waste of money going to the courts and that the people will be saved from their own folly.  The judge is on one side.  The Land Commission will say &ldquo;when we think you owe us something we will say so and come down and collect it.  There will be no reference to these old fogies who sit upon benches in wigs and gowns.&rdquo;  The Minister for Lands and Fisheries does not require their intervention any longer.  He is the governor, judiciary and everything else.  It may be that <Col N="2417" /> some people think that a desirable development.  I would like to hear the Attorney-General upon it.  He has fathered some queer schemes in this House but this will be the strangest issue that ever came from his marriage to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I hope he will claim it as his son.  The affiliation order will certainly be against the Attorney-General.  He cannot escape from it and he will have to pay up.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the section to which I first referred when I began my observation to-day.  I was waiting for the Minister to read that section.  In his preliminary observation he approached it with a certain amount of trepidation.  Then, he drew a deep breath and determined to jump the chasm and, when he came to Section 24, sub-section (4) (b), he said: &ldquo;This has presented an impregnable protection to those persons who were resisting compulsory acquisition of their land.&rdquo;  Those words might have been used by the leaders of the Land League movement when they secured the Land Act of 1881.  They were looking for something that would be an impregnable protection to the tenant farmers of this country, and they got it; and the Acting-Minister for Lands and Fisheries of the Free State Government is going to take it away.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this business about a £2,000 farm will deceive a vast number of people in this country.  They will imagine that their land cannot be acquired unless they have land in excess of the value of £2,000.  What the people of this country and the Deputies in this House ought to recognise is that the smallest farmer in the country can have his homestead taken from him in the morning and an offer made of land of equal market value. What consolation is it to a farmer in Donegal to be told that he will be given a farm of equal value in West Cork?  I do not blame Deputy Mrs. Concannon for laughing, but she is following the man who drafted that section.  She is lost in admiration of him.  It may have its amusing side to Deputies here but when that section comes to be put into operation up and <Col N="2418" /> down the country it will become an instrument of oppression and an instrument of injustice in the hands of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I venture to say this, that there is not a Deputy sitting on those benches over there who would dare to go down and tell his constituents that in this House he was supporting legislation which placed it in the power of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries to take their farms from them to-morrow morning if the Minister wanted to do so.  He may succeed in fooling the people.  He may succeed in persuading some of the people that that is not true, but there is not a single man on those benches who would dare to go down and tell the people frankly what they are doing and take the people's verdict on what they propose to do.</P>
    <P>We come now to the farmer who has land worth £2,000 and who is going to seek alternative land for that which is taken from him.  Before he will be entitled to do that, he must satisfy the Land Commission that he resides on the land and that he uses that land in the same manner as an ordinary farmer and with the proper methods of husbandry.  There was a time in this country when people knew what that meant, but during the last 12 months since we have been shipping cattle to Belgium, since we have been growing wheat under circumstances that have yet to have their issue, since we have been doing a variety of other things in accordance with the doctrines of the present Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, there are many people in this country who will ask themselves what are the proper methods of husbandry. If they be the proper methods of husbandry according to the doctrines of the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, then there are very few men in this country, who are competent farmers, who will qualify for the rights provided under this sub-section.</P>
    <P>To my mind, sir, the detailed examination of this Bill can well wait till the Committee Stage.  The destruction of the system of land tenure in this country, of the security of the people on their land, is, in itself, sufficient to condemn the measure. Unless that element is corrected, unless <Col N="2419" /> the power of the Executive Council to appoint these <i>ad hoc</i> commissioners is corrected, unless the position of the Judicial Commissioner is remedied, no worth-while reform can be made in the Land Bill that is before us now. Security of tenure means more to the people of this country than anything the Fianna Fáil Government can offer. They have got that security of tenure, and Fianna Fáil proposes to take it from them.  So far as I am concerned, in this House or outside it, I will do all I can to prevent the passage of this Bill into law, and I believe that any man in this House who honestly represents the tenant farmers of Ireland, should devote his energy and should devote his ability and courage to the same undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in stating at the outset that I am prepared to give my full support to the policy aimed at by the Minister who is responsible for the introduction of this Bill.  At the same time, however, I am under no delusion as to the final consequences of the passage of this measure.  I would much prefer to sit here in these benches as a private Deputy to await the result of the administration of this measure, knowing, as I believe I do, and as I believe the Deputies who sit behind the Minister know, that this measure is not going to provide an economic holding for every landless man in this country.  I have heard promises made in general elections as to the land policy of the Fianna Fáil Party and Government and what their intentions were in regard to the division of land. I fully realise the limited amount of land that is available in this country for the purpose of making uneconomic holdings economic and, in addition, providing economic holdings for suitable landless men who are rightly entitled to such land.  I would much prefer, as I said, to remain here as a private Deputy and await the result of three or four years' administration by the Ministry of this measure, because I believe that by that time the Minister, or the Acting-Minister, if he sits on the same benches, will find out <Col N="2420" /> that he is nearly as far away from the solution of the land question as he is here to-day in putting forward this measure.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the object of the Bill was to provide a livelihood on the land for our own people.  Nobody in this country, knowing the conditions of the country at the present time, could feel that the people who have land and have economic holdings at the present time are making a livelihood out of the land.  Nobody who knows anything about present conditions will believe, or take the word of the Minister on it, that by giving a man a holding of 30 or 40 acres under present conditions he is going to make that man better off than he is to-day, no matter what his position may be.  There are many other things that will have to go with this measure in order to make it possible for anybody who may be lucky enough to get an economic holding under this Bill to make a living out of that holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to pay any attention to the violent language used by the three lawyer Deputies who have spoken in opposition to this measure as to what is the real intention of the Minister.  I can readily understand that this is going to mean less work for lawyers but, at the same time, less expense to the people who own the land and who will, under this Bill, get economic holdings. I would vote for the Second Reading of the Bill for the simple reason that it removes many legal difficulties deliberately put in the way of the fair and just administration even of the 1923 Act.  I am satisfied that those who advised the Minister responsible for the Bill had good grounds for advising him to insert sections which will make the administration of Land Acts less costly in future than in the past.  I am satisfied that even the Cumann na nGaedheal Government could have done much more under the Act of 1923 to carry out the intention of the people responsible for the introduction of that Act if these legal difficulties had not been put in the way and kept in the way.  There would have been no necessity to include many sections in this measure if many legal difficulties had not been put in the way <Col N="2421" /> by the previous Administration.  I believe that some lawyer Deputies who have spoken are unnecessarily apprehensive in regard to the intentions of the Minister in reference to these matters.  They talk about taking the security of land from the tenant farmers.  I never regarded it as my duty to defend the Fianna Fáil Ministry, but I am satisfied to leave it in their hands and to the passage of time to see that no such thing will be done by the Ministry responsible for the Bill.  It is just a bogey raised on this measure to try to create more alarm amongst the population in regard to the present Ministry and their attitude in regard to matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>Will anybody who speaks from the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches deny that the land of this country has been bought at a ridiculously high price since the passing of the 1923 Act? Will they not admit that that is largely attributable to the so-called appeal tribunal which had a final say in fixing the price of the land purchased under that Act?  I personally would be prepared to place more trust in the opinion of a good Land Commission official as to what was the real value of land under the 1923 Act than any lawyer I know of in this House or outside.  As a Deputy who represents a rural constituency I know people who got land under the 1923 Act at annuities of £1 15/-, £2 and, in some cases, £2 5/- per statute acre.  How could any industrious smallholder make a living out of land, even in 1925, 1926, 1927, much less to-day, so long as he had to pay £1 15/- or £2 per statute acre for it?  Does not every Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy who was here in 1923 know that this is, to a large extent, due to the Appeal Tribunal set up under that Act which has the final say in the fixing of the price?  I admit now, and I never admitted it before, that I discouraged the late Minister from taking over a small number of estates in my area because I realised that to take them over at the price fixed by the Judicial Commissioner would place a burden on the people who would get the land <Col N="2422" /> which in a few years they would find it impossible to bear.  When the next lawyer on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches stands up to speak will he tell us something about the operations of the Judicial Commissioner and to what extent, in how many cases, and to what percentage, that Appeal Tribunal was responsible for increasing the price of land beyond all reason and beyond what any intelligent and industrious farmer, or even a landlord, would admit to be a reasonable figure?</P>
    <P>I am now 11 years a member of this House, and as a representative of a rural constituency I have some knowledge of the operations of the Land Commission.  Any Deputy who has similar knowledge, giving a fair and honest expression of opinion will agree that these officials, generally speaking, know more about the real value of land than any lawyer in this country.  There are going to be many obstacles wiped out of the way which will take away a good deal of the incomes earned by lawyers in the past in connection with the administration of the 1923 Act.  I do not profess to be competent to express an opinion on every section of the Bill, but I am glad the Minister is taking power to remove the costly obstacle that was in the way of the collection of land annuities.</P>
    <P>I have here in my hand, and it is not one of the worst examples that could be quoted, a case which shows how lawyers have fattened upon the poor people by imposing unfair charges for the collection of annuities.  I have a receipt given by a certain State solicitor&mdash;I am very glad he is not operating in Leix and Offaly.  The sum due was £5 1/5.  A cheque for the amount was sent to the Land Commission three or four days after the sum became due.  It was returned by the Land Commission to the person concerned and he was informed that he would have to settle with the State solicitor.  He wrote to the State solicitor and got a reply stating that he would have to pay £1 12/- legal costs for the collection of this money without having to go to court.  I am glad the Minister has brought in a section which will <Col N="2423" /> make it impossible for any lawyer to impose such a burden on a poor person of that kind in future.  I can show the receipt to any Deputy who may be anxious to know whether I am stating facts or not.  I am glad to be given an opportunity of voting for a section which will make it impossible for any thing of that kind to happen in future.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied that the Land Commission has at its disposal a body of officials quite competent to administer a measure of this kind.  I am also quite satisfied, from my 11 years experience of dealing with the Land Commission, that that particular Department of the Government service will have to be completely reorganised from top to bottom if this Bill is to be sympathetically administered.  If it is notable for anything, the Land Commission is notable for the number of polite acknowledgements it sends to those who write about anything.  If a Deputy who writes to the Land Commission does not write three or four times, so far as certain branches of that Department are concerned he will never get anywhere.  He is likely to be an ex-Deputy before he will get a satisfactory answer to his question if he does not put down a question in the House or go to the Minister and shake up some of the officials.  There is one branch of that Department which appears to me to work along business like lines.  I believe it is an unpopular branch, but it certainly works along commercial lines, and that is the collection branch.  I am sure the collection branch of the Land Commission is not popular either with Deputies or with the people who have to address communications to it, but I will say this much for the satisfaction of those who may be concerned, that you can get an answer within a reasonable time to any communication you address to them.  Whenever I found it necessary, as other Deputies may have found it necessary to write to them asking for time for payment of sums due, I will say that they gave fair consideration to any reasonable applications made to them.  So far as other branches of that Department are concerned, I gave a friendly warning <Col N="2424" /> to the Minister&mdash;I suppose he knows it if he has been watching the operations of the Department himself&mdash;that he will have to completely reorganise the Department from top to bottom, and put in charge of it men who will have some sympathy with the policy of the present Government, and administer the present proposals without putting any unnecessary obstacles in the way.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech outlined the policy of the Government in regard to the collection of arrears.  I do not think there is any good grounds for congratulating him when he says that he is going to fund the arrears now due, and charge those concerned interest at the rate of 4½ per cent.  I do not think it is doing anything remarkably good for the people who owe money to the Land Commission, or who may desire to have their arrears funded, to say that he is going to fund the arrears due at the rate of 4½ per cent.  I wonder if the Minister for Finance were in the House would he say what is the cheapest rate at which he can get money at the present time.  I believe it is possible for the British Government, and I believe it is equally possible for the Free State Government to get money at a rate of interest as low as 2½ per cent., and, if we are going to fund arrears at the very high figure of 4½ per cent. over a period of 50 years, in my opinion it is not doing anything extraordinary on behalf of the people who are concerned with that aspect of this measure, or with that aspect of the policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister when he is replying if he would give us any definition as to what is an economic holding from his point of view.  I believe it is a very difficult question for the Minister to answer.  He referred in his speech to a 40 acre farm.  You may have 40 acres of bog land with a valuation of £5, and you may have 40 acres of good land with a valuation of £25.  I think Deputies, especially thoses who sympathise with the policy of the present Government in regard to this measure, are entitled to some information on that point. <Col N="2425" /> What would be regarded as an economic holding in the Midlands?  I do not suggest that the Minister should answer the question by talking about acreage.  I think he should tell us his opinion as to what is an economic holding from the point of view of valuation, and then Deputies will be left in a position to know where they are in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he hopes&mdash;that is all he does; he only expresses the hope &mdash;to provide a livelihood on the land for a large number of landless men. I am as anxious as the Minister to see the suitable landless men of this country given economic holdings, and an opportunity of providing for themselves and their dependants by ways and means of that kind.  I have some experience, and I suppose every other Deputy has also had some experience, in regard to the position of landless men.  I know some of the very best ploughmen and herds who, previous to the acquisition of estates in my constituency, could be regarded as the best employees that could be found in that particular locality.  I know to my regret that when given holdings on the estates that were acquired and divided&mdash;of course, I agree with that policy&mdash;that many of those people have been unable to work the holdings which they got, because of an insufficient amount of capital to enable them to do so.  I suggest to the Acting-Minister for Lands and Fisheries and his colleagues that unless they take some steps to provide, for a period of years, a certain amount of capital, £300 or £500 or whatever else it may be, free of interest, they are not going to give the suitable landless men a fair and reasonable chance of working any holding which may be given to them under a measure of this kind.  I believe the German Government some years ago took steps to solve the land problem by a policy of that nature.  What Deputy could get up in this House and suggest that the best landless man in his own constituency could possibly make a livelihood out of a farm of 40 acres of land if he had not the capital to enable him to start and work that land from the very beginning? <Col N="2426" /> I suggest that the Fianna Fáil Government and those who support them in this House would be well advised to think along those lines when they are dealing with the question of putting landless men on the land with any hope of enabling those men to make a living for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    <P>There is another question with which the members of this Party are concerned. In the administration of the 1923 Act I came up against a number of cases where land was divided, and where people living in labourers' cottages alongside the estate were refused a holding, or an addition to their existing small holding as occupiers of labourers' cottages.  I want to encourage the Acting-Minister for Land and Fisheries that whatever it is possible they should aim at giving four or five additional acres to tenants of labourers' cottages.  I admit that that may be impossible in many cases, because there may be no land to be acquired under this measure in certain areas, but wherever it is possible it would, in my opinion, be a good policy to provide the occupiers of labourers' cottages with at least an additional four or five acres in order to enable them to till portion of it, and have grass for a cow or a calf on the remaining portion.  I hope the Fianna Fáil Deputies will support that proposal.  I think whatever can be done in that direction is quite in accordance with the policy of the Minister, as far as I can understand it.  If it is necessary to make provision by way of inserting an amendment in the Bill I think that should also be done, if the Acting-Minister considers it desirable to insert a suitable amendment.</P>
    <P>There is also another matter to which I wish to refer.  I want to know from the Minister if he can give us, when he is replying, the number of cases of representatives of evicted tenants who were provided for since the 1923 Act was passed, and whether he has any knowledge or information at his disposal or in his Department as to the number of such genuine cases which are still to be provided for.  If so, what is the policy of his <Col N="2427" /> Department in making provision under this measure for the claims of evicted tenants, or representatives of evicted tenants, who have not up to the present been provided for under the 1923 or any subsequent Land Acts?  I am informed that there are a considerable number of genuine and deserving claims from tenants themselves who were evicted, or from the representatives of evicted tenants, which are still awaiting consideration and decision by the Department of Lands and Fisheries.  I hope that some information and some reliable figures, if they are available, will be furnished to the House by the Minister in his reply.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Acting-Minister would not like to take responsibility for a number of division schemes which have been put into operation even during the course of the past six months.  If the Minister and the Government are responsible for the procedure adopted in some of the cases that have come to my notice I would certainly say that there is not much improvement, so far as this Government is concerned, on the procedure of their predecessors in making provision for landless men or uneconomic holders.  I came across a case quite recently where a very large number of cottage tenants&mdash;this was within the last few months, and I raised it in the House by way of question&mdash; one of whom at any rate had turbary rights on a certain estate, and his people before him for 47 years, and where as a result of a division scheme recently put into operation in my constituency all the people concerned were deprived of turbary rights.  I believe it is the duty of the Land Commission under the present legislation to make reasonable provision for turbary rights, whenever there is a bog on any estate and whenever the bog is being acquired and taken over by the Land Commission.  I hope that that aspect of Government policy will be closely watched during the administration of this measure.  I bring that matter under the notice of the Acting-Minister and the House because we are told it is the policy of the Government to increase the output of turf for home <Col N="2428" /> consumption in this State.  If that is so, the first people entitled to consideration are the small holders who had, previous turbary rights in those estates, because those are the men who are going to increase the output, if they get a reasonable opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <P>There is one other point that I should like to bring under the notice of the Minister, and I should like to have some information on that point.  I understand that up to five or six months ago, under Section 42 of the Land Act, 1923, the Land Commission were empowered to deal with the Land Committee cases, and that as a result of the guarantee for the land bonds ceasing the Department concerned are no longer in a position to deal with outstanding cases.</P>
    <P>I am reliably informed because I have made inquiries and I am interested in a couple of cases, that 40 or 50 of such cases still await the decision of the Land Commission.  I hope that in this Bill steps will be taken to have these cases completed in all cases where the Department is of opinion that they could or should be dealt with under Section 42 of the Land Act of 1923.  I hope that either in this Bill or I presume in the Land Bonds Bill these steps will be taken. I understand that the Department concerned were given short notice but in the short time at their disposal they were unable to deal satisfactorily with the outstanding cases.  I hope the Minister will deal with that matter.  I am concerned with three classes of cases namely the cases of landless men who are going to get land under this measure.  I hope that they will be given a reasonable chance and fair opportunity of getting a proper start to work that land.</P>
    <P>I have suggested in company with a colleague of mine in discussing that matter with the President some short time ago that this Government will take steps to provide sufficient working capital for these men free of interest for the first five years in order to enable them to work this land. There should be increased acreage given to those who occupy labourers' cottages.  Finally the Land Committee <Col N="2429" /> cases should be disposed of.  I personally am going to make no apology for giving my vote in favour of this Bill on the Second Reading.  I am perfectly satisfied that it would be impossible for this Government or for any Government to get sufficient land to provide suitable holdings for all the applicants, congests and landless men.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made that this is a measure surrounded by political considerations.  If I were a member of the Fianna Fáil Party I would not boast too much about the political kudos to be got from this Bill or boast about the political kudos that might come to the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government as a result of passing this measure.  Time and experience will tell to what the political kudos will amount.  I would advise the back benchers on the Fianna Fáil Party that while they can get up and claim that this Bill rightly removes obstacles to the solution of the problem of land settlement that in the long run it will not finally settle the problem itself.  I have no delusions as to the meaning of this Bill from that point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge) Patrick J. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of heat, or if I might call it hot air, introduced into this debate.  Deputy Hogan starts off here to tell us that it is a purely political Bill.  I would gather from that that he thinks that this Bill is one that would be pleasing to the majority of the people of this country.  Then the Deputy proceeds to tell us that what we are aiming at in this Bill is to strip land from one body of people in order to give it to the Fianna Fáil followers. The Deputy talks about landless men. He talks about Connemara and says that this Bill provides no solution for the problem of landless men or for the problem of Connemara. Finally he goes on to tell us about fixity of tenure and he went on the same lines as Deputy Dillon who got into such a state of hot air about this matter of fixity of tenure.  It is a most extraordinary thing to hear Deputy Hogan talking about fixity of tenure because I think it was he <Col N="2430" /> who sponsored the 1923 Land Act.</P>
      <P>His talk here about fixity of tenure is all nonsense.  If fixity of tenure was interfered with at all it certainly was interfered with by the Act of 1923.  Deputy Dillon was in this House for two years and in that time he made no attempt to restore the conditions that existed before 1923 and to get the landlords restored back again.  Under the Act of 1923 the judicial non-vested tenant could be shifted out of his holding.  Now we are asked about fixity of tenure but under the 1923 Act that was the position.  If that was so why did not Deputy Dillon restore the damage that was done under that Act?  He made no attempt to do so.  The party are trying to lead the House to think that there has been interference with fixity of tenure in this Bill and the suggestion is made that that was the first time that fixity of tenure was interfered with in this country.</P>
      <P>When I was in the Land Commission I saw a number of cases and this was the position: you had a man in one particular place who held 1,500 acres.  That man employed only one labourer who lived with him, to see after the cattle on the farm&mdash;a man and a dog.  That was all the employment given on that farm.  We tried to take that farm from him, but he came in under the exceptions that were provided in the Act of 1923, under Section 24.  We failed to secure that farm.  We had instead to take land from a widow in that area because she did not come within that exception.  We had congestion in the area and we wanted the land.  I would rather stand over the position here that we would be able to deal with the individual who had 1,500 acres and gave no employment than to deal with an unfortunate widow and take her farm in order to relieve congestion there.  That is the sort of fixity of tenure that Deputy Hogan wants, but it is not the sort of fixity of tenure that this side of the House wants, nor the fixity of tenure that any decent or fair-minded person in this country would want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1923 Act you had power to take land from people in certain <Col N="2431" /> cases provided you offered them a holding of equal and suitable value. Under the operations of that Act, as was outlined by the Acting-Minister in introducing the Bill, considerable difficulty was experienced, and it is in order to obviate those difficulties and to get over the obstacles that we found in the operation of that Act that this Bill has been introduced.  The difficulties that we are trying to overcome in this Bill are difficulties that have been forcibly brought to the notice of the Land Commission since the 1923 Act was passed.  It is for us to make up our minds whether we are to stand still or go on.  It is for us to say whether we will be in a position to relieve congestion or let the land go back to the rancher.  Under the 1923 Act the Minister is precluded from touching these lands and congestion remains unrelieved.  We have to stand now for one position or the other.  I would certainly say it would be infinitely better to take these large ranches than to have to come down and take a comparatively small farm for the relief of congestion in the country, leaving the rancher's acres untouched. Deputy Dillon talks about fixity of tenure under the 1923 Act, but we have to make up our minds whether a man with a 1,500 acre ranch who gives no employment is to have the land left with him and that the land must be taken from people with comparatively smaller holdings in order to relieve congestion in certain areas.</P>
    <P>This Bill threatens nobody with regard to fixity of tenure who gives employment, who works his land, who lives on his land.  All these people are as reasonably protected as they might be.  They are as firmly protected as they equitably should be.  Do we realise since the 1923 Act was passed the number of cases that were protected under that Act?  Deputies opposite referred in some instances to 2,000 acre farms in fairly congested areas.  Do they realise that they referred to ranches?  When I heard Deputy Dillon talking about fixity of tenure and talking about the fight that was carried on in this country to secure <Col N="2432" /> fixity of tenure, my mind went back to the later stages of that fight, the period after the fixity of tenure. Fixity of tenure was not concerned with the 2,000 acre farms.  Fixity of tenure was concerned with securing for those people, who were being put out of their homes, a certain fixity in their holdings.  It concerned people living on the land and eking out a bare existence from it.  That was what the fight was made for.</P>
    <P>The latter part of that fight was concerned with the very thing we are trying to achieve here.  Their cry was: &ldquo;Break up the ranches and put the people on the land.&rdquo;  That was the period of the fight that I recollect, and that was the period of the fight that was brought most forcibly to everybody's mind, and it was certainly the forerunner of the 1923 Act.  We are just proceeding along that line of policy that was referred to in these days as: &ldquo;Break up the ranches and put the people on the land.&rdquo;  We are pursuing that policy to its logical conclusion.  We are endeavouring to overcome the difficulties in the way of the Land Commission, and our anxiety is to give employment on the land to the greatest possible number.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan says that this Bill is no solution of the Connemara problem. What is the solution?  They cannot emigrate from Connemara; the people there cannot get a living in another land.  They have been working their own miserable patches of barren land, trying to eke out an existence.  They have no alternative employment in that area.  There are no big farmers to give them employment.  What are you going to do with them?  If Deputy Hogan's idea is to leave them there, it is a very simple solution from that point of view, but that would not be facing the issue as it should be faced.</P>

      <P>It must be remembered there were people taken before from the West of Ireland.  They may be regarded as mere serfs by people of an overbearing mind, but at any rate there were people taken from the West and put into other places. They have succeeded in those other places, a certain number of them, and others I know have failed.  Big farmers were taken from the West and migrated to other parts of the country in order to provide additional holdings for the people in the West.  We will leave fixity of tenure, having seen the fallacy of the arguments advanced in connection with it.  No doubt a lot of noise will be made about it and a lot of hot air expended at the crossroads about it, in order to try to deceive the people as to what it really is.  Let us leave fixity of tenure and come to the other point about which so much has been made.  That point was to the effect that we are taking drastic powers to proceed against people, that the Land Commission are to lodge these warrants with the sheriff for execution.</P>
      <P>The ex-Attorney-General, Deputy Costello, seems very concerned about this matter.  He said that this is an extraordinary procedure.  He was Attorney-General for some years and I am surprised that he has such an extraordinary feeling about this procedure because, so far as I can recollect, he countenanced a procedure quite analogous to it.  During the time he was Attorney-General he did not worry when income tax people and others could resort to a somewhat analogous proceeding.  It is a wonder he did not object then.  He allowed that to go on.  Income tax people could distrain on your land or property with no previous court proceedings.  A rate collector could distrain on your stock.  There were powers taken here by the previous administration under which, no matter what person's cattle were on the land, the sheriff could seize them.</P>

      <P>Those were revolutionary things, but Deputy Costello when he was Attorney-General never took steps to remedy that position. He thinks now that such a state of affairs should not exist with regard to the defaulters in the case of land annuities.  He never took any steps to remedy the somewhat analogous position that exists with regard to income tax.  Of course he is terribly worried about it now.  He is worried about it because he just wants to make a point against the Bill. Another point he was worried about, or simulated being annoyed about, was this provision with regard to the appeal tribunal.  In a great many cases that have come before the Land Commission there have been no appeals.  There is a legal member of the Commission and three other commissioners. So far as my experience goes, numerous cases have come before them when there was not a legal member constituting it; but yet the decision arrived at gave satisfaction to both sides very often and there were no appeals.  We are told now that because two commissioners are to assist the Judicial Commissioner everything will go wrong.  The Judicial Commissioner will decide and the others may agree with him as to whether a certain question is a question of law.  I do not think there will be any great difficulty in deciding what is a question of law and what is an ordinary question of price or value.</P>

      <P>We are trying to take a little off.  So far as my experience went, many of the questions that used to come before the Commissioners were questions as to price, the acquisition of certain lands, whether there was equally suitable land in the area, etc. There have been some legal points raised, such as were raised in the Lynham and Butler case, but these are rather far between.  I believe the legal questions will be very few in number. To come back to the question of the defaulters, I wonder has the House any appreciation of the costs that often have been put on the unfortunate defaulters who have not been in a position from time to time to meet the six days' notice?  These costs are ordinary legal costs.  I will give an example of the costs that are incurred. A man owed one year's arrears to the extent of 16/1.  The costs amounted to 11/-, drawing the certificate 2/, lodgment fee 7/-, making a total of £1 16s. 1d.  That is to recover 16/- the unfortunate man had to pay 19/11 in addition to the 16/- that was the ordinary proper legal cost.</P>

      <P>We are trying to give an opportunity&mdash;and here is a golden opportunity&mdash;of getting rid of all that cost so far as the Land Commission is <Col N="2436" /> concerned.  The people have the opportunity now if they want it.  Reference has been made to two points in the Bill.  There is the bogey about fixity of tenure, and fees to the sheriff.  Upon these rules will be made giving information to the people.  Notice will be sent to the sheriff, who will notify those concerned of the validity of these and the other rules. There was no defence in the case of the Land Commission certificate.  There has been a good deal of experience of it in the country and all the defence ever put up to it was to ask for time. The people employed a solicitor, but all he did was to ask for time.  That can be done under our Bill by communicating with the Land Commission and taking the ordinary steps.</P>
      <P>The Bill itself has been explained fully by the Minister for Defence.  I do not think there is any necessity to refer again to any of the points he dealt with.  From the point of view of our own country the undertaking with regard to the annuities, and so on, and the funding of arrears, and so on, is a good and generous measure. Additional power is given to acquire land.  We asked for that.  Deputy Davin made the point as to whether men employed on land in the possession of the Land Commission would be interfered with.  Wherever such employment was given these people were never interfered with except where it was absolutely necessary. Under the Act of 1923, where division of land took place, people disemployed as a result were taken over.  That is the position and that will be continued under this Bill.  The Land Commission can acquire land where they feel it is necessary to do so, and which can be taken over easily, and which will give the greatest relief. That was the way the administration of the Land Act of 1923 was carried out.  In the same way the powers acquired under this Bill will be carried out and efforts will be made to acquire as many economic holdings as possible for the people.  It is not at all necessary to take away fixity of tenure or anything of that kind, such as we have heard about, and there is no intention to do so.</P>

      <P>I do not know why he was so insistent that he was not offering an apology.  As a layman looking at the point of view put forward by Deputy Davin and the Minister for Justice, it seems to me that their plea in reality amounts to one for the abolition of judges to settle these matters.  They tell us that the Department is much better, more efficient and less costly; but there is just one thing that they have left out of consideration and it is this. Judges are appointed and they are not removable.  The objection to the tribunal we are now discussing is that two out of three of its members are laymen, and the majority decide.  They are completely the creatures, for this purpose, of the Minister.  In fact the Government are getting rid of the independent authority and that was the reason for the objection of Deputy Costello to this particular section.  By some strange mischance even the Minister for Justice seemed to have missed the main contention of Deputy Costello.  The objection of Deputy Davin to the Chief Commissioner was that he kept up the price of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That he put up the price of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>And that apparently is approved by Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches.  I presume, therefore, that one of the purposes that the Judicial Commissioner&mdash;an independent authority&mdash;not removable at the whim of the Minister, is being superseded by the tribunal is to put down the price of land.  Now it is not the landlord's land that is to be depressed in price, it is the tenant's land that is to be put down and that is one of the purposes of the Bill; it stares us in the face.  It is quite obvious that is why the Judicial Commissioner <Col N="2438" /> is to be superseded by the tribunal which is to be set up.  The Minister for Justice told us that, of course, the Judicial Commissioner is supreme on questions of law.  But the question need not come to him.  The lay commissioners can decide that it is not going to be a question of law. Again, speaking as a layman, I have heard from judges and others that one of the most difficult questions to determine is what is a question of law and what is a question of fact.</P>
      <P>Coming to more serious aspects of this measure I gather from the Minister for Justice and the Acting Minister for Lands and Fisheries that this is only a first step.  In answer to a question put by Deputy MacDermot the Minister said that it would solve at least a part of the question that cries for solution.  That is a clear indication that it is only a first step. The closing remarks of the Minister for Justice show that this was a minimum.  It was a maximum in the sense that it was all they could get through at the moment, but so far as their ideals are concerned it is a minimum. Anyone reading the speeches not merely of Fianna Fáil Deputies, and their supporters, but of Ministers, and the President, knows perfectly well that this is only the beginning and that there is no intention of stopping at £2,000 farms.  In his pronunciamento from Paris it is clear that a 30 acre farm will be the President's idea. Are we given any indication that they are going to stop at £2,000 farms. Does anybody believe they can?  It is quite obvious that they cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice spoke of the agitation that preceded the Land Bill of 1923.  I remember that agitation very well and I remember the intense uneasiness that agitation for the division of the land caused all through the country.  I know the way the Sinn Fein Party dealt with it won the support of a great many people.  Because they had the interest of the country at heart and they knew the danger of an agitation of that kind and that it was one that was extremely difficult to control or check.  In a deliberate way we <Col N="2439" /> suggest that the Government is now by this measure starting an agitation for the division and the sub-division and the further sub-division of the land in this country until, finally, you will have uneconomic holdings for everybody. That will be the inevitable result.  Deputy Davin may be quite satisfied that the result will be different, namely, that in four years time we will be no nearer the solution than we are at the present moment. That may be so, but I suggest that if that is the case we are paying a very heavy price in doing away with important principles for a very poor mess of pottage indeed.  How can anybody suggest that this Bill is anything more than the beginning?  The tenant ownership was not disturbed by the 1923 Act.  It was then that for many that full ownership was established and, since then, we took care never to interfere with that particular ownership.  I make this suggestion, that this Bill will be as fatal to the hold the tenant farmers have on their land as the Land Bill of 1881 was fatal to the hold the landlords had on their land; and if there were landlords at that time who prophesied a dire future for their class and opposed that Bill of 1881, there should be tenant farmers at the present day opposing this Bill for the same reason.  This Bill will be as fatal to ordinary tenant farmer proprietorship of economic holdings in this country&mdash;perhaps even more fatal&mdash;as was the Land Bill of 1881 to the landlords of this country. After a generation and a half the landlords are gone and in a very short space of time&mdash;because things march much faster nowadays&mdash;the situation of the tenant farmers will be in as parlous a condition as the landlords.  That is the position which Deputies ought to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>I am not going into the ethics of the situation.  I find that, so far as that is concerned, there are apparently different ethical principles cherished by the Fianna Fáil Party from those in which I was brought up.  Therefore, <Col N="2440" /> I will not discuss the matter from that point of view, but I will discuss it from the point of view of national expediency &mdash;from the point of view that you are here establishing a principle and starting an avalanche which you cannot stop.  You cannot stop this Bill, as everybody must feel in his heart, at the £2,000 farm.  You will quickly have to go beyond that, and if you take a £3,000 farm and take over the value of £2,000 in order to provide farms for landless men, there will still be landless men left.  What justification will you have when your ideal is the 30-acre farm, as evidenced by your President, to stop short of taking the next step of going on to the 30-acre farm?  As long as there are landless men there, how can you stop short of that?  You know perfectly well that you cannot stop short and, as the Minister said, this is only the minimum.  This is the minimum.  This is only the first step. It is quite in keeping with the whole policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They speak about the merits of this Bill and Deputy Davin, as usual, backed them up.  I am glad to see the old alliance has been fully restored and that friendly relations are again existing between the two parties.</P>

      <P>Well, they stand for commonsense and principle anyhow.  Legal technicalities have been swept away.  A great deal more than legal technicalities have been swept away, and because a great deal more than legal technicalities have been swept away we oppose this particular Bill.  You cannot take this particular Bill, bad as it is, by itself.  You will have to relate it to the whole mentality of the Government and to their speeches about land and to what their ideals and purposes are.  You are acknowledging here a principle that will lead a great deal further than many supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party think it will lead.  At least they will find out to their cost that that is so.  You will have to relate it to the general attitude towards employment and to bear in mind that, so far as people who actually give employment, <Col N="2441" /> and not merely promise it in the future, are concerned there has always been from the ranks of that Party an unreasoned hostility to them.  The man who gives employment has always been looked upon as a kind of enemy of the people, as a man living on the labour of others.  You are doing the same thing here to the land as you have done, by taxation and other measures, to the industry of the country.  You are doing here what you have done elsewhere, and that is creating uncertainty, cutting away the foundations of any certainty on which the farmers of this country can stand.</P>
      <P>Warnings were issued on other aspects of the Government policy that that would be the result of their efforts and that, not merely would the people with something in their pockets be hit, but also the people in employment and who were living by the work of their hands would be hit; that their employment would become uncertain.  Have we not had plenty of examples of that in the last couple of weeks when we see efforts being made to drive men out of employment who have been in that employment for a long time? That is also going to spread to the farming community.  When we issued warnings against that particular result of the Government policy, naturally, of course, we were sneered at.  In the last couple of weeks there have been striking instances in which, unfortunately, out prophecies have been proved to be only too true, and where the man in employment is no longer sure how long he is going to remain in that employment.  That uncertainty that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party has spread everywhere, they are going to spread now to the foundation of the main industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Lands and Fisheries put it, I think, in an article he wrote some years ago: &ldquo;We must have conditioned holding of land... subject to State control.&rdquo;  It was something like that.  I am not speaking now of the Acting-Minister but of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, the man into whose hands the power is now being given by this particular Act; and we have some vague ideas as to the views he holds about property <Col N="2442" /> and various other things.  I suggest that all that is only in keeping with the whole attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party and with the attitude they have adopted even so far as land is concerned. I remember in this House, speaking on the Wheat motion, that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, then Deputy Lemass, pointed out that the State&mdash;the community&mdash;had a right to demand from the farmers that they should use the land as the community thought fit; that the community had given them the land&mdash;that is what I want to stress &mdash;and, apparently, could take it away. Right through all this Bill that is the conception undoubtedly, and that can be the only justification for it.  Of course, I am not surprised that that does not create trouble for Deputy Davin.  I presume he speaks for his Party.  The conception right through the Bill is that the State owns the land; that the land belongs to the State and not to the farmers.  That would be one justification for this Bill.</P>

      <P>I did not misrepresent the Deputy.  He supports the principle.  He rejoices in this Bill.  I do not see any misrepresentation in that.  The Deputy supports that Bill. Show me where I am misrepresenting you.  The Bill stands for one principle, and the Deputy supports that with great pleasure.  In fact, the only thing I can find out from the Deputy's speech is that the Bill does not go far enough or quickly enough.  He feels that in four years we will be in a similar position to that in which we are now. That was his main objection to the Bill. We had the Minister for Agriculture at Claremorris saying: &ldquo;You will find that under this new Land Bill we are going to make an attempt to put the Irish people on the land that properly belongs to them.&rdquo;  Who are they going to put out of it?  Are they not Irish <Col N="2443" /> people?  In what sense does he mean that the land belongs to the people? Does he mean it belongs to the State? Why use such a vague term as that? It does not belong to the State; it belongs to the individual farmers, and it is being taken away from them. That is carefully concealed.  There are people who may say that there are no implications in this Bill, but the implications are there.  There are various aspects of the Bill that we might discuss.  I quite admit the difficulty in collecting old arrears, but why were they not funded?  Why is the man who owed seven years' arrears of annuity treated more favourably than the man who paid up to the last three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Why were not these arrears funded?  The land annuities were reduced by half.  Why? Because of the present value of land. But these arrears were contracted long before the fall in prices took place.  Why are these people singled out for special treatment?  I do not suggest you can collect the arrears all at once.  Why is there not a funding of seven years' arrears instead of three years?  What is the principle of distributive justice so far as that is concerned?  The farm stands to the farmer in the position that the factory does to the manufacturer; it is his means of livelihood.  If you are justified in taking away portion of that land, why do you not interfere with the manufacturer as well?  Why will you not take away some of his factory if he is making too much?</P>

      <P>As I said, I object to this Bill because it enshrines a principle that I believe to be extremely dangerous.  We have time and again warned the Government that they were going along dangerous paths.  Everything that has occurred in the last 18 months only convinces me that every warning we issued was, unfortunately, more than justified.  I object also to the particular mental attitude that this Bill represents and that is being worked up in the country&mdash;the attitude that a man is a public enemy because he has property and gives employment.  There is an attitude of envy, hostility and hatred being worked up.  That is not an atmosphere in which to bring in a confiscatory Bill of this kind.  It is quite true that there are countries that deal with moderate sized farms in the way in which this Bill proposes to deal with them.  I am sorry that in this, as in other cases, the Government have seen fit to follow that particular example.  There is no real justification so far as this is concerned.</P>
      <P>I ask the House to be under no delusions as to what the full consequences of the measure will be.  I can only repeat what I said, that I am convinced that this Bill will be as fatal to the hold that the Irish farmer has on his land as the Land Act of 1881 was fatal to the hold that the landlord had on his land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very amusing to hear the criticisms levelled at this the Opposition benches.  They made a whole lot of prophecies about what is going to befall the country if the Bill is passed.  In the absence of any <Col N="2445" /> other case, the charge is levelled by Deputy Hogan that this is simply a measure introduced for political purposes.  I think that when Deputy Hogan was making such charges he was thinking of the state of his own mind when he introduced the Land Bill in 1923, which was lauded all over the country at the time, and for many years afterwards, as being the great solution of the land question. Nothing better ever came or would ever come again to the country than the 1923 Land Bill.  The people were to be settled on the land.  Even the landless men that the Fianna Fáil Party are accused of trying to win over for political purposes, were to be looked after under Deputy Hogan's Land Bill of 1923.  Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Hogan, Deputy Costello and Deputy Dillon have accused the Fianna Fáil Party of playing politics by trying to play up to the landless men and stated that the landless men are going to be catered for by this Bill.  When the Deputies were making these statements, did they not think of the statements made by Deputy Hogan when introducing the Land Bill in 1923, the Land Bill which was going to settle the problem, but after nine or ten years of its administration Deputy Hogan has to come to the House and say that this is a big problem.  Deputy Dillon has to say that it is a big problem.  Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Costello also had to say that there is a very big problem to be settled.  Therefore, they admit that the great Land Bill of 1923 did not settle the problem or touch the fringe of the problem. What about the accusation as to the landless men?  We find Deputy Hogan reported in the Official Reports for 1923, column 1944, as making this statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The problem of congestion is a huge one and bristles with many difficulties.  There are congests on practically every estate and whereever there are congests the Land Commission will acquire the estates, deal with the congests and resell the balance to landless men.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now mind you, was not that good <Col N="2446" /> politics?  Did the Acting-Minister for Lands and Fisheries play as good politics?  Not at all.  We are not in the running with Deputy Hogan, who accuses us to-day of playing politics. Furthermore, he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are thousands of wretched holdings huddled together along and near the sea coasts, all under £10 valuation and with very little untenanted land of any kind in the neighbourhood to provide for them. As far as possible these tenants must be migrated, and as far as possible the bigger tenants must be migrated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was not that good politics?  Was not it a very fine political speech?  To carry that into further effect Deputy Hogan went down to Ballinasloe on the last Sunday of August, 1923, and after dealing with the problem of landless men and how land was going to be provided for them through the 1923 Act he said that the 100,000 congests would be catered for.  Was not that good politics by the man who to-day accuses Fianna Fáil of introducing this Bill for no other reason than playing politics?  They see simply their own tactics of the past, and Deputy Hogan &mdash;because his mind was solely directed to political considerations&mdash;thinks that the Minister could have no other reason for introducing a Land Bill than that of providing land for his friends. The Fianna Fáil Government has a long way to go before they cater so much for their friends as did the man who to-day accused them of playing politics.</P>
    <P>Under the 1923 Land Act the Mount Talbot House, Roscommon, was purchased by the Land Commission.  An amount of timber was sold which practically made up for the purchase price.  The Mount Talbot House and 158 acres of land surrounding it, including gardens and some timber, were let by the Land Commission as one holding. One of the local congests&mdash;mind you, one of the hardworking farmers whom Deputy Hogan boosted to-day; working a very small holding, saving money and looking around for a patch of land he could buy&mdash;offered £300 and the appropriate rent to cover the cost as <Col N="2447" /> valued by the Land Commission for 50 acres of that land.  Of course he was refused and sneered at, although he was recommended by the Land Commission inspector.  Who got the Land?  The 158 acres, with the house, were given to Deputy Hogan's best friend and local henchman for £1,300, £300 down and £1,000 to be paid at the rate of £47 10/- per annum.  The Fianna Fáil Government must go a long way before they are able to come up to Deputy Hogan or to the Front Bench opposite in providing for their friends and giving them land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan talked to-day about the hardworking farmer who would save money on the small holding, and buy a small patch outside it if he could get it, but that was not thought of by Deputy Hogan when a similar farmer to the one he boosted to-day offered to buy 50 acres of land at the Land Commission's valuation in 1925 or 1926, and was refused by Deputy Hogan.  It is from those men, whose hands are soiled, that the accusations come about political tactics, and Bills brought in for political purposes. They talk about the farmer being down and out; that farming is no good in this country and will not pay.  What objection have they, therefore, to farmers who are losing on their farms of 150 or 250 or 500 or 1,000 acres having them bought over from them, and given to men who will work them?</P>
    <P>I do not at all agree that farmers are down and out.  I am not taking the Fianna Fáil method of valuation in that.  I am taking the valuation of probably the most prominent leader in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in the country, who does not at all agree with the Centre Party or with the Cumann na nGaedhead Party that land is a bad proposition in this country.  We had ex-Deputy Gorey a few weeks ago paying £2,500 for a holding of land, in addition to a few other holdings which he has already.  Is that not a tribute to our Minister for Agriculture?  Is that not a tribute to our Government? Does ex-Deputy Gorey not know <Col N="2448" /> as much about land as Deputy Belton?  Does ex-Deputy Gorey not know as much about land as Professor O'Sullivan, a professor in the National University?  Does ex-Deputy Gorey not know as much about land as Deputy Dillon?  Ex-Deputy Gorey always boasted of living by the land.</P>

      <P>He paid £2,500 for land. He invested £2,500 in land at a time when we are told by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and the Centre Party that land is a bad proposition, and that nobody should put his money into it.  Mind you, I am prepared to take ex-Deputy Gorey, having heard him for a number of years talk on land matters, to be as good an authority on land, its value, what can be made out of it, and what money should be invested in it, as any man, any professor, or any lawyer who has yet spoken about this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion the Government are making a very big effort to settle the land problem.  That cannot be denied even by the Deputies opposite.  None of them has said that it is not an effort to settle that problem, and none of them denies that there is a problem, even after the great Land Act of 1923. To my mind, as far as taking over land is concerned, relief of congestion should be the main object.  Relief of congestion should be the first call on any national Government.  We have, throughout the country most disgraceful land slums.  There is a big estate in the County Mayo, the Palmer Estate.  You have it shown that there is one holding containing only two acres, one rood, divided up into 18 plots.  You have another holding containing 14 acres and 11 perches comprising 35 plots.  You have in that whole area a few thousand farmers.  As far as the nation is concerned, and as far as the national outlook is concerned, they have as much right to a livelihood as have the greater ranchers referred to to-day by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  They were the men who won whatever was won in the land war. They were the men whom Deputy Dillon referred to as putting up a great <Col N="2449" /> fight.  It was they who suffered, and nothing was done for them.  I am very glad that our Government has taken the trouble to find out what the land problem is in places like the Palmer Estate, and that they are going to get down to that problem and not heed any friend of the idle rich on the opposite benches who talks about disturbing the fixity of tenure.  They suggest that holdings of ten acres are going to be taken over, and the occupiers put out on the roadside.  That is the Cumann na nGaedheal objection to this Bill.  How far did they succeed in taking over land successfully and dividing it among the congests under the 1923 Bill?  In County Mayo there is one estate, the taking over of which was made a prominent part of the Cumann na nGaedheal policy at a few elections&mdash;the demesne lands of Castle Hill.  Under the last Government's Bill it was found impossible to take over that land; even though evictions within the last 55 years have taken place within that demesne.  A demesne wall was built out of the houses knocked down there within the last 55 years.  That is a demesne of 1,500 acres.  Where you have such conditions as have been explained, this Bill gives us a remedy for the taking over of demesnes of that kind.</P>
    <P>The vote given on this Bill by Mayo Deputies is a vote given to continue the system of withholding lands like Castle Hill lands from the people of Mayo.  We have in this particular place a farm which the Cumann na nGaedheal Government have been trying since 1926 to acquire.  As far as I can find out Deputy Roddy when he was in charge of the Land Commission did everything he could within the Act of 1923 to acquire that land.  He failed to get the lands of Hagfield in Mayo. But this Bill provides a remedy.  When we get down to hard tacks it is really in order to prevent lands such as these being taken over that all the blustering talk about disturbing fixity of tenure and other things have been spoken.  All the talk is simply bluff and political tactics on the part of Cumann na nGaedheal.  The problem of congestion is a big one.  I am not so interested in the problem of providing <Col N="2450" /> land for landless men.  I take it that it is the policy of the Government that the condition of the congests, of uneconomic landholders is to be dealt with first, and when that problem is dealt with then it might be a very wise policy to consider the question of providing land for farmers' sons who know how to work the land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, who spoke on this Bill, asked why should the State have any say in the matter as to how the farmer should work his land.  The Deputy instanced the case of a factory and asked should the State have any say as to how the owner of a factory was to run that factory?  I say the State should have a great lot to do with that question.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government when in power took it on itself to have a good deal to do with matters of that kind. If a man were the owner of a factory and had valuable machinery and if he, because he had interests in some other country, allowed that factory to go into decay and the machinery to lie idle at the expense of the livelihood of 200 or 300 workers and their families, would the State have any right to interfere in such a case?  Are we to allow monopolists and idle men to run this country and make it a playground for themselves and their passions?  I say it is the same as far as the land is concerned.  In this country where we have the finest land in the world there are people with large tracts of this fine land which are not being worked in the interests of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  It is the duty of the State to solve these problems.  I do not see any wrong in this Bill when you think of the confiscatory powers that were taken by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in the matter of the Shannon scheme and in dealing with the lighting in the different towns.  There was confiscation there, absolute confiscation, out and out confiscation, and the matter was not as vital to the country-people, to the farmers and the workers as this Bill.  To my mind, it is a Bill that has not gone too far, probably not far enough, as far as the people in this country want and deserve.  There has been a great deal of talk about the three years' arrears to be forgiven by the Land Commission. We have been told that these arrears are forgiven because the people who owe them are Fianna Fáil supporters.  Will any Cumann na Gaedheal Deputy put down an amendment asking that these arrears be not forgiven?  Will they get every member of their Party to vote for it? Unless there is a very strict Party whip I am going to vote for that amendment, and so far as I know, a pretty big number, if not the majority of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, will vote for such an amendment.  I am not so sure that the Minister may not on the Committee Stage go back on that. Then we will see where the boot pinches.  At least this provision should be made that arrears should not be forgiven in any case over a certain valuation, say £20 or £25 valuation.  I say that because during the years when Cumann na nGaedheal was in office, when as they assert, they made this country a happy and rich land for the farmers, surely a man with a valuation over £25 should be able to pay his rent.  If he was not able to pay his rent when Cumann na nGaedheal was in office he should not be entitled to any reduction now.  I would like very much to see Deputy Belton, on the Committee Stage of this Bill, put down an amendment asking the Government not to forgive the arrears which it is proposed in this Bill to forgive.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2452" /> It is proposed in this Bill to acquire land.  It is proposed to acquire it in a more expeditious manner than was done by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  It is proposed to put aside all the red tape, and when the land is acquired it is proposed that the Land Commission should have the final say in the matter.  It is proposed that no rancher or demesne owner, whose ranches have been taken over in the interests of the people, will have the right to go to an appeal tribunal and pull wires, as they so often tried to do before.  I say &ldquo;tried to do before.&rdquo;  The charge is made that it is an unwise thing and a political move to interfere with the appeal tribunal.  But I say that is the best thing in this Bill.  We know as much about this problem as the people on the opposite benches.  I know one particular case in the County Mayo where the valuers of the Land Commission went down a few years ago and valued an estate.  The owner of that estate appealed to the tribunal.</P>

      <P>No.  That is a very important matter and there again you run up against the argument of the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies that you interfere with fixity of tenure.  I know a particular place in County Mayo where a couple of hundred acres of bog are held by two individuals who sell it to local congests every year at a fabulous price.  They have no right to hold that bog from the people.  It is the duty of the Government to come to the assistance of the people and to purchase that bog from those two individuals regardless of title.  They should not allow those people to penalise the local congests almost in the same manner as the landlords did in the old days.  This is tackling the problem.  It may not settle it finally, but at any rate it is a decent effort and, so far as a settlement of the land question goes, it will, I believe, settle the whole problem of congestion in this State.</P>

      <P>We have had some expressions of dissatisfaction from the opposite benches in relation to this Bill.  We were told by some Deputies there that it does not go far enough. There are others who declare that it does not carry out sufficiently the policy, of those who want to dispossess the people who are in and put in the people who are out.  I hope, before this debate comes to an end, we will have an expression of dissatisfaction from other members of the Party, the people who think it is going too far. I would like to give this assurance to the people who do not think it is going far enough, that if they examine the machinery they will find that it is revolutionary enough even for their taste.  To my mind this measure proposes to set up a dictatorship in the Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards those Fianna Fáil Deputies who think this Bill is going too far, I hope they will have the courage other Deputies of their Party had to come forward and express their dissatisfaction with the Bill.  There are numbers of pretty large holders supporting Fianna Fáil who, it is a matter of common knowledge, are very uncomfortable about this Bill.  I hope their spokesmen in the House will have the courage to say that they disapprove of the Bill.  I would regard such an expression with great satisfaction, just as I regard the discomfiture of those people with satisfaction. If people choose to go for a ride on a tiger it affords a certain amount of satisfaction to onlookers, when people <Col N="2455" /> deliberately put themselves in that position, to see how in their discomfort they will get down and get away.</P>
    <P>This Bill has taken a lot of hatching and it has made its appearance in the form which Deputy Hogan described.  He termed it a political Bill.  Apart from being political, it is a revolutionary Bill because it proposes to set up a dictatorship in the Ministry.  Let us examine Section 6. It purports to divide the authorities of the Land Commission into two parts.  It sets out, first of all, to except matters which the Minister is not entitled to deal with himself and then, further on, it confers absolute powers on the Minister as regards everything else.  The excepted matters are the determination of the individuals from whom land is to be taken, the price to be paid, the persons to whom it is to be given and the price to be paid by them.  The Bill goes on to give the most dictatorial powers to the Land Commission, acting under the direct instructions of the Minister, as to what is to be done.  Why draw a distinction at all between the powers given to the Minister?</P>
    <P>The body to whom the right of appeal is given is a farcical body consisting of three persons.  We were first told it would consist of the Judicial Commissioner and two lay commissioners.  To-day we were informed that in Committee an amendment will be introduced substituting Land Commissioners for the Lay Commissioners.  We are told nothing further as to any change that is proposed except in the name to be applied.  So far as we know, the extraordinary powers given to the Minister to nominate people to act as his puppets are to be retained. According to Section 7 (1), on and after an appointed day the Judicial Commissioner and any two officers of the Land Commission for the time being nominated by the Minister are to act as an appeal tribunal.  In other words, the whole scheme is to put two gentlemen there who are the creatures and the puppets of the <Col N="2456" /> Minister, because they are only there for the time being.  They are there, not as judicial persons, but as persons carrying out the instructions and the policy of the Minister.  If they fail to do that, they cease to be there; they are appointed only for the time being.  That destroys every safeguard that centuries have invented to provide some authority independent of the Administration to act between the Administration and the subject in the just carrying out of the law.</P>
    <P>That tribunal is most extraordinary from many points of view, because it puts the Judicial Commissioner in the position that he is not even entitled to exercise the primary function of saying what is a question of law.  In order to determine that a question of law arises, he must get the concurrence of at least one of the two Lay Commissioners.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, one of the greatest difficulties that judges very often have is to say what is really a question of law as distinct from what is a question of fact.  There are questions of law purely and there are questions of fact purely, and there are mixed questions of law and fact.  Very often one of the greatest difficulties judges experience is to determine into which particular class some questions may fall.  Here we have a Judicial Commissioner harnessed to two laymen who have no qualifications whatever beyond merely being officers of the Land Commission. They may be junior clerks taken out of the office.  We are told now they are to be Land Commissioners.  We are not told what qualifications applies to the description of Land Commissioner. These two gentlemen can control the Judicial Commissioner in deciding what is a question of law.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Attorney-General is not in the House, because I would like to tell him that in my opinion the proposal is absolutely <i>ultra vires</i> of Article 64 of the Constitution, which provides that the judicial power of this State is to be exercised by judges appointed under the Constitution. These men are not judges and this section proposes to confer judicial power on laymen who have no legal <Col N="2457" /> qualifications whatever and are not appointed judges.  You can, if you like, appoint laymen with sufficient qualifications for the position of judges, but unless you make them judges under the Constitution you cannot allow them to exercise the powers proposed to be given them under this Bill.  It appears to me that it is proposed to set up a dictatorship as regards land in this country; but it is not a dictatorship in the healthy sense in which that position has been created in other countries, because the head of this movement is not a national figurehead.  He is the figurehead of the Fianna Fáil Party.  If the time ever comes, as outlined by the Acting-Minister for Lands and Fisheries when speaking a year or so ago after his Government took office, somewhat in the spirit of hope rather than a prophecy, that power is handed over to a Government more extreme than this, then the tenant supporters of the Government at the present time, who have gone for a ride on a tiger, will begin to understand the implications of this Bill in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice did not like Deputy Hogan's speech because he called this a political Bill, and because he referred to fixity of tenure. I hope before this Bill has gone through this House the tenant purchasers of the country will understand that everything that was got for them by Parnell, Davitt, and Redmond, and O'Brien, and Dillon is being swept away from them.  Everything is being taken away from them and they have no longer in future a security of tenure.  We had recently a principle announced, apparently with the benediction of the Labour Party that men in constant employment are no longer to have fixity of tenure and that other people may be taken on in their places.  Now the same principle is to be applied to tenant purchasers.  People occupying farms are to be put out to make room for men, some of them perhaps very deserving and some not, who have no land at the present time.  Security of tenure is to be abolished under this Bill.  Let the tenant farmers not <Col N="2458" /> forget that.  Deputy Hogan referred to one case that might arise where a residential holder is a small man who has an adjoining holding, his principal source of livelihood, and which is not protected at all.  There is the other case of a man with two farms, one a winter farm and the other a summer farm.  He is not protected either and yet he is one of the best types of farmers we have in the country.  One of the great difficulties we have in this country is that we have no example of all-the-year-round farms that they have in other countries.  That man is not protected under this Bill.  He is to be ousted from his security of tenure.</P>
    <P>There is another section of the Bill to which reference has been made already.  This section substitutes a warrant issued by the Land Commission for a court order in the case of unpaid annuities.  Deputy Davin became very eloquent on that and said that three lawyer Deputies who spoke complained of that because it took work away from them as lawyers.  The three Deputies were Deputy Hogan, ex-Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Costello and Deputy Dillon.  Not one of them would be affected to the extent of one farthing in 20 years as regards their personal earnings by the change made in this Bill.  It would be as absurd to say that the pier-master in Dun Laoghaire would be affected as to say the Deputies referred to would be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin talked a great deal of nonsense upon this subject.  He overlooked the fact that the proposals now contained in this Bill were put before a joint committee on the Courts of Justice Acts three or four years ago by an officer of the Land Commission. Evidence was taken and considered, but the committee unanimously turned down these proposals because they came to the conclusion they would lead to trouble.  I am making no reflection upon the staff of the Land Commission. It is a very big department and in any such huge department such as that a number of mistakes may sometimes occur.  It is only natural that it might occur that people might be <Col N="2459" /> sued for annuities that they had already paid.  But it is now proposed to take away the protection that the order of the court proposed between the annuitants and the Land Commission. They are really the collector of the money in a particular transaction and judge in their own case.  They are to be allowed to issue warrants without any means of redress by the persons on the other side.  Taking another point made by the Minister for Justice, it is quite easy to devise some system in the case of some people who default by which the costs could be reduced to a minimum.  Speaking again from recollection in regard to the report of that committee I spoke of, I think they made recommendations, upon that subject also.  When Deputy Davin talks a great deal of nonsense upon this subject I might remind him that that committee included members not only of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party but members of the Labour Party as well.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said by way of excusing the provisions of this Bill on the grounds that it follows the lines of previous legislation.  The Acting Minister, in introducing the Bill, talked about people for whom land would be provided.  He mentioned landless men and then went on in that delightfully vague way to add &ldquo;and so on.&rdquo;  That is a very pregnant phrase because it included every person that the political administration chooses to give land to.  There were safeguards in all previous legislation preventing abuses of that kind. There are none here because the people who will be in authority in the department will be the puppets and nominees of the Minister.  The fundamental mistake made in this Bill is that it opens the floodgates of a system no Government can stop.  The land hunger in this country does not need to be stimulated.  But it is stimulated and intensified by the proposals in this Bill.  We hear people described as ranchers because they have 300, 400 or 500 acres, but this Bill will create a situation that in a few <Col N="2460" /> years a man with 30 or 40 acres will be described as a rancher and demands will be made for the division of his farm.  This Bill introduces a new and revolutionary principle in Irish land.  It will create a new period of unrest and will give rise to land agitation in this country the end of which no man can see.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hogan seemed to be somewhat disappointed with this Bill.  He called it a real bad Bill.  What is this Bill?  Is it not in practice the same Bill as Deputy Hogan was forced to introduce in 1923 but with all the different impediments put there purposely removed.  That is all this Bill is. We have taken all the monkey-wrenches, nuts and different other impediments that clogged the machinery out of the way and we have put protection around that machine so that it can function properly.</P>
      <P>Why did the former Minister for Agriculture introduce the Bill of 1923 at all?  He was forced to do it. There was no way out of it.  If he had not introduced that Bill, the people would have taken the land themselves, and he introduced that Bill with the full determination to remedy what he called that evil. Gradually he repented.  If he did not repent, those outside his circle did repent.  Deputy Hogan talked about this Bill being political.  There is nothing political about it.  Neither was his Bill political when he introduced it, although it was not long until it became so.  In County Meath nobody would believe that there was ever a Land Act in the country. Occasionally, one sees attempts at the division of land.  Occasionally land is held up there.  It belongs to nobody at all, seemingly.  It is nobody's child.  Nominally, it belongs to the Land Commission and you see it in the names of men with strange names.  Sometimes it is not stocked at all; sometimes it is half stocked with hungry cattle which are taken up to Dublin and sold in mass for 10/- or£1 and if they can get that much, well and good.</P>

      <P>It is the fault of the monkey-wrenches that were thrown into the Land Act.  If things remained as they are, that land would remain there for the next 20 years.  It could not be divided.  I admit that land hunger is intense, but no matter how bad it is, or how strong the land hunger is, nobody is going in to take that land.  What do we mean to do in all this?  Let us take the position in a county like Meath.  Around the town of Navan there are about ten families living on a place known as the Common, and the average acreage there would be one and a half acres. They have no milk except what they buy.  They have to buy the milk because they have no place to keep a cow.  These people are hard workers, and most of them have capital.  A mile and a half from that place you come across 25 holdings with an average of seven statute acres. That is the average.  Some of them go down as far as one acre; a number of them have four acres and many of them six acres.  On the other side of the road there, we have an estate with 760 acres and, alongside, another estate with 180 acres, with two herds getting 10/- a week.  Sometimes it is stocked, and sometimes it is not stocked.  That is the problem.  I do not see what difficulty we had in the last ten years that prevented us from changing these people across the road, and these people are compelled to take that in the grass way, and if they did not do so, no annuities could be paid.  That is the position.  I do not think that anybody in the House will deny that that ought to be solved, and that a solution of that problem would be for the benefit of the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing about it is this.  Who are those people on the one and a half acres and the two acres, and the four acres?  I know them all.  They are, perhaps, the grandchildren of men who held considerable quantities of land there and who, by one ruse or another &mdash;by putting more monkey-wrenches in the machine&mdash;were pitched out, and who, with permission or otherwise, <Col N="2462" /> erected little mud-wall cabins and are there ever since.  We propose to come to the rescue.  The 1923 Act could have rescued them only for the monkey-wrenches and the other impediments that were put in the machine.  That is the position and nobody can deny it. We have created innumerable ranches in Meath by this section of which so many people complain&mdash;the migratory section&mdash;ranches up against this very class of people.  Are they going to be left looking on, or is it not our bounden duty to make an attempt to preserve the peace?  Can they be kept indefinitely there under such circumstances, knowing that they have the physical strength and the capital to make use of land?  They know that there are opportunities for themselves and for their capital to come into action.  They know the opportunities are here now. Why should they not be allowed to avail of them?  Why should not the ratepayers of Meath be allowed to have the number of those who can pay rates increased?  I think that very few Deputies in the House would be inclined to go against that principle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan talked about the political aspect of this measure.  I take it that all measures promoted by any Party, no matter how pure they may be, are open to that accusation. It is an accusation that is very hard to refute.  During his speech the Deputy came on to the tenant right business and, after he had mentioned it, he got nervous and said: &ldquo;No, I will not go any further that way.&rdquo; He did not go any further because he killed tenant right.  He was the first man to interfere with it.  Deputy Dillon, of course, spoke about tenant right also, and naturally so.  Why should he not speak of it?  His late father had a great connection with it.  Everyone of us respects tenant right, but I do not see that tenant right is interfered with at all in this Bill.  I do not see that the Minister or any other body under him are out to interfere with the living that is got by people on the land or through the land.  As long as a farm of land can be worked by the owner economically and as long as he has the wherewithal to work it and to employ men on that land and give them a living, <Col N="2463" /> neither the Government, I am sure, nor the men employed would like to see that land interfered with.  I see no intention whatsoever to interfere with it.  I think it would be wise for some of the members on the opposite benches to drop their political bias and face the issue from the national point of view.  I think a little more nationality would improve the House and the country.</P>
    <P>We are faced now with doing what should have been done after 1923.  We are faced now with the problem of putting the people on the land.  That is the intention of this Bill&mdash;putting the people on the land in a just and righteous manner.  There is no question at all of doing what Deputy Rice stated we were going to do and what Deputy Hogan stated we were going to do, that we were going to take all the members of each branch and put them on in preference to anybody else. That kind of thing is easily suggested, but no such thing is going to happen. As a matter of fact, the Minister was quite jealous on that point and, perhaps, we were not quite pleased with the Minister because, over certain things that arose under the Act, he had not control; but now we notice that the Minister was quite wise in insisting that he would not have any say at all as to who is to get the land, what the price of it will be, and other such things.  It is quite easy to say that the Government or the Executive Council are going to select men for the land that are thoroughly seasoned lieutenants of Fianna Fáil. They are not going to do any such thing.  If they have to select men outside the Land Commission they are going to select capable men.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal of talk and I myself have made statements on many occasions against the officials of the Land Commission.  I admit now that I spoke in ignorance. These officials had to carry out the law under which they work and it was not their fault.  They worked under very considerable difficulties which were imposed by the members of the late Government.  I am now <Col N="2464" /> in a position to sympathise with these men.  They were strangled and fettered and they could not move. They were busy and overworked doing nothing.  That was how, as I say, the monkey-wrench was thrown into the machine which would otherwise have worked smoothly and which caused it to jerk up suddenly. Excursions to the country, telegrams, telephones, messages and letters flying in all directions, but no reply &mdash;it was only an excuse.  I asked questions five years ago in this House as to why certain lands supposed to be taken over by the Land Commissioner were not divided. The people sat in their miserable hovels watching that land and nothing happened.  It could not be done.  We were not told that.  Every one of the Ministers then knew why. Now, because we are removing the causes, there is a sort of outcry.  One man shouts &ldquo;politics.&rdquo;  Another man, who is not a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, says: &ldquo;You have destroyed the land tenure system of this country; you have destroyed tenant right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What was the tenant right under the Act of 1923?  How far did that tenant right hold good beyond this, that the moment the tenant failed to pay his annuity there was no tenant right?  The Executive Council at that time took every possible step to secure that he would not have any tenant right.  They passed the most harsh laws that could possibly be passed.  If a man owed half a year's annuity there was no mercy shown to him.  If by sickness, misfortune, or otherwise, he was not able to meet his annuity, an auctioneer could not even set the land for him, or give him any chance of meeting his arrears.  Why was all that done?  I know that that did not come from Deputies now sitting on the opposite benches.  These men were all good nationalists.  They did not do it of themselves.  They got into an unhappy situation in which they had to do those things.  I believe that it is good for every Deputy to face up to the position and to recognise once and for all that what we are doing <Col N="2465" /> is what they would have done only for some circumstances which prevented them.  They are glad that it is being done; it is a great relief to them.  They, just as much as we do, want to see their kith and kin in possession of this country.</P>
    <P>The fundamental thing in this country is the land.  It was not ours up to this.  As soon as this Bill is passed, the people of the country will own the land.  That is the real tenant right to my mind.  I hope the day is not far distant when economically we can be in such a position that we may remove all this artificial system of land division and leave it in the ordinary course of events to be bought and sold amongst the people.  This is all artificial&mdash;every bit of it.  It is our past that has forced us into this position. The rotten gamble in land that went on, the confiscations, etc., forced us into it.  Some people may say that we should not speak about that, but if we want to understand what is happening we must speak about it and understand what happened.  Why are there all these numerous little islands of people all through Meath and all those good, rich lands now derelict? Even men with capital were afraid to touch them for years past.  Is there some spell about them, some curse on them, that they could not be worked? Why should they be without people on them when the bogs and the hill-sides of Meath are full of people?  Why should that be the case?  We are satisfied that it ought not to be the case, and we are determined that it will not be the case.  I am not satisfied that the Bill is extreme enough. I will admit candidly that if I had my way I would have more power.  There is no one listening to me but would do the same if he were honest enough to say it.</P>

      <P>You will get it in the Official Report.  I am not going to repeat it again.  That is the problem that we have to face up to.  We want to see that these 25 families I mentioned not far from the town of Navan will be put on that wilderness that exists there.  Nobody knows to whom it belongs.  We heard Deputy Rice refer to the section in the Bill which deals with the recovery of arrears.  I believe that that section is perfectly right on that business.  I remember a time not very long ago when there were 2,600 of these decrees issued in Meath. I was anxious to know what these things cost and I was only told that the average was two guineas each.  I do not know who got it, but I know who would have paid if we did not intervene.  The farmers would have bills against them.  There is nothing unreasonable in doing this in a much simpler way.  As to court proceedings, <Col N="2467" /> all I ever heard about them was that the District Justice just heard the case and signed the decree and it was all over.  The tenant did not appear, but he knew it meant a couple of extra pounds on his arrears.  I think that was a hardship and that the solution for that difficulty is what we have proposed. I do not see why anybody should object.  There is nothing political in this Bill.  This Bill is a national Bill.  It is built up to a large extent on the structure of the 1923 Act. The weaknesses of the 1923 Act are eliminated, and stronger measures are put in.  It has been said here that the result of this will be to whittle farms of land down to 50 acres, and when they have been whittled down to 50 acres that next year or the year after we will take the 50 acres, and that we will repeat what is repeated by the foreign body in those maps you saw to-day.  There is not the slightest danger of that happening.  Except the country fails completely that will not happen.  I do not believe for a moment that that sort of thing is going to be repeated.  We have taken this step now, and having taken this step I believe we have ensured to the people of this country that elementary principle which, when boiled down and reduced into ordinary language, means the right of living here in their own country.  That is all that is claimed. Those people did not have the right of a living.  They depended on something else that might happen.  It was mentioned here about a foreign market&mdash; about the market that we deliberately took away.  Was there ever any dispute with that market before?</P>

      <P>I am not going to pursue that, but it had been mentioned here by many speakers and that is the reason that I refuted it.  It would not be easy to justify this Bill except some form of economics were introduced. I am permitted to say this much, that the other view of why this Bill is necessary is that, as every Deputy knows, the economic conditions of land and its products in this country have completely changed. You have here now a full, complete and efficient protection for commodities produced on land, and the £25,000,000 or £30,000,000 worth of foreign stuff that was bought hitherto and that could be produced here is now no longer purchased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers in this country in the future will have an opportunity of making full and complete use of their land.  Hitherto, they were restricted to two or three months of cattle production.  They were not even able to stall feed the cattle, as it was uneconomic.  We were reduced gradually to the point when for the months of June, July, August and September the people could sell grass beef, and were compelled to live on whatever profits they could make on that for the rest of the <Col N="2469" /> year.  Now we have a much wider field in front of us.  That is one of the principal reasons why more people should be allowed to make use of the land in this country.  In the near future, a great deal of physical capital will have to be used on the land.  I admit that up to ten years ago the production of beef was an economic proposition in this country.  I admit that it paid.  I admit that quite candidly, but conditions were rapidly changing.  Investments made by England in the Argentine and other big cattle producing countries compelled them to give free entrance to the products of those countries, to our detriment.  No matter what happened, whether you had an economic war or whether you had not, I believe that the farmers of this country would be, even at this stage, compelled to change their system and to change their outlook.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down, Deputy O'Reilly, seems to be a bit obsessed with imaginary monkey wrenches. He dealt with them in practically every sentence for the first ten minutes of his speech.  I am afraid he became a little bit incoherent, but if one gathered anything of what he is driving at, one of his grievances was that apparently the imaginary monkey wrench and the existing land machinery had created around him ranches to which persons were brought in from other areas to the exclusion of certain landless men in his own constituency. I think I heard Deputy O'Reilly on that before, and of course it is hard to blame him.  It is hard to blame Deputy O'Reilly for being against the system that has prevailed in this country and which apparently now is, to some extent at any rate, being departed from, that is the system by which there would be migration of big holders in the congested areas for the purpose of giving their land to the economic holders in the congested areas, and the bringing of those big men up into Meath, Kildare and so on, and giving them alternative holdings there.  That apparently is Deputy O'Reilly's main grievance.  He is naturally against the bringing in of <Col N="2470" /> those foreigners from Connemara, Mayo or Kerry.  In other respects, Deputy O'Reilly is very satisfied with the Bill. He says that tenant right is not being interfered with, and indeed he is only following the lead of the Minister for Justice, who came out very strongly on that point.  The Minister for Justice was stressing the speeches made on this side, and he referred to the bogey of fixity of tenure.  Anybody reading the Bill&mdash;and I suggest to Deputy O'Reilly that he should read the Bill very carefully&mdash;will see that there is very definite interference with fixity of tenure.  I suggest to Deputy O'Reilly that he should make a close study of Section 28, which gives absolute power to the Minister to take over any land, whether land that has already been purchased under the Land Purchase Acts or not, land bought by the tenant under the 1923, 1909, 1903 or any of the other Acts.  Assuming that his land problem was settled for all time, he comes within the provisions of this Bill, if his opinion of farming does not coincide with the Minister's opinion of what good farming should be.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Reilly says that this is a Bill to give the right of living to those persons who have been deprived of it in the past.  I suggest to him that it is taking away the right to make a living of many persons who, under the former Land Acts, have acquired their land for the purpose of making a living for themselves and for their families.  I, unfortunately, was not here for the opening statement of the Minister, but I think he gave some explanation to the House to the effect that there will be a corollary Bill to this&mdash;a Land Bond Bill.  I was wondering why there was no provision in this Bill for the creation of land bonds, because in all the Acts that have been passed by the Oireachtas so far there has been such a provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the first section of the three principal Acts, that is the 1923, the 1927 and the 1931 Land Acts, and it was provided for also in the 1929 Act.  It is all the more strange that there is no such provision in this Bill.  In fact, there should be a Land Bond Bill introduced into the House long ago.  It is well known that there has been a <Col N="2471" /> hold up in dealing with certain cases because of the expiry of the British Guarantee last December.  In reply to a question of mine on 22nd March last I was told: &ldquo;It is intended to introduce at an early date the necessary legislative proposals to enable the creation of a new series of land bonds requisite for the completion of land purchase proceedings.&rdquo;  One would have imagined that since that Bill was necessary even before this Bill was on the stocks at all or introduced that advantage would have been taken of the introduction of this Bill now to insert a clause dealing with the creation of land bonds.</P>

      <P>The two amendments are very closely connected. The reduction of the capital to £2,000,000 would naturally follow if not more than £100,000 was to be invested in any one concern.  I happen to have seen since last night something which goes far to confirm the point of view which I was endeavouring to put forward with regard to this Bill and with regard, particularly, to the arrangement that no less than two-fifths of the capital of the company was to be employed very promptly in erecting, as I understand, three sugar beet factories.  There appears to be a conflict of opinion as to how many. I understood the number was three.  It so happens that there has just taken place a discussion in the British Parliament on agricultural questions, and in the course of that discussion this subject of sugar beet came up.  The British Minister for Agriculture, who was most anxious to continue the sugar beet industry if possible, pointed out the various advantages which flow from it, but mentioned that nevertheless the cost was so great that it had been decided that a very close actuarial investigation was necessary in order to decide whether or not the Government was justified in continuing with the industry at all.  I wonder very much if any such close actuarial investigation has been undertaken here, or whether it is going to be undertaken here, and if not, whether it would not be worth while at any rate to await the result of the British actuarial investigation which might throw a great deal of light upon our similar problem here.  I wish to stress the point once again that the starting here in Ireland for the first time, I believe, of a big investment company, a sort of investment trust under Government auspices, is something extremely important, something <Col N="2473" /> that one is very anxious to see turn out a success, and if it is to have a fair chance of turning out a success it should proceed upon business principles. Above all, it should take account of the cardinal feature of every well-run trust, and that is the diversification of risks, so as not to put too large a portion of the capital into any one undertaking.  The Bill as it at present stands runs absolutely counter to that principle.  Moreover, I put it to the House that it is a mistake to start an enterprise of this kind on such a vast scale as £5,000,000.  It would be much wiser to start more modestly and to limit ourselves to the not inconsiderable figure of £2,000,000 sterling.</P>

We have been told that another item that will entail a considerable amount of capital is the item for the manufacture of industrial alcohol.  I do not know whether the Government plans have matured sufficiently for them to say whether that is a £250,000 or a £1,000,000 scheme.  If the plans of the Government are sufficiently matured, I think that the Minister ought to give us some approximate figure.  There is another point about industrial alcohol, and I do not know whether the Government and the Minister have paid sufficient attention to it.  What are their plans for such a factory?  I do not suggest that they should have everything prepared.  They propose to substitute that for petrol and to drive motor cars and various other things by industrial alcohol.  If so, I think there is almost a bigger, a longer, and a wider field to be undertaken in the experimental stages alone on the lines of how far it is profitable to use industrial alcohol in industry.  The Minister ought to be aware, and I am sure he is aware, that when petrol is very cheap probably there is nothing in it.  When it is dear there is a considerable difference.  I understand that while you could, with a separate carburettor, drive a motor car on industrial alcohol alone, if you want to get really efficient results from it you <Col N="2474" /> would have to have an alcohol engine. It is not very different from the present petrol engine, but there is some difference.</P>
      <P>If the Government are considering running motor cars in this country on industrial alcohol it is high time they started to educate private and public users of motor cars and started some experiment, such as finding out what they thought the alcohol could be supplied at, and offering people figures as to the price at which alcohol engines could be purchased for motor cars.  I suggest the Government should not make the mistake of going ahead with their scheme of establishing a factory for producing industrial alcohol and then finding that it may take four or five years or a good deal longer to get any considerable consumption unless the ordinary users of motor cars are prepared to scrap their machines.  I merely make these few remarks, not in any sense to ask the Minister for a cut-and-dried plan, but only to reinforce what Deputy MacDermot has said with regard to sugar.  It is quite obvious, to my mind, that a considerable period must elapse before industrial alcohol could be used to any great extent in this country.  I do not wish to be taken as throwing cold water on the possible success of manufacturing industrial alcohol, but I suggest to the Minister that its success will largely depend on the care and forethought that is given to every aspect of the case.</P>

      <P>The remarkable thing about some of the Minister's statements on the type of industry that is likely to be developed through assistance on the part of this company is, in the first place, his very great uncertainty. Another remarkable thing is that all the principal industries that he mentions as likely to be established after getting considerable assistance from this company are industries that are only going to be kept in existence either by substantial sums being raised annually by way of subsidy from the taxpayers to keep them going, or substantially increased costs being placed on the consumers.  Generally it seems to me that the Minister is going to look for a loan of £5,000,000 for carrying on a business which is not so much feeding <Col N="2475" /> the dog with its own tail or developing and building up the dog by feeding it on a bit of its own tail, but by feeding the dog on its hind legs.  The Minister for Defence has been reminding us that agriculture is the important industry of the country.  The Minister for Agriculture was in Clonmel on Sunday last and he was telling agriculturists generally that they could never again get to the situation in this country when they could do without tariffs, bounties or subsidies; they may alter the existing ones, but they would always have to have some.  Our principal industry is to be bolstered up by tariffs, bounties or subsidies.</P>
      <P>The attempts that are being made to develop the manufacturing industry have been very critically discussed by the President.  He is not satisfied with how things are going.  The discussion we had on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce would make us all feel the President had very good reason for not being satisfied. This company is going to assist in the development of industry, and one industry that it is going to be called upon to assist by apparently very substantial sums is, the Minister mentioned, the sugar beet industry.  Deputy Dillon was quite right on one occasion recently when he described that as a big relief scheme for farmers.  It gives a very limited amount of employment so far as the industry itself is concerned, through a very limited part of the year&mdash;three or four months.  It gives employment on tillage over a very limited area, too, particularly when you consider the amount of money being put into this business and the amount of money that is going to be drawn from the consumer or taxpayer annually to support the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cement industry is going to be established and we have been warned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that that is going to call for substantial payments in the way of assistance from the users of cement.  He indicated that the cement industry, if established here, will raise the price of cement.  We have not been told anything about industrial alcohol <Col N="2476" /> or about paper-making except that long ago it was suggested that the paper-making industry, if established here, would increase the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing that arises when we do mention mining, industrial alcohol and paper-making is, will a Bill be introduced to deal with these matters in the same way as a Cement Bill has been introduced, and in the same way as the Sugar Beet Bill, which we have not yet seen, is to be?  Must the House review, by way of legislation, each of these major industries before they are embarked on?  Otherwise we will get no information about them.  I suggest if industrial alcohol is not in the same class as beet and if the development of mineral resources is not in the same class as beet&mdash;that is, if these are not going to be big industrial enterprises throwing an annual burden on the taxpayer&mdash;the Minister might tell us something about them.  With our agricultural industry in the position which the Minister for Agriculture stated and with our general industrial position just as the President mentioned&mdash;it is in that position as affecting our general credit that the Minister proposes to raise a loan of £5,000,000. While demanding of this House power to raise that £5,000,000 he is, nevertheless, in the position that he does not know what he is going to do.</P>
      <P>Early in his reply on the Industrial Credit Bill he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is the new sugar beet undertaking; possibly, though not probably, a new cement undertaking; possibly, also, but not probably, proposals for the re-establishment of the paper-making industry; possibly and probably, the establishment of an undertaking to manufacture industrial alcohol.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that there were to be three sugar beet industries likely to be established, maybe four.  The probability in the earlier part of his speech seemed to disappear in the latter part, I admit, when the Minister went on <Col N="2477" /> to say that he would want £750,000 for cement, £500,000 for the paper-making industry, and would be wanting up to £400,000 for the four big factories.  If the Minister is in that state of mental indecision with regard to these matters why does he demand in this measure the whole £5,000,000?  I submit that if he is proposing to borrow this year and is likely to be in the position to do so, he is unnecessarily putting a very big burden of debt upon this country and more than he at all requires.  He is perhaps doing what is worse.  He is telling those people interested in the management of sugar beet factories, interested in the management of cement factories, and interested in the management of those other things, that if they are able to monopolise the technical side and the technical equipment for the running of these industries, then they need not risk their capital in them at all, and that the Minister will provide through this company any amount of money.  There will be an inducement to those people, as I take it there are classes of people interested in the management, collecting the technical staff and assuming the technical management, to come along and almost prevent private capital from coming into these undertakings when they can so easily and with such magnificent and splendid ease secure the amount of capital provided by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister is, I think, acquiring too easy a way of dealing with millions. It must come very easy to members of the Government who promised to economise to the extent of £2,000,000, to find when they came into office that they could increase expenditure by putting an additional £6,000,000 of taxation upon the people.  It must come very easy to the Minister who has that experience and the nerve to indulge in Governmental operations like this to say to himself, &ldquo;After all, what difference does it make between £2,000,000 and £5,000,000.  We may as well have the £5,000,000.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister that this is an injustice to the whole of our financial position and an injustice to his own wish to get private capital, or any other kind of capital, invested in Irish industry here <Col N="2478" /> rather than that it should be all State capital, for the whole of the industrial development here.  Therefore I submit that both the amendments moved by Deputy MacDermot are perfectly reasonable and if accepted would in no way stand in the way of carrying on the business of this company on, at any rate, sensible lines.  This is not the last day, and £2,000,000 is certainly enough for the Minister to go ahead with.  He can quite readily come back to the House later and give a statement of the position he finds himself up against and ask for whatever more money is necessary if he needs it.</P>

      <P>The sum of £700,000 would probably be required for the manufacture of cement.  I presume that that enterprise here in the Free State would be operated by a group of experts.  The Minister takes up the unsubscribed capital which the public do not take up.  Will the group, or the business firm, which operates in this country under licence from the Minister of Industry and Commerce, be limited to subscribe only 50 per cent. of the capital according to a previous Act that passed this House?</P>

      <P>I support these two amendments of Deputy MacDermot and I do so for the reasons already mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy.  The Minister seems to be in the most uncertain state as to how this £5,000,000 is to be disposed of.  I am perfectly satisfied that if any son were to approach his father and ask for £500 for a scheme of such uncertainty as that put forward by the Minister he would not succeed in getting a single pound.  I support the amendment not because I approve of the Minister getting £2,000,000 or getting anything, but simply because I think it is better he should get only £2,000,000 and not £5,000,000.</P>

      <P>I also desire to support the amendments.  I do say that the Minister has not given any sufficient or definite information to the House as to what the scope of the expenditure is likely to be which is to be incurred in connection with this £5,000,000 of money.  £5,000,000 of money is an extraordinarily large amount of finance in <Col N="2479" /> this poor country.  It is being juggled around here as if it was a matter of no consequence.  What I am afraid is that the Minister has not offered a proper explanation as to the foundation of this company and has left the whole matter too indefinite to be regarded as a serious proposition.  Looking at his opening speech last week we find in every second sentence the words &ldquo;possibly&rdquo; and &ldquo;probably.&rdquo;  First of all there was to be a new sugar beet undertaking possibly, though not probably. Possibly there was to be a cement undertaking.  Possibly, not probably, there would be a paper-making industry, and probably an industrial alcohol undertaking.  Probably also there would be development of the mineral resources of the country.  Probably or possibly we would have to provide for the financing of all or any of these projects and other contingencies for which we must make provision.  I am afraid of all the possibilities in this Bill.  It is all too indefinite.  Some of the Minister's ideas as regards flourishing industries, as revealed last week, would call for very serious examination. Take the question of paper-making.  It is easy to proceed from paper-making to newspaper-making, the establishment of which might run into something like £100,000.  We might find that possibly or probably some of this money would be diverted into a newspaper scheme which might cost the citizens thousands per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinary idea.  Possibly and very probably this whole scheme is not going to have the result we would like to get from it.  I think if the conditions in the country were such, and that if the buoyancy that the Minister told us prevailed in financial circles did actually prevail, it would be better for the financial stability of the country if schemes mentioned here could be initiated and possibly financed before Government help was sought at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>According to Deputy MacDermot we should wait and hear <Col N="2480" /> what the British Government would have to say in regard to the sugar beet industry before we go any further. Now we have Deputy O'Neill wondering which particular form of industrial scheme would be best for the country &mdash;a scheme of devoting £500,000 or £1,000,000 each year to give temporary employment to a few starving men for a couple of months, or the settling of those men once and for all in permanent industries in this country.  What neither Deputy MacDermot nor Deputy O'Neill seems to realise is that all the Minister will have to put into shares in those companies is the balance that will not be subscribed by public subscription. In all probability, the full money will be found by public subscription, and I will guarantee that there will be no possibility of the whole of it going to the Belgians in the way it went in the case of the former sugar beet scheme.</P>
      <P>I say that we will, first, protect the farmers who are going to produce the beet and see that the foreigner will not get a guaranteed bonus, while, at the same time, our own people are left unprotected and at the mercy of the foreigner as to what price he will give for the beet.  That was where the last sugar beet industry in this country failed&mdash;that the foreigner got his bonus secured for a certain number of years, while the farmer who was producing the beet got no protection whatever. The farmer got a guaranteed price for two or three years, but the Belgian got a guarantee for a far longer period. The kernel of this whole matter is whether or not we are going to wipe out the sore of unemployment in this country.</P>

      <P>I propose to say only a few words on this matter.  It has been the Fianna Fáil policy, or at least their professed policy, to spread industries as far as possible all over the country, and the amendment put forward by Deputy MacDermot is aimed at putting that policy into operation. Twenty industries scattered all over the country would have the effect of putting the policy into operation and with that money scattered over a great number of small concerns there would be less risk of loss to the nation.  This scheme is something in the nature of an experiment and, as an experiment, I suggest that there should not be too much latitude at the very start. Experiments should be taken in a small way and then it would be an encouragement to future enterprises if this scheme should prove a success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proper subject for debate on this amendment might be, first of all, as to whether the amount of the nominal share capital of this company is excessive for the objects and purposes which it is designed to serve, and as to whether it is necessary that some restriction should be imposed upon the employment of such resources as it may <Col N="2483" /> be provided with from time to time by the public or by the State.  Possibly, the proper way to discuss it would be to take the second amendment first.  At least, the logical course of the discussion would be, I believe, to take the second amendment first, and then deal with the first amendment which appears in the name of Deputy MacDermot. However, I propose to deal with the first amendment for the reason that it seems to me that the adoption of this amendment would be to alter radically the character of the company.  It would be to convert it into that type of an organisation to which an amendment of this kind might be properly suited; that is to say, convert this company, which is originally an underwriting company prepared to take risks, into an investing company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole basis of that amendment, as Deputy MacDermot has said, is to ensure that in the investments which the company makes there will be that diversification of risks which is generally accepted as being essential to the proper organisation, management, and control of an investment trust.  But in regard to the major concerns in the flotation and the financing of which this company is going to be engaged, I think we have to consider, first of all, what is the amount of risk.  I have indicated that it is intended to take a large and essential part in the financing of the new sugar beet manufacturing undertaking.  I have indicated that it might possibly be called upon to take a substantial part in the financing of the cement-making industry.  What risk is there associated with one or other of these concerns?  They will be floated under conditions which will reduce that risk to a minimum and which, in the opinion of the Government, and of the Oireachtas, if it passes the Acts, will ensure their success.  The same can be said in regard to the other industries I have mentioned, the paper-making industry and the other projects which the Government have in mind, none of which will be launched until its ultimate success can be clearly foreseen. Therefore, at once, so far as this particular company is concerned, the <Col N="2484" /> necessity which, in the case of the ordinary investment trust, leads those who are responsible for it to seek a diversification of risks, vanishes here. There is no risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought you said beet.  I was wondering whether the Deputy was now preparing to throw over beet, in view of the fact that Deputy Hogan is sitting beside him, and say that a sum of almost £3,000,000 which has been spent in an experiment in that particular industry, has been wasted or lost.  Therefore, the whole investment was a foolish and misguided one for which, as Deputy Mulcahy said, this country has to pay in taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been wasted if the Minister has learned nothing from the experiment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He has learned a good deal from the experiment, as the sugar beet proposals when they come before the Dáil will indicate.  We do not propose to proceed in the manner our predecessors did.  I was dealing <Col N="2486" /> with the fact that in this case there is no necessity to seek that diversification of risk.  Even if there was some urgent drive, where are we going to find in this country this diversificativeness? An investment company operating in a highly industrialised community, where there are a considerable number of projects to pick and choose from, might accept, without being unduly hampered by it, an amendment such as Deputy MacDermot proposes, because they would have no difficulty in getting 200 or 300 concerns in which to invest the units of £100,000 to which Deputy MacDermot would limit it.  Here you could not get that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the 300 factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>At this moment none of them requires £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not be too sure about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As they expand and grow, I have no doubt that they will require additional financial resources, and, if they do, they can either get the money from the public or from this company.  That brings me back to a point made by Deputy MacDermot. While I have indicated that the major purpose of this company is to provide the capital required for the larger undertakings which the Government has in mind in order to give effect to its industrial policy, there is nothing which will prevent this company from investing in existing industrial undertakings, if such undertakings desire to come to the company, and in coming to the company accept the disadvantage to which I referred last night, that at any moment the Minister might, by pressure in the Dáil, be compelled to state that so much public money is invested in that concern and that the position of that particular concern is such-and-such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I was saying that even if it were necessary to give that diversification of risk which Deputy MacDermot has referred to and which he has informed the House is his policy in putting down this amendment, nevertheless it would be in the present circumstances of this State impossible to <Col N="2487" /> give practical effect to that principle, because there are not a sufficient number of risks sufficiently diversified to enable us to make the considerable number of investments that Deputy MacDermot has in mind, if his mind is expressed by his second amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Then what was the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Bill for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying, when the Deputy interrupted me, that there was no possibility of doing this, and I was going to say further that there was no necessity.  The purpose of this company is to finance undertakings which we believe will be a success, and which the Government will do everything to make a success until such time as the public are convinced that they are successful, and will be prepared to relieve the Government of the burden of financing them.  Apart altogether from those considerations we have to consider the practical utility of this amendment.  We must not, according to Deputy MacDermot, make any greater investment than £100,000 in any one concern, whether it is sound or whether it is unsound.  Whether it is a good risk or a bad risk it is to be subject to the same restriction.  Cannot the Deputy see that an investment of £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 in a concern like the new sugar beet undertaking would be, in all the circumstances, a safe and sound investment, and that the investment of even 100,000 pence in another concern, not of that kind and not of that nature, not supported and sustained in the same way by the Government, would be a risky and foolish and misguided investment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I understand the purpose of Deputy MacDermot's amendment is to prevent the company from making an unwise or a foolish investment, but the means which he chooses would equally prevent the company from making a wise or from making a foolish investment.  If the concern is, in the minds of all reasonable men, a concern that is going to be a success, surely if this company <Col N="2488" /> were going out as an ordinary profit-making concern it would be the duty of the directors to place all the free resources of the Industrial Credit Corporation in an undertaking of that sort&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which was an assured success; which would be backed with the Government guarantee; for which the Government would ensure such market conditions that it could not possibly fail unless it were grossly mismanaged?  Deputy MacDermot's amendment would prevent the Industrial Credit Corporation from making an investment in a concern of that sort, and would not at the same time prevent the Corporation from investing £100,000 in an absolutely wildcat scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister allow me to intervene?  No amendment such as this could protect any company against bad judgment on the part of its directors.  If the directors are foolish enough to invest in an unsound scheme, all this amendment would achieve would be that at any rate they could not invest more than £100,000 in it. The princple of not putting too many eggs in one basket holds good for every investment trust and every individual. It is nonsense talking about assured successes, because that is a matter of human judgment too, and human judgment is fallible as to what is an assured success.  It is for that reason that investment trusts have hard and fast rules which they stick to.  In spite of the glowing prospects that may attend a particular enterprise they refuse to put more than a certain proportion of their resources into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot has made the point which I was making, that is, that this amendment will not protect the company against the consequences of bad judgment, but it would hamper the better judgment of the directors of the company in relation to perfectly sound concerns. While I quite admit that the principle which Deputy MacDermot is asking the Dáil to accept in this matter is a sound <Col N="2489" /> one, normally applied to normal undertakings, it is not a principle that we should attempt to enforce in regard to this company, because this company is primarily not an investment trust, and not an undertaking in which people place their money because they feel it is certain, because they feel it is good, or because they know they are going to get a sure and certain and large return&mdash;a comparatively large return, taking all the factors into consideration. This is essentially a company that is going to take risks.  That is why we are establishing it, and not to avoid risks.  It is established to accept those risks which ordinary commercial investors in this country at the present moment and in the state of industrial development of this country are not prepared to accept.</P>

There has been.  There has been full advertence to this fact, that we have the most &ldquo;lop-sided&rdquo; economy, not merely in Europe, but, I should say, in any civilised part of the globe.  We are in this unique position, that 67 per cent. of our people are compelled to scratch a living out of the soil, and they are not able, according to what has been said by Deputy Mulcahy and other members of the Opposition Party, to make a living out of the soil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In the year 1926 a competent investigator estimated that the total income of the agricultural community in this country was <Col N="2490" /> £46,000,000.  In 1929, that income had declined by 45 per cent. to £25,000,000, and in the two following years, it only declined by a further £7,000,000 so that the greater part of the flopping, if there was flopping, took place during the period when the Deputy opposite was a member of the Executive Council, and was largely responsible therefore for the flopping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will agree with the Deputy in part.  He is only feeling it now, but those who were in Opposition, and those who were moving through the country, as the Deputy is beginning to move through the country since he went into Opposition, were feeling it, and the country was feeling it from 1926 to 1929 and 1930.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the income from agricultural sources was declining, that the beginning of the decline was in 1922, and it has continued to decline ever since, and that something must be done to provide alternative means of livelihood for those people; that the Government has adverted to the fact that we have a lop-sided economy, and is prepared to ask the House to put £5,000,000, at any rate, as a first instalment at its disposal, to redress the balance, to give us a symmetrical economy, and to enable us to build up here some sort of industrial activity that will provide a livelihood for people who, inevitably, if these conditions were to continue, would be driven off the land, and driven out of the country, as happened in 1846 and 1847.  It is with a full advertence to our lop-sided economy that this Bill has been introduced.  I am sorry I have not been able to deal with the other points that were raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to go into any details regarding the beet sugar and other products, the financing of which is contemplated under the Bill.  The beet sugar proposals will be before the House next week, when it will have <Col N="2491" /> an opportunity of examining and discussing them in every detail.  The same will be true of all the other measures and proposals in which the Government is interested directly.  As the House will have a full opportunity of considering them, I do not think, at this stage, there is anything to be gained by taking up time and going any further into them.  With reference to the beet sugar industry, as established in Great Britain, it should be stated that the beet sugar factories in Great Britain were amongst the least efficient in the world.  There has been a huge conflict of interest between the various sections in Great Britain on the sugar question.  On the one hand, the Bristol refineries, drawing raw materials from the British West Indies, are anxious that Government assistance and Government countenance of the sugar beet manufacturing industry should be withdrawn.  On the other hand, are beet sugar factories of an obsolete pattern, established at a time when capital costs were high and, not too efficiently managed.  It was under these circumstances that the British Minister for Agriculture, while admitting&mdash;and this is the significant point for us&mdash;that, <Col N="2492" /> from the point of view of agriculture, and from the point of view of the general economy of the people, the sugar beet industry had a great deal to recommend it, nevertheless, in view of other circumambient factors, a searching investigation would have to be made before it could be established in the particular circumstances of Great Britain&mdash;with a huge trade built up between Bristol and the West Indies dependant for supplies of raw cane sugar from that British Posession&mdash;that it would be, on the whole, economically wise to continue to finance on the same lavish scale as heretofore the beet sugar industry.  That does not apply to this country.  If we went into the sugar beet industry we would be growing the raw material, every process in the manufacture of sugar would be carried out, every penny piece we send abroad for the purchase of sugar would be kept here, and spent amongst our own people, providing employment for industrial workers and for farmers and their sons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Galway): Would you allow me, sir, to make a personal explanation.  I understand from the Official Report that Deputy Cleary made the following statement earlier this evening:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the 1923 Land Act, the Mount Talbot House, Roscommon, was purchased by the Land Commission. The Mount Talbot House and 158 acres of land surrounding it, including gardens and some timber, were let by the Land Commission as one holding.  One of the local congests&mdash;one of the hardworking <Col N="2497" /> farmers whom Deputy Hogan boosted to-day, working a very small holding, saving money and looking around for a patch of land he could buy&mdash;offered £300 and the appropriate rent to cover the cost as valued by the Land Commission for 50 acres of that land.  Of course he was refused and sneered at although he was recommended by the Land Commission inspector.  Who got the land?  The 150 acres with the house were given to Deputy Hogan's best friend and local henchman for £1,300, £300 down and £1,000 to be paid at the rate of £47 10s. per annum .... Deputy Hogan's talk to-day about the hardworking farmer who would save money on the small holding and buy a small patch outside it, if he could get it, was not much thought of by Deputy Hogan when a similar farmer to the one he boosted to-day offered to buy 50 acres of land and was refused by Deputy Hogan. It is from those men whose hands are soiled that the accusations come about political tactics.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are two statements there.  One is to the effect that I personally or, as the head of the Land Commission, refused a congest 50 acres of land at £300 and an annuity.  There is no truth whatsoever in that statement. The other statement was that I got 158 acres for £300 and an annuity, for a friend and henchman of mine.  There is no truth whatsoever in that statement either.  There is a suggestion also that the Land Commission itself was a party to some sort of fraud in this matter.  That is the sort of suggestion we are used to hearing from the Deputy who is a self-confessed eavesdropper. As far as I know, I do not believe that the facts, so far as the Land Commission is concerned, are correctly stated by the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was referring to the fact that, in spite of the protestations or at least the scoffings of Deputy Cleary and the Minister for Justice at the statements made from this side of the House, fixity of tenure was being interfered with by the Bill.  I hold, and I am sure there is nobody better aware of it than the Minister for Justice, that this Bill reopens the whole question of land tenure in the Irish Free State. That is written across the whole face of the Bill.  Section 28 provides that even land purchased under the Land Purchase Acts can now be taken, hotch-potch, from men who felt that when they purchased their holdings under the former Acts there was a definite settlement for them.  These lands can now be taken if the Bill becomes law and can be given to allottees according as may be determined by the Minister.  The Bill gives the Minister, the political head of the Land Commission, absolute power except in four matters which are called excepted matters, these four being the determination of the actual persons from whom the land is to be taken, the price which is to be paid for the lands so taken, the individual allottees to whom the land is to be given and the price at which the land is to be sold to those individual allottees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may appear a safeguard and one would like to believe it is a safeguard, but then we read the speeches of Ministers, responsible and otherwise, through the country, stating as the Minister for Agriculture stated last Sunday, if he is reported correctly, that the Bill will give the Government power to take the land of any farmer who could not make it pay and pay him for it. In the same breath, in case there might be any doubt about it, he goes on to say: &ldquo;After the election the big farmers who voted Cumann na nGaedheal or Centre Party got so poor that they had to sack their men, while Fianna Fáil farmers were able to keep their men.&rdquo;  There <Col N="2499" /> is no doubt what was meant by that statement.  There could be only one inference from it and the inference I draw from it is this that the Minister was saying: &ldquo;Boys, we will take the land from our opponents; we will take the land from those who voted Cumann na nGaedheal or Centre Party and we shall give it to those who stood by us.&rdquo;  It is undoubted that that is what he meant to convey to his followers.  He meant that, in spite of the fact that there are excepted matters provided for in the Bill, the Minister and the Government would have the say as to who was to get land and from whom land would be taken.  Either he meant that or he was fooling those who were listening to him, fooling his own followers.  I should like to say to the Minister and to the Government, if they have any such intentions, that they had better get them out of their heads before the Bill is passed because the tenant farmers of the country had a sufficiently hard struggle to get to the position which they have now reached.  They endured sufficient hardships to make them feel that they are not going to sit quietly by in the year 1933 and see themselves deprived of rights which they won so hardly.  That is in no sense a threat.  It is a mere statement of fact.  The Minister can verify the position for himself.</P>
    <P>I have seen in the papers statements of persons who said, when this threat of the taking of their land was first mooted, that they were going to put up a physical fight before the land would be taken.  That would be a very regrettable state of affairs, but this Bill is giving the cue&mdash;if cue is necessary&mdash; to certain people.  There has always been land hunger in this country.  This Bill is an incentive to those who are possessed of that land hunger to denounce persons who hold land to the Government and to say: &ldquo;We want that land.&rdquo;  The Minister, by the very provisions of this Bill, is depriving himself of something by which he could meet <Col N="2500" /> those demands, by taking all these powers he has over the Land Commission instead of leaving it to the Land Commission to determine these matters. These people will be able to come along to him and say, if he makes the excuse that it is a matter for the Land Commission: &ldquo;That is all very fine.  The new Bill gives you every power over the Land Commission and you must provide us with that land.&rdquo;  Section 6 gives the Minister absolute power over the Land Commission and the lay commissioners. It says that they must act &ldquo;under and in accordance with the directions, whether general or particular, of the Minister and the Minister shall have and may exercise, if and so far as he shall think proper, full and unrestricted power,&rdquo; etc.  He goes on and he reserves to himself &ldquo;rights of approval and disapproval, or of reconsideration, revision and confirmation of every or any act of the Land Commission or the lay commissioners not relating to an excepted matter.&rdquo;  As I said, the excepted matters are there. He will say that this is a safeguard and that the Minister cannot interfere as to what individual will be selected for the purpose of taking his land or he will not interfere as between the individual allottees when the land is being distributed, but I am afraid that, at any rate, it will be said that these are only unreal safeguards and that, in fact, he has taken the power to exercise political influence with regard to the taking and distribution of land.</P>
    <P>In the next section we come to the appeal tribunal.  Deputy Cleary was very satisfied with the appeal tribunal. He was making a case when he was stopped by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because he was dealing with a decision of the Judicial Commissioner.  If he made any case at all it was this: that the Land Commission inspectors who go down the country are the best judges of what the real value of the land is.  Therefore, the case he made is that there should be no tribunal at all to revise the valuations of the Land Commission inspectors.  Nobody, I am sure, will agree with Deputy Cleary in that.  No matter how impersonal the Land Commission may be in making its valuations <Col N="2501" /> of land, it is certainly elementary justice that the person from whom the land is being taken should be allowed to appeal against the valuation if he thinks it too low, but this appeal tribunal which is here constituted is a new departure.  The Judicial Commissioner has to preside over the body of three but, in fact, he has no power to give a decision at all on any matter. He has no power to give any decision which is contrary to the wishes of the Minister.  I understand that the Minister, in his opening statement, said that this section with regard to the appeal tribunal is being changed so that instead of an officer of the Land Commission there will be two of the lay commissioners of the Land Commission, but sub-section (2) Section 6 sets out that these persons must act under and subject to the dictum of the Minister.  The Judicial Commissioner, therefore, can give no decision which is contrary to the wishes of the Minister unless his nominees turn tail on him.  He appoints these two removable nominees and they sit with the Judicial Commissioner.  They have to act on the instructions of the Minister and the matters that come before the appeal tribunal are not included in the excepted matters, so that, in fact, unless there is a change made in the Bill, the persons who sit on the appeal tribunal will be dealing with matters on the appeal tribunal which are not excepted matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy read sub-section (4) of Section 6?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read the whole section for the Minister.  Section 6, sub-section (1) says:</P>
      <P>The following matters shall be excepted matters for the purposes of this section ....</P>
      <P>The four exceptions to which I have already referred are then set out.  The second sub-section gives control to the Minister, the third refers to the Land Commission and the fourth then states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall apply to the Judicial Commissioner or to the appeal tribunal or <Col N="2502" /> operate to give the Minister any power or control of any kind over or in relation to the exercise of his functions by the Judicial Commissioner or their functions by the appeal tribunal.</P>
    <P>That is very fine but his nominees will have certain instructions from him on matters which may come before the appeal tribunal and which are not excepted matters.  I do not say that the Minister, under the Bill, can for one moment issue a dictum to the appeal tribunal, as it is going to sit on a particular matter.  That would be a little bit too bald.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not know that it is indicated that the lay commissioners are to be appointed by the Executive Council and not by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Or by the Executive Council.  So far as that is concerned, the one thing is the same as the other. The position of affairs, therefore, is this, that unless the Judicial Commissioner's views happen to coincide on a particular matter with those of the Minister, we would never hear a judgment from him and that is the position, even with regard to a matter of law, as has been pointed out.  On matters of law, it is set out that the Judicial Commissioner's opinion shall prevail but he cannot determine that it is a matter of law, unless, again, one of the two nominees deserts the Minister and agrees with the Judicial Commissioner that it is a matter of law.  Then the Judicial Commissioner is wiped out even in regard to a matter of law.</P>
      <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the arrears and the revision of the purchase annuities and, again, I will refer to some of Deputy Cleary's statements. If I understood Deputy Cleary rightly, he said that if an amendment were put down refusing to wipe out the arrears in the good years, which I take to be the moderately good years&mdash;any years prior to the economic war&mdash;he would support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy does not understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy did not understand what he was saying <Col N="2503" /> himself.  I listened very carefully to what he said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Deputy who is speaking understands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he said that if an amendment were put down refusing to wipe out the arrears of persons who got into arrears in the good years and funding these instead, he would support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that I would seriously consider supporting it and I possibly would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to give the Deputy that opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to see it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that, as a result of the economic war, the farmers cannot pay their way, as Deputy Hogan and others have pointed out.  They cannot pay their annuities now.  They have not been able to pay their annuities out of their farms, anyhow, for the last 12 months, and if there is a case for wiping out any arrears, they are the arrears that have accrued in the last 18 months.  I intended to give the Deputy an opportunity of supporting an amendment somewhat on these lines, that, since the Government feels that they must collect these three years' arrears, they should be the three years' arrears prior to the economic war.  I will take the last three years before the present Government came into office, 1929, 1930 and 1931.  Have those three years funded and wipe out all the arrears prior to those years and all the arrears since the economic war started.  There is not any real excuse or, at least, it is not fair to the man who paid his way during the moderately good years when farming was paying that now the person beside him who did not meet his liabilities during that period should get off scot free while he is mulcted for the current bad years when through no fault of his own he is not able to pay.  These are his only debts.  These are the only liabilities he has contracted and they are not being wiped out, while the arrears contracted <Col N="2504" /> by others in former years are.  The Minister for Justice tried to make a point against Deputy Costello when he referred to Section 27, that is the section which enables the Land Commission without judicial proceedings to send out a warrant to the county registrar of any county or, in cases where such officials exist, to the under-sheriffs in those counties.  The Minister tried to make a point out of the fact that the Revenue authorities have such power already and that the rate collectors all over the country have that power.  I would like to ask the Minister for Justice does he know of any case where rate collectors in fact exercised that power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Who gave it to the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It was inherited by us from the British Authorities as portion of the existing legislation and we modified it to such an extent that they go into the district courts normally. That is how the Revenue authorities use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>You gave it to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We have inherited the law.  The late Government inherited the law in the same way as the present Government inherited it.  They have not changed it though they did denounce these laws in all the moods and tenses before they came into office. But I say that there is no case for the levying of the warrants departmentally. <Col N="2505" /> No matter how well run a Department is, it is not right it should have power to levy warrants and make seizures. As Deputy Rice pointed out, mistakes had been made in the past.  Mistakes are inevitable.  In a Department dealing with numbers of cases it is inevitable that cases have occurred and will occur again.  And where legal proceedings were taken against annuitants for the non-payment of annuities and where the annuitants were able to produce their receipts to the judge no warrant would issue against them. They were safeguarded then but they will not have that safeguard now.  The warrant will go down to the sheriff who will probably seize their stock and furniture. Very likely it will be the furniture instead of the stock on the lands which are practically of no value now.  I think that is a bad principle and I think that if it does exist already in other Departments it certainly should not be extended to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPKeely" hpid="Mr. Keely Mr. Keely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keely</NameTxt>
      <P>There are so many points in this Land Bill that commend themselves to me that I cannot help speaking on them.  In the first place this Bill aims at remedying one of the greatest sores that we have in the West of Ireland.  It aims at remedying the condition of the distressed or uneconomic holders along the moors, bogs, and mountains of the Gaeltacht of Galway, Clare, Mayo and Kerry.  There are people many of whose parents or grandparents were evicted out of the lands in Meath, Westmeath, Longford and Tipperary and had to take refuge and shelter amongst the mountains of Connacht.  Our object is to do justice to those people and bring them back to the land from which their forefathers were driven. In doing that I believe the Government are doing a Christian work and a work which would commend itself to anybody who has at heart the interests of the people of this country.  In doing so we will not attempt and we shall not attempt to deprive any hardworking ordinary farmer of his land. Deputies on the opposite benches <Col N="2506" /> who have spoken have tried to confuse the issue here.  They have tried to drag in the ordinary hardworking farmer at every stage of this debate.  They never mentioned the rack renting landlord or the inheritors of the rack renters who held the land from which the people were evicted.  Our object is to take back these lands and plant the dispossessed in them.  The descendants of the people of Ireland will get back into their old heritage again. That is our object in bringing in this measure and the only fault I find with it is that it is not quite drastic enough to cope with the situation which exists in the impoverished western sea-boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal has been said on the funding of the arrears and on the striking off of the arrears down to three years.  The House will remember that the Fianna Fáil Government came into power about 15 months ago.  Therefore we are not striking off any of the arrears that were contracted under the Fianna Fáil Government.  We are striking off the arrears that were contracted when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were in power.  I hope the Minister, before he strikes off those arrears, will publish a list of the defaulters. When that list is published there will be found amongst them substantial farmers who are in a good way of life and a good way of living.  These men were allowed to escape payment because they were supporters and followers of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in power.  It is in respect of those people that Deputy Hogan says the Government is placing a premium on dishonesty.  There is the dishonesty of those who neglected through political patronage to pay their annuities during the time the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were in office, during the years that we were told were years of prosperity for everyone in town and country.  We have not attempted to strike off a penny of the money that accrued since our Party came into <Col N="2507" /> power.  We have not attempted to do it.</P>

      <P>I think it was a principle in all the Land Purchase Acts that at any time when sweeping changes took place in the land laws of this country there had always been a clause introduced into each Bill striking off arrears down to a certain date. In striking off these arrears we are only following the principle laid down in former Acts.  We are striking them off irrespective of whether the defaulters are supporters of Cumann na nGaedheal or Fianna Fáil.  We will do justice all round.  We will do that justice in the case of the annuities, in the case of the distribution of land and in choosing the people from whom the lands are to be taken.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by Deputy Hogan to a case in County Roscommon. I am not going to accuse Deputy Hogan of any of the dirty work that was done in that case.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPKeely" hpid="Mr. Keely Mr. Keely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keely</NameTxt>
      <P>All I have to say in passing from this case is that I hope and trust we will have no example of the sort under the administration of the 1933 Act.  We were told by Deputies on the Farmers' Benches that not a single problem has been faced by this Government since it came into power except from a political point of view.  They accused us of introducing this Land Bill in order to gain political kudos.  The object of the introduction of the Bill is far from that. The object is to try to solve for all time the land question in Ireland.  I am confident that under this measure the Minister for Lands and Fisheries and the Land Commission will have just ample power to solve that problem in the only feasible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point I would like to stress on the Minister.  When this measure is being put into operation the uneconomic holders of the West of Ireland, especially those on the mountain sides, should be taken <i>en masse</i> and migrated to counties where lands are available for the relief of congestion, and when they have been migrated the mountainy wastes should be handed over to the Forestry Department to be converted into what they were designed for by nature, forest lands.  If that is done, and I am hopeful it will be, the problem that has been a burning problem for many Governments will have been solved, at least so far as the West of Ireland is concerned.  We were told in 1923 by Deputy Hogan that he was going to solve that problem and on several occasions in Galway he mentioned the numbers of congested holders whom <Col N="2510" /> he intended to migrate under the 1923 Land Act from the barren slopes of Connacht in order to place them in other counties in holdings suitable for agricultural purposes.  Not one-tenth of 1 per cent. of the congests have been removed from the West of Ireland since 1923.</P>
    <P>If I speak now of migrating those people from the Deputy's constituency and my own constituency I probably will be told I am preaching politics and that I have not a national outlook.  I think it is the duty of the Government to provide for the people and the only way in which they can provide for the people in those times is to give them an opportunity of earning a living and rearing their families on suitable land. If we do that we will be laying the foundations here of a nation that will be strong and prosperous.  Every nation that has grown great or strong has derived its strength from the sons of the soil.  As the poet said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A bold peasantry, their country's pride.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We want to have in Ireland a bold peasantry who will be their country's pride, their country's mainstay and their country's defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>He must be a very green boy, because we got rid of the landlords, I suppose, long before he was born.  He must have been living up in the air for a very long time.  The Minister said the object of this Bill is to establish on the land as many families as it is possible to establish. As far as I could catch them these were his introductory remarks.  I wonder does the Minister know that we who are on the land, and working it, could produce a whole lot more than this country could consume and that his Party has deprived us of the market for our surplus produce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2511" /> The history of land tenure in this country is very interesting.  We can go back a number of years when our fathers fought for the three F's&mdash;fair rent, fixity of tenure and free sale. Our fathers would turn in their graves to-day if they knew that an Irish Government or an Irish Minister proclaiming himself a national patriot and Irish of the Irish was introducing a measure depriving us of some of those rights so hardly won.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenJordan" hpid="Mr. Jordan Mr. Jordan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jordan</NameTxt>
      <P>And that from two F's &mdash;Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and this measure is introduced by Fianna Fáil.  The three F's that our fathers fought for are being done away with by this Bill, introduced by Fianna Fáil.  There is no hope for any farmer, holding land and working it, under this Bill.  There is nothing whatever to prevent the Government or the Land Commission coming down the morning after it is passed and taking his land from him. Mention was made of a certain ex-member of this House buying land recently in his native county.  I believe his name was mentioned in the House, and that it was stated ex-Deputy Gorey paid £2,310 for a farm while there are landless men in Mayo, in Connemara and West Cork&mdash;and we have congests in West Cork.  I should like to know what the Fianna Fáil supporters in ex-Deputy Gorey's constituency would think if they had migrants from Mayo or Galway or West Cork brought up and this land distributed amongst them in Kilkenny.  Of course, I suppose migrants and landless men should have a better right to it than ex-Deputy Gorey with his six or seven sons at work on the land, knowing their jobs and having paid out of their honest toil for the land.  They did not pay for it with money robbed from banks or other institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill the Minister is going to acquire land for the relief of congestion for landless men who are workshies.  He is to get land for these people while we with our land fully stocked, fully equipped with farm implements, with generations of <Col N="2512" /> experience behind us cannot make the land pay at the present moment.  How does the Minister expect that handless men and congests and follows who never worked without capital or equipment are going to make the land pay. I hold this is a most inopportune time to introduce a measure of this kind. If the Government at the moment were going to give us back our markets and were going to open up the one market that absorbed our surplus produce I could go a long way with it in agreeing that it was right to introduce a measure of this sort.  Again, I could see reason for introducing a short Land Bill that would deal with matters that perhaps were not dealt with under previous Land Bills.  I know there are questions of fee farm grants and of tithe rent charges which are relics of the penal days.  They are mentioned in this Bill, I believe, but they are not dealt with fairly.  I think they should be wiped out altogether.  We have also the holders of potential building ground.  So far as I can read this Bill it means no advance whatever in Acts passed by this Dáil since it was established. So far as I can see, there has been no advance by any attempt to deal with these three cases I have mentioned. There should, of course, also be included a reduction of the annuities by half, but everybody knows that that is a humbug and a farce.  Everybody knows that by reducing them by half you are wiping them out because under existing conditions everybody knows it would be impossible to collect them.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that I would like to deal with.  Here in this country we are a sort of economic unit. In my constituency in West Cork we have a number of congests; we have no land for sub-division, but we are hard workers and good workers.  We find that under our system we have to sell our small cattle as yearlings because we could not hold them any longer as we have to depend on the sale of milk and butter in the summer and we could not have both young cattle and dairy produce.  We find that landholders&mdash;some people would call them ranchers&mdash;go around West <Col N="2513" /> Cork and Kerry and other congested areas and buy from the small farmers their yearling cattle at good prices. They take them away from these areas to their own lands and they fatten them in the cheapest way it is possible for any man to fatten cattle and that is by turning them out on the grass. They bought them from us and when they fattened them they used to sell them on the British market.  These people from these big ranch areas of Kildare, Westmeath, Meath and portion of Dublin probably, bought at least 70 per cent. of our young cattle. Is it the policy of the Government to get these congests and landless men, without money and means and without the wherewithal to work the land, into these areas and to distribute the ranches amongst these people who know nothing about farming or cattle and know absolutely nothing about anything at all connected with agriculture? You are going to divide these ranches amongst them.  You are going to get them to produce commodities; to get them to grow wheat, oats, potatoes and young cattle that we have been endeavouring to produce, and that we have produced well in the past&mdash;and we got our market for them, too.  They are going to produce in competition with us and the result will be that we will have a surplus of commodities and as somebody mentioned a few days ago, we will reach the stage where the bonhams were let go with the tide because they could not be fed or sold; or the stage, as in the County Louth, the Minister's own constituency, where they let hundreds of tons of potatoes rot in the field because they had no market for them.  That is the condition we will be left in if this Bill is carried through.  We will produce and continue to produce and we will have no market.</P>
    <P>As I said, this State is an economic unit and each area works into the other area.  Our people before us, who have been in agriculture for generations, who knew their job as well as we do, and perhaps better than we do, found that a system established in their area suited that particular area.  When <Col N="2514" /> you change from that system, as we had to change during the big War, down in places like Limerick and portions of Tipperary&mdash;the Golden Vein&mdash;where they were obliged to till a portion of their land, the wheat rotted because the land was not suited for it.  That was 15 or 16 years ago.  They tried to grow oats and it was never reaped because the land was not suited for it.  They had to give up the one industry that they knew and in which they were able to beat the world&mdash;the butter industry.  The land ploughed up at that time in an endeavour to grow wheat and oats will not be in the same position for the next 30 years to produce butter as land that had not been tilled for the last 50 or 60 years.  It is all very well to talk about the distribution of land and giving it to landless men and congests, but, first of all, you want years of training for the landless men and congests before you can put them on the land, because any man who knows anything about it knows that land and agriculture at the moment is most scientific and anybody who does not know his job has no business on the land.  He must know his job and he must know it well.  I have forgotten more about agriculture than all the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil put together ever knew. I say to them that it is impossible for any man to produce at the moment at a profit, or even to be able to keep going.</P>
    <P>The big point in this Bill is the loss of free sale and the insecurity that follows on it, and the fact that what our people fought and suffered for in the past is going to be filched from us now.  From the time of the passing of the Land Act, we saw and we remember the times when the farmsteads in our country were neglected; when there was no drainage of bogs; when the farmer had no security with the result that he would have no interest in it: and we saw, once he got fixity of tenure and security and once his land was purchased, the great change that took place on the face of the country-side <Col N="2515" />&mdash;nice houses, well-kept places and well-kept farms.  That was all over the State.  It was obvious to everybody.  That is going to disappear now.  We are going now, as a result of this insecurity, to go back to the position in which our grandfathers were, in which we will have no interest in the land.  Why should we?  We do not know but that &ldquo;Seán a Scuab&rdquo; is going to have the place for which we slaved and in which we spent all our lives.</P>
    <P>Another matter that is of great importance is the question of arrears that is being dealt with in this Bill. Again, we have the Fianna Fáil Government, I suppose, coming to the help of those&mdash;and there are a lot of them all over the country, and I know them&mdash;who are worthless and do not want to pay anything.  These are the supporters of Fianna Fáil.  These are the fellows who want to pay nothing; who do not want to pay the banks, or to pay their rates, or annuities, or anything.  Their hope that they need not pay anything is realised in this Bill.  These are the type of men with ten years of arrears of annuities and the arrears are now wiped out.  This is what we have now.  I said, and I repeat, that the people who are supporting the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash; the farmers who are supporting it&mdash; are the down-and-outs.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to attack this big job at this late hour.  I am afraid that if the Labour Party were attending to their duty they would question our right to dispense with the half-holiday by taking up a job at this hour. I listened with amusement to the second last Deputy in his picture of the promised land for the men of the west.  He almost promised them a single ticket from the bogs and rocks of the west to the rich lands of the Midlands and the east where land can be got for the taking.  I am a native of the Midlands and I am living in the east, and I never saw any place in the Midlands or in the east where land can be got for the asking or for the taking. A reference was made to ex-Deputy Gorey and his farm.  I wonder if there is a member of Fianna Fáil in the County Kilkenny who would advocate an excursion train with passengers or migrants from the west with single tickets coming up to be dumped down on the County Kilkenny on this ranch that former Deputy Gorey is supposed to have bought.  I think that if that Fianna Fáil Deputy from the County Kilkenny, or if the secretary of a Fianna Fáil Club in County Kilkenny, got up in the open and advocated a policy like that, it would be the last that would be heard of him in public life in County Kilkenny or in any other county.  This Bill is divided into four parts.  I oppose the Bill from beginning to end and I am going to explain my reason.

      <P>The Acting-Minister, in reading his statement introducing the Bill, referred to conditions in the country.  He said there were a large <Col N="2520" /> number of uneconomic holdings and that there were large ranches which gave little or no employment.  He also said that with the virtual stoppage of emigration there was a large increase in population in these latter years.  He said that all this constituted a problem, and was the <i>raison d'etre</i> for this Bill.  The Deputy-Minister did not elaborate or give the House a definition of what an economic holding is.  A holding of five acres in one place might be a good economic holding, and a holding of 100 acres in another part of the country might be an uneconomic. It all depends upon the proximity of markets.  The Deputy-Minister and his Government, when they destroyed the market of this country, rendered not only the small holding uneconomic, but they rendered the entire land of this country uneconomic.  This Land Bill will, I feel sure, give rise not to a demand for the reinstatement of the three F's, but a demand for the reinstatement of the three F's plus another F, namely fair annuity, free sale, fixity of ownership, and free markets.  Also the Deputy-Minister stated that it was necessary to divide the land in order to increase tillage.  I wonder has he ever considered agriculture at all?  Has he exchanged views with the Minister for Agriculture?  Has he asked himself how this land policy of this Bill can be carried out successfully&mdash;by successfully I mean nationally successfully, and for the benefit of the country as a whole&mdash;side by side with the Minister's grain policy.  If the Minister knows anything about the history of agriculture, and the history of land administration in Europe since the Great War, he should know that large tracts of Europe were corn growing areas prior to the Great War, when they were in ranches, because it is only in large areas that corn can be grown economically at a world price; and that since the Great War large tracts of those old empires have become portion of smaller States, and the ranches have been divided up into small holdings. Those holdings have been used in the main for dairying purposes, and the products of those countries have become our chief competitors in the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2521" /> The Deputy-Minister made a statement which is an absolute fallacy, that by dividing this land tillage would be increased.  The tillage that is foreshadowed by the Minister for Agriculture is more corn growing.  Corn can only be successfully and economically grown in large areas where the best modern machinery for cultivation and reaping and threshing can be used, so that that little gesture that he has chucked in there as a reason why land should be taken off one Irishman and given to another does not hold water. If, as he suggests, there are large ranches giving little employment, what is the Government doing?  The Government of any country that has an economic policy carefully thought out is unfit to govern if it cannot induce the landowners of the country to carry out that policy, through the only means by which a policy will be successfully carried out in any country, namely by providing a market that will pay the farmers.  The idea of the Government Bench, composed of people who know nothing about agriculture, is to give an order that a certain field must be tilled and a certain crop put into it, regardless of whether it will pay or not.  The man is a rancher, he is an enemy, he is a West Briton, he is an imperialist, he is all that is odious, who does not do a thing that will not pay him.  The incompetence of the Government is shown by the fact that they are not able to evolve an economic policy that is sound and good nationally, that will give employment to the unemployed to-day and yet give a good return to the man who will employ them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevancy is the comment of the Deputy-Minister in introducing this measure that there were large ranches not giving employment, that it was necessary to break up those ranches into smaller holdings that would be tilled by those smaller holders, and that that would be a good national policy.  I am pointing out that the way to get them tilled, <Col N="2522" /> regardless of the size of the holding, is to induce the owners to till them by providing a market that will give the produce of tillage a good remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Also as regards the policy adopted by the Minister for Agriculture, namely, the grain policy, I have endeavoured to show by the example of certain European countries that the breaking up of big holdings into small holdings does not tend towards grain growing.  On the contrary it tends towards the production of dairy produce and bacon.  With this increased population, everybody who thinks at all about the country realises that it is a problem, and a national one.  The Deputy-Minister suggests that a way must be found for them on the land.  The Acting-Minister must know, if he has learned simple division, that, even in normal times, the land is not able, with a free market, to accommodate all the young people who are growing up.  Some other outlet must be found for them. It is up to the education authorities, and the Minister for Education, to see that youths leaving school between 14 and 18 years of age are put to some trade that will be useful to them, because, per head of the population, we have a larger number of unskilled people than any country in Europe. Certainly a livelihood cannot be found for them on the land.  The Minister should know that the first step to be taken in any land policy is to see if those who have land, which has cost the State nothing&mdash;men with economic holdings, and with family traditions for working land, who live according to a certain standard; who owe nothing, and who possess the necessary equipment&mdash;are making it pay at present?  The Minister might then consider going on with his policy.  If landholders and farmers are not making land, which cost the State nothing, pay at present, what is the use of setting up a ramp to take it in order to give it to others who have no farming tradition behind them?  Is not the first <Col N="2523" /> problem for the Government to tackle to make agriculture a paying proposition? If there was any intelligence in the Government brain boxes it would start there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan has revealed the truth, that this is a political measure. Some people do not realise that land is practically valueless now.  There is an idea that land is as valuable as it was six or seven years ago, or there is the hope that, at any rate, it will come back to its own some day. People will take land for nothing.  Of course, they will, because, even if they fail, they will lose nothing.  There is no provision in the Bill to see that people who get land will have some qualification to entitle them to it.  The Acting-Minister should know that agricultural classes are held by the county committees of agriculture, and that certificates are issued to successful students.  It is not even suggested in the Bill that potential allottees should possess certificates issued by the County Committees of Agriculture to show that they know something about land.  There is no clause in the Bill to the effect that men who get land must keep it for a certain time before selling it.  There is no protection of that kind.  The only idea appears to be to give the land, and if some fellow can be found to give a few pounds for it afterwards, it can be disposed of.  I could take the Minister to ranches that were broken up and given to allottees within the last 20 years which are now ranches, where the bullocks are going in or out of houses that were built by public money.  Is this the time to introduce a Bill like this, when we have no markets, thanks to the Ministers on the opposite benches, and thanks, perhaps, more than anybody else, to the Minister in charge of the Bill?  The Minister had the audacity to get up and say that we would now have cheap food.</P>

      <P>Farmers have been criticised because they do not till their land, and they have been dubbed ranchers.  How can they till land when they have no markets for their produce? Because they do not till, the land is now going to be taken from them compulsorily. I have not half as much land tilled this year as I had last year.  I will have none tilled next year, and neither will my neighbours, if the present situation continues.  We may thank the Government for the present position, and more particularly the Minister who introduced this Bill.  He stated that these were the minimum proposals.  When the Minister puts up a proposition like this Bill he should be asked to prove it.  If men who have land, which cost the State nothing, cannot make it pay, how can other people, on whom of necessity the land must be dearer, make it pay, in view of the conditions produced by the present administration?  These are some of the practical problems that the Minister should have explained. The Minister told us that it would take the Land Commission 30 years to transfer 1,000,000 acres, and he suggested as an alternative to the acquisition and distribution of land, to get people who own what he called ranches to cultivate them.  If the Minister has not studied the agricultural problem, before we adjourn, he should read T. W. Midleton's &ldquo;Agriculture in Germany,&rdquo; which can be had for 2/6 from the British Stationery Office.  In that book he will find that the best agricultural education in Germany is given on large farms. A big farm run on moderate lines was a better method of disseminating agricultural education, and giving a practical demonstration of agricultural work than any of the agricultural colleges. In the space of 20 years the productivity of the soil of Germany had been increased by 30 per cent.  The Acting-Minister wants to wipe out all the big farms, but the Government will not apply that principle to anything <Col N="2525" /> else.  They will not apply that principle by giving a junior lawyer a chance.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
