      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President if he will state the number of appointments made by the various local authorities in Saorstát Eireann from lists of qualified candidates submitted by the Local Appointments Commission since 1st January, 1932, and if he will give returns under separate headings showing the number of such persons appointed whose names were first on the lists of qualified candidates sent forward by the Local Appointments Commission, the number of such persons appointed whose names were second and the number of such persons appointed whose names were third.</P>

      <P>Since the 1st January, 1932, recommendations under the three names procedure have been made by the Local Appointments Commissioners in connection with 186 posts.  In 43 cases the number of persons recommended was only sufficient to fill the vacancies.  In 53, 46 and 17 cases the persons placed first, second and third, respectively, in order of merit were appointed by the local authorities.  In addition, there were nine advertisements covering 27 posts, and as a result of these nine advertisements the candidate placed first in order of merit was successful except in one case.  It might be mentioned that in forwarding the names of persons recommended, the Local Appointments Commissioners set out the names in alphabetical order and not in order of merit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say <Col N="1846" /> how many of the persons who were placed first on the list by the Local Appointments Commissioners were subsequently appointed by the local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean how many were marked first on the lists sent down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>How many of those returned as first by the Local Appointments Commission were subsequently selected by the local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not give the names in the order of merit.  As the reply states, there were 53 who secured first place, 46 who secured second place and 17 who secured third place.  That was the order of merit and they were all appointed by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that 116 persons who were selected by the Local Appointments Commission as the best qualified persons were accepted by the local authorities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In 17 cases persons who were placed third on the list in the order of merit were appointed. In 46 cases persons who obtained second place were appointed, and in 53 cases the persons who were first in order of merit were selected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there were only 53 out of 186 persons who were selected as first in order of merit and they were appointed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 53 out of 186.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the lists are sent down in alphabetical order.  Are the local authorities informed as to the order of preference in which the Local Appointments Commission would have placed them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the local authorities are not in a position to know which of the candidates is best qualified in the eyes of the Local Appointments Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody would be put on the list if he was not qualified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there no information given to the local body as to who is best qualified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority asks for three qualified persons and three names are sent down.  In a number of cases local authorities ask for one name only and they get that one name, generally of the person best qualified.  They are not given any other information and the names are sent down in alphabetical order.  When sending the names the full qualifications of each candidate are supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Minister's remarks that the position is that three names are sent to the local authorities and the local authorities are given no information as to which of the three persons named was considered best by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  They are given the names in alphabetical order and supplied with the qualifications, but they are not told the opinion of the Local Appointments Commission with regard to the order of merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any reason why that information is not given to the local authorities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume it is that they do not ask for it.  They merely ask for the names.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if it is a fact that he agreed to pay double duty on all stock purchased prior to the 8th or 9th November last provided that the animals were tariffed at the rate of 40 per cent. on landing in Great Britain and Northern Ireland; and, if so, if he will state why it is that the double bounty on such cattle shipped on the boat that sailed from Dublin at 1.50 on the morning of the 10th November last was not granted, and if he has taken into account the fact that the cattle were on the shipping company's premises and inspected and valued by the Department's inspectors on the 9th November, and that their shipment was only delayed because of the company not having a boat ready for sailing at midnight, and if in view of this he will favourably consider granting the bounty asked for by the owners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the opening portion of the question is in the negative, as the decision of the Executive Council specifically restricted the payment of double bounties to consignments of cattle actually exported on the 8th and 9th November last.  The cattle referred to in the question were shipped on 10th November and were <Col N="1855" /> not, therefore, entitled to the payment of double bounty.  I am fully aware of the circumstances connected with the shipment of these cattle, but, for the reason indicated, I am not in a position to give favourable consideration to the proposal referred to in the concluding portion of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say that the reason he is not prepared to give further consideration to the matter is that the Executive Council specifically restricted the increased bounty to cattle exported on 8th and 9th November last, and is he aware that in one of these cases it is a question of cattle being shipped from New Ross on the morning of the 9th November and which were not exported from the port of Dublin until 1.50 on the following morning because of difficulties experienced by the shipping companies, difficulties that had nothing at all to do with the shipper himself and that in fact if the difficulties had not arisen the cattle would have been shipped that night?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the cattle were shipped within two hours after midnight on 9th November, but we have to draw the line at some particular hour and if we were to say that we would give until six o'clock on the following morning, perhaps it would be found that cattle went out after that hour.  There were various consignments going out across the land border as well as across the sea borders.  As a matter of fact we gave 24 hours longer than was originally intended. This concession was to extend at first only until 8th November, but afterwards it was extended to 9th.</P>

      <P>If the concession were given in order to remedy a definite hardship arising out of the unexpected imposition of an increased tariff, will the Minister not take into consideration the case of persons who lost the benefit of this concession arising out of a pure accident, and where if the normal trend of competing services had been running <Col N="1856" /> this concession would have been given? I submit to the Minister that there is very great hardship in the case in which a person through the normal channel finds his shipment one and a half hours late because of the fact that there was an accident arising within that normal channel.  Will the Minister reconsider the matter, because there are a limited number of cases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>So that not only was this work done for many months recently at Foulksmills by Donovan, but he is a man who had 20 years' service in the post office and the person now appointed has no post office service.  Does not the Minister consider <Col N="1862" /> that a very serious injustice has been done in a case like that where a man has given this service; where there has been no complaint as to the way in which he did his duty up to the present; and when he is a man with a wife and family of seven children?</P>

      <P>The position is, as I understand it, that his area is five miles away and he has reverted to the position in which he had been before; because it is considered that local people are the best suited to these particular jobs.  The actual amount of the wages of the man who has got it is only 14/10 per week and Donovan has 10/- per week, so that there is not very much difference, considering he would have to come five miles.</P>

Could the Minister explain why it is necessary to put in that clause?  In the first place the rate of duty on sole leather or insole leather is 37½ per cent., with a preferential rate of duty of 25 per cent., and then power is taken to allow this leather in under licence.  Could the Minister give any information to the House as to the granting of these licences; how many have been requested; and if any have been granted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The licence provision is to permit us to allow sole and insole leather to be imported by boot manufacturers. One of the difficulties in imposing a duty on sole and insole leather, one of the difficulties which was adverted to by the Tariff Commission, when the matter was under examination, was that there was no satisfactory method of distinguishing between leather imported for repair work and leather imported for manufacturers. We have adopted this device of imposing a duty upon all leather with a licence provision, so that we can permit leather to come in free of duty to manufacturers.  The present position is that the country's requirements of leather for the repairing business and business other than the manufacturing of boots, would involve a considerable increase in the present output of the tanneries.  Therefore, we feel that until we have got to the stage where these tanneries are supplying all the other requirements of the country, there is no necessity to put upon boot manufacturers the direct obligation to get their requirements from Irish tanneries. At a later stage, however, it is intended that boot manufacturers will also be required to take the sole and insole leather tanned here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>And the manufacturers will not?  That is another way of putting it.  Which of the two, would the Minister say, uses the greater portion of the leather?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there would not be a lot of difference.  I cannot give precise figures on that score.  I have satisfied myself that the requirements of the country for repair work are sufficient to occupy fully the existing tanneries.  It is likely, of course, that the capacity of those tanneries will be increased and that perhaps new ones will be started, in which case when the trade has been revived and put upon <Col N="1864" /> a new basis of efficiency we can withdraw the licences from manufacturers, requiring them also to get their supplies from those tanneries.  I do not think we would have any hesitation about compelling boot manufacturers to get their leather from the tanneries here if the tanneries could supply it.  It is the fact that they are not able to supply it at the moment that requires this licensing provision.</P>

      <P>Boot manufacturers use leather tanned from dry hide. the Saorstát tanneries are not producing that kind of leather at the moment.  Of course the leather which they are producing is quite suitable for sole and insole purposes.  It is, however, a much better quality than is ordinarily put into boots by manufacturers. No doubt the tanneries will develop the production of leather from dry hide as soon as the existing trade has been restored.</P>

      <P>That is in fact really changing into a permanent duty what is at present in force as an emergency duty.  The metal is metal used for road construction, and in connection with concrete works.  The duty came on automatically under the emergency duty upon all steel goods imported. We did not contemplate that it would produce this industry.  In fact, two firms started to produce the goods here.  The general duty upon steel goods was removed at the beginning <Col N="1866" /> of the year, and the persons who were employed in this industry, up to a couple of hundred, were considerably reduced.  The duty was then reimposed by another emergency order, and we are now making it a permanent duty. This is one of the industries produced unexpectedly by the emergency duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several cases in which the Minister, in consultation has taken power to issue licences for the importation of goods without paying any duty.  It is a bad principle.  It is thought in certain quarters that only certain people would get them.  In a case I have heard of, one business man had a licence in a certain town, and another man who was in the same line of business was not aware that it was open to him to apply.  I think the Minister ought to tell the House what the procedure is with regard to this, whether the same consideration is given in all cases, and whether there cannot be some sort of intimation given to business people as to how those licences are to be had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever possible, intimation is given.  In cases like the one the Deputy is now discussing the licence provision is merely inserted to deal with the possibility of some special make of tank or cistern being required for special purposes which cannot be foreseen at the moment. Ordinarily, licences will not be issued, but we want to make sure that we will have power to issue licences in certain special cases the circumstances of which cannot be foreseen at present. I think it is undesirable that there should be any extensive use of such a licence provision, and we desire to get rid of those licensing powers as quickly as possible.  We hope to get rid of some of them in the coming Finance Bill.  The practice is that wherever a licence is given for any type of article the decision upon the application which produced the licence is taken as a test decision, and is applied to similar applications in the future, except the circumstances change in the meantime. Wherever the article can be defined, and is known to fall within a particular category, public notice of <Col N="1867" /> the fact that licences for such an article will be given is arranged for.  I agree fully that it is very undesirable that there should be any doubt whatever concerning the manner in which those licensing powers are used.  The practice is that any facility given to one importer in respect of any class of article is given to all importers until the circumstances have changed, or, to explain the last phrase, until similar articles produced here are available. In certain cases the licence provision is there because of the fact that home production is not quite sufficient to meet the requirements of the country, in which case a licence to import is issued when evidence is supplied that the person or firm in question has made application to the existing firm and has been unable to get his order met. In that eventuality he is permitted to import.  Exactly the same procedure is followed in all similar applications. The decision in respect of one governs all similar applications in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Reference No. 14, this question of the manufacture of glass bottles is one that should be settled some time so that we may know where we stand. There is a fixed impression abroad that Ringsend Glass Bottle Factory can supply a wide range of bottles but it is becoming exceedingly difficult <Col N="1869" /> to implement the Minister's intention in regard to the package duty, as a result of the glass bottle situation. There is a considerable range of glass bottles which it is not possible to get in this country.  One is the glass bottle with the tapering neck.  I know of one case where an application was made three weeks ago for a licence to import bottles of that kind. I presume the Revenue Commissioners are trying to satisfy themselves whether or not these bottles are really available in the Saorstát but in the meantime the packer is held up and he cannot pack the commodity at all. I suggest that categorical instructions should be issued to the Revenue Commissioners, that only a certain limited category of bottles can be obtained in the Free State at present and that, at least until the situation has been thoroughly examined, other classes of glass bottles should be admitted without let or hindrance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should make himself acquainted with the history of the glass bottle duty in this country.  It is a considerable time since it was first imposed.  For a period after its imposition I do not think there was much difficulty in getting supplies within the Saorstát.  Then difficulties arose.  There was a limited production in the factory which was finally closed down.  The duty was, however, maintained, but the licensing provision in connection with the duty was operated so as not to hamper anybody who desired to import glass bottles.  Then the glass bottle factory started making dark glass bottles. Licences were issued without delay, I am satisfied, for the importation of any other classes of bottles which were required.  The factory is now installing a tank for the manufacture of white glass bottles.  When that tank is in full production, the only glass bottles admitted will be of the description set out in the various lettered paragraphs of Reference No. 14.  All other types of glass bottles will be produced here.  It may be that there will not be the same variety of bottles produced, but there will be bottles produced to meet the <Col N="1870" /> requirements of all trades.  It is possible that there may be some small class of bottles which may have to be imported of a kind which we cannot visualise at the moment and which is not enumerated in the lettered paragraphs. It is to deal with such cases that the licensing provision is made. That licensing provision will be got rid of as soon as possible because I think in a very short time we shall be able to know whether we have omitted from the list of exemptions any class of bottle that cannot be made here. In all other cases, there will be bottles of all sizes, of white and of dark glass, available, and the only limitation of supply will be in respect of the variety and types of bottles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that my experience of the Revenue Commissioners is that their promptitude in dealing with these regulations has been admirable?  There can be no conceivable reason for complaint in that regard, but there is a certain variety of bottle which cannot possibly be obtained in this country.  Take, for instance, the bottle used for bottling cattle castor oil.  It has always been a cheap bottle.  It is quite inconceivable that for some considerable time at least an Irish glass bottle of that type will be available.  I suggest to the Minister for Finance that this business of the glass bottle is cutting right across his packing policy and making it frightfully difficult to carry that policy into effect.  The Minister, if he inquires, will find that there are certain classes of glass bottles which it is practically impossible to get in this country and which the Irish glass bottle factory cannot be expected to handle for some time.</P>

Then every class of white glass bottle will be produced&mdash; every white glass bottle that there is a mould made to make.</P>

I should like the Minister to give us some idea of what is contemplated in this, particularly in view of the fact that the Minister applies the tariff on cherries, strawberries and raspberries for a very limited period, and applies it over the whole year, apparently, on apples, pears, plums, currants and gooseberries.  What is the particular reason for applying the tariff during a restricted period in the cases of numbers 4, 5 and 6 of the Schedule and leaving the period unrestricted in the cases of, say, 7 and 8, not to speak of numbers 1, 2 and 3?  I should like to know what is the general policy enshrined in sub-section (7), because if there is no policy enshrined in sub-section (7) then there is, apparently, an all-the-year-round tariff to be put upon apples, pears, plums, currants <Col N="1875" /> and gooseberries.

There is no intention to issue a licence with regard to cherries, strawberries and raspberries, within the dates mentioned, as dessert fruits; but so far as the jam makers are concerned, as soon as we get the returns we have asked for, consideration will be given to the issuing of a licence for a certain percentage of what they have been importing up to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case of apples, pears and plums is different.  The crop in regard to these fruits is rather variable.  It is not like strawberries and raspberries which are fairly regular from year to year.  The crop in the case of apples, pears and plums depends on the season and on the sort of weather that obtains, particularly in the month of May.  Because of this we cannot foretell with any degree of accuracy at all for how many months our home supply of these particular fruits would last. As a matter of fact, we have issued licences freely for the importation of apples up to 31st July.  From that date up to, say, the last day in August we intend to issue licences with regard to the quantity so that there would not be an over supply of apples when our own supply comes in.  As soon as we are satisfied that all the apples in <Col N="1876" /> the country are used up we would issue licences freely again.  I think that, as far as dessert fruits are concerned, apples are the only exception that will be made with regard to the issuing of a licence.  With regard to jam making, it is uncertain for the last few years and I cannot reply on that for the moment because the returns from the jam manufacturers have not yet come in in detail.</P>

We have got here in this Resolution a new definition which will prevent that system of evasion. Chemists have been working on this for some months and have produced this definition.  We think that even it is not quite watertight, and that it will be necessary to have some slight modification of it later on.  The duty position is not altered at all.  This is merely a device to prevent the system of evasion which grew up during the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of it is to change the emergency duty into a permanent duty.  The duty on cloths was increased very largely in consequence of the lowering of prices and of attempts to produce cloths at uneconomic prices.  The increase in the duty on cloth necessitated a corresponding increase in the duty on articles made from the cloth.  The duty on wearing apparel, men's and women's, &ldquo;made wholly or mainly from woven tissues wholly or partly of wool or worsted&rdquo; was increased by an emergency order. It is being made a permanent duty in this Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the operation of the duty on woollen cloths and readymade clothing definitely resulted in the public being unable to get the cheaper ends of women's outer wearing apparel at the price they used to be able to get them at?  It is now virtually impossible to buy here a woman's coat under about 25/- or 30/- which used to be available at £1.  I think if the Minister looks into the matter he will find that the manufacturers of women's outer wearing garments have practically given up the attempt to produce a woman's coat under 22/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say at the moment at what price these are being produced&mdash;I mean the cheaper grade of women's outer garments.  There is a substantial leeway to be made up in that industry because nothing had been done in consequence of the low rate of duty that prevailed until this time last year.  During the past year substantial advances were made, but still we have a long way to go before we can hope to be self-sufficient in the matter of factory-made women's outer garments. At the moment a certain amount of leeway is being made up by the home manufacturer: by dressmakers and others as well as those who intend wearing the coats and dresses and things of that kind which they make themselves.  I am not at all sure that it is not just as desirable to have production in that form as in the factory form.  The information at the disposal of my Department would indicate that there has been a very substantial <Col N="1881" /> increase in the number of persons engaged in the dressmaking business in their own homes and in the output of those so engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to follow the Minister's explanation: whether it is that in fact coats are being produced and that there is no scarcity, or whether, on the other hand, there are no factories producing cheap women's outer garments, but that the trade has passed into the hands of home dressmakers operating on their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that up to this time last year we had practically no factory production of women's outer garments at all.  Now we have. There are a number of firms engaged in the factory production of women's outer garments.  These firms are not sufficient to supply what would be regarded as the ordinary demand for factory produced articles.  This deficiency is made up in two ways: by continuing imports on the one hand, mainly of high-class goods in respect of which the import duty does not make much difference, and by the output of the home dressmaker.  Ordimarily speaking, if this situation did not exist there would be a larger consumption of the factory produced article as against the dressmaker produced article.  At the present time you have a larger production of the dressmaker produced article than of the factory produced article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who will have to pay this duty are the poor. They are the principal purchasers of these cheap outer garments for women. They will suffer most under this.  The country dressmaker will charge from 10/- to 12/- for making a coat.  About three yards of material are required for the making of a coat.  If 12/- is charged for the making of a coat, the total cost of which is £1, there is only 8/- left for the purchase of the material and trimmings.  My experience has been that the Irish manufacturers are avoiding the cheap end of the trade in women's outer wearing garments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, so <Col N="1882" /> far as there is factory production of women's outer garments at all it is the cheaper class of garments that is being produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that if such representations have been made to his Department they do not give the position correctly. There are, so to speak, three classes of trade.  First, the highly expensive class&mdash;those who send to London or Paris for their clothes; then there is the middle trade of good quality; and thirdly, there is definitely the cheap trade which caters principally for the poorer classes in Dublin and the rural areas.  I quite agree that the middle trade is being surprisingly well done in Irish factories, but I think that, if the Minister examines the lower end of the trade, that is, the garments which will not retail at a price higher than 25/-, he will find that these are practically unprocurable from Irish manufacturers and he will find that no dressmaker, working at home, could by handwork, produce it.  It is purely a factory product and Irish manufacturers are not trying to produce it. They are avoiding it and trying to take all the middle-class trade, on which they can make a fair profit by getting a price from 35/- to 75/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands me.  A great deal of the cloth used in women's garments is woollen cloth in respect of which there is no concession given at all. There is, however, in the manufacture of the other cheap garments, a cloth which is mostly cotton but which is subject to duty because it has some wool mixed through it.  That cloth which is very cheap&mdash;it is sometimes 9d and 10d a yard&mdash;is allowed in free of duty.  That cloth, I think, is not used and would scarcely be used by the home dressmaker.  It is suitable only for factory production of very low-grade cloths.</P>

      <P>The Minister may rest assured that no cloth coming into this country under 2/- per square yard was pure wool cloth.  They were all adulterated more or less by cotton. They were mixed cloths known in the trade as woollen cloths and I think that, if the factor is to get the concession the Minister indicates he is to get, the Minister ought to consider the claims of the country dressmaker.  It simply means that he is taking the business away from the country dressmaker. His eventual objective will be to wipe the country dressmaker altogether out of the cheaper end.</P>

      <P>The class of goods I am referring to are not, and could not, be made by a dressmaker at all. They are a type of goods that can only be sold at the prices at which they are sold because of the fact that they are produced in huge quantities. They can cut out one hundred garments on one machine at the same time and sew them on the one machine in half-an-hour.  It is that type of goods, which can be sold at that price because of mass production methods, that I am referring to but the type of garment that has to be made individually is the type that requires a somewhat different kind of cloth and in respect of which no concession is given.</P>

      <P>With regard to Reference No. 4 which deals with saddlery and harness, these materials were excluded last year, under Section 9, from the tax in respect of woven tissues or blanketing for use in saddlery or harness work but saddlery and harness materials are now introduced in one or two sections in the Schedule to Resolution No. 11 and in the following Resolution 12.  It is introduced there in sub-section (3) and I think I saw it somewhere else.  The Minister probably knows that saddlery is a very important matter for horses. If the quality of the material be not up to the mark, they may possibly get sores.  There must have been a reason for excluding it.  Can the Minister tell us if there has been any expert examination of the quality of the material which shows it to be suitable?

The harness makers here are very expert.  They make excellent saddles and other equipment for horses, and it would be a great pity to <Col N="1886" /> interrupt their business.  Is the Minister satisfied, from any examination he has made, that the quality and price of this material are as good as that in use at present?  I do not know but that they are using local material, but as it was excluded last year it must have been excluded for some reason.  I have not heard that there has been any production of this particular quality of material that would be suitable for this trade.</P>

      <P>In fact the exclusion was made in 1928 or 1929, when the duty on woven tissues was first imposed.  Harness cloth was excluded at that time because the Irish woollen mills were not producing it at that time, but since then they have been producing it in first rate quality and in adequate quantity, so that the exclusion, which was agreed to in 1929, has now been removed and the duty on woven tissues has been applied to these cloths.  The Deputy can be satisfied that there will be an adequate supply of them in first rate qualities.</P>

      <P>A number of firms are manufacturing it.  Reference 2 is consequential. As regards Reference 3, we have been giving to cap manufacturers free importation of cap cloth.  We have decided to withdraw that concession. We find that some of the manufacturers are using imported cloth exclusively, while some are using as high as 50 per cent. of home-produced cloth.  We have decided to withdraw the concession and to impose the woollen duty upon cap cloth, as upon other cloths, and thus encourage the use of Irish cloth.  The duty payable is, in any event, trivial&mdash;20 per cent.  On a yard of cloth costing 10d., only 2d. would be payable and out of that they would be able to make a dozen caps.  As regards Reference 4, we exempted from duty last year, at the request of some Deputies, steel frames used for stained glass.  These are now being produced here and, with the agreement of everybody concerned, the exemption is being withdrawn.  Reference No. 5 is largely consequential on the withdrawal of the exemption from duty of saddlery and other cloths.  In effect, it increases the duty on blankets and rugs from 20 per cent. to 30 per cent.  Reference No. 6 doubles the duty on down quilts. Reference No. 7 has two effects.  It makes greeting cards&mdash;Christmas cards and the like&mdash;subject to the stationery duty.  It exempts from duty printed wax paper.  We kept that duty on during the year and approached some firms with a view to having the work done within the country.  No firm has yet started to do it.

These articles can be made here <Col N="1889" /> although this change is mainly being made because of the evasion of duty on rain-water pipes.  These were being imported as smoke pipes and ventilation pipes and were thus escaping duty. To bring that evasion to an end, it is necessary to make all these classes of pipes subject to duty.

      <P>The bulk of the wood that will come in for use by builders will not be subject to this particular definition.  There is no question of that.  If there is any type of wood that might be subject to this definition and that is required for purposes other than box-making, then the licensing provisions may be operated to permit it being imported free of duty.  This duty in the main achieves our purpose, which is to prevent the importation of <Col N="1894" /> component parts of boxes, particularly egg-boxes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?  You have defined the dimensions of the wood.  One way out of the difficulty would be to say: &ldquo;boards and planks of soft wood, the minimum thickness of which does not exceed three inches by one inch.&rdquo; That might get over the difficulty. Personally, I think the Minister's attitude in regard to the component parts of egg-boxes is exceedingly silly, and will do very material injury to the egg trade.  The egg-boxes at present manufactured from wood sawn in this country are by no means comparable to the egg-boxes that used to be manufactured from foreign sawn timber.  I believe the Department of Agriculture knows that.</P>

If the Department knew anything about the egg trade they would make every effort to end this tariff.  If the Minister knew anything about the egg trade he would put an end to the tariff immediately. Unless the Minister is going to create great inconvenience in the building trade generally, he ought to revise his definition of the timber he wants to catch under this Resolution.</P>

      <P>The original intention of the Legislature in imposing excess profits duty was to impose it on the person or persons engaged in business at that time.  So far as I have been able to examine the Act of 1915, in respect of which this duty first became chargeable, it is fairly clear the intention was to get the excess profits duty from the persons then owning and carrying on business.  This particular amendment effects quite a different purpose.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The first portion of my remarks was directed to the Act of 1915&mdash;the substance of the Act. Reference No. 15 here seeks to alter that, but the person who is affected by the terms of the Act is referred to in No. 14:</P>
      <P>that the charge of excess profits duty effected by Part III of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, and the Acts amending or extending that Act was not repealed, prejudiced, or affected by Section 32 of the Finance Act, 1926 (No. 35 of 1926).</P>
      <P>First, there is the principle I have stated, that it was the person carrying on the business at the time this imposition was made in the Legislature, who was affected.  The terms of the 1915 Act are quite clear:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duty may be assessed on any person for the time being owning or carrying on the trade or business or acting as agent for that person in carrying on the trade or business, or, where a trade or business has ceased, on the person who owned <Col N="1897" /> or carried on the trade or business or acted as agent in carrying on the trade or business immediately before the time at which the trade or business ceased,</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If my interpretation of that enactment is correct it would make the person carrying on the business now liable.  We entered into possession of that asset under an agreement.  That is the agreement which has been referred to by the Minister as the &ldquo;Secret Agreement.&rdquo; When speaking of it as a &ldquo;Secret Agreement&rdquo; there has been no reference made to the advantages derived under that agreement.  The final clause of that agreement gives us all the arrears of taxes due to the British Government in 1922.  These were given to us.  It is in respect of that agreement which the Minister and his Party refer to as the Secret Agreement that these moneys are being collected. Those moneys, such as they were, were due from persons owning the business. This amendment, if I interpret it correctly, alters the situation entirely, and it harnesses responsibility on any person who entered into possession of a business by purchase or by any other means, by bequest or anything else of the sort.  That was not the intention nor the words of the Act which gave the right to collect this particular tax. Section 15 here states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1898" /> (1) That sub-section (2) of Section 45 of the Finance (No.2) Act, 1915, shall be construed and have effect and be deemed always to have had effect as if the words &ldquo;at the date of the making of the assessment&rdquo; were inserted therein in lieu of the words &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; now contained therein.</P>
    <P>What is the meaning of that section? It has only one meaning, and that is that the persons who were originally legally responsible for the excess profits duty, which runs from that enactment of the 1915 Act, are not to pay, but their successors in title, without knowing what their liability was, must do so.  Recollect it is 18 years ago, and they are having placed upon them a tax for which they were not liable at that period.  If I am wrong let the Minister correct me, but I submit that is the meaning of this section.  If it is not a question of changing, altering, amending or extending the imposition which is made by reason of Section 45 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, passed by the British Legislature, then I do not know what it is.  If my recollection is correct, Section 32 of the Finance Act of 1926 was amended last year.  It was amended to the disadvantage of the taxpayers liable under it.  It read in any case as originally drafted and was law until last year:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 39 of the Finance Act, 1921, no repayment or adjustment of excess profits duty may be obtained or made and no assessment or additional assessment to excess profits duty may be made after the 30th day of September, 1926, except in a case which is by virtue of this. Part of this Act deemed to be an undetermined case.</P>
    <P>Apparently in any case which is not a determined case there was an end of it so far as excess profits duty was concerned.  Anyone who is acquainted with business accountancy knows when you read of a case like that and take that as an undetermined case, you can go on with your business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much afraid that in the eyes of the Revenue Commissioners wilful neglect is equally serious with fraud.  There is no difference between the two as far as Finance is concerned.  They would be both offences.  Fraud and wilful neglect will be regarded equally as offences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. I am quite sure they would not be long making up their minds on it.  What they do, what they are empowered to do and all their authority is derived from this Act of the Oireachtas.  They keep within this Act and they must keep within the law.  They are liable to be tried before the courts for a breach of the law but they are not entitled to be brought before the courts on a question of fact.  Whatever we do here, it is we who are laying down the law and everybody knows what the interpretation of that will be.  Everybody knows what that Act of 1926 gave or granted.  Fraud or wilful neglect in the interpretation of the Revenue Commissioners is the same thing.  There is a bigger question as to the person who is liable for this excess profits duty. If I interpret this new change correctly <Col N="1900" /> the scope is extended.  Persons succeeding by purchase or otherwise entering into possession become liable if these amendments are passed.  This Section 14 says: &ldquo;that the charge of excess profits duty effected by Part III of the Finance (No. 2) Act of 1915, and the Acts amending or extending that Act was not repealed, prejudiced or affected by Section 32 of the Finance Act, 1928.&rdquo;  What is the meaning of passing it?  What had the Legislature in mind when they enacted the original clause?  They meant to do something. And we are told now, according to this amendment, that it was not repealed, prejudiced or affected by Section 32 of the Finance Act of 1926.  So much for that particular aspect of the case.</P>
      <P>Take the general question.  Take this particular tax, started as far back as 1915.  Take, as a standard year, 1913 or 1914.  Now while a great many firms do keep their accounts in regular order, quite a number do not.  To go back to that period of years now, particularly with a clause of this kind, is taxing business people in a way which, to my mind, is unreasonable. I mean a tax on their understanding rather than a tax on their pockets.  Ordinary business accounts ought to be able to be closed from year to year.  The Statute of Limitations runs as against individuals.  It is not running here.  As far as the State is concerned, it should be in no stronger position than an individual, and business accounts ought to be closed each year and people ought to know where they stand exactly with regard to their accounts.  I do not know what sum of money is involved in this.  No matter what the sum is, I submit that what the tax was originally conceded to be and accepted to be should not now be extended, eighteen years afterwards; that if there was a concession in the Act of 1926 it ought to be maintained rather than refused, and that business generally will be all the better for having these things more up to date in future.</P>

      <P>In that connection I think I might, with your permission, sir, reserve my right to reply, and I think that the discussion ought to be limited then to Resolution No. 14.  The trouble has arisen owing to the fact that Deputy Cosgrave, rising on Resolution <Col N="1904" /> No. 14, went on to discuss the subject matter of Resolution No. 15.  I then suggested that we were taking both together and I understood it met with the assent of the House that they both should be taken together.  In view of the trend of discussion, I think it might not be any harm to get back to Resolution No. 14 and afterwards deal with Resolution No. 15.  I can assure Deputy Dillon that we are not acting in an arbitrary fashion in regard to Resolution No. 15, nor are we making any change in the existing practice.</P>

      <P>I understand that we are trying to give statutory effect to a certain view.  Another view has been raised against the Revenue Commissioners, and we are coming to the assistance of the Revenue Commissioners to give statutory effect to their view.  But, frankly, I find it somewhat difficult to follow the exact application of the Resolution.  Surely the Chair will agree that the Minister, when introducing a financial resolution, usually explains it and subsequently, if he deems it necessary, answers questions, if questions are put to him.  Whatever the exact procedure is, the usual practice is that the Minister tells the House what the resolution is about and then holds himself, within reasonable limits, at the disposal of the House to answer questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will remember&mdash;I do not think it can have escaped its recollection&mdash;that at the present moment certain people do propose to challenge in the courts the legality of the action of the Revenue Commissioners in making certain assessments for excess profits duty. The basis, I think, of their case is that it has been claimed that the charge to excess profits duty was repealed by Section 32 of the Finance Act, 1926, which provided that as from that date assessments were to be made only in certain cases, and that this charge was not revived by the repeal in 1932 of the words in the 1926 Act prohibiting the making of assessments.  The Revenue Commissioners have been advised all along, and have acted in accordance with that advice, that this contention is unfounded.  On the other hand, it is <Col N="1905" /> possible that some people may bring this case into court.  Those who are interested are well supplied with the wherewithal to bring it into court, well supplied, we hold, at the expense of the Exchequer with the resources which would enable them to initiate legal proceedings of undue length.  Once those cases come into court, of course, the collection of the revenue would be considerably impeded, and in order to ensure that there would be no doubt in the mind of any person as to what the intention of the Legislature was, as expressed in 1926, Resolution No. 14 is now before the House.  It provides that in order to remove doubts it be declared and enacted that the charge of excess profits duty effected by Part III of the Finance Act, 1915, and the Acts amending or extending that Act was not repealed, prejudiced, or affected by Section 32 of the Finance Act, 1926.  That is the purpose of this Resolution.</P>

      <P>Certain persons held, and of course rightly held, that they had a perfect right to take these proceedings. If they were assessed wrongly, under law they had a perfect right to a decision on that matter in the courts.  They instituted proceedings. It is not a question that they were going to do it.  They had actually instituted proceedings.  They had gone to their solicitor, briefed counsel and incurred considerable expense. The case had in fact, I think, been actually listed for hearing.  If the aim of this motion is not to forestall the decision of the court I do not know what it is.  It is a resolution to put out of court persons who have actually <Col N="1906" /> incurred expense.  It does not matter whether they could afford it; that does not remove the injustice.  If those persons, acting perfectly legally and within their rights, have incurred costs, and are now put out of court by the action of the Minister under this motion, I say in all justice they should be indemnified against their costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a question, sir, about which we need get heated, but I think the Minister will agree that there is no precedent for this procedure, except one, and that is the precedent set up by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government when they forestalled the judgment of the British Privy Council Court, and effectively destroyed the jurisdiction of the British Privy Council Court in this country.  So far as I recollect, that is the only precedent for attempting to forestall the interpretation of an Act of Parliament by the courts of the country.  In that case the procedure could be defended on the ground that the impending interpretation was not by a court of this country.  The statute was going to be interpreted by a British court; the possibility was that our Supreme Court would be overruled, and the interpretation of our courts set aside.  The very dangerous procedure was adopted of forestalling the interpretation of a court of law by declaratory legislation. Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether he is aware of another precedent for such a procedure.  I do not think there is another.  I should like to remind the Minister that, if this procedure is here admitted, no man need ever start in this country again an action which is calculated to embarrass the Government.  No man need ever apply for the protection of the courts against the Government, and the principle involved in this business is, to my mind, so fundamental that a very large body of people will not recognise its existence at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole system of our judiciary is maintained for the purpose of providing the ordinary citizen with protection against the State, so that <Col N="1907" /> he would always have the right, in the last extremity, to go to the courts, and that the courts, absolutely independent of the Executive, could protect him.  Quite apart from the merits of any individual application in respect of excess profits duty, the fact remains that the statutes are there, the statute of 1915 and the statute of 1926.  The only body that ought to interpret those statutes is the courts, and if a person invokes the protection of the courts against the Government this House should not intervene in that court action on one side or the other. If the legislators of 1926 did not make themselves clear it is not the first time they failed to do so.  There is not a judge on the High Court bench who will not tell the Minister the same story, that again and again complicated questions of interpretation arise out of statutes passed in this Parliament, and every other Parliament in the world, but the principle has always been maintained that no matter how complicated they may be the business of interpretation was reserved to the courts and the citizen was entitled to the protection of the courts.  Here, in the knowledge that an individual citizen has invoked the protection of the court and asked the court to intervene between him and the State, as we cannot intimidate the judge we propose to change the law. That is the blunt way of putting it. Charles I would have sent down his second footman and told the judge that there was such a thing in existence in this country as the block and the hatchet.  The judge would have taken very good care to ascertain what the view of Charles I was on this particular lawsuit, and he would have put it into operation.  Deputies may think I am being too severe on Charles I.  I am quite prepared to put the blame on Queen Elizabeth, but that was the practice then.  In order to protect the judiciary from that very kind of interference their positions were made unique.  They were put in a very special, privileged position in order to protect them from interference, and because that interference is now impossible we introduce <Col N="1908" /> the next best thing, declaratory legislation.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister remember that by so doing we are removing the interpretation of statutes from the judges on the bench to the Deputies of Dáil Eireann.  I have the profoundest respect for the opinion of Deputy Corry on almost anything, but when it comes to interpreting the Finance Acts from 1915 to 1933 I hesitate to lay that burden upon his capable shoulders.  Remember we have to vote on this Resolution after judging the merits of the case and deciding whether the Minister's interpretation of the Finance Act is the correct one. If we make up our minds that it is we must vote for the Resolution.  But if we believe that the meaning which the Minister has put on the Finance Act is not the true meaning we should vote against the Resolution.</P>

Until we make up our mind on that issue we cannot give an intelligent vote on this Financial Resolution.  I cannot see how the Minister could defend such a position. We are being asked to intervene in a legal struggle between himself and a citizen and to paralyse the courts.  If that is done in this case occasions may arise later when we shall be asked to do it in very different circumstances, and we might find this quoted as a precedent for such interference with personal liberty in this country.</P>

      <P>The Minister asked the House to hold that this <Col N="1909" /> resolution did not interfere with the law as it stands.  I would direct the attention of the House to paragraph (a) of the resolution which says: &ldquo;That the charge of excess profits duty effected by Part III of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, and the Acts amending or extending that Act was not repealed, prejudiced or affected by Section 32 of the Finance Act, 1926 (No. 35 of 1926).&rdquo;  Now, the Act of 1926 must have done something that this resolution wants to nullify. There is no doubt about that.  Is there any ambiguity about Section 32 of the Act of 1926?  The Act of 1926, sub-section (1) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 39 of the Finance Act, 1921, no repayment or adjustment of excess profits duty may be obtained or made and no assessment or additional assessment to excess profits duty may be made after the 30th day of September, 1926...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this resolution is deliberately introduced for the purpose of repealing the protection given to citizens under the Act of 1926.  The sub-section I have read clearly states that &ldquo;no assessment or additional assessment to excess profits duty may be made after the 30th day of September, 1926.&rdquo;  You do not want a lawyer to interpret that.  This resolution aims at removing that protection given to the citizen.  I am afraid that we are guilty of contempt of court, even by discussing the resolution here.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to resent very much the suggestion that this resolution is rendered necessary by a defect in the Act of 1932.

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, undoubtedly, involved in this resolution a rather dangerous principle and, I suggest, for the introduction <Col N="1910" /> of that dangerous principle, the Minister has certainly not given adequate grounds.  This is retrospective legislation of a very dangerous and doubtful character. We must assume that this resolution has a purpose.  I suggest, the only purpose it can have is to make it quite definite that there can be no doubt about the legality of a certain charge, the legality of which is in doubt.  The Minister makes very subtle distinctions as to what his intentions are.  His intention is not to bind the court; that is, the court will be perfectly free, and, with his usual presumption, he has not the slightest doubt that the court will decide on his side.  Yet we must take it for granted that those persons who have determined to appeal to the court have been advised that they have a case.  I suggest if that is so that there is, at least, a doubt on the point. There is a doubt that the court may resolve in favour of those who feel themselves aggrieved.  Therefore, however much the Minister may try to gloss it over and try to suggest that he has another reason for doing it, in reality he is trying to prevent the court from interpreting the law as it now stands.  That can be the only effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He says he has another intention, to prevent people even appealing to the court.  I suggest that that is even a worse offence in a way than the one he is slow to admit.  I make the suggestion that even a rich person, a person who can afford it, has a right to appeal to the courts in this country.  When the Minister makes the statement that they are appealing to the court with money they have illegally withheld from the revenue, he is, I suggest, making a statement that is highly improper.  He is, as usual, assuming where there is a legal doubt that his view is the correct one, that these people are guilty of fraud, whereas in reality the purpose of this resolution is to deal with people against whom the charge of fraud could not have been made in the past. I suggest the whole thing is extremely dangerous.  In reality, we are retrospectively imposing a charge on people <Col N="1911" /> that was not there, or at least if we are not doing that, we are taking steps to see that there shall be no doubt that such a charge can be imposed, if the present law imposes it.  I suggest there is no justification, certainly none but a trumpery justification, put forward by the Minister in seeking to deprive people of the right of appealing to the courts.  I suggest that is the worst excuse we have ever heard in this House&mdash;to prevent people going to the courts, to frighten them off, because, forsooth, they may delay the collection of the revenue.  It is an extraordinary reason put forward to deprive people of what is their legal right.  This is retrospective legislation against them.</P>
    <P>These are the two purposes.  There was the case in which, apparently, there was a genuine doubt, at all events in a certain number of citizens of this State, and that there were arguable cases to come before the courts.  This amendment is intended to accomplish two objects: to frighten them off of their legal remedy that they could get from the courts, or to prevent the judges interpreting the law.  The Government may feel their vanity hurt because they were not able to carry through what they wanted last year.  The Minister really repeats here his intention of trying to tie the hands of the court; he wants to deprive people of the rights they have to a remedy.  Unless there is the very gravest possible ground, I suggest retrospective action of that kind should not be allowed by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally agreed that this is retrospective legislation. I should like to know what are the limits to which a Minister or a Government may go; or are there any limits to the extent to which they may apply retrospective legislation?  It is a rather serious step.  May I take an extreme and unlikely case?  The Finance Acts of 1925 imposed an income tax of 5/- in the £1.  Is there anything to stop any subsequent Government bringing in legislation adding a further burden of 2/6 or 50 per cent. to that 5/- and then proceeding <Col N="1912" /> to collect it retrospectively? Surely there must be some limitation to Parliamentary power in that direction.  It seems to me that if we are to be open to retrospective legislation of this kind, and if business people's accounts are likely to be reopened, after a certain date, there is not much security.  Surely we are entitled to such security and fair play, and, surely, we are entitled to protection from legislation of this character unless it could be shown that there is the very gravest reason for it.  I would like the Minister, in this particular business, to justify his action from that point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I had better confine myself, on this occasion, to Resolution No. 14.  In that connection, possibly, it might be better if I were to deal, once and for all, comprehensively, with this question of the collection of income tax and excess profit duties, for the years prior to 1922 and 1923.  The decision of the Government to proceed in this matter, in accordance with the policy laid down by our predecessors, and never departed from by us since we came into office, has been founded upon the opinion that if justice is to be done between one taxpayer and another the course we are now pursuing must be followed, and has been made inevitable by the practice in operation here since 1923.  After the change of Government, and the setting up of the Revenue Department, the Saorstát Exchequer found itself under an obligation to meet claims by Saorstát taxpayers, on various grounds, for repayment of income tax and excess profit duty&mdash;duty paid in previous years to the Board of Inland Revenue for the benefit of the United Kingdom Exchequer.  It was found that these liabilities were very heavy indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between the 1st April 1922 and the 31st March 1932, repayments of income tax in respect of the years up to 1921-22&mdash;income tax paid to the United Kingdom Exchequer&mdash;were made by the Saorstát Exchequer to an amount which may be estimated at no less than £2,250,000.  And during the eight years which ended 31st March 1929, when the last repayment of excess <Col N="1913" /> profits was made, the repayment of excess profit duty, as apart altogether from income tax, amounted to not less than £627,000.  Faced with this huge liability, for which this Government had no responsibility at the time, the Government of the day decided that the assets which attached to the Revenue Department at that date must be collected.  Our Board of Revenue Commissioners took over the administration of the revenue as from the 1st April 1923.  The assets in respect of income tax and excess profit duties of that date consisted of the outstanding arrears of tax, which had been already assessed, but not paid, and in addition the right to recover taxes which had escaped assessment, by means of additional assessment, penalties, etc.</P>
    <P>The task of collecting arrears was first undertaken.  Now I want the Dáil to grasp the position clearly in relation to these arrears.  In order to simplify the matter I propose to deal, first of all, with the income tax position. At the date on which our Board of Revenue was set up income tax for two, three, four, five and, if we include 1922-23, even, in some cases, for six years was unpaid.  The arrears in respect of this tax were due from taxpayers in every walk of life&mdash; farmers, grocers, publicans, drapers, tailors, national teachers, tram conductors and tram drivers, shop assistants, clerks and other people in receipt of comparatively low and small remuneration. On the other hand, some of the taxpayers concerned were wealthy, and very wealthy indeed.  Hundreds of the people involved had already spent their income and could only pay the arrears, if they were collectable from them at all, by instalments spread over comparatively long periods.  That was the position in which our predecessors determined that all the moneys properly due and collectable by the Revenue Commissioners, for the benefit of the Exchequer, were to be collected, no matter, I presume, from whom they were due or by whom they were owing.</P>
    <P>I am rather sorry Deputy Cosgrave is not in his place, because he had an important part in formulating that <Col N="1914" /> policy.  In that connection Deputy Cosgrave, who was then Minister for Finance, spoke in the Dáil on the 30th April, 1923, Official Report, Volume 3, column 98, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For 1920-21 there are 3,725 cases where we are owed under £100.  For 1921-1922 there are 6,861 such cases. The tax covered by these is not less than a quarter of a million.  As regards cases over £100, there are 200 in 1920-1921 and 423 for 1921-1922. The actual tax in this case is £115,000.  In Dublin City alone the arrears due from employees, exclusive of workmen, is £365,000. Making allowance for deductions which may be claimed, the net sum is something like £300,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Dáil to note the amount due from employed persons in Dublin alone&mdash;tax, every penny piece of which has been collected already, and collected at the cost of great hardship in the case of the workers and employees from whom it was taken.  That was collected by members of the Opposition when they were members of the Government, these Deputies who are now so vocal in regard to the wealthy defaulter to-day.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Government decided to collect these sums, and special powers were taken to enable the Revenue Commissioners to enforce payment.  These powers were embodied in the Finance Act of 1923.  Section 6 of that Act enabled the Revenue Commissioners to turn employers into income tax collectors, and compelled those employers to deduct from the wages or salary, payable to an employee, the latter's arrears of tax for past years.  Section 7, sub-sections (2) to (13) of the same Act, conferred special and altogether exceptional powers of a drastic character on the under-sheriffs throughout the country for recovering arrears.  There was not any question then of depriving a man of his legal rights!  They simply made the assessment and the sheriffs collected when workers were involved, and when they were not people who could put their ill-gotten gains together in order to deprive the Revenue of what was due to it.  Oh, no!  When they were poor people who <Col N="1915" /> could not protect themselves, and who could not retain lawyers to obstruct the due operation of the law, then we had an Act, with special powers for under-sheriffs, passed through this Dáil without opposition from Deputy Lynch or Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy O'Sullivan.  They are the people who brought it in and who launched the under-sheriffs on the small men&mdash;on the national school teachers, on the workers, the employees, the tram drivers of the City of Dublin&mdash;and gave them special powers to collect income tax which was owed in respect of the preceding four, five and six years.</P>
    <P>What was the justification for these extraordinarily drastic powers?  When I come to consider what was said in the House in regard to this policy in 1923, I feel like Mark Anthony when he wished that he were Brutus; for were I Deputy Cosgrave who sponsored these proposals and Deputy Cosgrave Minister for Finance, there were a Minister who would ruffle up our spirits and make us realise what our duty is to the honest taxpayers of this country!  I am sure that the taxpayers, when they hear how Deputy Cosgrave loved them during the period when he was Minister for Finance, may be glad that it is I, and not Deputy Cosgrave, who am here at this moment.</P>

      <P>I cannot plead the cause of the Revenue with all the eloquence that Deputy Cosgrave had at his command on that occasion, but I have here the record of his speech and this &ldquo;poor, dumb mouth&rdquo; will speak for me.  I am quoting Volume III again, column 546, in which Deputy Cosgrave said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This Finance Bill is, in certain respects, much more exhaustive and far-reaching, in respect of certain particulars, than has been the practice here.  A good deal of criticism of it has been printed. The Press has taken up the question of certain steps that are supposed to be taken in the Bill to get in income tax.  It must be remembered <Col N="1916" /> it is only fair to those who are paying loyally and with a due sense of their civic responsibility, very considerable sums into the Exchequer in respect of income tax, that they have got some rights, and that it is due to them, as well as to the State, that every person properly chargeable to this particular tax should pay his quota.  That is all that is contemplated under the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And that is all that is contemplated under this Resolution&mdash;that every person who is properly chargeable to this tax shall pay his quota.  If he thinks he is not properly chargeable he has his remedy.  We are merely making it quite clear to everybody that any person who was properly liable to excess profits duty between 4th of August, 1914, and 5th August, 1921, is still liable and has always been liable according to the practice of this State.</P>

      <P>I will come to that, all in due course.  In the meantime, the Deputy, who has now thrown in his lot with Deputy Cosgrave, ought to listen to what Deputy Cosgrave said in 1923.  There was much more sense in what Deputy Cosgrave said on this particular measure on that date than in what he said to-day, and it would be wise if everybody would listen to the arguments&mdash;sound and valid arguments, I admit&mdash;that were then brought in to defend it.</P>

      <P>Precisely&mdash;and I am safeguarded in every way.  I made it quite clear that we were not going to strain the law against the taxpayer; and we are not.  We are making the law conform to what has been the universal practice.  Deputy Cosgrave, on the occasion to which I <Col N="1917" /> have already referred, went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For one reason or another, for some years past, certain people have evaded the payment of this tax.  In one journal it has been mentioned that we were responsible for that. We have denied it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then Deputy Cosgrave went on in Columns 547-8 to say this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In any case, no matter who the individual was who owed money in this respect, he cannot be allowed to gain that advantage over his less fortunate brother who paid his way either since we took over the affairs of this country or who paid previously.  There is no real injustice, but there is a good deal of interested criticism of these proposals.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Further on, the Deputy said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are now faced with very heavy burdens.  We have fairly big responsibilities for the present time, and will have for the future, and every citizen is expected to bear his share of that burden.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And then he went on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are asking for nothing more than the means to utilise our present powers, and when the present means are defective to strengthen them, and to give us the opportunity of giving to the State what is due&mdash;&lsquo;rendering to Cæsar what is his.&rsquo; That is not too much to ask, and that is all that we are asking for in this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In column 580, in answer to certain arguments advanced by Deputy Johnson with regard to a person who would be affected by the proposed income tax legislation, Deputy Cosgrave said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Why should he be allowed to escape?  An unfortunate man with several children, living in a small house, paying more than his quota to the upkeep of the State is to be mulcted and made to pay more than his quota in tobacco or tea because the other man.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is the person who is properly liable to excess profits duty&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&ldquo;is released.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1918" /> Then, finally, in order to make quite clear what the attitude of the Government was in regard to this whole question of excess profits duty, after the passing of the Act of 1923 a Government notice was issued and published in the Press on 2nd August, 1923, in the course of which the following words occur:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whatever may have been the reasons for default in the past there can now be no justification for retaining for private purposes moneys that legally belong to Saorstát Eireann. These moneys must be regarded as trust funds which the taxpayer was not entitled to hold in his possession even for a single day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the foundation and that is the initiation of the policy which we are pursuing to-day.  In accordance with those declarations made by Deputy Cosgrave, who was then Minister for Finance in 1923, the Revenue Commissioners proceeded to act, and except where recovery was found to be impossible the people who were liable to this tax, not only the well-to-do classes but the smaller taxpayers, particularly the smaller taxpayers, because they would be easier got at, had to pay.  They could not put their money on deposit. They could not make concealed investments. The Revenue Commissioners knew what had been paid to them week after week during the period they were liable for this tax.  They knew what they were receiving week after week that the tax was being paid, and they could not evade it.  They could not employ lawyers to impede, by every obstacle that a skilled legal mind could devise, the action of the Revenue Commissioners in collecting the tax. National school teachers, clerks, small shopkeepers and shop assistants had to pay their arrears of income-tax, arrears which had accrued over two, three, four and five years.  And, of course, in addition to that, they had to pay the income tax which was accruing year to year as well.  In some cases it took men who were paying by monthly instalments over two years to get up-to-date with their income-tax payments.  Even during the year which ended on 31st March, 1932, tax was still being collected which had been assessed in 1921-22, <Col N="1919" /> or earlier years.  We were not responsible for the practice carried out in the year ending on 31st March, 1932. The Dáil had passed this Act, the Act of 1926 which was responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will be patient for a moment and conceal his ignorance of the law I will let him know what the law was.  Even during the year which ended on 31st March, 1932, tax was still being collected.  The Revenue Commissioners estimate that during the ten years ending 31st March, 1932, the amount collected in respect of income-tax assessed in the years prior to 1922-23 was no less a sum than £5,400,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now with regard to the excess profits duty, as the Dáil is aware, that was a duty levied on profits made by traders during the period commencing somewhat before the outbreak of the European War and ending about two years thereafter in cases in which such profits exceeded certain standards. The duty was charged by reference to the periods for which the traders made up their accounts and was limited to periods which ended after the 4th August, 1914, and before 5th August, 1921.  Now the duty&mdash;this is a point that I am sorry Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGuire are not here to listen to&mdash;was not chargeable for any period subsequent to 5th August, 1921, but up to 30th September, 1926, returns could be demanded and assessments made in the ordinary way for all excess profits duty periods up to that date.  What happened in 1926?  It was decided that no further assessments should be made in certain cases, but the charge to excess profits duty was not repealed. It still remained.  The making of the assessments was simply part of the machinery for the enforcement of the charge.  The Dáil by the Act of 1926 suspended the operation of the machinery in regard to certain cases, but the charge to excess profits duty still remained.  If any person was properly chargeable to excess profits duty in respect of the period between 4th August, 1914, and 5th August, 1921, he still remained liable, notwithstanding <Col N="1920" /> the Act of 1926.  To get back to the history of the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In 1922-23 the British Commissioners of Inland Revenue carried on the administration of the inland revenue on an agency basis for the Saorstát Government.  The gross receipts of excess profits duty collected for the benefit of the Saorstát Exchequer in that year amounted to £405,408. The gross receipts in the five following years ending on 31st March, 1928, amounted in the aggregate to £687,342. I have already pointed out that the Finance Act of 1926 provided that, except in certain undetermined cases, and in cases where it appeared to the Revenue Commissioners that there had been fraud or wilful neglect, no assessments to excess profits duty should be made after the 30th September, 1926. The Dáil merely provided that the assessments should not be made.  That is all.  It was open at any time to the Dáil, by a subsequent enactment, to provide that those assessments should be made and it carefully provided and maintained the machinery for making the assessments.  It safeguarded itself. It is said that assessments should be made where there had been fraud or wilful neglect.  We will leave that for a moment and we will consider now the action in recovering the unassessed duties by means of additional assessments and the penalty proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to about the end of the year 1927, the energies of the officials of the Revenue Commissioners were fully occupied with the making of the current income-tax assessments, year by year, and the clearing up of the huge mass of assessed arrears.  Towards the end of 1927, the question of the unassessed arrears was taken in hand.  Inspectors of taxes throughout the country <Col N="1921" /> resumed the investigation of cases in which they had reason to suspect that duties had not been assessed in full and a special staff was set up at Dublin Castle to supervise this work.  It was set up, not in 1932 or 1933, but set up in 1927 by the Government of which Deputy Cosgrave was then head.  This was a new departure; at least, it was a new activity.  It was work which, if they had had the organisation at their disposal, the Revenue Commissioners would naturally have embarked upon in 1923, but they embarked upon it after the Act of 1926 had gone through the Dáil.  They embarked upon it in 1927, the moment their hands were free and the necessary staff available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Those were income tax assessments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy please make up his mind to be quiet until the end?  They were not income tax assessments.  They were both excess profit duty assessments and income tax assessments and it was never denied that they were both.  In fact, if there was any desire at all to meet the taxpayer displayed by our predecessors, it was in regard to income tax and not in regard to excess profits duty.  They were careful in every statement they made here always to reserve to themselves the right to make any investigation they cared into the amount of excess profits duties for which a taxpayer might be liable.  They did it, of course, in a roundabout way. Cumann na nGaedheal said: &ldquo;We will allege fraud or wilful neglect.&rdquo; Now, what is fraud and what is wilful neglect?  They said: &ldquo;We will allege it the moment we suspect a man is liable for excess profits duty; we will say he is either a fraudulent taxpayer or a person guilty of wilful neglect, and we will have him served with an assessment.&rdquo; That is the policy which Deputy Cosgrave wished to start in 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, it followed inevitably from the policy which had been adopted regarding assessed arrears.  If you had collected arrears from persons who had been assessed, you could not possibly allow people who owed the Exchequer the tax to go scot free merely because of the accidental circumstance that <Col N="1922" /> they had not been assessed, due to shortage of staff or due to some other reason during the significant years. As most of the taxpayers who had been dealt with up to 1926 were small people, the small fry, the cases which were easily dealt with, it was clearly impossible, as I said earlier, to let off the wealthy trader who, by one device or another, had succeeded in evading his liabilities and had invested the proceeds of such evasion in sound investment, after the State had maintained its right against the small taxpayers like National teachers and drapers assistants and compelled them to pay their taxes to the last farthing.  From 1928 onwards&mdash;and this I think is something which must be borne in mind by Deputy Dillon and others who have criticised this proposal before the House&mdash;the House was never in any doubt as to what it meant by this section of the 1926 Act&mdash;never, for instance, indicated that it believed that a person who was properly chargeable to excess profits duty in respect of 1914 to 1921 was relieved of that charge by the Act of 1926 because every year from 1920 or 1929 onwards, the Budget Estimates, year by year, included large sums which it was expected to recover in respect of unassessed duties and, in fact, the actual collection was very large.</P>
    <P>During the four years ended 31st March, 1932, 838 cases of taxpayers, who, in one way or another, had evaded adequate assessment at the proper time, were disposed of.  These cases yielded, in income tax, sur-tax, corporation profits tax and excess profits duty, the huge sum of £1,663,000, an average of over £400,000 per year and an average of about £2,000 per person. That was&mdash;and, again, I should like to emphasise it&mdash;during the four years ending on 31st March, 1932.  That was what was collected because the House was of opinion that, in the words of this Resolution, &ldquo;the charge of excess profits duty effected by Part III of the Finance Act of 1915, and the Acts amending or extending that Act, was not repealed, prejudiced or affected by Section 32 of the Finance Act of 1926.&rdquo; If it had been repealed, prejudiced or affected, then that £1,663,000 was <Col N="1923" /> illegally and wrongfully collected but it was collected by Deputy Cosgrave's Government at a time when he was President of the Executive Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>You have got away with the swag and we are not going to make vicarious restitution.  That is one thing, at any rate, and let us make up our minds about it.  In any event, there is no doubt in the matter.  If there were any doubt, it is the prerogative of the Executive to ask the Dáil to make its mind clear in this matter, either before or after the courts have given their decision&mdash; and before, for preference.  A doubt does not exist, but if it does a much less objectionable course is now proposed than that which was followed here in the Finance Act of 1931 when, in Section 2 of that Act, after the court had given the decision, an attempt was made to nullify the judgment.  That was a pretty example of real retrospective legislation. I should like to emphasise that there is nothing retrospective about this legislation.  No decision has yet been given.  We have time to make quite clear what the intention of the Oireachtas is and has always been with regard to excess profits duty.  The interpretation which we have adopted having been perfectly consistent with the practice which has been followed during the past ten years, we are justified, before the courts have given any decision at all, where doubt has arisen, to clarify the statute and remove the doubt. That is done every day.  When a Bill is going through the Dáil, it is amended on Committee Stage.  If the amendments introduced on Committee Stage do not give full effect to the intention of the Dáil, the Bill is amended on Report.  Even when Bills have become Acts, we have introduced Bills, and our predecessors have introduced Bills, to amend them so as to make the intention of the legislature clear and &ldquo;to remove doubts.&rdquo;  Those who talk about depriving citizens of their legal right had better recall what <Col N="1924" /> they did in 1931 when, in the Finance Act of that year, they introduced Section 2 which was designed to nullify a decision of their own Circuit Court. That section contained the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1925 (No. 28 of 1925), shall be construed and have effect and be deemed always to have had effect as if after the figures &lsquo;1918&rsquo; now contained therein there were inserted the words and figures &lsquo;or under Rule 18 of the General Rules applicable to Schedules A, B, C, D and E of the said Act&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They did that in 1931 after the courts, as I have said, had already come to a decision.</P>
      <P>That is the history of this matter up to 31st May, 1932.  When this Government took office a little over 12 months ago, we found that this principle of collecting taxes for the years prior to 1922-23 had been laid down by our predecessors. We found that this policy had been steadily and consistently followed for nine years.  We had, for the first time, a clear view of everything that had happened.  Whatever views we had held previously, it became obvious to us that, if justice was to be done to the general body of taxpayers, there were only two courses open to us; one was to reverse the policy <i>ab initio</i> and repay all the millions collected in respect of these taxes during the previous nine years.  Obviously, this course was impracticable.  The other course was to adopt the policy of our predecessors and to carry it out to its logical conclusion.  We decided on the latter course.  Apart from the defence which I have made, I am prepared to defend that course on the grounds of justice and equity.  Excess profits were made out of our people by profiteers and we are here to see that the people get the benefit and advantage of them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We found that the Revenue Commissioners, in order to carry out the policy of the Government, were compelled to rely to an undue extent on their power to determine the existence of &ldquo;fraud or wilful neglect.&rdquo;  They had sometimes to establish to their own satisfaction that there was fraud <Col N="1925" /> or wilful neglect in cases where they had reliable information, but not clear legal proof, that fraud existed.  Speaking when I was in Opposition&mdash;this statement is quite consistent with our policy to-day&mdash;I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It may be that, for the purposes of the Minister, the powers given by the law are insufficient but, if so, his remedy is to amend the law and not to break it&mdash;not, in any event, to strain it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first thing we did was to give the Revenue Commissioners the powers we felt it was essential they should have if they were to do justice as between one set of taxpayers and another&mdash;the taxpayers who had paid the tax either willingly or under compulsion, and those who should have paid the tax but had succeeded in evading it.  Although they did rely on the proviso regarding fraud or wilful neglect, it was obvious that there were many cases in which the Revenue Commissioners would not act because they took a somewhat stringent view of their responsibilities under this section.  They refused to act in any case in which some reliable information had not been conveyed to them or had not come into their possession. Very often, that information came into their possession in an accidental way.  Very often, it came into their possession when the person who had succeeded in evading the tax died. One thing was clear&mdash;that there was quite a large body of people properly assessable to this tax who were successfully evading it because, by a mere hazard, the Revenue Commissioners did not get sufficient information to enable them to determine to their own satisfaction that there had been fraud or wilful neglect.  When an investigation was started, the proofs, as a general rule, were speedily forthcoming.  We said that we were not going to do that.  That might be held to be straining the law.  We said that the only way justice could be done as between one class of taxpayers and another was to give to the Revenue Commissioners power to make an assessment in any case in which they thought an assessment might properly be made&mdash;in other words, to release all the machinery, not to reimpose the <Col N="1926" /> charge, because the charge had not been repealed by the Act of 1926.  We decided to release the machinery which had been partially held up by the Act of 1926, to allow the machinery of assessment which, under the Act of 1926 could only operate in the case of those taxpayers who might appear to have been guilty of fraud or wilful neglect, to operate in the case of every person.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, if it is allowed to operate in the case of every person, that only people who are going to be made liable now for excess profits&mdash;the only people who will have anything to fear, if the Revenue Commissioners have full discretion to make the assessments they think necessary&mdash;are those who were, in fact, guilty of fraud or wilful neglect.  There is nobody else. The taxpayers who have not paid excess profits duty up to this date are people who are either guilty of fraud or have wilfully neglected to furnish the necessary returns, so that there is no injustice being done any person, and there is no attempt to deprive any person of his legal rights, and certainly nothing so drastic is being done as was done by Cumann na nGaedheal Government, 1931.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a cheer from the ranks of Tuscany.  When we decided to amend the Act we decided also to make a concession in regard to those who had not put themselves right with the Revenue Commissioners in this regard.  We felt that it would be desirable to wind up the whole of this excess profits duty at an early date, and we offered a concession to those who had succeeded in evading the tax; a concession which we had a great deal of hesitation in offering, and which many people thought was unfair to taxpayers who had already met their liabilities in full.  But we felt it was in the general interest of the taxpayers, and of the Exchequer, that something should be done to clear up this whole position expeditiously, and we offered the concession which was embodied in the Finance Act of 1932.  Upwards of 1,000 taxpayers have already intimated their intention to take advantage of that and, as a corollary, we did the <Col N="1927" /> other thing, we gave the Revenue Commissioners power to make assessments in any cases in which they thought, on the information at their disposal, they were justified in making assessments without having to determine that there had been fraud or wilful neglect.</P>
      <P>As to the legislation which we passed in 1932, I am advised that that legislation is fully effective.  But as I have already stated, we find a number of people, every one of whom has been already assessed&mdash;because there is information that they are properly chargeable with excess profits duty&mdash; banding themselves together, pooling, as they have publicly stated, all their resources, and embarking on expensive and vexatious litigation, in order to do what they can to defer the collection of excess profits duty until the Cumann na nGaedheal Government is back in office, and rewards its friends by granting remission at the cost of the general body of taxpayers.</P>

They have held meetings, published pronouncements in the Press, and generally endeavoured every way they could to prejudice the trial of the action, by commenting on its merits.  I am entitled to say, in reply, that litigation that they propose to embark on is purely vexatious, and that, on the face of their own statements, it is designed merely to defer collection of the revenue until such time as another Government comes in, which will not collect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was interrupted I think I was saying that we were not going to allow the mere suggestion of a doubt to hinder the collection of revenue.  We propose this year to introduce further legislation founded on this Resolution, so as to place the whole position regarding excess profits duty beyond a doubt. I say we are quite entitled to do that. We are entitled to make clear to the judges, and anybody else, what the mind of the Dáil is in regard to this matter.  We are not, as our predecessors did, trying to nullify the judgment of the court by subsequent legislation. I admit that would be open to challenge and to very serious criticism.  We are not doing that.  We are making it clear that it has always been the intention of the Dáil that the Revenue Commissioners should operate to collect whatever excess profits duty might be properly due, or whatever other duty might be properly due in respect of the years prior to 1922-23, in view of the fact that the Dáil has assumed liability for repaying excess profits duty and duties of every sort which were not properly collected and not properly assessed prior to 1921-22.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given particulars of the collection, up to 31st March, 1932, of income tax and excess profits duty which escaped assessment.  During the year 1932-33 a further 283 cases were settled, the amount collected being £226,000 for income tax and sur-tax, and £116,000 for excess profits duty.  These figures would have been very much larger but for the fact that <Col N="1931" /> the revenue staff were heavily pressed and there was an equal pressure on accountants and others acting for the taxpayers in connection with these settlements.  The position at the beginning of the current year was that there were about 1,400 cases remaining to be disposed of, and it is estimated that these will yield on an average about £1,000 per case.  The great majority of the 1,400 taxpayers concerned have already intimated their intention to adopt the concession outlined in my Budget speech of last year.</P>
    <P>The opposition to the payment of taxes comes, it can quite clearly be seen, from a comparatively small number of die-hards who up to now have persistently made use of every means open to them to evade the liabilities which have been met by the enormous majority of taxpayers of this country, and who are determined, if they can, to transfer the burden which they ought to bear to the shoulders of their fellow citizens.  I would like any person really concerned with the position of these people to bear in mind that if they get away with it they will succeed in making those who have met their just obligations to the State shoulder the burden of those who have succeeded in escaping by defrauding and cheating the State.  I am hoping to get this year something like £450,000 from these 1,400 cases by way of income tax and excess profits duty, and approximately the same amount in the next two years also.  This sum of £450,000 must be got from somewhere.  I suppose if Deputy McGilligan were here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 15.&rdquo;  This Resolution is designed to put beyond any doubt a practice which has existed since excess profits duty was established and which has not been challenged by anyone since March, 1922. It has already been decided that these words &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; mean at the time of making the assessment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is merely the logical consequence of the decision which was given in March, 1922, that the assessment was properly made on the person for the time being owning the business.  Excess profits duty, of course, is made in respect of a business and on a business in just the same way as property tax may be assessed on property, and it merely puts the onus on the person taking over the business in respect to which there is an excess profits duty liability; exactly the same onus as would be on him if he was taking over real property in respect of which there was an outstanding property tax. Paragraph (2) is merely a provision which will enable the Revenue Commissioners to deal with cases of hardship.  It is designed to enable them in suitable cases to assess the person who was the owner of the trade or business at the time the excess profits were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the analogy that the Minister draws with a person buying a business in respect of which a claim remains in the Revenue Commission for excess profits which should have been paid, and was not, 16 years ago.  If I buy a piece of real property upon which certain taxes are leviable, I can readily ascertain by reference to statutes what taxes were leviable, and I can demand that the person who conveys the property to me shall produce receipts to show me that the tax has been satisfied.  Suppose, however, that I proceed to buy a business from an individual who operated that business between 1915 and 1921, and it is of a kind in which no satisfactory accounts were kept at that time, I have no means of ascertaining whether the man was liable to excess profits duty or not.  There are no means available to me whereby I can find out.  I pay the man the fair value of his property, having made all requisitions on title that I can make; having insisted that he will produce receipts for all the taxes or State liabilities that I can know he is liable for.  Some years after I acquire the property, the Revenue Commissioners come along, if I understand the Resolution correctly, and say: &ldquo;Because your predecessor in title in this business failed to pay what was due in respect of excess profits, we now propose to assess you,&rdquo; and the Commissioners can then assess me for the default of my predecessor in title and collect the money from me.  I am not quite clear whether I would want to become the successor in title to the defaulting taxpayer before 1921. Suppose I bought a business with a liability of this kind attached to it in 1927, would I be liable for the tax-payer's default?</P>

      <P>I am discussing the thing really on its merits.  I do not know what the practice or procedure has been in the past.  I am not very much influenced by whether that remedy has been in existence heretofore or not.  It seems manifest to me, however, that the only obligation we ought to put on any citizen is to take every reasonable precaution to avoid collusion in any fraud upon the Revenue Commissioners.  I think it must be manifest to the Minister that, in the matter of precautions, if you acquire a business, and this Financial Resolution becomes an Act of Parliament, you may find yourself liable.  I consider that that is not equitable or fair.  For that reason I cannot support the Minister in carrying this Financial Resolution into effect.  I think it places an unfair obligation on the citizens of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, sir, that the decision which is being given statutory effect in this resolution is the Wankie Colliery case.  I think the Minister will know that in that particular case there was a very considerable divergence of judicial views on the meaning of the section.  If he will look at the report of the case he will find that there was a very considerable divergence of views in England, in the House of Lords and, I think, in the Court of Appeal, on the question of the liability of the successor to the business.  It is not at all clear that the court in this country would have followed the decision in the Wankie Colliery case. It is a remarkable fact that although that case has been decided for a number of years a case has never been decided by these courts, except towards the end of 1931 there was a case which raised the point.  There was actually no authoritative decision on it <Col N="1938" /> so far as I am aware.  There is an aspect of the matter to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention. He has told us that a person who bought a business in 1927 would be liable for a default made in 1916, even if there had been a number of intervening changes of ownership, so that if a person was liable in 1916 to excess profits duty, and had sold his business to a person who had then sold it to another person, who sold it to still another person, the last person in possession of the business would, under this resolution, be legally liable for excess profits duty due by the original owner of the business.  Further, suppose in 1916 an assessment had been made on the owner of a business for excess profits duty, and the Revenue Commissioners had accepted his statement of accounts, had come to an agreement with him as to the amount of his assessment, and had given him his discharge, and he had subsequently sold his business to somebody else, the person to whom he had sold that business and who now owns it would be liable to have that assessment ripped open at the present moment under the provisions of this resolution.  That is a very serious state of affairs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon pointed out that when property is being bought the person who advises the purchaser raises requisitions of title, and by making the necessary enquiries can ascertain what are the liabilities which attach to the particular piece of property, and see that no unascertained liabilities are transferred to him.  Under this particular provision it is now made the law of this country that a person who bona fide purchased a business in 1921, before the Wankie Colliery decision was given&mdash;or whenever that decision was originally given&mdash;without any idea that he would be liable to the excess profits duty that may be owing or due by the owner of the business, now finds himself after a number of years liable to be assessed by the Revenue Commissioners. It seems to me that that will be liable to work a very great injustice and hardship.</P>

      <P>There is a point I mentioned earlier, that so far as this <Col N="1939" /> particular resolution is concerned it deals with more than the Acts of the Oireachtas, unless we take it that the Constitution in adopting the Acts that had been then in force made them Acts of the Oireachtas.  This Act was passed in the British Parliament in 1915.  There is apparently a question of doubt in connection with the use of the words &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo;, and we strengthen the claim in the year 1933 in respect of any taxes which the Government wishes to acquire by putting in words that were not in the original Act.  In so far as that is imposing a tax on profits that were earned within the last 18 years it is a change in the law, and with that change in the law all the rest stated by Deputy Costello and Deputy Dillon follows in much stronger measure than if this alteration were not made.  If each and every one of these assessments made in the meantime can be opened, where is the end going to be with regard to this?  The Minister mentioned this evening that this was following the practice that had been adopted over ten years. That is not a fair statement of the case, and the Minister ought to know it.  In the first place, the first Government of this State entered by agreement into possession of the right to collect those arrears, and it also entered into the liabilities which the British Government would have been called upon to discharge, and which we had to discharge&mdash;something like, I think, half or three-quarters of a million pounds that had to be paid back to people who had been over-assessed or something else in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act of 1926, which we have just disposed of, put an end both to the assessments and the repayments, except in regard to the undetermined cases and cases where there had been fraud or wilful neglect.  This certainly was not the intention of the Legislature at the time and it is not the intention of the Legislature at the time we have to consider; it is what they did, and what we have done.  The law as we have known it is now being altered, <Col N="1940" /> and it opens up a whole number of cases that have been closed and determined. Business people really have a right to know when those cases will be finally closed.  It is rather a pity that those three sections were not discussed at the one time, because they are all inter-related, and are part and parcel of the whole scheme. The scheme is being strengthened now in a way in which it has not been strengthened in the last ten years. People are being made liable now for duties to which they were not liable during that period.</P>

      <P>A very serious aspect of this particular tax assessment arises from the fact that, under the Excess Profits Duties Acts, when an assessment is made by the Revenue Commissioners the taxpayer before he can be heard on appeal against that assessment must pay within two months the amount of the assessment raised on him by the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners say to him: &ldquo;We assess you for £20,000 excess profits duty.  You must pay that £20,000 within two months.  After you have paid us that £20,000 we will listen to you and see whether you really are liable for that amount or not.&rdquo;  Under this particular resolution a person may find himself in the position that he has purchased a business not knowing that there is any liability for excess profits duty, and the Revenue Commissioners may come down on him and say: &ldquo;We assess you for £20,000, which you must pay within two months.  When you have paid it we will discuss whether you are liable or not.&rdquo;  That is a very serious aspect of this matter.</P>

      <P>I think possibly I ought to deal first with the last point which Deputy Costello has made.  It is quite true that a person who was <Col N="1941" /> assessed for excess profits duty must pay within two months, but he has the right of appeal before he pays.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon.  I am advised that the position is that he may appeal, and if his appeal is heard and decided in his favour before two months he does not have to pay. If the appeal is not heard before two months elapse, collection of the assessment is never enforced, so that he is in the same position.</P>

      <P>While the law does give the Revenue Commissioners power to collect the duty if the appeal has not been heard and determined within two months of the date of assessment, in fact the Revenue Commissioners never do collect the duty in that way when an appeal is pending.</P>
      <P>On the question that is involved here, for the last ten years since the Wankie case was decided in the House of Lords, the practice invariably has been to make the assessment on the owner of the business.  Section 26 makes it quite clear that the person to be assessed is the person who has been owner of a trade or business liable to excess profits duty which has not been assessed or insufficiently assessed.  In any case the business is liable to excess profits and the position always has been that the assessment was made on the person who was owner of the business at the time of the assessment.  That is in accordance with the Wankie decision. Deputy Costello has talked of the great wealth of legal opinion that went to form that decision and has said that there was a good deal of difference of opinion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What is the position? That that decision has never been challenged in these courts, that in view of the difference of opinion, in view of all the legal light which was shed on that decision, it should remain unchallenged in these courts for over ten years.  I suggest that the reason it remained unchallenged, notwithstanding the fact <Col N="1942" /> that there were people with considerable resources involved in these cases is because everybody has made up his mind that the decision was a sound one and that the law here in fact is as that decision lays it down to be.  That is that the person who is properly assessable for excess profits duty is the person who owns the business at the time at which the assessment is made.</P>

      <P>It has happened before now.  The position, therefore, is that we are only clarifying the law and making it quite clear that the judicial decision given in respect of the case in which proceedings were initiated in 1920, the decision given in March, 1922, before we took over the Revenue Service, has the force of law here.  That is what the Resolution purports to do.  It also goes a little further.  It proposes to give relief in cases such as Deputy Dillon has in mind, where a person takes over a business quite in good faith, not having the benefit of good advice and not being aware of the legal position. In that case the Revenue Commissioners, under the second part of the section, have the power to make an assessment on the original owner who owned the business at the time the profits accrued.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister undertake that the Revenue Commissioners will do that?  I am thinking of a case where they might discover the original owner of a business was no mark.  I would be rather afraid that then they would not allow their sense of justice to prevent their squeezing money out of some bona fide purchaser of the business.</P>

      <P>Of course, I cannot bind the Revenue Commissioners.  I want to make it quite clear that I have never tried to bind them or to influence them in any way to prevent <Col N="1943" /> their interpreting the law as they find it.  Anything I might say either in this House or elsewhere would not, I hope, influence them later in carrying out what is their duty under the law. At the same time I do not think the case is quite as hard as Deputy Dillon has represented it to be.  It seems to me that if the House passes the Resolution and makes the legal position clear, it will be open to any person who is going to purchase a business, a business which was in existence in the years 1914 to 1921, to ask the person who was owner of that to go to the Revenue Commissioners and bring from them some sort of proof or documentary evidence that in their opinion the business in not chargeable with excess profits duty at this date. That can be quite easily done.  A man purchasing a business will no doubt employ just as skilled a lawyer as he would to inquire into the title when he is purchasing a house, and no lawyer will take possession until he has a certificate that there is no liability for excess profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection I should like to make this point clear, that one of the difficulties in regard to the original position was that very often where the Revenue Commissioners had suspected there was fraud, they felt themselves precluded from making an assessment unless they had <Col N="1944" /> some tangible evidence that fraud existed.  In any of the cases covered by Resolution No. 14 or even by the original section of the 1926 Act, where evidence comes into their possession that fraud has been actually perpetrated on the Exchequer, they will reopen these cases.  As I said, I should like to make it quite clear that prior to 1932 the Commissioners acted strictly within the law in every case.  In fact one of the difficulties was, as I have said, that where statements were made to them without tangible evidence they would not proceed to make an assessment.  At any rate it seems to me that was an unsatisfactory position, and that is one of the reasons why I want to modify it.  To get back, I was saying that it was open to any person purchasing a business to ask the vendor to interview the Revenue Commissioners and to come back with some satisfactory assurance from them that the business would not be liable to excess profits duty.  If the purchaser in that case gets such an assurance from the Revenue Commissioners, then I take it the Revenue Commissioners, in view of what is contained in Part II of the Resolution would not, if they discovered fraud subsequently, proceed against him where he was actully the bona fide purchaser&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If judges vary in their judgment, in the lower courts, we could always say there is judicial opinion in support of an erroneous view of the law.

As we acted in accordance with that interpretation since 1923, we would be simply stultifying ourselves if we did anything else, and we would be stultifying the Revenue Commissioners and the Oireachtas. There is no question left; no one can criticise the matter and it has no retrospective aspect whatever.  The decision has never been challenged, and now we are putting it beyond challenge. I think where there was a bona fide purchase the person need have no fear in his mind when the Revenue Commissioners give him any sort of clearance that the subsequent owner of the property would be put to any trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be quite prepared to do so in a suitable case if they got proper evidence.  If there was no proper evidence forthcoming, it would be evidence to the purchaser that there must be some liability attaching to the property, so that he might arrange a purchase price that would indemnify him against loss in the contingency that that slight liability should become probable.  This provision is as much in the interest of those people who buy property in good faith as anyone else.  One of the things we wish to guard against is the transfer of property with the idea of defeating the revenue.  That is the reason why it is necessary to make the position unchallengeable. We do know the extraordinary extent to which it is possible to evade the duty.  In view of the concession given to people who paid taxes and who were liable to excess profit duties last year, and in view of the statement that that was to be accompanied by the strengthening of the law if necessary, and with the decision of the House Lords prevailing for ten years, and the fact that the revenue practice has always been in accordance with it, I think the House would stultify itself if it did not adopt that course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Financial Resolution No. 16.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Resolution is to enable excess profits duty to be assessed on executors of a deceased person who was liable to such duty. This is a logical consequence of the decision to collect excess profits duty in all cases where there is an unsatisfied liability.  If we are going to collect it from people who are alive there is no reason why we should not collect it from the estates of deceased persons. There is no reason, at any rate, why the heirs of persons who have defrauded the State during their lives should retain the proceeds.  The first paragraph of this Resolution provides for the making of assessments on executors accordingly.  On the other hand, it would not be just that an undue impediment should be placed in the way of executors winding up the estate, and under the second paragraph assessments to be made on executors must be made within a period of two years from the date on which they obtained probate.  In this connection, it is well to remind the House that in the case of income tax, assessments may be made on the executors of a deceased person within three years after the death occurred.  In cases in which a corrective affidavit is lodged, however, it is provided that the two years shall run from the date of the lodgment of such affidavit.  This is necessary in order to protect the revenue in cases in which the whole of the assets of the deceased were not disclosed in the original affidavit.</P>
      <P>This Resolution has no retrospective effect so far as executors are concerned, for paragraph 3 of the Resolution provides that the executor of a deceased person who died before the 11th day of May, 1933, shall not be charged with or assessable to excess profits duty by virtue of this Resolution if such executor or administrator has fully administered the estate and distributed the assets of such deceased person before the said 11th day of May, 1933.  In those cases no assessment can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fourth paragraph of the Resolution <Col N="1949" /> enables executors to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a certificate to the effect that there is no outstanding liability with regard to excess profits duty, and the issue of such a certificate will constitute a bar to any subsequent assessment save, as is provided in the fifth paragraph, in cases of fraud or failure to disclose material facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of this, I should like to know from the Minister is it quite clear, on the wording of this Resolution, that the liability of the executor or administrator to assessment for excess profits duty is limited to his capacity as executor or administrator, and only goes to the extent of the assets which come to his hands as personal representative of his deceased testate or intestate?  It would look, from a cursory reading of the Resolution, that it is capable of bearing the interpretation that an executor will be liable and liable not only in respect of the assets that come to his hands.  I would like to know if it is quite clear that, in the recovery of this excess profits duty, the only remedy available to the Revenue Commissioners will be such as will not operate <i>in personâ</i>, so that the personal representative of a deceased will not have the added terror of finding himself in jail because he has not sufficient assets to distribute to pay the excess profits duty.  Is it intended that paragraph 5 of the Resolution should operate to discharge not merely an executor as such, but the estate of the deceased?  Otherwise an executor might possibly find himself, on the certificate of the Revenue Commissioners, having subsequently to pursue the assets into the hands of a beneficiary under the will of the deceased, as in the Wankie Colliery Company case, or under the Resolution just passed.</P>

      <P>It is not clear to me that there is any doubt that an executor, under this Resolution, would only be liable to the same extent as the deceased person and is only liable in his capacity as an executor.  Even though he is personally liable, it is not <Col N="1950" /> clear to me that the first part of the Resolution could be so considered.</P>

      <P>With regard to paragraph 5 of the Resolution, could not some period of time be fixed?  Otherwise the distribution of an estate may be held up for a very long time.  This question of excess profits duty is a very considerable one where it interferes with business and with people engaged in commerce.  As the paragraph stands, an estate may be held up for years before distribution can take place.  In the course of the debate this evening the Minister mentioned quite a number of cases in which delay may occur.  I think this paragraph requires amendment to the effect that, failing the issue of a certificate, then, say, after a period of two years the estate may be wound up.</P>

      <P>We have the fullest sympathy for an executor.  If he comes along, places all his cards on the table and allows the Revenue Commissioners to do their duty, to satisfy themselves that there is no excess profits duty liable, then there is no reason why the certificate should be held up, and it will not be held up.</P>

      <P>We had it already this evening that a reopening of certain cases may occur.  These cases will take some considerable time.  I am not concerned with the executor in this case but I am concerned with the distribution of the assets.  It very often happens that people are in great need of the money and, as the sub-section stands, it may be held up for any length of time until a certificate is granted.  While the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to say that the delay has been occasioned by the executor, the executor may claim, on the other hand, that there is unreasonable delay on the part of the Revenue Commissioners, and it might go on for one, two or three years.  That is an unduly long period of time and I think some determination of the points ought to be arrived at within a reasonable period. There ought to be a time limit so as to enable the matter to be wound up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>There may be a claim of undue delay on the part of the Revenue Commissioners, but we had here a statement by a Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners dealt with every case expeditiously.  They are anxious to get in revenue and there will be no undue delay in dealing with the matter if they get the facilities the executor should afford them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The case that was mentioned was a case in respect of goods.  I am quite sure there is no unreasonable delay in any case.  But the difficulty, so far as the individual is concerned, in this case is that there is no limit of time with regard to the executor or the beneficiaries under the will.  I think some time ought to be fixed during which the matters in question ought to be determined one way or the other.  As it stands, an estate might never be wound up.  I do not say that such a thing has happened, but, as it stands, the Revenue Commissioners are entitled not to have a case determined, and, in those circumstances, the estate would be held up and the executor could not wind it up.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 18.&rdquo;  Section 50 of the Finance Act of 1932 imposed a stamp duty on the available surplus of every sweepstake held under the Public Charitable Hospitals (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1930.  If there had been no amending legislation, it was contemplated that the latter Act would have expired on the 1st July, 1934, and the operation of Section 50 of the Finance Act of 1932 would, <Col N="1955" /> accordingly, be limited in point of time.  A new measure, the Public Hospitals Bill, 1933, is at present before the Dáil with the object of repealing the earlier Act and replacing it by more permanent provisions.  It, therefore, becomes necessary to adapt Section 50 of the Finance Act of 1932 to enable stamp duty to be charged on the available surplus of sweeps to be held under the terms of the new Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot let this Resolution pass without protest, as the Minister knows.  The Minister's name has gone down to history as the first Government Minister who has placed a tax on the incomes of charitable institutions, such as hospitals, and, as I told him last year, that is not an enviable position for him to occupy.  I wonder if he has not seen the writing on the wall, because, when he brought forward his proposal a year ago, the Derby Sweep was at its peak, at the height of its popularity.  What has happened since? The Derby Sweep of the present year has fallen by nearly £1,000,000.  I am sure that the Minister would not take on himself the credit for having injured the sweepstake to that extent, but, at all events, that has happened.  Not only has the total amount received been lessened by over £900,000, but the amount going to the hospitals has been lessened by £221,000.  That is a great falling off for the hospitals and, as I say, I am wondering if the Minister has not seen the writing on the wall and has not made up his mind that it would be better for him, before he has destroyed the thing altogether, to drop this proposal. However, there is something to be said, of course, for his sticking to his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this time last year, how much money has been placed in the State Exchequer from the Hospitals' Fund?  No less a sum than £1,011,393. It would, therefore, be surprising if the Minister, even in spite of the appeals made to him, or in spite of the thought that he was going to wreck the whole business, were to give up the chance of making a little <Col N="1956" /> money, but I am amazed to hear him speak about pursuing poor people for £30,000 or £15,000, when he has collared within one year, from the time he started his retrospective legislation and went back to collect revenue on the Grand National Sweep of 1932, a sum of&mdash;let me repeat it&mdash; £1,011,393.  At this last moment, may I appeal to the Minister to consider whether it would not be advisable for him to drop this stamp duty on the charitable hospitals?  He may think that there is nothing in the suggestion I make that the institution of the stamp duty has done a great deal to injure the sweeps, but I say it with great confidence, because I have received, from great numbers of people, letters stating that they had refused to sell tickets or to have anything more to do with the sweeps because the Government was beginning to collect the money that should be going and which these people had subscribed to the hospitals.</P>
    <P>I repeat that I am not easily scared but I do think, and I told the Minister last year, that, as soon as the public knew that he was going to collar large amounts of money from the sweepstakes, they would cease to subscribe as they had subscribed before.  Might I ask him, therefore, to reconsider this.  I suppose he will not reconsider until he finds himself without anything to reconsider and until he finds himself eventually going very much behind hand so far as the amount he is receiving is concerned. What he has received, even from this Derby Sweep, is nothing to be ashamed of.  He has received £185,760.  That is an extraordinarily substantial sum to receive out of one sweep when one listens to the Minister's references to pursuing poor people and hunting them into jails because they had not paid excess profits duty for the last 11 or 12 years.  The Minister made one suggestion which, I think, was not worthy of him.  It is because I am not connected with the Party that I do not think he ought to have allowed himself to say it.  I do not think he ought to have allowed himself to connect the Cumann na nGaedheal <Col N="1957" /> Party with the dishonesty that he suggests. He suggested that there were people who are not paying excess profits duty, and I do not think he should have used the name of any Party.  I would have objected very strongly if he had suggested anything of the same nature in regard to anybody with whom I had any connection, but, strange to say, no Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy objected to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, in reply to Deputy Sir James Craig, that it is not possible for me to consider his suggestion.  We have the fact that the sum accruing to the State from the available surplus represents, as the Deputy himself admitted, a very substantial revenue which we are not in a position to forego.  I cannot for a moment accept his suggestion that the imposition of the stamp duty has been responsible for the decline in the sweepstakes.  None of us at any time expected that the sweepstakes would go on expanding in perpetuity.  All of us knew that a day would come when the sweepstakes would reach their zenith and begin to decline.  When in Opposition, I pointed out that, at best, the sweepstakes could only have a temporary popularity, that they would go the way of similar ventures in the past, that the well of optimistic gamblers was bound to dry up.  Apart altogether from that, a number of things&mdash;just as well known to Deputy Sir James Craig as to me&mdash;that occurred during the past year had, I believe, a much more detrimental effect on the sweepstake than anything done in this country.  It is not necessary for me to go into those matters now.  The Deputy is aware of them.  I think that he ought to bear that in mind when he is attaching blame where blame does not properly belong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, we have to take into consideration the depressed conditions which are more general and more severe elsewhere than they are here. The fact that unemployment has increased considerably in the countries from which the main revenue of the sweepstake is drawn would be a much <Col N="1958" /> more reasonable explanation of the falling-off in the receipts than the explanation which Deputy Sir James Craig has given to the House.  If there is increased unemployment in a country, naturally the people have not the wherewithal to gamble.  They have unemployment on a much larger scale in Great Britain, the United States and continental countries than we have here.  The fact that unemployment has not only not decreased but has increased in these countries goes a long way to explain the falling off in the popularity of the sweepstakes apart from any other considerations.  But there are other considerations to be borne in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>A little aspersion was cast upon me, or rather the Parliamentary Secretary was priding himself, apparently, when he said that I had not been consulted with regard to this measure.  I am very glad I was not consulted, because I certainly could not have agreed to the proposals put forward.  What he said was that instead of consulting me he had taken the opposite course of consulting the committee representing the various hospitals that came under the sweeps. The Parliamentary Secretary proceeded to say that the Hospitals Committee was perfectly satisfied with the Bill.  The House will be rather amazed and amused when it hears that every amendment, except one, standing in my name, was sent to me by the Hospitals Committee. They were sent to me and I was asked to move them on behalf of the Hospitals Committee, although the Parliamentary Secretary said in this House that the Committee was perfectly satisfied with the provisions of the Bill.  When the original Bill was brought in, the money was to be for the benefit of voluntary hospitals. Under an amending Bill the available surplus was divided, two-thirds being for charitable hospitals, and one-third for country hospitals.  According to the present Bill the Government has gone back upon the provision to divide the money and is putting it into a single fund.  That is what the Hospitals Committee <Col N="1962" /> objects to most strenuously, and so do I, because this unified fund is to be placed under the control of the Minister for Local Government and he can do what he likes with it. He need not give a single penny to the voluntary hospitals, unless he likes to do so.  That has raised a great deal of suspicion, and a great deal of fear, in the minds of those connected with the hospitals.  That is why the amendments are moved.  The House will see why the amendments put forward by the Hospitals Committee are necessary.  Those representing the various hospitals have great fears that the voluntary hospitals may be left out in the cold, seeing that there is no provision in the Bill that they are to get any money, unless the Minister likes to give it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sir James Craig, apparently, is determined to continue on the lines adopted since this Bill was introduced, and as far as it rests with him, at any rate, to develop the atmosphere of suspicion that surrounds the Bill, its intentions, and the likely results, should this Bill become law.  I presume, if he persists until the Bill is passed, we must only hope that the people most intimately concerned will become assured that there is no foundation whatever for the atmosphere of suspicion that certain Deputies are endeavouring to create. As I stated more that once during the discussions on this Bill, the one intention in the minds of the promoters is to secure that the best possible results, in the matter of hospitalisation and equipment, will be made available to the poor, as a result of the financial opportunity that the sweepstakes offer. Even Deputy Sir James Craig will, I think, admit that the division into the proportion of two-thirds to the voluntary hospitals, and one-third to be placed at the disposal of the poor law authorities, was purely an arbitrary division.  We have nothing to guide us, at the moment, in making up our minds whether the one-third or the two-thirds will give the best possible results.  It will be some considerable time before the Hospitals <Col N="1963" /> Commission can report.  All Deputies are agreed that they are undertaking a very difficult, complicated and delicate task, and if it is 12 or 18 months before the Commission can report, if we were to divide the two-thirds and one-third proportions of the moneys available, we might be holding up schemes ready for operation by local authorities, while the moneys are lying idle.</P>
      <P>Many of these schemes&mdash;extensions of mental hospitals, the provision of fever hospitals and the provision or extension of county and district hospitals&mdash;are ready to be put into operation and the only thing that is holding them back is waiting on the allocation from the Hospitals Sweepstakes Fund of a proportion of the cost.  These schemes will require little or no examination from the Commission inasmuch as they have been examined already in detail and reported on by the expert advisers in the Local Government Department.  I would like to hear some members of public bodies on the opposite benches who frequently come to the Local Government Department pressing for the immediate allocation of money to help to finance schemes that are about to be put into operation. They have never yet accused me, in so far as I have any responsibility for the distribution of this money, of being over-generous or disbursing money without the most careful consideration of the proposals about to be carried out.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sir James Craig need not have anxiety about the fate of the voluntary hospitals.  It ought to be remembered that we are extending the period of operation of sweepstakes in order that sufficient money will be made available to solve our hospital problem entirely. In the ordinary course the sweepstakes law would have ceased to operate this year, but we are extending the period indefinitely in order that if the sweepstakes continue to be successful there will be sufficient money available to solve the problem of the voluntary hospitals as well as the institutions run by poor law authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we accept this amendment <Col N="1964" /> it will mean that schemes now ready for operation will have to be held up, schemes that local authorities are anxious to carry out and cannot, because there is no money at the moment available. The problem of the local authorities may be solved in the course of twelve or eighteen months and the entire proceeds from the sweepstakes would then be available for the voluntary hospitals. I find it hard to understand why Deputy Sir James Craig waxes so hot and eloquent on this question.  If he approaches the matter in a reasonable frame of mind he ought to admit that the amendment, instead of advancing the hospital schemes, will have the effect of holding up schemes that, with very little further examination, could be put into operation the moment we have the money available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess the Parliamentary Secretary's reply is, to me, very unsatisfying. The Parliamentary Secretary, if he wished to make a case on the lines on which he was endeavouring to make one, might have come here with specific facts and figures.  There is available for local bodies a very considerable sum.  That sum will be augmented this week out of the Derby Sweep.  If it is not augmented this week, it will be in the immediate future by a sum of something over £300,000.  Why does the Parliamentary Secretary not tell us how much money is wanted at present for schemes ripe for completion and which could not be financed out of the money he has already received, out of the money he is going to receive in the immediate future, and also out of one-third of the total sum devoted to hospitals which he will receive from the Cambridgeshire this year?  It seems to me that the sweeps were started for the voluntary hospitals and that should be kept in mind.  This is a continuation of sweepstakes which were justified by this House because they were helping voluntary hospitals that could not receive adequate help from persons outside.  Just as all the past money was primarily theirs, under the whole of this scheme the voluntary hospitals <Col N="1965" /> ought to be the owners of the larger share of this money.</P>

We know the needs of the poor and we know the conditions in local hospitals where they have to try to carry on under very tough conditions. Local bodies have been totally unable to provide properly for the poor.  The strain on the ratepayers would be entirely too heavy to provide what should in decency be provided for the poor.  Deputies are aware that many schemes are ready and are merely awaiting the money.  I have a very decided objection to Deputy Sir James Craig or anybody else interfering with these schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the voluntary hospitals are so badly off for immediate relief as Deputy Sir James Craig said.  I noticed in the public Press last week that one of the Cork voluntary hospitals invested a large amount of their surplus money in British securities.  National Loan is not good enough for them at all now. I suggest to the Minister that when he is advancing any further moneys he should give it in the form of Irish <Col N="1966" /> securities or Irish bonds.  The Parliamentary Secretary says we could not accuse him of being over generous. We accuse him of not being generous enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are anxious to get £200,000 for poor law hospitals and mental hospitals in Cork county.  The local bodies have to contribute something like £66,000 in that connection. With these conditions there will be a rather severe strain on the ratepayers. I suggest if the Minister has any money to spare, that instead of giving it to the voluntary hospitals to invest in British securities, he should relieve the ratepayers a little further and be more generous towards the local bodies. Undoubtedly some relief is needed for the local bodies to enable them to put the county hospitals and the district hospitals into a fit position so that the poor will be properly cared for and provided with the proper necessaries in these hospitals when they have to go there.  Such relief is long overdue.  I for one am glad that the Minister is speaking out and not giving way to those very strange proposals that we had from the Opposition to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say one or two words.  As I already told the Parliamentary Secretary, I was not the author of this amendment.  The amendment came to me from the Hospitals' Committee&mdash;from the gentlemen who are representing the hospitals in connection with it.  They briefed me on the very lines I have stated here, namely, that they were afraid that as no part of the money was ear-marked for voluntary hospitals the county hospitals might be badly treated.  That fear and that suspicion came from the Hospitals' Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other thing to which I ought to refer.  The Parliamentary Secretary on the last occasion said that there was a great deal of reorganisation required in the hospitals here in Dublin.  I think he used the expression that they were in a chaotic condition. I want to deny that.  I think I am in a position to state what is the condition <Col N="1967" /> of the general hospitals in Dublin.  I think I am in a very much better position to state what their condition is than is the Parliamentary Secretary.  I examine them for various bodies.  There is not a hospital that I do not visit in my capacity as examiner and I am satisfied that the poor are well treated and, as far as the main hospitals are concerned, they are kept in a most excellent condition.  As far as the teaching goes I do not think there is as good teaching anywhere as the students and nurses get in Dublin. I want to say that it would be a poor thing for people to get it into their minds that the hospitals here in Dublin are in a chaotic condition.  Their teaching is good, their nursing is good, the poor are looked after excellently and the hospitals are kept in good condition.  I admit that there is no research work.  I agree with the suggestion made about research work.</P>
    <P>I do not want Deputy Corry to get it into his head that I am in any way opposed to the money going to the local hospitals.  I want to see every hospital well provided and I have said so on every occasion, even when fighting about the proportion of money to be given to the county hospitals. On that occasion I said I wanted to see those hospitals put into a good position and the patients made comfortable as far as the nursing is concerned. I want again to say, following the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks, that the fear I entertained with regard to the Bill and the suspicion I entertained are not my own but that they are the suspicions and fears engendered by the Hospitals' Committee.  Those amendments would not be handed in by me were it not that I was urged by the Hospitals' Committee to do so.  The only amendment put down by me on my own was that the sweepstakes would end five years from now.</P>

      <P>Possibly, but it is to his type of mind that the Government is drifting.  Owing to the powers elsewhere in this Bill I think it is necessary that a certain proportion of the money should be set aside for voluntary hospitals.  That is what is sought for by the amendments.  There is no interference with the other hospitals.  This is only a last moment effort to save some shred of authority to the voluntary hospitals.</P>

      <P>In reply to the point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to stress one matter and that is that the hospitals that have refused to co-operate with the Government at present and that also refused during the period of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government to co-operate in the matter of taking girls from the Gaeltacht as probationers should be made do so.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see that these <Col N="1969" /> hospitals should be compelled to co-operate in the scheme set up by the late Government and continued by the present Government in that matter of girls from the Gaeltacht.  At that period a certain sum was set aside for the training of the girls to whom I have referred.  The matrons of the hospitals in Dublin refused to co-operate with both Governments.  The only hospital that did co-operate was the Richmond Hospital.  I would go so far as to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see that those hospitals that still continue to refuse to co-operate to make this scheme for the Gaeltacht girls a success should not receive the consideration that they would receive in ordinary circumstances.  By that scheme it was intended that girls from the Gaeltacht would get hospital training. That scheme was started two or three years ago and the promise was made again last year, but the matrons of the hospitals have refused to co-operate.</P>

      <P>The section, as it stands, directs the trustees to invest the capital of the Trust Fund, so far as it is not required for the time being for making disbursements, in trustee securities or securities authorised by the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, I am sure, is very conversant with the law concerning trust funds and the Trustee Act. Where the instrument creating the trust does not give express directions as to the investment, the law assists by giving a list of investments in which property may with safety be invested. The principal list is contained in the Trustee Act of 1893.  This list was made up some 40 years ago, and I think even Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney would hold that the list is in need of revision. In 1931 the question was under discussion in the Dáil and Deputy Little then pointed out that the list should be amended as there were a number of securities mentioned as trustee securities which no same trustee would invest in, and there were other securities that might be properly included. On that occasion, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said: &ldquo;As far as Deputy Little's point is concerned about trustee securities and the revision of the list of trustee securities, I agree with him that it is a matter to be inquired into, as a certain revision is no doubt necessary.&rdquo; Judging by the expressions of opinion from all sides of the House in 1931, one would think that there would be general agreement now that the trustee list of securities should be brought up to date and that the list does not afford sufficient guidance to trustees at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> The second part of the section is intended to give the trustees a wider discretion subject to the safeguards mentioned.  It is understood that the Department of Finance have under consideration an amendment of the Trustee Act and that the matter is in a fairly advanced stage.  In these circumstances, the power given under the second part of the section may never be put into operation.  At the same time, I think, there cannot be any great objection, in view of the views expressed already by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, to giving the wider discretion for investments than the terms of the original section provided.</P>

Well and good, let it be revised, but let the National Hospital Trustees be in the same position as every other sets of trustees.  He says that actually at present revision is under contemplation and should be carried through.  Even if it is, that is all the more reason why these particular words which allow the Minister to invest in any single class of security he likes, no matter what its nature is, should come out.  Let the National Hospital Trustees stand in the same position as all other trustees, only able to invest in proper trustee securities.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (4), page 11, to delete lines 4 and 5 and substitute the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;save if and in so far as is otherwise directed by the Minister, be added to and form part of the capital of the said fund as from the receipt thereof by the said trustees.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Under the new sub-section (2) of Section 24 the Minister may make a grant out of capital to the Hospitals' Trust Fund, or out of the income, or he may direct a portion of the capital to be set aside for the purpose of securing an annual grant.  The amendment proposed in this section is consequential on this power.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (5), I think, is bringing in a very bad new principle, that the National Hospital Trustees, though they are not to solicit contributions to the Hospitals' Trust Fund, may start getting collections.  I think that is an endeavour to prevent voluntary subscriptions from the charitable public going direct to the hospitals.  It is an endeavour to intercept them and I think it is a very bad principle.</P>

There is a feeling&mdash;whether it is one of those peculiar feelings that I am supposed to entertain or not&mdash; that this is a means of intercepting ordinary voluntary subscriptions that <Col N="1973" /> would be going to the hospitals.  I do not know whether there is much substance in it or not, but that is what is felt.  I am supporting the amendment very strongly.</P>

      <P>Sometimes the Deputy can be clear enough, but at other times he is extremely dense.  There may be a method in it.  He complains that, if the amendment is not accepted, voluntary contributions may pass through the Hospital Trustees, but, as a matter of actual fact, the section as it stands lays down that it shall not be lawful for the National Hospital Trustees to solicit subscriptions to the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  It appears to me, at any rate, that it is not the function of the National Hospital Trustees to solicit subscriptions.</P>

      <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Minister may at any time, either on his own motion or in consequence of an application to him under this Act, make to any hospital or nursing organisation in Saorstát Eireann a grant out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund of such amount and for such purposes authorised by this section as the Minister shall think proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Whenever the Minister determines to make under this section a <Col N="1975" /> grant out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund he shall direct the National Hospital Trustees to pay such grant out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund and thereupon the said trustees shall pay the amount of such grant out of the said fund to such person and at such time or times as the Minister so directs.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever the Minister makes under this section a grant out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund to a hospital or a nursing organisation, he shall specify the purposes for which such grant is to be expended and may attach to the receipt of such grant such conditions (whether to be performed before or after such receipt) as he thinks proper for securing the due expenditure of such grant on the purposes specified by the Minister or for securing or attaining any other object.</P>
    <P>(4)  Grants may be made under this section by the Minister out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund for expenditure on any of the following purposes, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the purchase of buildings, including a site for new buildings and also including any superior or outstanding estate or interest in land or buildings belonging to the grantee;</P>
    <P>(b)  the construction of new buildings;</P>
    <P>(c)  the reconstruction, extension, alteration, or improvement of buildings belonging to the grantee;</P>
    <P>(d)  the purchase of hospital, nursing, and other equipment;</P>
    <P>(e)  the endowment of the grantee or any part of the activities of the grantee, including, in the case of a hospital, the endowment of a bed or beds in the hospital;</P>
    <P>(f)  the discharge of the debts or any particular debt or debts owed by the grantee, including debts incurred for the past maintenance of the grantee.</P>
    <P>(5)  No grant out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund shall be made or applied <Col N="1976" /> for or towards the future maintenance of the grantee.</P>
    <P>(6)  In this section&mdash; the expression &ldquo;the grantee&rdquo; means the hospital or organisation to whom a grant out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund is made under this section; the word &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; means ordinary day-to-day support and upkeep properly chargeable to income;</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 37, to delete the words &ldquo;either on his own motion or&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to prevent the Minister, without consultation with anybody, handing out the money as he likes.  When an application is made to him under the Act by any of the promoting hospitals he is bound to refer the matter to the Hospitals' Commission and to get their report, but under this section, if it remains unamended by taking out the words which I propose to take out, the Minister, without any application from the hospitals, and, therefore, without any consultation at all with the Hospitals' Commission, can proceed to divide out this money.  I submit to the House that that is a wrong principle. If the Hospitals' Commission is to be set up, and is to be consulted&mdash; as I think it is right that they, or a body of experts, at any rate, should be consulted&mdash;before the money is distributed when an application is made for a grant by any participating hospital, it ought to be exactly the same principle when the Minister gives it out himself.  Therefore, I submit, that the Minister should not be allowed to distribute any money except in consequence of an application.</P>

      <P>It ought to be remembered in relation to this section that <Col N="1977" /> the definition of &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; covers not only voluntary hospitals but also poor law hospitals.  In respect of the poor law hospitals and district mental hospitals the Minister stands in a special relation.  Where the Minister, through his professional and technical advisers, has become acquainted with the circumstances of a particular institution or area, it would be altogether superfluous to have the work of investigation done all over again by the Hospitals' Commission. It is principally for that reason that provision is made for the Minister to make grants without going through what would be the normal procedure of referring each case and each application to the Hospitals' Commission. If the amendment were accepted the Minister would have to wait passively for applications even from local authorities, and he could not institute schemes for Hospitalisation under the local authorities particularly. Again, it may be necessary to give grants or to make allocations, on the Minister's own motion, for experimental work or in connection with financing particular branches of research.  I am advised, at any rate, by the legal advisers to the Minister that in order that he may be in a position to do those things it is necessary to retain the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary here again is, I know&mdash;and I think the whole House must know&mdash;impervious to any argument of any kind.  He has made up his mind that he is not going to listen or pay any attention.  He is simply going through this Bill like a bull charging at a gate.  The power which the Minister is taking is not in the case of district hospitals or the hospitals under the control of the local authorities.  He is taking it in respect of every single hospital.  He can, without consultation with any single living person, out of his own motion, pay out a sum of several million pounds to any particular voluntary hospitals that he likes.  That is how the Bill stands at the present moment.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 40-41, to delete the words &ldquo;authorised by this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is part of general recasting of the section, which has been done since the Second Reading debate.  In the course of that debate several Deputies expressed apprehension as to the working of sub-section (5), which barred grants towards future maintenance.  It has already been explained that this sub-section merely continues what was contained in the Act of 1931 as provided in Section 6 (2) (b), that the sweepstakes should be in addition to, and not in substitution for, moneys spent by local authorities on ordinary maintenance.  The section as it stands provides for endowment, the income of which can, of course, be applied for maintenance and it provides for the payment of debts.  If we add to these grants for future maintenance, then all possible purposes will be exhausted and it is scarcely necessary to preserve sub-section (4).  It is therefore proposed to delete sub-section (4), which relates to various authorised purposes.  The three words in sub-section (1), &ldquo;authorised by this section,&rdquo; should, therefore, also be deleted.  The Minister shall make a grant for such purposes as he may think proper on the report of the Hospitals' Commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> In page 11 before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2) A grant made out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund under this section may, as the Minister shall in each case think proper, be in the form of a sum to be paid out of the capital of the Hospitals' Trust Fund or in the form of payments to be made annually, for such period as the Minister shall direct, out of the income of the Hospitals' Trust Fund and the National Hospital Trustees shall if so directed by the Minister set aside a portion of the capital of the Hospitals' Trust Fund and invest such portion for the purpose of securing any grant made in the form of payments to be made annually.</P>
    <P>This new sub-section specifies the various forms in which grants may be made.  That is, they may be made in the form of capital sums such as would be required for the erection of building, furnishing, equipment, etc.  They may be made in annual payments such as may be required for experimental purposes, or they may be endowments which would provide an income for permanent services such as the endowment of beds.  With grants in these forms every possible claim for assistance can be met while the Hospitals' Fund has money at its disposal.</P>

      <P>Yes.  In addition to these amendments I also desire formally to move amendment 38 which I think goes with them.  The amendment is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (6), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In making a grant out of the Hospitals' Fund to any hospital the Minister shall have regard to the amount of benefit conferred upon the sick poor by the said hospital and may make it a condition of every grant to a hospital that the said hospital shall make available for the sick poor a certain proportion, in all the circumstances reasonable, of the beds therein contained either free of all charge or at a charge not exceeding ten shillings per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands at present the Minister may make any kind of conditions that he likes to secure any single object in connection with the management of the hospitals, At the present moment if he does not like the matron of the hospital, or whoever may be the visiting physician, he may make it a term that they should be removed, or that the offices of surgeon or medical visitors to the hospital, all these honorary posts, should be filled by nominees of his own.  That is a power which the Minister should not have. As a matter of fact, in my opinion the less interference there is in the management of the voluntary hospitals the better.  The voluntary hospitals that have been built up by subscriptions of the charitable public of many generations, should not now be taken over by the Minister.  My suggestion is that the Minister shall not be able to make any terms except what he is allowed by this section definitely, that he can make terms which shall secure the expenditure of such grant on the purposes specified, and also, if my amendment <Col N="1981" /> is accepted, that he shall make no other condition except as is hereinafter provided.  What is provided hereinafter is set out in amendment No. 38.  That is carrying on the old principles which were enshrined in the previous Bills.  Except that the Minister shall have power to see the sick poor are looked after in the hospitals, he shall not and ought not have any control over the hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney seems to think that if the Minister is given any powers at all, under this Bill, it can with safety be assumed that he is going to abuse them.  I do not think there is any likelihood that the Minister will do any of the foolish things which the Deputy has mentioned.  The Deputy should remember that when he was Minister he took very drastic and terrible powers from time to time.  Some people may say he abused some of those powers; at the same time he did not go as far as he might.  I certainly feel there is no danger that the powers the Minister has taken, under the Fianna Fáil administration, which will last until the hospitals' problem has been solved, will be abused.  If the Minister makes a grant he has to specify the purpose of that grant. Thus, if it is a grant to buy a site, to erect a new building, to pay off an overdraft, or to invest the proceeds to produce an income, or to pay the day to day maintenance of the hospitals and so on, he can attach conditions to secure the due expenditure of the grant for the purposes specified.  For instance in the case of a grant for building, he may require the plans, specifications and contract to be submitted to him for approval.  In the case of local authorities that would be almost the invariable condition.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage of the Bill Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that while from the earlier Acts the safeguards for the sick poor had been taken out, not a single safeguard had been put in.  Here is the very safeguard that has been put in for attaining the purpose that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney proclaims he is most anxious to secure.</P>

If we deleted the words that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney proposes should be deleted we would not be able to attach the conditions to the grant necessary to be attached in order to ensure that these beds will be apportioned.

      <P>I am not one bit afraid that the Minister is going to do any of the terrible things envisaged by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, but I think the discussion on amendment 38 might well be availed of by the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate what the policy of the Minister is in regard to the provisions suggested and to declare to what extent the Parliamentary Secretary intends that the policy of the Minister would go in this matter. Would he be in the position to say if his policy in regard to compelling the hospitals to make provision for the poor would take the shape of reserving 25 per cent. of the beds for the poor? Is he prepared to go so far, or would he be prepared to go farther?  I think it would help to clear up any doubts that exist on that matter if the Parliamentary Secretary could see his way to let a little further light in upon that subject.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is quite inconsistent in this matter.  He talks about taking away provisions previously inserted.  As a matter of fact, in two or three of the Acts carried in this House the provisions that he tries to insert now in this Bill were not inserted.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon. One Cork City hospital is a notable example of what I say.  The fact that such a provision was omitted led to a scandalous abuse in connection with that same hospital.  The fact that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is now asking to have inserted something that he failed to insert when his Bills were passing through this House, is no tribute to him.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will make provision that these things are made hard and fast. No matter how careful he may be the tendency in certain hospitals is, and will be, to evade responsibility in this matter.  I greatly regret it.  This matter was discussed before in this House when Deputy Norton and myself were responsible for a Bill that sought to check these things.  In one hospital to which a substantial sum of money has been paid I know that not one nonpaying <Col N="1984" /> patient was admitted, not one patient who could afford to pay only 10/- a week, and no case was admitted except of persons paid for at the full rate by the Board of Health or by private people.  The fact that this Bill proposes to check that makes it very acceptable to me and to everybody conversant with the facts, or intimate with the want of proper hospital accommodation in various parts of the country. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will indicate as definitely as he can to what extent he intends to make provision for the poor in return for the generous assistance the hospitals are going to get.</P>

      <P>When the first Hospitals Bill was before this House and being examined by the Committee set up to examine it, one of the provisions that the Committee thought most essential in the Bill was a provision that a certain proportion of the beds in the hospitals should be available for the poor.  That was enshrined in the original Bill.  The Minister has cut that provision out of the amending Bill.  I do not pretend to be a lawyer but I do not see any difficulty about reinserting the provision that was in the original Bill.  If the Minister's legal advisers advised him to the contrary I can even assume that their ability can provide means to insert in plain language what was thought to be necessary in the original Bill and what appears to be still necessary, according to the assertion made by Deputy Murphy.  If Deputy Murphy's assertions are true&mdash;and from my experience as a member of the Hospitals' Committee I am loath to believe that they are true&mdash;but if the Deputy's assertions are true there is all the more reason for the acceptance of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's amendment, which points out the necessity to make it incumbent on every hospital receiving these funds to provide a certain proportion of its available accommodation in beds for the sick poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, a certain proportion. We are leaving something to the discretion of the Minister.  I would have preferred the exact proportion to be down in figures and perhaps the <Col N="1986" /> Minister would adopt that course.  I am merely arguing for the principle of the thing.  The Parliamentary Secretary argues that he can bring about this in another way.  Perhaps he can. But the Committee that considered the Bill originally thought it was necessary that it should be definitely set down in the Bill, in black and white, that a certain proportion of the beds should be available for the sick poor.  Deputy Murphy's speech is in itself an argument for Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's amendment.  Perhaps it is a better argument than we can make here&mdash; that is, if what Deputy Murphy alleges actually happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, you did not. This amendment is an attempt to put back in the Bill the one and only absolute safeguard to provide what is <Col N="1987" /> necessary in the way of relief for the sick poor in regard to the proportion of beds.  The Parliamentary Secretary said, I think, that the remote object of the grant was to provide for the poor.  If he says that the remote object of it is such-and-such I do not know what his intentions are.  I should say that the immediate object should be to make provision for the sick and needy poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain&mdash;I suppose it is foolish to bother trying to explain to the Deputy&mdash;the immediate purpose at the time of the allocation was to provide for buildings; the remote purpose was to provide free beds for the poor.  I think it will be agreed that it is necessary to provide the buildings before you can provide the beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the intentions in the Bill was to provide buildings and equip existing buildings in a better way.  That was one of the immediate objects.  But it was never an object of the Bill that it was to be in the remote distance that a certain proportion of beds was to be available for the sick and needy poor.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that the remote object was the provision of beds for the sick poor.  I say that that should be the immediate object. I, certainly, whole-heartedly support Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's amendment. It was supported by the Labour representative, Deputy Murphy, perhaps indirectly, but certainly more forcibly than I supported it and I hope the House will press for the reinsertion of this provision in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This again raises the thing in which I was particularly interested in this Bill&mdash;what is being done under the cloak of providing for the sick poor which is more definitely provided for by the amendment than by the section in the Bill as it stands. Under that pretence and under that banner we have an attack, so far as principle is concerned&mdash;and that is what mainly interests me&mdash;on the voluntary system.  For that reason I would ask the House to consider and support Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's <Col N="1988" /> amendment.  Supposing what Deputy Murphy has said is true, what does it prove?&mdash;that a certain power was given in the late Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but that it was not in the late Bill at all.  With regard to one city hospital in Cork, when I confronted the hospital with what I have already mentioned, they pointed to the Bill and said there was no obligation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section, as it stands now, does not deal with the point raised by Deputy Murphy.  It does not make any definite provision in connection with the sick poor.  Supposing that is what is aimed at and that there are other powers which the Minister wants, why not provide for these powers?  It is said that he is not going to utilise the immense powers that are given, but I suggest that there is a principle at stake and that if he is not going to utilise them the House ought to be very slow to assent to that principle.  There are very few voluntary institutions left in this country.</P>
      <P>Voluntary institutions so far, for instance, as education and hospitals are concerned, are things that some people attach great importance to. The voluntary principle is something that people attach great importance to. I suggest that, without adequate reason, that whole position so far as it can be done by legislation, ought not to be undermined.  If there is any fault to be found with the actual drafting of the amendment the way to meet that is the way that amendments have always been met in this House, namely, that the principle of it be accepted, and then have it re-drafted to get what exactly is aimed at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as one can see, the amendment itself seems perfectly clear.  The Minister has met that by saying that his legal advisers assure him that it will not have the effect of carrying out what is its obvious purpose.  In that case I suggest that the ordinary line that has been pursued on the Committee Stage in the House is not to find verbal fault with the amendment, but to accept the principle of it and have it redrafted to carry out the intention.  If there is full agreement <Col N="1989" /> that, in certain matters where money out of the Sweeps Fund is being given, the Minister should lay down certain conditions, I suggest that those conditions ought to be defined, and that the vague power in the Bill as it stands should not be given to the Minister. The House, I suggest, would be doing a very dangerous thing in assenting to that principle.  That is mainly the reason why I rose to speak on this.  It seems to me that there is a very big principle involved.  It is a principle, as I have said, that a large number of people in this country are passionately attached to.  That principle seems to me to be endangered by this Bill as the section now stands.  Verbal attacks on the amendment, whether justified or unjustified, do not meet that particular case.</P>

      <P>The principle of voluntary institutions not being unduly interfered with by the Government, a principle that I stood very strongly for when I was Minister for Education.  I know perfectly well that there are many people who are quite as strongly attached to that principle so far as the hospitals are concerned. The tendency of the State is to interfere more and more with voluntary institutions.  I think that this House, in the position that we are in, having the traditions that we have, should hesitate very much before it gives any such power into the hands of a Minister.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy O'Sullivan to get his point of view. I appreciate the point of view that he expressed, but I say that the hospitals are no longer voluntary hospitals as they were before the original Sweepstakes Bill was introduced.  That being the case, I say that where legislation is providing the means for their existence and continuance and when we take into account the position they have arrived at to-day, the position is altogether different to what it was some years ago.  When the original Bill was introduced I remember well Deputy Sir James Craig referring to a certain voluntary hospital which had an overdraft of £5,000.  Under the various sweeps that have been held that hospital has now received something in the neighbourhood of £150,000. I would agree with Deputy O'Sullivan's point of view if the returns from the sweeps were very much smaller and if the people who were running the hospitals did not point to the fact that voluntary support for them had now ceased because of the sweeps.  I would like to hear Deputy O'Sullivan explain, if he is really convinced as to his point of view, the principle of voluntary hospitals in view of the present situation.</P>

      <P>Very good. That is precisely what I am arguing against: that the voluntary system has not ceased to exist.  The voluntary system does not cease to exist merely because the money comes from the sweepstakes.  The interference with the voluntary system is interference by Governmental authority.  If the House will bear in mind what Deputy Briscoe has said they will be able to appreciate whether or not the fears that we have given expression to are or are not justified, namely, that the justification for backing up this particular section is that the voluntary hospital is already dead.</P>

      <P>This is not State money&mdash;nothing of the kind.  May I say that the point of view that Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Briscoe are so fully in accord with strikes at the very foundation of our whole scholastic system in this country for which nearly all the money comes from the taxes.  It does away with the whole thing.  If Deputy MacDermot would really try to grasp how much some people are attached to this voluntary system he would understand what is at stake.  It is quite obvious that neither Deputy Briscoe nor Deputy MacDermot does understand. I was not amazed to hear Deputy Briscoe say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to Deputy MacDermot's exposition which revealed a complete failure to understand what this country struggled for for a couple of generations and has attained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy argued that the State was now getting into the management of voluntary hospitals and that this was the forerunner of interference in educational affairs.  I want to say that I agree entirely with what Deputy MacDermot has said.  We all know from experience the struggle the voluntary hospitals had to carry on under the voluntary system.  There is to be no interference with them now so far as their internal management is concerned.  The State is introducing legislation to enable these voluntary hospitals to be put on a better basis, and as far as I can understand it is reserving to itself the right to see that the money raised under its legislation is wisely spent: that it will do all the good that it is possible for it to do for the persons it is intended to serve, namely, the sick poor.</P>
      <P>When the original Bill was introduced, the amount of debt in the case of every hospital and the number of years of its struggles were stated and, in every case, the point was made of the number of sick poor attended by these hospitals.  I do not say that they were exaggerating.  I can only speak for the City of Dublin; but I appreciate, from my own little knowledge of the matter, that they made great efforts notwithstanding all their difficulties, but, since they received these tremendous sums, I must confess they have not improved on their previous generosity to the sick poor.  I was amazed at the amount of attention being given to certain structural alterations and to certain internal improvements while, at the same time, there was a neglect, and an almost complete neglect, in some cases, of extending the charity they had been so proudly boasting of in the past to the sick poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had no intention of intervening <Col N="1993" /> in the debate, but I was anxious to see the point of view the Opposition were developing, and it was only when Deputy O'Sullivan spoke that I got a clear view of what the arguments were being based on.  I maintain that where the State is legislating, as Deputy MacDermot has pointed out, in simple and plain language, with a view to putting the hospitals in a much better position than they had ever hoped or dreamt of being in, the State should have the right to interfere to ensure that the money is being spent in giving service to the sick poor.  I want to go a point further. My own personal point of view is this &mdash;and I expressed it on a former occasion&mdash;I should like to see hospitals run by the State rather than on a voluntary basis.  I would prefer to see State management of these institutions because I believe that you would have a far better system in this country than you have at present with far better service for the sick poor.  I believe it would be a far better system in view of the fact that we have talked so much of the sweeps being for the benefit of the sick poor, while, as it has turned out, a great deal could be done that has not been done.  I say that the Minister is quite right in taking to himself the right to examine and, where he sees it may be necessary to intervene, I think he should intervene and should make his conditions when awarding the various proportions to the particular hospitals.</P>
    <P>As I said before, I cannot accept the statement of Deputy O'Sullivan that the hospitals to-day can call themselves voluntary hospitals.  They are absolutely dependent to-day&mdash;let us face the situation&mdash;on the position created by the introduction of this method of raising funds.  I do not say that I ever accepted this system as a proper system but, nevertheless, the position is there and you have no longer voluntary hospitals as Deputy O'Sullivan understood them, or as we knew them to be.  They are to-day State aided hospitals.  It does not matter where the money comes from. It all boils down to this&mdash;it is through the legislation of this State that their income comes and they are dependent <Col N="1994" /> on that income so long as the State chooses to re-enact legislation to continue this means of raising these funds I say the State has a great responsibility and not only at the present time.  I visualise a time when our hospitals will be properly equipped and when there will no longer be any necessity for the income the hospitals have been enjoying in the last few years and, if this money is not wisely spent now and spent in a way that will ensure continual benefit for those whom it is intended to benefit, those who come after us will be able to say that we could have been more wise in our administration of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bennett finds fault with the frank statement of the Parliamentary Secretary when he says that, primarily, we are interested in seeing that the buildings are there and that, in the second place, comes the consideration of the beds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bennett is emphasising the words &ldquo;immediate and remote.&rdquo;  That is a relative matter.  It might mean what we understood it to mean when we were in Opposition&mdash;six, ten or even 100 years hence&mdash;but, as I understand the Parliamentary Secretary's point of view, it is that he wants to see buildings put in position that will satisfy him as to their desirability and suitability. The remote point of view would be the beds.</P>

The fact that he <Col N="1995" /> possesses these powers does not necessarily mean that they will have to be used.  From the manner in which Deputy Bennett spoke, one would imagine that he was going in for fresh air treatment and that all he was concerned with was the question of beds in the open air.

As I said in the beginning, if Deputy O'Sullivan could convince me that the hospitals to-day were purely voluntary hospitals I should be the first to accept his point of view and to agree that there should be no right to interfere on the part of the Minister, but I cannot accept his point of view.  I should like to be convinced, if it is possible to convince me, that they are voluntary hospitals.  I say that they are no longer voluntary hospitals.  On one occasion, some years ago, when the State was seeking to cut down certain expenses and to introduce certain economies by reducing their contribution to the hospitals, I resented it and tried my best to argue against it to Deputy Cosgrave when he was President.  I said that I wanted the State to reserve, by its contributions, the right to have some say in the administration and management of the hospitals.  The present Minister for Local Government and Public Health was on the Dublin Corporation at the time and, if I remember correctly, he strongly opposed the proposal and succeeded in saving the contributions to the hospitals by the City of Dublin from being reduced. In the Dublin administration, we <Col N="1996" /> wanted to have some right, as a civic authority, as regards the sick poor of Dublin and, on that principle, I say that these hospitals are no longer voluntary hospitals.  They are voluntary hospitals, if you like, in the sense that the services of a number of eminent physicians and surgeons attached to them are being given gratis and in a generous spirit for the benefit of humanity but, outside that, they are not voluntary hospitals.</P>

      <P>I have only a few words to say.  I did not intend to intervene in the debate, but I think that the last speaker's remarks are altogether beside the point.  We are getting nowhere with this academic discussion as to whether the hospitals are voluntary or not.  The principle of the Bill is to provide free treatment for the needy poor and I, for the life of me, cannot see why that should not be explicitly ensured in the Bill.  The Minister did not give any reason.  Is there any reason why there should not be an assurance to that effect in the Bill?  Would it damage the Bill?</P>

      <P>I support Deputy O'Sullivan for no other reason than that State control ultimately develops into State ownership. That creates a soulless machine.  The human tendency gradually slips away in administration and, by degrees, that kindly atmosphere which should prevail in a hospital is absent.  Everything is regulated by the filling of forms.  I have pleasure in supporting Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment and I hope it will receive the favourable consideration of the House.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that you cannot do a worse service to any principle than to try to apply it when it is really not applicable.  I am strongly in favour of resisting improper State interference, but it is open to any institution to refuse to receive <Col N="1997" /> public moneys if it so desires.  We have liberty here to bring in legislation at any time to apply these moneys to some other purpose and that, surely, should give us a right to say what the hospitals ought to do.  I am hesitating as to how I should act on this amendment.  If it could be shown that the result of the amendment would be to produce better management than is likely as a result of the Minister's action, I should vote for it. I think it is really a question of which method is going to produce better co-ordination and give better results. That is the only thing that interests me.  I think that this appeal to the rights of the individual is wholly out of place under the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that there is no appeal to the rights of the individual.  It is a question of institutions.  With regard to the long speech made by Deputy Briscoe, if this is merely a question of the sick poor, it can be met by definite provision.  That is no excuse for the powers which will be taken in this section when the various amendments shall have been incorporated in it.  A case for a limited amount of interference constitutes no reason for placing in the hands of the Minister the absolute power we are now about to confer upon him.  That is what I object to.  State interference may not necessarily mean State control. I know perfectly well that when the State gives money it may affix conditions to the grant, but that is no reason why it should take absolute power.  Any case made here to-night has been for only a limited power of interference by the Minister.  That was the only case put forward by the Minister himself, by his colleague Deputy Briscoe and by Deputy Murphy.  The way to do that is along the line of definite provision and not along the line pursued by the Government of what amounts to an absolute power of interference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How Deputy MacDermot makes up his mind to vote on this question is a matter primarily for himself, but I can assure him that, in connection with these voluntary institutions, there are serious principles at stake.  This is not an academic matter.  It is a matter to <Col N="1998" /> which many of us attach great importance. A person occupying a responsible position has to watch carefully to ensure that the State, when it has power, does not give way to the temptation to abuse it. The whole tendency is in that direction. Everybody occupying a responsible position&mdash;whether in Parliament or as a Minister&mdash;has to be continually on the watch against such interference. That is the reason I deprecate any such attempt as is now being made to give absolute power to the Minister, as this section will give when the various amendments standing in his name will have been accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

      <P>It is rather amusing to hear Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and Deputy O'Sullivan complaining of the powers being given the Minister when we think of the powers that they looked for during our four or five years' experience.  I do not see why the Minister for the time being should not have whatever powers of interference are necessary to protect the sick poor and see that the hospitals perform their share of the bargain which was struck when this House was introducing sweepstakes.  So far as the hospitals of Cork are concerned, I could not speak too highly of the manner in which they have carried out their share of the contract. There was one exception of which Deputy Murphy and I had experience.  When the Bill was being passed through the House, the safeguards thought necessary were introduced by Deputies opposite and passed.  What was the result?  When Deputy Murphy went up to one of them he was told: &ldquo;Show us in the Bill where our obligation is?&rdquo; The obligation was not there. These people obtained money under false pretences.  The Minister should have power&mdash;absolute power&mdash;to step in in a case like that, tell the hospital that it had evaded its responsibilities and compel it to act up to the conditions under which it had got the money.  The Minister should have unlimited power to deal with any emergency like that.  We had bitter experience in one case and we do not want that experience repeated.</P>

      <P>The discussion on these amendments has ranged over a very wide field.  On one point, there appears to be general agreement&mdash; that we should ensure that adequate facilities for the hospital treatment of the poor will be made available consequent on the placing of these moneys at the disposal of these institutions. There appears to be general agreement on that principle.  The disagreement would appear to range round the provisions we are making, as compared with the provisions made in previous enactments.  Deputy Bennett, for example, laments that we have not included in our Bill a condition that 25 per cent. of the beds of the participating hospitals should be free to the poor.  Other Deputies on the opposite benches spoke in a similar strain. They are already aware that certain hospitals were specifically exempted by law from compliance with that condition. They are also aware that, even in relation to hospitals to which that section did apply, while it was necessary that 25 per cent. of the beds should be available to the poor, at the time the allocation was made there was no provision whatever for continuing to place 25 per cent. of the beds at the disposal of the poor.</P>
      <P>Deputies on the opposite benches may say that it was quite safe to leave the matter in the hands of the voluntary institutions.  They may talk about the great work these institutions did in the past.  We all admit that.  As I stated on a previous occasion, this money is made available by Government action, and there is a responsibility on the Government to ensure, as a result, that adequate provision and the best that medical science can provide will be made available for the poor of this country as a result of the opportunity presented. What are the safeguards that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney proposes in his amendment:</P>
      <P>In making a grant out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund to any hospital the Minister shall have regard to the amount of benefit conferred upon the sick poor....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He &ldquo;shall have regard&rdquo;.  What does that mean?  If ever there was an <Col N="2000" /> example of an empty formula I think Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's amendment will answer to that description:</P>
    <P>And may make it a condition of every grant to a hospital that the said hospital shall make available for the sick poor a certain proportion....</P>
    <P>He may, or may not, make a certain proportion&mdash;one per cent. or 100 per cent.  I suggest to the House that this is merely the expression of a pious hope, as to what the Minister may do, and that the provisions in Section 24 (3) are real safeguards for the poor. The amendment does not improve the situation.  In fact, it makes it possible that conditions governing allocation for the provision of free beds for the poor, may be altogether in the air. Why do we not specify at this stage what particular percentage of beds will be made available for the poor in any institution?  For the simple reason that we do not know.  That is one of the purposes of the Hospitals' Commission, to examine into the hospital system as it stands, to examine it from the point of view of the needs of the community and, more especially, the poor.  They will then be in a position to report and to recommend to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health what proportion of the beds in a particular institution should be made available free.  It is quite conceivable, and likely, that in different classes of institutions a different proportion of beds will be necessary. Ten beds might be sufficient in an institution set up for the treatment of certain diseases, while 50 or 60 beds might be required in another class of institution.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to Section 24 (3) in which Deputy Murphy was particularly interested:</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister makes under this section a grant out of the Hospitals Trust Fund to a hospital or a nursing organisation, he shall specify the purposes for which such grant is to be expended and may attach to the receipt of such grant such conditions (whether to be performed before or after such receipt) as he thinks proper for securing the due expenditure of such grant on the <Col N="2001" /> purposes specified by the Minister or for securing or attaining any other object.</P>
    <P>That section has been drafted deliberately to enable the Minister to attach conditions to the allocation made to any hospital and will safeguard the rights of the poor.  As far as the hospital system is concerned in the future that is the only section in the Bill that safeguards the rights of the poor, and it is an absolute safeguard, whereas if we insert the amendment the poor, for all practical purposes, have no safeguard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>If one wished to turn a thing topsy-turvy I do not think anyone could set about it more successfully than the Parliamentary Secretary.  As the Bill stands there is not a single provision in it for the sick poor.  From beginning to end of the Bill the sick poor are not mentioned, and it is in the power of the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Minister, to make it the condition of a grant that no assistance and no help should be given to the sick poor.  There is absolute and unlimited power over the internal arrangements of hospitals, but there is not a single word, and no direction to the Minister from this House, as to how the Bill should be administered.  Surely this is a Bill in which the House should give a direction to the Minister, and should set out what matters the Minister is to consider.  One of these matters&mdash;and here is where the Parliamentary Secretary finds fault with my amendment&mdash;if the amendment is accepted, is where it directs the Minister to take into account how hospitals assist persons most in need of assistance. Because this House is giving directions to the Minister that he is not to make a grant, except to an hospital that considers the necessities of the very poor and needy, we are asked to reject the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard a great deal from different persons about the reason why there should be unlimited power, if the Minister is going to interfere with the hospital arrangements.  Deputy Briscoe was very strong on that, and wants to see State control.  He has got it in <Col N="2002" /> the Bill, in the sub-section which gives the State absolute control over all the domestic affairs of every hospital, because the Minister can make any regulation he pleases with reference to any hospital.  He has got absolute and complete control.  You cannot have more State control than this Bill gives the Minister.  He tells us that he does not want it; that he does not intend to use it.  Then why take it?  We are told that as the State is providing money for the hospitals why should it not have control over them.  That statement is utterly inaccurate.  The State is not providing one single halfpenny for the hospitals.  The one way in which the State is interfering with State money is, that it is taking away, and has taken away over £1,000,000 from the hospitals.  I do not know whether that argument does or does not appeal to Deputy MacDermot, who said that the State has given the money, and therefore has a right to control.  When the State is actually taking away money, instead of giving it, surely that does not give it a right to control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not the hospitals have got this money without State control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Under common law it is the right of every individual to carry out a sweepstake. A person is perfectly entitled to carry out a sweepstake, or lottery, or anything else at common law.  A certain number of statutes called the Lottery Acts were passed and they made the holding of sweepstakes illegal.  All that the State has done in this country as regards the hospitals is that it has restored to them the common law rights which they possessed, absolutely nothing more.  That is the position.  I do not suggest that some of the Deputies opposite, who laugh so gaily at that statement, know very much about these matters.  If, however, they take the pains to go back on the Lottery Acts and study the reason why they were passed, they will find that it was not out of any great desire to prevent the English people from gambling.  The only reason was that they discovered that lotteries were <Col N="2003" /> very much more attractive than State loans and, because money was not being subscribed to State loans, lotteries were made illegal.  That is what lies behind the Lottery Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that is being done for the hospitals here is that the Lottery Acts are being repealed so far as they are concerned. That does not give them State money.  They are allowed to collect money from ordinary persons by means of sweepstakes, but that is all.  They are getting no money from the State and on that ground the State has no right to interfere at all.  What we do want is to see that hospitals that have been placed in that position, that have been allowed to collect in this peculiar fashion from the general public, shall utilise the proceeds for the alleviation of suffering amongst those people who are unable to pay for adequate medical and hospital treatment.  Further than <Col N="2004" /> that we have no right to go.  These hospitals should in that way be assisted in order to enable them to bring themselves up to date, to carry out their duties to the sick poor and thus realise the kindly intentions of those who founded them.  These hospitals are not State founded.  With possibly one exception in Dublin, the old House of Industry, all the others have been built by the donations of charitable and pious persons and they were meant to do a particular class of work.  We are simply allowing them to help themselves to carry out that beneficent work.  This House has no right to interfere with these institutions, which have been endowed by private individuals, and the Minister has no right to take complete control of them, as by this section he purports to do.</P>
