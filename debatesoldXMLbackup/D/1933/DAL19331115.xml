      <P>asked the President if, in relation to the falsehood about Deputy Mulcahy given publicity by the President in the Dáil on 28th September last as a reason for bringing the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act into operation, he will state (a) the date on which the information upon which this falsehood was based was received by him; (b) whether that information was communicated by direct personal approach to the President or by letter or through any intermediary; (c) the name of the person alleged to have supplied the information to the President; his address; age; nationality; profession, trade or occupation; associates; means of knowledge of the matters alleged; his general repute in respect of reliability, accuracy, veracity and his touch with or knowledge of events in the Saorstát in recent years; (d) whether all or, if any, which of these details were known to the President when this person's approaches were first made; (e) whether any and, if so, what investigations were made in respect of whichever of these details were originally unknown to the President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the President aware that the only statement made in this matter was that he did not propose to hold an inquiry?  I am not now asking anything with regard to whether the person who is alleged to be responsible for a certain falsehood will come forward to give evidence or not, but I am inquiring as to what have been the President's activities in this matter. Does the President realise the difference?  Further, does the President now think that it would have been wiser to be discreet before he gave publication to the false information than to be discreet now?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of this question is in the affirmative. The test was similar to that which has always been applied to candidates, namely, simple translation and conversation.  There is no question of passing a test.  It is applied simply to determine the relative knowledge of the various candidates.  A knowledge of Irish is not an essential qualification for admission to the Gárda, but the degree of knowledge possessed by the candidate is a factor to which weight is given in selecting suitable recruits.</P>

      <P>In the absence of the information I have asked for I cannot, of course, question the Minister very fully upon the matter.  I would like to ask him, however, how he would square the fact that we are exporting offals with the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture to the effect that the great thing was to provide cheap feeding stuffs for the farmers.  I would, also, ask him how he would square his statement with some of the evidence given yesterday before the Pig Tribunal to the effect that an artificial famine has been created in the case of offal feeding because of the recent exportation of these offals, and that owing to that the price of pollard has gone up to £6 15s. or £7 a ton.</P>

The Deputy should remember that the demand for offals is seasonal but the production of offals takes place all the year round and that at some periods of the year the supplies exceed the storage capacity of the millers and a serious situation would arise if that was not relieved by exportation.</P>

    <P>That the Dáil approves of the International Load Line Convention with Final Protocol, signed at London on the 5th day of July, 1930, <Col N="22" /> a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 9th day of August, 1933, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps to ratify the said Convention and Final Protocol.</P>
    <P>This Convention is the first international agreement on the loadlines of merchant ships.  An international standard for the loadlines of ships has long been considered a desirable thing amongst the maritime nations.  A conference was contemplated in 1914 but the proposal fell through owing to the European war.  The matter then remained in abeyance until 1927 when it was again taken up, and eventually an International Loadline Conference was convened in 1930 and produced the present convention.  The standard rules laid down by the convention will replace over a dozen different standards, and when the new standard is ratified generally there will be uniform loadline rules&mdash;which means uniform safety rules&mdash;for cargo ships of any size all over the world.</P>
    <P>The convention will not represent any vital departure from present practice in An Saorstát.  Loadlines will remain more or less in the same positions as before, but a simpler system of calculation will be available to surveyors and our vessels will have the advantage of holding International Loadline Certificates which will be accepted in all countries.  A Bill entitled &ldquo;Merchant Shipping (Safety and Load Line Conventions) Bill, 1933,&rdquo; amending our merchant shipping legislation in order to give effect to the provisions of this convention and the Safety of Life at Sea Convention was passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas last session.  The Bill has now been enacted.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  Pages two and three of the Bill set out the Acts which it is already proposed to continue under this Bill, which has been an annual one.  A memorandum has been circulated to Deputies&mdash;and no doubt has been carefully read by them &mdash;which explains why the Acts set out in the Bill should be continued on the Statute Book.  I do not know what points Deputies may require to raise in that connection, but if there is any criticism to be offered I should like it to be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  This Bill is a composite Bill affecting many Departments.  The sections have no relation to one another except the fact that they relate to Acts <Col N="25" /> which normally would expire if this Bill were not passed.  Accordingly it would be necessary for Ministers to have some information as to the various points which Deputies might desire to raise.  In that connection, as I have already suggested, it seems to me that those matters might be more conveniently discussed on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Bill there are three points which I want to raise and which might be looked into.  The first has reference to the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, under which I think labourers' cottages are built in this country.  I should like to know, since it is the purpose of the Government to continue that Act under its present form, if they are in a position to make any statement of their intentions in regard to the scheme which has been put forward to facilitate the purchase of labourers' cottages by such tenants as are desirous of purchasing them.  If they have nothing to say on that matter will they be in a position to reassure the House that a scheme directed towards that end will not in any way interfere with the security of tenure of a labourer who does not wish to purchase his house, but wishes to remain a tenant in the house which he already has?  In that connection I should also like to hear from the Minister the Government's view as to how the annuity for the purchase of a labourer's cottage would compare with the average rent paid by labourers occupying labourers' cottages throughout the country at the present time. In arriving at the sum for which a purchasing labourer would become liable I think the Minister should take into consideration the amount the labourer would be called upon to pay in respect of rates and repairs on a cottage of which he was the tenant purchaser instead of the ordinary tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it, sir, that it is relevant to ask the Minister to deal with certain aspects of legislation that might be introduced by this Expiring Laws Bill. I should also like the Minister, when dealing with this question, to say if he has considered devising a scheme whereunder a sinking fund could be <Col N="26" /> set up in each county, into which would be paid the annuities charged on each house which a labourer was in the process of purchasing; and whether, on the security of the annuities being paid into that sinking fund, a new cottage could be built for every cottage that was made the subject of a purchase annuity agreement? I believe that in that way you can vastly increase the accommodation for agricultural labourers, and at the same time meet the desires of agricultural labourers who want to buy out their own cottage, which they now must occupy as a tenant only.</P>
    <P>Another measure which is to be re-enacted under this Bill is the Local Authorities (Central Purchasing) Act. Part of that Act provides that no local authority can purchase requirements locally without comparing the price quoted by the local merchant with the price quoted by a supplier authorised under the Local Authorities (Central Purchasing) Act.  The ridiculous anomaly not infrequently arises that when a man in charge of works in a rural district, which are under the control of the local authority, wants a pennyworth of screws, if he buys them and gets seven instead of nine screws, the auditor is liable to surcharge the local authority for the two screws.  At a distance that sounds impossible, but in practice it can be extremely inconvenient. A case came under my attention where a waterpipe burst and inundated someone's house.  When the plumber wanted to repair that waterpipe he had to get in touch with the local authority, to find out what was the Central Purchasing Board's price for solder.  Unless he could get a quotation locally as cheap as that of the Central Purchasing Board, the plumber could not buy, except by sending a requisition to the local authority and getting it direct from the authorised undertaking.  Clearly there should be power in the local authority to relax the regulations for trivial purchases.</P>
    <P>With regard to No. 8 in the Schedule &mdash;The Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act&mdash; I understood that Act is repealed or superseded by a Bill which is at present <Col N="27" /> passing through this House. Whether it is deemed desirable to keep that Bill in operation until it is actually repealed by the Bill now passing through the House is something we have to find out.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear the present Government's attitude on the Increase of Rent Act.  As far as I am aware, that Act was originally passed with a view to protecting tenants from extortion, owing to the housing shortage that obtained.  When the present Government came into office, in an exceptionally eloquent Budget speech, the Minister for Finance declared that the shortage of houses in this country was virtually at an end; that Fianna Fáil had put their shoulders to the wheel, and that the millennium was in sight.  The shoulders are still at the wheel, but the millennium has not turned up yet.  I want to know from the Government when will the realisation of their housing policy make the Increase of Rent Act unnecessary.  Are we to assume that they have made so little impression on the housing shortage so far, that this extremely drastic legislation is still necessary?  In that connection I think I am entitled to say that the fruits of the Government's activity in housing are very disappointing. I had sincerely hoped that after 18 months we would have made some impression on the housing shortage.  I regret to say that I think the Increase of Rent Act is just as necessary to-day as it was when Fianna Fáil came into office.  We have heard a great deal of talk about houses, and we have actually passed a number of Acts dealing with houses, but I would be very much interested to hear, from any Deputy, news of a substantial addition to the available housing accommodation.  I invite contradiction of the statement that, so far as I am aware, not one tenement dweller in the City of Dublin has been taken out of a tenement house by the Fianna Fáil Government.  We have had 18 months of Fianna Fáil administration.  They <Col N="28" /> announced that they were going to make an end to the slums in this city, not to go outside that to the grave problem that exists.  I challenge them to produce proof that there is one person less living in tenement houses in Dublin than there was when they came into office.</P>

I was pointing out that Fianna Fáil undertook to build so many houses that there would be a surplus. If there is a surplus the Increase of Rent Act becomes an unnecessary instrument.  I am suggesting that through their ineffective housing policy there is ground for re-enacting the Increase of Rent Act, because there is just as great a shortage now as when the Act was passed.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Combined Purchasing Act I have availed of the opportunity each year, on the passage of this Bill, to call attention to abuses that have arisen in connection with that Act.  It is generally denied that such abuses prevail. I was in a position one year to point to actual cases that came under my notice, when an apology was tendered for these abuses.  During the last year the abuses continued and when they were brought to the notice of the Department of Local Government there was practically a refusal to investigate them.  There is very grave discontent through the country with regard to the working of that measure. Local officials are availing of an Act passed to enable public institutions to purchase goods at contract prices to get goods for their personal use and for their friends.  I think the Minister should see that such meanness and such dishonesty are not tolerated.  I was amazed at the reply received from the Department of Local Government two or three months ago when substantial instances of such abuses were submitted. The reply practically indicated that no inquiries would be made.  I ask the Minister now to undertake that these abuses will be investigated and that they will not be tolerated in future.  I am prepared to supply the letters before the Final Stages of the Bill are passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. The purpose of this Bill is to secure that so far as possible the sum of £10,000 provided by the Oireachtas in the School Meals (Gaeltacht) Act, 1930, will be fully availed of.  Prior to the introduction of this Bill, Deputies are no doubt aware, the recoupment to each local authority concerned from the sum of £10,000 provided under the Act of 1930 was subject to a maximum of whichever happened to be the less, either (a) one-half of their expenditure, or (b) a sum which bears to the sum of £10,000 the same proportion as the number of children certified by the Minister for Education to have attended national schools in the district defined under the Act bears to the number of children certified to have attended national schools in the entire Gaeltacht defined under the Act during the prescribed period.  It was found, however, in working the Act that on account of the poverty of the inhabitants of certain scheduled areas, it would be necessary to provide school meals in those districts during the entire school year instead of in the winter months only.  Furthermore, the cost of the meals was increased owing to the difficulty of obtaining supplies locally and the difficulty of transport, due to the widely scattered areas in which the schools are situated.  These conditions applied especially to the scheduled area in Galway County where expenditure on the scheme extended considerably the amount earning the full recoupment of 50 per cent. to which the board of health is entitled under the conditions imposed by the Act of 1930 to which I have <Col N="31" /> already referred.  In other areas, however, that is, Donegal and Kerry, possibly due to better conditions, the boards of health concerned have not expended the total sums in respect of which recoupment at the rate of 50 per cent. would be available.  The present Bill, therefore, proposes merely to remove the restriction embodied in Section 1 (9) (b) of the principal Act so as to allow of a larger share of the £10,000 being assigned to districts in which the need is greater. For example, in 1932-33, in Galway County, the expenditure by the board of health and public assistance of £7,199 13s. 9d. would have entitled them to recoupment of £3,599 16s. 11d. if the overriding maximum imposed by the Act of 1930 had not been in operation.  Due, however, to that restriction the amount to which they became entitled was only £2,451 8s. 10d. based on the attendance of children as provided in the principal Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>They became entitled to only £2,451 8s. 10d. based on the attendance of children as provided in the principal Act and thus there was a deficiency of £1,148 8s. 1d. in recoupment. In the case of all the other boards concerned&mdash;Cork, Donegal, Kerry and Mayo&mdash;their actual expenditure was less than the expenditure necessary to earn full recoupment.  The total issue from the grant in respect of the year 1932-33 amounted, therefore, to only £7,371 15s. 6d.  If the present Bill had been in operation in respect of that year a sum of £2,628 4s. 6d. or the unexpended balance of the grant of £10,000, would have been available, out of which it would have been possible to meet the deficiency of £1,148 8s. 1d. in recoupment to Galway County referred to above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There appears to be little doubt as to the benefits derived from the provision of these meals.  The County Medical Officer of Health for County Kerry states that teachers in schools in the scheduled area in that county are unanimous in their opinion that <Col N="32" /> school children are deriving great benefit from the provision of meals. Many of the children have to travel long distances to the school, he adds, and the provision of a hot meal for these children during play-hour has been a great boon and is bound to have a beneficial effect on their health and happiness.  The other county medical officers are of the same opinion, one stating that a reinspection of children formerly found to be suffering from malnutrition has shown an improvement in most cases which may reasonably be attributed to the free meals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that through the delinquencies of the local boards of health or was it that the children refused to take the meals?  If the Parliamentary Secretary would give us that information it would, I imagine, be extremely illuminating.  One is very glad to hear, of course, that the medical officers of health in the different counties have praised the effects of the Act.  I should have liked to have heard something from the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate whether it might be desirable to extend the number of areas in the schedule or to increase the amount of £10,000. Of course, the fact that nearly £3,000 remained unexpended last year would indicate that the £10,000 was ample but, undoubtedly, it was the opinion of all Parties in the House at the time when the principal Act was introduced here that the schedule was rather limited and that very many other electoral areas in different counties could very well have been included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder whether any examination of that aspect of the matter has lately been made.  I know that in my own constituency there were very grievous complaints against me for not having included several electoral areas and I was satisfied subsequent to the passing of the Act that some of them should have been included and were entitled <Col N="33" /> to be included just as much as others were entitled to be included.  I think it would be well if there were an examination of the Schedule by the officers of the Department of Local Government and perhaps, in co-operation with the Department of Education, to ascertain whether there are other areas which might well be included in the Schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with Deputy Lynch in an inquiry as to what steps may be taken to add to the district electoral divisions which are contained in the Schedule to the Act of 1930.  There are, I have no doubt, in every county electoral divisions which have the right of admission to the benefits of the Bill but it is for each of us who knows the local conditions in his own particular constituency to draw the Minister's attention to them.  There is no doubt that in parts of Inishowen &mdash;I am sorry that Deputy O'Doherty is not here&mdash;near Malin, there are at least two electoral divisions that should have the benefit of this Bill and have not got it.  There is, I am satisfied, one electoral division in the neighbourhood of Marin similarly situated.  It is comprised in the parish of Kilclooney. There is also an electoral division between Burtonport and Dungloe which I think should have the benefit of this Act and has not.  In connection with the last place referred to, I raised the matter with the Department of Education and I was there confronted with a return which they had received from a teacher in the area some four or five years ago in which it was represented that the children were not Irish-speaking.  As far as I could judge that seemed to be an insuperable obstacle to getting that particular electoral division defined as a Fior-Ghaeltacht electoral division.  I must confess that it now escapes my memory whether it was in connection with the School Meals Act I was dealing when I approached the Department of Education.  I do not think it was. I think it was in connection with examinations for admission to preparatory schools.  I should like to know from the Minister or from the <Col N="34" /> Parliamentary Secretary, if representations are made to him that certain electoral divisions which may not have seemed to be Fior-Ghaeltacht when the Act of 1930 was passing through and are now Fior-Ghaeltacht or very strongly Breac-Ghaeltacht, whether he will consider admitting these electoral divisions to the Schedule of the Principal Act and this amending Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other question which I want to ask the Minister.  Provision is made in Section 4 of the principal Act for meals.  The terms are: (a) to provide food for such meals, (b) to provide accommodation, apparatus, equipment, etc., for the distribution and preparation of the food and (c) to take such other steps as in the opinion of the board of health are necessary for or incidental to the provision of such meals.  The Minister is aware that it is the practice of the Department of Agriculture to send out circulars from time to time informing county committees of agriculture and other interested persons of recent discoveries in diet or husbandry of any kind which they are satisfied are worthy of consideration.  I suggest that the Department of Public Health should send out to these school meals committees in particular, suggestions of the type of food that they would think particularly valuable for inclusion in the school meals.  I throw out that suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary who is particularly well fitted to judge.  His attention may have been directed recently to an alleged find in one of the branches of the Rockefeller Institute of the peculiar value of orange juice and lemon juice as a beverage for growing children to prevent the incidence of dental caries. It would seem to me that the inclusion of such an article as that in the diet of school children would be very easy, would be very acceptable to the children and would be extremely useful from a public health point of view. I would be much interested to know if the Parliamentary Secretary would consider co-operating with the school meals committees along these lines and giving them advice from time to time as to the specific articles that might with advantage be introduced into the <Col N="35" /> diet under Section 4, paragraph (b) of the principal Act.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that this Bill has been brought forward and, on behalf of the people of the Kerry Gaeltacht, I should like to get an assurance that the Parliamentary Secretary will consider the proposals sent forward by our county medical officer, namely, that extra areas be included in the new schedule which will be inaugurated under the new Bill. We could never understand why certain areas in West Kerry were excluded. Take, for instance, Dingle town which is practically in the heart of the Fior-Ghaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht. It is excluded from the Schedule under the principal Act.  Certain other deserving districts in the Breac-Ghaeltacht were also excluded.  We have formulated a scheme in co-operation with the county medical officers and we ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give it his favourable consideration. We simply ask that all Breac-Ghaeltacht districts be included in the list under the new schedule and that two or three other areas which we have indicated should also be included.  A recommendation has also been made by the Kerry County Board of Health that the type of school meal might be improved upon.  We welcome the Bill because it will give local authorities in places like Kerry a great opportunity of doing their utmost for the people concerned.  We have received repeated representations from the teachers in the districts referred to asking us to do our utmost to get these areas included. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give every consideration to the proposals sent forward by the Kerry County Board of Health in regard to this important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lynch asked me to inform the House, as far as my information would enable me, of the cause of the delinquency of the boards of health concerned.  It appeared to him to be an astonishing fact that all the money earmarked for assisting the finances of the free school meals was not being availed of.  I understand that it is due in the main to two causes. <Col N="36" /> In the first place many of the local authorities are not striking a rate to raise a sufficient amount of money to absorb the grant that would be available from the Central Fund, 50 per cent. of the cost to be provided in the areas concerned is borne out of State funds, but if the local authorities do not raise sufficient money to finance a scheme that will entirely absorb that 50 per cent. they can only get 50 per cent. of the actual expenditure, so that it is largely, I think, the fault of the local authorities themselves that this £10,000 earmarked for the purpose is not being entirely absorbed.  In some areas the school managers have not encouraged the adoption of the free school meals in the Gaeltacht areas. In a limited number of cases the school managers in these areas have actually opposed the extension of the free meals on the grounds that the people in these areas would prefer to maintain their independence and purchase their own food.  Of course, that is a mentality that can well be understood and appreciated, but it is one of the factors contributing, anyhow, to the refund to the Exchequer of approximately £3,000 that would be available for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of increasing the area scheduled under the School Meals Act that would require specific legislation and, so far, no case has been made for extending the area.  It is hard to see how we could.  Presumably, if the area were extended&mdash;and I may say that, personally, I should be glad to see it extended in the entire Gaeltacht area&mdash;it would be hard to make a case to the Minister for Finance at the moment that more money should be made available for this purpose in the light of the fact that the money that is already available is not being availed of.  The Deputy from Kerry, Mr. Flynn, informs the House that proposals are coming forward from the Kerry Board of Health to extend the area in which the school meals will operate.  These proposals have not yet reached my Department, and I presume that when the proposals do reach us there will be an indication of the preparedness of the Kerry Board of Health to strike an increased <Col N="37" /> rate for the purpose of financing the extended scheme.  If the various boards of health in which this Act operates, give such indication, we will be at least in a position to put up a reasonable case to the Minister for Finance for more money, but until such time as they strike a rate to absorb the money that is already at their disposal, I think it is futile to discuss the question of extending the area.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any other point arising out of the discussion that requires to be dealt with. Deputy Dillon mentioned the desirability of sending out circulars from time to time with suggestions for improvement of the school meals.  That has been in actual practice in my Department for quite a number of years and, from time to time, suggestions are sent out to the local authorities, and the expert advice of our Department in relation to these matters is placed at their disposal. The suggestion of providing fresh fruit juice or orange juice as part of the school meals would be desirable, undoubtedly.  Its desirability from the medical point of view, I am sure, would not be questioned; but I am afraid that it would be very difficult to operate.  The cost of the meals has to be kept within reasonable limits.  It is a matter that would require careful examination, and I doubt if, for the same expenditure, we could not provide a better substitute for the children than orange juice.  However, as I say, the matter will bear examination and, if feasible, it will be put into practice, I am sure.</P>

      <P>The necessity for this Bill, so far as my Department is concerned, arises from a few small difficulties which have been experienced in the administration <Col N="38" /> of the original measure.  The late date on which that Act became law rendered it impossible for wheat growers to qualify for payment of wheat bounty in view of the terms of sub-section (2) of Section 71 which provides, inter alia, that no bounty is payable on home-grown millable wheat &ldquo;unless such wheat was grown on premises entered in the register of wheat growers during the period of three months next preceding the commencement of the cereal year.&rdquo;  That is to say, before the 1st May.  It became evident that, notwithstanding the publicity given to the scheme through the medium of advertisements, posters and lectures, a number of wheat growers had failed to realise the necessity for registration.  I may mention, incidentally, that 8,000 odd wheat growers had registered up to 31st July last and that about 2,000 more have applied since.  It seems only equitable that in the initial stages of a scheme of such national importance, persons who have grown wheat of millable quality should not, on a technicality, be deprived of the bounty, and the object of Section 8 of the Bill is to extend for this year only the period during which applications for registration will be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Section 71 (2) (a) of the original Act.  Section 8 of the amending Bill deals with that matter.</P>
      <P>A slight amendment of Section 76 (1) is necessary to cover the case of a person who is registered as a wheat dealer.  He may, for instance, dispose of it, in opposition to the intention of the Act, by transferring it to premises for which he holds a permit under Section 36 of the Act.  The wheat dealer who buys wheat on which a subsidy is payable may, contrary to the intentions of the Act, dispose of it to his own mill.  That is a thing which we want to make right under Section 9 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the important question of the sale of home-grown wheat for seed.  It is desired to encourage licensed millers and registered wheat dealers to reserve, if they so desire, some of the better samples of wheat for sale for <Col N="39" /> seed, and provision was made for such sales under Section 76 (3) of the Act. I regard it, however, as an essential condition of such sales that the vendor, who will no doubt expect and receive an enhanced price for such wheat, should refund to the State a sum equivalent to the bounty payable to the grower thereof.  There is, of course, the obvious danger that without some such precaution bounty might have to be paid twice, or oftener, on the same lot.</P>
    <P>There is also, as I mentioned when speaking on a previous occasion, the point that the dealer or the miller buying wheat from the farmer, paying the ordinary price for it, on which wheat a subsidy would be receivable from State funds, would be in a very favourable position competing against the ordinary seed merchant or the ordinary merchant in selling wheat. The only way we can bring them, more or less, on terms of equality is to compel the wheat dealer or flour miller to refund the amount of the subsidy to the State after the wheat has been sold for seed.  The powers conferred on me by Section 76 (3) did not, however, enable me to deal with this matter adequately and Part III of the Bill is intended to remedy this by definitely requiring the licensed miller or registered wheat dealer to refund the bounty in cases in which he resells wheat for seed.  The other conditions upon which such sales may be effected are laid down in detail in Section 11 of the Bill and are not, as in the original Act, left for settlement by regulations. Another matter has arisen which may be raised on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  It refers to Section 81, which deals with the sale of pure maize for human food.  I merely mention the matter now because I think it may be necessary, if an amendment is possible, to bring it in on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  There are also in the Bill two sections which are more concerned with that part of the measure which is administered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce than they are with the part administered by my Department.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, there are two <Col N="40" /> classes of millers under this Bill&mdash;the licensed miller and the permitted miller.  The licensed miller can buy wheat on which a home grown wheat certificate is issued and the seller of the wheat is entitled to the bounty.  The permitted miller, on the other hand, is not in a position to buy wheat under these conditions.  If he buys wheat, there is no bounty given.  Therefore, the farmer would not be disposed to sell his wheat to the permitted miller unless the permitted miller would give him the same price as the licensed miller would give, plus the bounty. The difficulty arises in drawing the line between the licensed miller and the permitted miller.  There are very small millers who have done a good deal on a commission basis&mdash;taking the wheat from the farmers, milling it and returning it to the farmers for their own use.  We should like to encourage that business and to see that farmers have their own wheat milled for their own purposes.  I think there will not be any great difficulty in encouraging that business because farmers who get into the habit of growing wheat will be inclined to have a few barrels of the wheat milled for their own use.  But there are millers in a small way who do a good deal of that commission business and who do also a certain amount of importing or buying wheat to mill for sale.  If they were to apply for licences, they would be compelled to obey all the regulations laid down for the licensed miller and they would be subject to the penalties prescribed. Amongst the penalties is one of a fine in case the quota for which they apply is under-milled.  There is an amendment in this Bill exempting from penalty millers who mill less than 1,000 barrels a year.  That will give a chance to those small millers, who are partly commission millers and partly licensed millers, as described in this Bill, to exist.  These are the points which have been dealt with.  In a Bill of the magnitude and importance of the Cereals Bill, which went through early this year, it would be absolutely impossible to foresee all the difficulties that might arise in the administration of the measure.  These few amendments become necessary at this stage <Col N="41" /> and in all probability, as time goes on, other amending Bills may have to be introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first amending Bill introduced to that monument of Fianna Fáil agricultural policy&mdash;the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill, 1931.  As I was considering these amendments, I came across a most astonishing speech by the father of this legislation, delivered five years ago&mdash; on 30th May, 1928.  I think that it is right that the House, when considering these amendments, designed to facilitate the administration of this enlightened Act, should hear what the Minister had to say when he was a humble Deputy, sitting on the benches of the Opposition five years ago.  In Lewis Carroll's book, &ldquo;Alice Through the Looking Glass,&rdquo; there is a character&mdash;I think he is the &ldquo;White Knight&rdquo;&mdash;who was constantly embarrassed by the fact that, when he began to talk, he found that, do what he would, he always began at the end of the sentence and talked backwards. In that way, he found it extremely difficult to get people to understand him.  The Minister for Agriculture when he was humble Deputy Dr. Ryan was discussing with the then Minister for Agriculture, now humble Deputy Hogan, a tariff on flour and this is what Deputy Dr. Ryan said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have always believed, myself, that it would be a great thing for agriculture in this country if offals could become cheaper, but I never saw a better case than the figures supplied by Professor Whelehan.  I had no idea that the Irish farmer was at such a great disadvantage as he is, undoubtedly, at by the movements of trade in flour and offals as they at present obtain.  I had no idea that in Denmark, for instance, they get far more than their share of offal and Ireland gets far less than its share, and these two countries compete in the British market for the production promoted by the feeding of those offals, as you might say, afterwards.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be observed that Deputy Dr. Ryan was &ldquo;playing England's game&rdquo; and was guilty of the shocking treason of being solicitous about the welfare of <Col N="42" /> the Irish farmers in the market that President de Valera thanks God is gone for ever.  I suppose there has been an Act of Indemnity passed since Fianna Fáil came into office to excuse Fianna Fáil Ministers for acts of treason committed five years ago. Deputy Dr. Ryan went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the offals were reduced in price, that in itself would be a subsidy, and it would be a further inducement&mdash;a small inducement, at any rate&mdash;to farmers to fatten their cattle in the winter and to raise beef at the very time when a good price could be got for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>More high treason!&mdash;the raising of cattle and fat stock for the British market, for the feeding of John Bull! The Deputy proceeded:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is easy for any Deputy interested in farming and who knows the amounts of meal ration required to turn out and produce, say, a gallon of milk or a dozen eggs, to work out what the reduced price would mean.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to point out how we could facilitate the production of milk and eggs and a variety of other commodities which, he thought, should be disposed of in the hated British market.  Now, he explained also, very lucidly, that some poor fools imagined that the imposition of a tariff on flour, and legislation along the lines of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, would increase the price of bread and the price of flour.  Deputy Ryan, as he then was, proceeded to scotch that fallacy.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Suppose we put a tariff of 3/- a sack on flour&mdash;and while everybody admits that the mills would ultimately be able to mill a hundred per cent. of our requirements&mdash;suppose that while the mills were getting going a certain amount of flour were allowed in under permit.  In that way there would be no increase in the cost of flour, and consequently there should be none in the price of flour.  Nobody would suggest, I presume, that if mills which are now working half-time were working full time they would increase the price of flour.  In fact, one would expect <Col N="43" /> that the flour would be sold cheaper, because the overhead charges would be the same, and when they were turning out twice as much flour as they turn out at present, the flour should be cheaper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then went on to explain how the possibility of a rise would be corrected by the admission of flour under licence. He declared that there was a mare's nest, that there was no danger whatever.</P>
    <P>The time came when Deputy Ryan became the Minister for Agriculture, and, with the assistance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, he put all those pious thoughts into a Bill which was carried through this House and which is now an Act of the Oireachtas.  What is the result?  The price of flour in this country varies between 3/6 and 5/6 a sack dearer than in Great Britain.  The benefit that was to be conferred on our agricultural community to facilitate their treacherous activities in feeding John Bull has vanished and, instead of cheaper offals, our offals are 30 per cent. dearer than the offals that are available in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Instead of being able to get feeding stuffs for the production of eggs, milk, poultry and beef cheaper than we ever got them before, we are to-day paying £1 15s. a ton more for offals than they are paying in Belfast.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he then was, deplored the appalling handicap under which our farmers were competing in the British market as compared with Denmark.  To-day he declares that the handicap of 40 per cent. in the British market is of no consequence, is doing no harm, has not resulted in a worse price for our farmers at all. His leader has gone a step forward. His leader said it was all wrong, that it was playing England's game, that it was treachery to the Irish nation to have any solicitude for the British market because, he said, it is gone, and he thanks God it is gone.  I remember when the Minister for Finance was introducing his Budget. He wound it up with a burst of passionate eloquence and he said that <Col N="44" /> if taxation must be heavier, at least there would be bread for the poor. Yes, but dearer bread.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, the prognostication of Deputy Patrick Hogan, then Minister for Agriculture, has been exactly fulfilled.  The result of the tariff on bread has increased the price of the 4-lb. loaf by 1d. and the price of the 2-lb. loaf of everyday bread is increased by ½d.  If that were added together, on the report of the Tariff Commission, who held that the average consumption of flour in this country was a sack and a half per individual, the additional cost imposed upon the community by the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act is gigantic.  Let us, for the sake of conservatism, fix the annual consumption at a sack per head of the population.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to argue the relevance of my observations with the Chair.  All I am submitting is that the provisos contained in the Bill are directed towards facilitating the carrying out of certain operations under the principal Act.  The effect of those operations has been to increase the cost of certain commodities to the public.  I am submitting that the increased cost involved is a potent argument against affording these additional facilities that the Minister now seeks.  It was virtually admitted to-day that as a result of some of the powers conferred on millers under this Act the price of offals which Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he then was, foresaw would be cheap has, in fact, advanced 100 per cent.  You have a situation to-day in which admittedly a greater proportion of flour is being milled in this country than was milled in it two years ago. That is all to the good, but, owing to the inept way in which that end was arrived at, the additional quantity of flour is being milled in this country at an annual cost to the community of about £350,000.  The additional milling which is being carried on at best put 300 extra men into work.  It would have been cheaper to give each one of those men the salary of a Parliamentary Secretary and send him home to rest himself and to consort with his family than to have put the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a mighty achievement for Fianna Fáil.  I congratulate them on <Col N="46" /> it.  But that is only half of the Bill. They have provided the salary of a Parliamentary Secretary for every man who has been put into employment by this Bill.  We then proceed to count the cost that falls on the farming community. You can buy wheat pollard to-day in Belfast at a price that would leave it £4 5s. per ton delivered home. We are paying Irish millers £6 and £6 5s. per ton for the identical commodity that we could get for £4 5s. We have against us in the British markets a tariff of 40 per cent.  To offset that tariff we have bounties given by the Free State Government. But these bounties are taken back by the increased prices of pollard and feeding stuffs that the Irish millers of this country are in a position to extract from the agricultural community under the provisions of the Cereals Act.</P>
    <P>Sometimes when logic can be brought to prove that a certain course of action was folly you would be justified in changing your course of action.  But there are other occasions when the best way to convince the Irish people of their own folly is to allow them to burn their fingers.  For good or ill this legislation is in force. It is extremely complicated and extremely difficult for the man in the street to understand it.  It has the blessing of Fianna Fáil.  It is declared to be the patriotic duty of every Irishman who wishes to serve his country to throw his back into it.  I am convinced from the point of view of experience and reason that the cost of this legislation is out of all proportion to the benefits to be conferred on the community.  I am convinced that the benefits derived from this Bill could have been got at a tithe of the cost if the Government had gone the right way about it.  I also believe that the best way to teach the people that this kind of operation is folly, and undiluted folly, is to let it be worked out to its logical conclusion.  In my opinion the man best fitted for that task is the present Minister for Agriculture.  I am quite content to let his reputation stand or fall by the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act and the Bills amending it.  When it comes to the <Col N="47" /> fall I will be only too glad to buttress the Minister to prevent his fall being too heavy.  But that collapse is certain, as this whole scheme of control as incorporated in these Acts is going to develop.  Then the destruction of the Minister will be a terrifying spectacle.</P>
    <P>I am convinced there is no half-way house between Rome and Babylon in this matter.  The Minister will be driven to the conclusion soon that he will have to nationalise the milling industry of this country or else to abandon legislation of this character. He can abandon legislation of this character and at the same time ensure that 90 per cent. of the requirements of our people in flour will be manufactured in this country and that no foreign or domestic miller will be able to get exclusive control of the flour milling industry.  He can do that without this instrument.  If he does not proceed to do that without this legislation, then as certain as this House is sitting to-day he will be forced to nationalise the milling industry at no far distant date.  In my opinion that will be a great catastrophe for our people.  It will be a catastrophe that will involve them in heavy cost and heavy expenditure and they will get very little from it.  I am satisfied on the Minister's own statement when he was a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House, that it can be made manifest that this legislation has collapsed, has failed in its purpose and that it is costing the country a sum out of all proportion to any benefits that it may have conferred upon the community.  At the same time, I hold the view that this is a kind of lesson best learned by experience.  It is the kind of method by which the people of this country will best learn the meaning of legislation of this kind.  They will learn it by experience.  For that reason I do not propose to vote against or obstruct the passage of this amending Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy followed what I said when I was explaining the Bill.  If wheat dealers buy wheat at the present time they buy at 17/- a barrel.  There will be paid then to the farmer at the end of this period, that is at Christmas, the difference between 17/- and 23/6.  On the other hand, if a seed merchant were to buy that wheat for seed, there would be no subsidy, because of the fact that it was for seed.  Otherwise, if farmers sell their wheat for seed they would be getting a subsidy as additional profit to put into their pockets.  We, by this Bill, are proposing to levy a subsidy back for that again.  Perhaps that explains the section.</P>
      <P>With regard to some remarks made by Deputy Dillon, I think it would be too much to expect a person to follow all the arguments raised by the Deputy and to answer them in a lucid way. The arguments were not put in a lucid way, nor in a way in which one could follow them.  The Deputy read some extracts from a speech I made on a previous occasion.  I said then that if a tariff were put on flour, and if as the result of that tariff the millers were working full time instead of part-time, they could sell flour at a lower cost.</P>

      <P>Whether they are doing it or not is a different question.  I do not accept what the Deputy says about that.  The Deputy compares the price here with the price in England where at the moment there is a trade war on and it is said they are cutting prices.  I do not know whether that is true or not.  On that occasion also I said that Denmark was getting more than its share of the offals; that is that more than its share of the offals were imported to Denmark with the flour.  Denmark imported a certain amount of flour from England.  We were also importing a certain amount of flour from England but we were not getting our share of the offals with the flour we imported while Denmark was getting more than her share. That was the position at the time. Deputy Dillon says that offals are selling at such and such a price.  I think he quoted the figure of £6 10s 0d.</P>

The position at that time was that we were paying for our offals the price at Liverpool, plus freight to the Free State.  That was the complaint that we made at that time: that if we were making our own flour here we would have the offals at a price less that freight.  Now we are actually exporting offals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If people are prepared to carry on business here, pay the freight across and back and the 20 per cent. at the other side, and still keep more here than they were keeping before there was any freight or tariff, then all the argument against the economic war goes for nothing because tariffs or freight mean nothing to us. Deputy Dillon complained about the <Col N="50" /> 40 per cent. tariff on cattle.  Surely the argument must apply both ways.  If the 40 per cent. tariff hits us by reducing the price of our cattle it must also have the effect of reducing the price of our offals here in spite of the 20 per cent. and the payment of freight.  Deputy Dillon said that the Principal Act was all wrong.  He made the general argument that the whole thing was wrong; that the sooner it failed the better to show the people that we were wrong.  He was prepared to stake his reputation on that.  So am I.  While he said that the whole thing was wrong, he did not explain why.  I spent a not very profitable hour on Sunday last reading the policy of the new Party.  I find from it that they are going to encourage the growing of grain.  What is the complaint?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The present powers of the Minister for Agriculture in regard to the control of the use of stallions in the Saorstát are exercised under Section 14 of the Horse Breeding Act, 1918, which came into operation in Ireland on the 1st January, 1920.  Under this Act, it is not an offence to keep an unlicensed stallion.  The offence consists in using such sire for the service of mares other than those the property of the stallion owner. Thoroughbred stallions, used exclusively for the service of thoroughbred mares, are exempt under that Act.  It is well known that there are in the country entire horses, unlicensed, and used ostensibly as work horses, which are allowed by their owners to serve mares contrary to the provisions of the Act.  The stallion owners in such cases cannot be prosecuted unless sufficient evidence of the actual service of a mare or mares is produced.  Such evidence is extremely difficult to procure, as mare owners are reluctant to appear as witnesses against a stallion owner who may be a relation or a neighbour.  The effect of the use of these unlicensed stallions is to inflict damage on the horse breeding industry, and to nullify, to a certain extent, the <Col N="52" /> efforts of the Department of Agriculture and of the local committees of agriculture to improve the breed of horses in this country.  The present Horse Breeding Act is ineffective in meeting the difficulty above mentioned.</P>
      <P>The main heads of the new Bill are: Under Section 4, which deals with restrictions, it is made compulsory on owners of stallions of all classes to obtain a licence annually.  This provision will bring under the Bill, not alone thoroughbreds used exclusively for bloodstock breeding which are exempt under the 1918 Act, but also all entire horses whether used for stud purposes or otherwise, such as horses in training or used for sport.  Provision is made under Section 12 for a system of permits for the latter class at a nominal fee not exceeding five shillings.  Owners of other stallions will be required to take out licences, the fees for which will be determined by regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill, therefore, it will become an offence to keep an entire horse without a licence or permit, as is now the case with bulls and boars. Under Section 5, application for licences must, as at present, be made before a prescribed date which will be fixed as 31st December.  A late fee will be prescribed which must not be more than £5.  This is intended to cover extra cost of inspection where application is not made at the proper time.  This special fee, which is not returnable if the application is refused, is not provided for under the present Act.  At present the fee is one guinea and there is no provision for charging an increased fee to a late applicant, and where the application is refused the fee is returnable.  Under Section 6, the Minister is given power to limit the area in which a licensed stallion may be kept.  This is not provided for under the 1918 Act. Under Section 17, where the Minister is satisfied that a stallion is unsuitable for breeding purposes he may order such stallion to be castrated. If the owner refuses or neglects to have this operation carried out the Minister may cause the animal to be castrated, and the expense incurred shall be payable by the owner. <Col N="53" /> Section 18 provides that the panel of referees to be constituted by the Minister will be appointed for a period of three years and is renewable thereafter.  Under the present Act no limit is fixed as to the life of the panel.  Under the Live-stock Breeding Act the panel is for five years as in the case of bulls.  I think I have now covered all the points.</P>

      <P>Thoroughbreds used for bloodstock only?  The difficulty would be, in administration, to distinguish between thoroughbreds used for thoroughbred mares alone, and those used partly for thoroughbred mares, and for others also.  It is very difficult to draw the line.  There is a provision here for giving a permit, and I think that would cover all cases, and that there would be no difficulty.  One could hardly think that the Department would refuse a permit.</P>

The Minister mentioned that he wanted to improve the horse-breeding industry of this country.  Does not the Minister know, and does not the country know, that he has ruined the horse-breeding industry in the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is ruining the horse-breeding industry, and well he should know it.  He talks of a Bill now to improve the breeding of horses and to compel by legislation the owner of two or three-year-old thoroughbreds to apply to the Department of Agriculture for a permit to keep them.  If that is legislation intended to help the horse-breeding in this country, then all I can say is that I cannot understand it.  It seems to me to be like a good deal of the legislation introduced in connection with farming generally.  Heretofore there has been legislation to license stallions.  When that legislation was introduced it was never thought desirable, nor should it be desirable, to compel the owners of thoroughbred stallions commanding high fees in this country, to apply for permits to have their horses let out to thoroughbred mares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at the ridiculousness of a Bill like this.  I have not read the Bill, but I can very easily understand it from the explanation given by the Minister.  It does not require any great knowledge to understand the meaning of a Bill like this.  The Minister admits it is necessary to apply for a permit for two or three year old thoroughbreds.  Does it require anybody of intelligence to criticise a Bill that attempts to legislate in that manner?  I know that the horse-breeding industry was a profitable and a paying industry, until the Fianna Fáil Government turned around and ruined it by their policy. They have allowed money to go out <Col N="55" /> of the country owing to the fact that some very prominent stallions have had to be sent out of the country. The money was prevented coming in when these horses were sent out of the country.  That money had been coming into the country until then. The Minister can smile if he likes, but everyone realises that he knows nothing about the horse-breeding industry, and the best possible thing he could do would be to leave it alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might, at least, have given us some reason for the introduction of this measure. We are in general agreement about the importance of this industry throughout the country.  The suitability of the country for high-class bloodstock production of any class of horse is unrivalled.  The horse-breeding industry in this country has been built up over centuries.  Recent competitions in Great Britain, in India, and in every country to which our horses have been exported, and notably so in America and in Canada, have shown that the outstanding qualities of the Irish horse have been maintained.  The Minister is prescribing regulations under this Bill.  As the present Act stands without any of these prescribed regulations, I am rather inclined to agree with Deputy Curran that two-year-old thoroughbreds would come under the ban if a permit or licence was not had for them.  The permit, although it may be necessary, is something different from the licence.  The Minister mentioned a permit in respect of certain animals. He mentioned it in connection with bloodstock.  I think the Minister would admit that a permit under this Bill has not got the same character as a licence, and he urged that the provision of a permit for high-class bloodstock is not adding to the character of it.  You cannot detract from the character of an animal, but, nevertheless, we must admit that people who pay some attention to the description in official documents do have regard to matters of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the departure which is made from the Act <Col N="56" /> of 1918 in connection with bloodstock. There was in the Act reference to animals which I think were mentioned as being scheduled in certain stud books.  There is no particular reason why that should not be done here.  I am not at all sure that anything in the nature of supervision by a Government Department is going to make for any great improvement in bloodstock raising.  People engaged in that industry have devoted their lives to it, and very large sums of money have been spent on it.  It would be news to me to learn that any Minister or Department, however well qualified in other respects, is going to make any great improvement in that matter, more especially having regard to the events of the last few years in that connection.  From the success which has attended the efforts of the blood-stock raisers in this country it seems to me inadvisable to interfere with them. The introduction of this measure now brings into bold relief the condition of the horse-breeding industry.  This Bill will not remedy the disadvantage which we have suffered during the last month or two by reason of the loss to this country of the sires Tredennis, Blandford, Trigo and Stratford.  A dozen Bills such as this would not remedy that.  It would be better if, in presenting a measure of this sort, a little more examination was given to the problem, a little more attention to the history of the success of Irish blood-stock, and to the improvement that takes place when animals bred in other countries are brought here and raise stock here.  It would be inadvisable to make any statement which would give undue publicity to the fact, but one of those animals now gone across the water comes from a stock whose progeny in England has not been very successful. When that animal came over here the issue from it was more than successful; it was outstanding in its superiority and in the quality of its produce. What has happened has, as I have said, done more damage than a dozen Bills such as this could possibly remedy.</P>
    <P>I would have expected that in introducing a measure of this sort the Minister would have dealt with the matter in much the same way as his <Col N="57" /> predecessor dealt with stock-breeding Bills.  In reading over this measure the other evening I noticed one section which was not mentioned by the Minister&mdash;Section 17&mdash;at least he did not mention this particular provision in it:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the Minister refuses an application for a licence or a permit under this Act or revokes or suspends a licence or permit granted under this Act, or is of opinion that a stallion to which this Act applies is not suitable for breeding purposes...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is all right, I have no objection to that.  It goes on to say, however:</P>
    <P>...&ldquo;or where an application for a licence or permit under this Act is not made within the prescribed time the Minister may serve on the owner, reputed owner, or other person keeping or having possession of the stallion the subject of such application, licence, permit, or opinion a notice in the prescribed form requiring such person within the time (not being less than fourteen days) specified in such notice to have such stallion castrated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no necessity for that.  Even though the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is there, that ought not to be in the section. This is something over which human agencies have very little control.  One of the most successful stallions in this country was purchased at the yearling sales for £700.  I think the fee for that stallion is four hundred guineas. An animal which won the English Derby and the Grand Prix was bought at the sales for £300.  Having such a provision as that in the section is to my mind a very great mistake.  No person should have such power, whether or not he exercises it.  That provision ought not to be there.  You should stand on the quality of the animal and not on the question of whether or not a person made a mistake through neglect, wilful or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I should like to get from the Minister some explanation as to why thoroughbred blood stock are included in this.  They were excluded under the <Col N="58" /> Act of 1918 on very specific grounds:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A stallion entered in any prescribed stud-book if used for the service of none but mares so entered or mares approved by the Department; or a stallion belonging exclusively to one individual if used for the service of none but mares belonging exclusively to that individual.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that we have any such case as that.  That is the second case. Goodness knows these people are suffering badly enough as things are. Not one mare in four comes over here from England now that came before the Government indulged in these experimental economics.  Nothing whatever has been done or has been attempted to be done to repair the damage to this once important industry.  It affects more than race meetings and thoroughbreds.  It has affected and will affect the horse-breeding industry in this country for all time and no regulations or improvement in finance are going to repair the damage that has been done and that is going to be done by the removal of these four stallions, and perhaps others may follow in their wake.  These people have lost heavily enough up to this and some more consideration should be given to them now than to tell them that they will have to register the stallions and will have to apply for a licence or permit to carry on their work.  I am quite sure that the Department has some very competent officials, but is it contended on behalf of the Minister that they know more about this subject than the people who keep thoroughbred stallions throughout the country?</P>
    <P>There is just one other reference that I should like to make.  One of the disqualifications that the Bill says will not be against the registration of a stallion is that he is affected in his wind.  I should like to hear from the Minister something about that.  I should like to know whether or not any attempts are being made to limit the number of stallions affected in their wind in this country.  Some American publications recently directed attention to what they call this peculiarly Irish <Col N="59" /> disease.  I cannot remember the exact words used, but there was a reference to paralysis of the larynx.  That is not so bad.  I do not mean to say that it is a disability which prevented some horses from doing very good work. One animal suffering in that way won the Grand National in recent years. A bad horse will not win that race. Though it may succeed in winning some other, it will not be able to win the Grand National.  That does not stop some horses, but it is regarded in certain countries as an indisposition peculiar to this country, for what reason I do not know.  While one might exercise a discretion, it is not necessary to put it into an Act of Parliament, practically admitting that the thing is here. There have been cases in which this particular disability has been cured. I would suggest, at any rate, that if it is possible to get animals that are sound in their wind it would be all the better for the industry.</P>
    <P>The real reason for this measure, the Minister states, is that some of these stallions are used for other purposes. Great attempts have been made in recent years to re-establish what is known as the Connemara pony, and animals employed as stallions are also employed at other work down the country.  I do not know whether it is intended to increase whatever allowance is made to a person for keeping one of those animals.  But from what has come under my notice it would be almost an impossibility for them to live on that or at least to maintain an animal exclusively for breeding purposes in such districts as those.  If an alteration in policy is intended in that direction it ought not to be brought into operation without consultation with some local persons who are acquainted with all the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred largely to the introduction of thoroughbred horses into this Bill, and I would myself like if the Minister would give us some more information as to why he did include them.  If <Col N="60" /> there is one section of this community who are experts at their business I should say they are the people who are breeding horses, whether they are thoroughbred horses or other horses. Breeders and dealers in horses in this country have a reputation for their knowledge of horses&mdash;their knowledge not alone of the breeding of horses but of the buying and selling of horses as well.  There is no Minister or no Minister's official or no expert that the Minister can find who is capable of telling the ordinary horse-breeder of this country his business.  I make that assertion without any fear of general contradiction.  I may be contradicted by the Minister, but I will not be contradicted by the bulk of opinion in this country, or in any outside country, when I say that the horse-breeders in Ireland have a natural aptitude for their business.  It is universally recognised. If this Bill were restricted to a certain type of thoroughbred horse which the Minister, I expect, has in mind&mdash;perhaps a thoroughbred horse that was mated with certain mares for which there was a subsidy provided&mdash; there might be some excuse for it.  If the Minister or any particular agricultural society is going to subsidise mares they have certainly a right to have some say in the sire.  If the Minister had that intention I dare say that the House would give him power to interfere in cases of that kind&mdash;he has a certain power in that regard under the old Act&mdash;but power to interfere with the whole business of the rearing of thoroughbred horses in this country is a power which I hope this House will not give him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the number of sires which have left this country.  I venture to predict that if the powers in this Bill are given to the Minister&mdash;I do not believe the present Minister or any future Minister will dare to exercise them, but if some unfortunate Minister did attempt to exercise the powers in this Bill in regard to thoroughbred horses&mdash;95 per cent. of the good sires which are in this country will leave it within 24 hours. Does the Minister tell me that any official of his Department or any of the experts to be appointed under <Col N="61" /> Section 18 of this Bill will be at all as competent to judge the suitability of a thoroughbred sire as many of the breeders of this country who have been raising thoroughbred stock during the last 15 or 20 years?  Take the case of a man with one of the sire stallions in County Kildare or County Limerick with fees from £100 to £300.  I myself know that some of those sires might not conform, in the actual beauty or build of the beast, to the opinion of certain judges of ordinary horses, and some expert of the Minister might come along and say: &ldquo;This horse it not fit to be a sire,&rdquo; although some of these horses have produced possibly the greatest thoroughbreds this country or any other country has ever produced.  You are opening the thoroughbred stock industry of this country to the possibility of some nincompoop appointed by the Minister coming down to a man with an established sire and saying: &ldquo;This sire is not, in general build and appearance, such as I should think desirable.&rdquo;  I do not say that power is going to be exercised.  I venture to say that no man dare exercise it, but why give any future Minister the power to do such a thing?  It passes my comprehension.</P>
    <P>As I said before, breeders of thoroughbred stock in this country need no interference with their industry. They are the world's greatest experts in that particular industry. They have taught the breeders of bloodstock in England and other countries how to breed horses.  They have established a reputation for the breeding of thoroughbred horses in this country that no other country can hope to compete with.  The Minister brings in a section in this Bill which the men who brought in the previous Bills&mdash;with a foresight of what might happen&mdash;took precautions to exclude. The Minister has made no argument why thoroughbred horses should be included in this Bill, except that he said there might be confusion.  There may be confusion in regard to thoroughbred horses that are mated with certain mares which the Department subsidises.  That particular form of thoroughbred horse is not the horse <Col N="62" /> which the breeders of thoroughbred stock largely use, and the Minister could have protected himself by simply providing that those particular horses should be under the Minister's authority to veto or not as he chooses.  I, for one, hope that this House is not going to give the Minister the power he asks for over thoroughbred horses in this country.  What we really want is to get a chance of selling the horses we have.  In regard to that particular matter I have noticed in the statistics a rather lamentable occurrence. We in this country are breeding the best horses in the world.  Some of the horses we sold at scrap prices last year are winning the greatest races in England and all over the world at the present moment.  Many of those were horses sold at £40 or £50&mdash;horses that might possibly be scrapped by some experts.  In 1931 we exported 8,347 horses to England.  They were valued by the English Department themselves at about £1,750,000, or a sum of about £210 each.  In 1932 we exported 7,520 horses.  They were valued at about £1,450,000 or £152 each.  That was for a ten months period.  In the ten months of this year we exported 8,745 horses.  They were valued at the sum of £140,000 odd or £38 each.  A Bill to rectify that state of affairs is what we need in this country and not a Bill to tell the thoroughbred breeders of this country how to breed horses.</P>
    <P>There may have been reasons for interfering with other live stock&mdash; cattle for instance&mdash;in order to check the breeding of scrub bulls, but I never heard of any breeder of high-class horses raising a scrub sire.  No farmer with any intelligence who owned a good mare would breed from a scrub sire.  The average Munster farmer, in Tipperary or Limerick with ten acres of land, is a greater expert in these matters than many officials in the Minister's Department.  In saying that I am not by any means reflecting on the officials.</P>
    <P>There is a section in the Bill which says, forsooth, that the Act will not be confined to horses used as sires.  The unfortunate farmer with a two-year-old <Col N="63" /> or a yearling that he could not sell at the sales last August, and which he kept in the hope that the animal might turn out useful, will be compelled to approach the Minister with his hat in his hand to ask for a licence to keep the horse for 11 months, or otherwise to geld him.  Perhaps that horse would, in future, be of great benefit to this country, by proving himself a racehorse. I do not contemplate that any of these provisions of the Bill are going to be largely taken advantage of by the present Minister, nor, I hope, by the next Minister for Agriculture. I have always agitated that a provision that is not to be used should never be put into a Bill of this kind.  We had several Bills where similar sections were inserted and we had the Ministers concerned getting up and saying that they would never be put into effect. I consider that a nonsensical argument to put before an intelligent House.  If these provisions are not going to be used they should be left out.  At any rate the references to thoroughbred horses and to thoroughbred breeders should be left out of the Bill.  Unless the Minister states that he is prepared to exempt thoroughbred horses, except in cases where they are used for mares subsidised by the Department, I will oppose this Bill at every stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree generally with what other speakers on the Opposition Benches have stated, but I propose to deal with another aspect of the question.  While I agree with the objects of the Bill, I do not think the Minister has gone the best way about securing that object.  I suggest that there should be no interference with the liberty of people engaged in the industry, because they have proved themselves to be efficient.  The Minister should be slow about restricting the liberties of the people concerned, without very grave reasons.  Some provision should be put into the Bill instructing owners of mares on the best way of utilising these animals.  I have some experience of this question and, notwithstanding the splendid horses bred in this country, there are what is known in the business as &ldquo;weeds,&rdquo; due <Col N="64" /> to improper mating.  The Minister could do a great deal to improve horse breeding by having a pamphlet issued by the Department instructing owners of mares on the best methods of mating. Farmers in the south of Ireland who go in for the breeding of high class horses know their business better than those who are directing them, but small farmers with small mares do not understand a great deal about horse breeding.  Sometimes they use thoroughbred sires with mares that are unsuitable, and instead of breeding thoroughbreds or hunters they get &ldquo;weeds.&rdquo;  I would not be in favour of restricting owners from using any stallions they choose, but the Department could do a great deal to help by instructing them on the best methods. There are well-bred two- and three-year-old horses, but they are too light to be useful for farm purposes, or as hunters, troopers, or polo ponies.  It is desirable that some clause should be inserted in the Bill, so that the advice of experts would be available for small farmers who do not understand much about horse breeding.  On the next stage I hope the Minister will insert a provision to that effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If possible, the Minister should not interfere with thoroughbred breeding because, as long as I can remember this country has been famous for the breeding of thoroughbred horses.  These horses have won races all over the world.  In the past, every Government in Europe came to this country for troopers.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that in County Cork farmers always kept strong agricultural horses as sires.  The Department seems to be against allowing Clydesdales and other breeds to stand in County Cork.  The Department considered these breeds dirty, and too heavy to be mated with mares bred by farmers.  Strong mares of the Irish breed produced very useful cart horses, weighing from 13 cwts. to 14 cwts., and capable of drawing a couple of tons in the cities.  That class of horse has disappeared.  I know of a firm in Cork which gave an order recently for two of these horses for lorry work.  There was no question about the price to be paid if suitable <Col N="65" /> horses could be had.  It was not possible to find such horses, and the firm was eventually compelled to get a lorry.  That has occurred very often. Some time ago I was asked to buy a good cart horse.  I had to search County Cork to find one.  It would not be possible to get six good cart horses, although I often bought 60 of them a few years ago.  Buyers from Belfast and Glasgow always came to Cork for such horses.  The Department seems to favour the wide draft horse, and would not give licences to import other classes.  I do not think Irish draft horses are suitable for the work they are called upon to do in this country. They are not strong enough or heavy enough, and when a farmer brings them to a fair he cannot sell them to the city people for work.  A farmer with the colt I spoke of, of from two to three years old, does his farm work with it, and he sells it at the age of from four to five years.  He usually got about £45 for that horse, and that paid his rent, and you cannot sell a horse bred from an Irish draft for anything like it.  I have as much experience as anybody else of horses.  I think we have always worked about 40 horses, and I suppose I bought more cart horses for the British Government than anybody in Ireland, and I would advise the Minister strongly that if anybody wants to get such a horse into County Cork, to let him have a permit, and give him permission to stand such a horse in County Cork.  I would also ask him not to interfere with the thoroughbred horse breeding industry, because the people who breed such horses know too much about their business for him to interfere with them.</P>

      <P>The point raised by the last speaker, Deputy Desmond, is a point that has been raised with me by Deputies on many occasions since I became Minister for Agriculture. Perhaps I might allay some of the suspicions of Deputy Bennett and others by saying that I am a most diffident person in dealing with horses and, in fact, I should not like in any way to put my opinion against the advice of the Department of Agriculture, in the matter of horses at any rate.  I have carried on the policy <Col N="66" /> that was carried on before I came into the Department in regard to the breeds of horses to be encouraged in this country.  I intend, however, as soon as this Bill goes through&mdash;and I hope it will go through in spite of Deputy Bennett and others&mdash;to set up a consultative council under the Bill. We will have on that council representatives of the bloodstock breeders, representatives of the thoroughbred owners in the country, the breeders of hunters, etc., and also advocates for Clydesdales and other breeds.  Arguments can be put up at that council on behalf of all those breeds and in that way we hope to get a better policy, if possible, in the matter of the breeding of horses in this country than has been pursued in the past. The way I look on the thing personally is that the Irish hunter is famous the world over and, in fact, I saw it advertised in Paris myself as the best meat for consumption&mdash;&ldquo;Hunter Irlandais&rdquo; at so much a pound.  The hunter itself is famous the world over and the racers are also very famous, so that we have something distinctive in our racehorses and hunters.  In breeding the half-bred Clydesdale, however, we would not have anything distinctively Irish.  It may be a profitable horse and if it is a profitable horse in certain parts of the country, and if that point is put strongly at the consultative council I speak of, something may be done in that regard, but, in the meantime, I would not undertake the responsibility of turning down a policy that has been pursued by the Department up to this in encouraging the thoroughbred and Irish draft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGovern made the point that we should try to educate the farmers rather than to use compulsion in the form of a Bill and I think there is something to be said for that.  It is a point of view I sympathise with but I think that that sort of education, by means of leaflets and the Department's schemes with the county committees of agriculture, has been going on for some years and people have got the opportunity of getting the service of good stallions.  They are getting them cheap and in many cases, free, so that you have a fair amount of education going on in the horse breed <Col N="67" /> ing industry for the ordinary farmer for many years.  This is a Bill brought in to deal with those who will not listen to education or anything else.  The point has been made here by many speakers that the Bill was not necessary but some of these speakers admitted that the Live-stock Breeding Act that was brought in to deal with bulls and boars was necessary. Some speakers have also made the point that breeders of horses know what they are doing and will not use inferior stallions because they are rearing horses for themselves.  The very same thing applied to cows.  The people who owned cows knew very well that they were breeding from inferior bulls and yet a Bill had to be brought into this House and passed into law to prevent farmers from keeping scrub bulls&mdash;and preventing them from doing so for their own good&mdash; and compelling them to keep good bulls.  This is a Bill on the same lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is what this Bill is for and if the Deputy would read the Bill, he would know what he was talking about.  The point is that it was found necessary to deal with some farmers in that way, and it was done in their own interests.  They knew that it was in their own interests to keep good bulls but they would not do so.  We propose to make the same regulations with regard to stallions so that there will be no opportunity for farmers to make the mistake of breeding from poor stallions.  Deputy Curran started off by saying that he had not read the Bill and he made a slightly more intelligent speech than usual even though he had not read it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, perhaps, a hint to him not to take any particular interest in the reading of Bills.  He talked a lot about interfering with the two-year-old that was in training, but there is a provision in the Bill to give a permit in the case of a horse that is used for training.  I do not think that any Deputy condemned the Bill outright. <Col N="68" /> Some condemned it because we were dealing with bloodstock or some particular class of stallions, but if the Bill is to go through at all, we must include the whole lot.  If that is not agreed, let us have an intelligent amendment, if such a thing is possible from the Opposition, to exclude some particular class of horse for some good reason, and it will be considered.  The difficulty would be to exclude any particular class of horse and not destroy the whole effect of the Bill. For instance, take the thoroughbred stallion about which there is so much talk.  There are thoroughbred stallions in the Stud Book and they are used only for mares in the Stud Book.  How will you exclude those, if they are to be excluded, without vitiating the Bill?  If we exclude those by amendment, it will be necessary, I take it, if a complaint is made to us that a stallion is not used for thoroughbred mares in the Stud Book alone, to have powers to ascertain whether that is the case or not, and if we have to get powers to go in and examine an owner's books and his business to see whether or not he is evading the Act, he might as well get a permit and be done with it.  He will have no more trouble at all if he does so.  To come a little bit lower, that stallion used for mares in the Stud Book alone may be used for mares which are considered thoroughbreds and so on and it will be necessary to draw the line some place.  These horses get old and defective and bad in the wind.  I am told that the big majority, in fact, the overwhelming majority, of the veterinary profession consider that a defect in the wind is hereditary and that, therefore, such horses should not be used for breeding.  That old horse becomes defective and he was once the bloodstock horse which is sacrosanct so far as the Opposition is concerned and which should not be interfered with. That defective horse can be used and the farmer can do what he likes with it and if that is so, we might as well have no Bill at all.  We must license them or give them a permit.  We must know what they are and we must be able to get in touch with the owners to see what happens to them because the great difficulty about them is that <Col N="69" /> they may contract some disease that is hereditary and may be sold for some small sum, with the result that we do not know how they will be used and we cannot keep track of them.</P>
      <P>I have never claimed, and I am sure the Department has never claimed, that we know more about the subject than the owners of bloodstock.  We do not know more about it, or even half as much.  It would be impossible for a Minister for Agriculture, no matter how clever he was, to be a real expert in all these things.  In fact, the Minister for Agriculture, in bringing in a Bill like this, must rely to a certain extent upon what the people themselves say.  Whatever Deputies may say, the people connected with the horse-breeding industry, that we have consulted in this matter, have told us that the Bill is necessary, every one of them.  They have, I admit, said that there might be exceptions made in certain cases, and if anybody in this House is prepared to put down an intelligent amendment to exempt some horses it will be very sympathetically considered.  Deputy Cosgrave asked about Section 17, and he said that we should not have power, because a person is late in applying for a licence, to go in and insist on castration.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that under another section a person has a right to apply for a licence, even though he is late, if he pays the increased fee.  I do not think Deputy Bennett made any point except to reiterate the nonsense uttered by previous speakers about the powers taken in this Bill.  If Deputy Bennett would give half the time and attention that he devoted to his speech to the consideration of an intelligent amendment dealing with the point he put, it would be considered.  He says that we are sending down nincompoops to say to the owner of a horse that that horse is not fit.  That is what is going on in the case of all the Live-stock Breeding Acts.  The same thing applies in the case of bulls, boars and other animals. A veterinary surgeon will be sent down, whether he is a nincompoop or not, and he will know his business in these matters.</P>

      <P>I do not know how many of these amendments might be considered together, but down practically to No. 11 they follow a common idea and are moved with one object. I think everybody is agreed that a measure such as this, simplifying the procedure for harbour boards, is desirable and that a harbour authority should not have to proceed by way of a Bill every time it wishes to make an alteration in its powers.  Some people, however, feel that in departing from the powers that are conferred on the harbour authorities and practically making the Minister autocratic, we are proceeding from one anomaly to another.  The first sub-section of Section 3 reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may if and whenever he thinks fit on the application of the harbour authority ... or without any such application ... fix all or any of the rates or where he so thinks fit ... restricting or otherwise regulating the rates or the maximum or minimum rates chargeable by such harbour authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a report made by the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, and in paragraph 1085 of that Report a recommendation was made that the harbour rates to be fixed by the Department of Industry and Commerce, either in the first instance or subsequently on revision, should be the maximum charges and not the actual rates <Col N="74" /> leviable.  In paragraph 1086 a recommendation is made that the fixing, within the limits of the approved maxima, of the actual rates to be charged on vessels and goods should continue to be made by the harbour boards.  The Report recommends that a simpler system of fixing rates should be introduced.  The amendment of the section standing in my name provides for the simpler fixing of the maxima rates.  Anyone interested can apply to the Minister who, under Section 5, must give notice before he makes any order.  I do not see any necessity for the Minister to act on his own initiative except in a case where the revenue of any harbour is insufficient or excessive and the harbour authority refuses to increase or reduce the rates as required.  These amendments are really a slight alteration of the procedure under the Bill.  Some harbour authorities in the past have gone wrong and possibly some in the future will go wrong in regard to certain rates that they charge.  At the same time, they are conversant with local conditions and, usually, all the interests necessary are represented on those boards.  I suggest to the Minister that if he takes out of their hands the fixing of maximum and minimum rates, or rather the alteration of the rates within those limits, he will take from the local harbour board a very desirable scheme or a very desirable system by which they have to budget for their own needs, and they will lose a certain amount of interest and feel that a considerable amount of authority has been taken out of their hands.  The Minister, I am sure, is aware that certain individuals may from time to time make representations to him and it would be very difficult, without long and protracted investigation, to find out whether it is some individual who has made representations or the harbour board on the spot.  I suggest to the Minister that the amendments cover practically all the phases that will occur during the present time when rates have to be varied. The harbour authorities are left with certain powers to vary the rates <Col N="75" /> according as local conditions may dictate that they should be varied. Provision has also been made for the Minister, where harbour authorities have either charged too much or too little, to bring them to book.  I suggest to the Minister that the amendments standing in my name on the Order Paper, provide an easier, a simpler and a better way of carrying out the work of the harbour boards than is outlined under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 3 of the Bill, as the Deputy has stated, gives the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to alter harbour rates, whether maximum or actual rates, whether on an application made to the Minister or on the Minister's own initiative.  The Deputy's amendments &mdash;I think the majority of the amendments standing in his name down to No. 18&mdash;seek to limit the Minister's power to the alteration of maximum rates only and for the purpose of securing merely that in any case the general level of rates will be sufficient for the purposes of the harbour.  In that connection the Deputy quoted the recommendation of the Port and Harbours Tribunal.  In relation to this matter, however, the Port and Harbours Tribunal made a number of recommendations, of which the Deputy quoted only one.  The recommendation which he quoted related to the procedure necessary where a harbour authority desires to change its rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;1085&mdash;and in such cases where application is made by the harbour authority it would certainly be the ordinary practice that maximum rates only would be fixed; but the Port and Harbours Tribunal made other recommendations.  I would refer the Deputy to paragraphs 1087 and 1088.  Paragraph 1087 relates to the possibility of complaints being made concerning actual rates.  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There remains the question of dealing with complaints by traders or shipowners who may consider themselves aggrieved by the rates actually charged in particular cases. <Col N="76" /> The Department of Industry and Commerce should have power to deal with such complaints, and, after due inquiry, to vary by order any rates charged by a harbour board, which, in the opinion of the Department, operate unjustly or have been fixed as a result of prejudice or unfair partiality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1088 reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend, further, that the Department should be empowered to move with a view to varying maximum rates and, in certain circumstances, to enforce the levying of actual rates without an application from an interested party.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fixation of actual rates by the Minister, whether on application by a trader or shipowner or on his own initiative, is necessary to prevent injustice. It has been found that harbour boards, constituted as they are at present, are sometimes prone to favour particular interests, and the same reason can be advanced in justification of giving the Minister power to move on his own initiative in these matters.  The Deputy is anxious that the initiative should be taken from the Minister, but I would draw his attention to the fact that Orders made, such as the Buncrana Order, the Foynes Order, and in the case of the Cork Harbour Act, all give to the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to vary the rates on his own initiative. In an earlier part of the Report of the Port and Harbours Tribunal, paragraph 363, the Tribunal drew attention to the fact that the incidence of charges at the Port of Dublin had varied considerably as between the post-war years and 1927, when the Tribunal reported, in respect of tonnage dues and cargo rates.  They also drew attention to the fact that a similar state of things prevailed at Cork.  Ordinarily the power of direct interference by the Minister will be utilised only on very rare occasions, and where obvious injustice exists or there is obvious need for such interference, but having regard to the circumstances which are known to exist and to the Report of the Port and <Col N="77" /> Harbours Tribunal, I think it would be a mistake that that initiative should be taken away and, consequently, I should be disposed to resist the Deputy's amendments.</P>

      <P>That would appear to arise more under Sections 4 and 5 than here, where provision is made in certain circumstances for public notification of any application for or intention to modify the rates with power given to all interested parties to make representations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this measure, I invited your attention, a Chinn Comhairle, at the beginning of the proceedings, to a matter which I ask leave to raise now.  This Bill was referred to a Committee of the whole House.  I suggest to the Minister that, owing to its character, it could be more effectively dealt with by Special Committee. The reason I advance for that <Col N="80" /> suggestion is that the Bill has been practically adopted <i>in toto</i> from the British statute.  The British Act of Parliament has been in force for a considerable number of years and there is a mass of judicial decisions upon it.  It would be of great advantage if persons familiar with the practice of workmen's compensation law had an opportunity of sitting down over the Bill, so as to amend it in the light of judicial comment on certain sections which have been in operation in Britain for some time.  I make the proposal because I believe that certain sections of the Act are, owing to their uncertainty, reacting very unfavourably on the workmen of Great Britain. It will be extremely difficult to clarify these sections unless an opportunity is afforded of calling in expert opinion from the Bench, from the legal professions and, possibly, from the trade unions, in order to assist in devising a form of words which will obviate here a great deal of the litigation that is taking place elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it desirable that this Bill should be referred to such a Committee as the Deputy suggests.  The necessity for amending the workmen's compensation code has been under consideration for a long time.  An Inter-Departmental Committee was established and a voluminous report was prepared by it and is available.  The Department of Industry and Commerce has had the whole subject under consideration for a number of years and the Bill is the product of two successive Governments. The Bill was prepared in skeleton form by one Government and, with certain amendments, has been introduced by another Government. Any points the Deputy wishes to suggest, or any amendments he wishes to propose, can be fully discussed here. We must not forget that the public are interested, very definitely, in the Bill. If there is any desire to leave special matters over for consideration, I should not be averse to allowing quite a considerable time to elapse between the Committee Stage and the Report Stage, and, if the number of amendments necessitated it, I should be <Col N="81" /> prepared to have the Bill recommitted on Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister has missed the point of Deputy Dillon's proposal.  The whole subject of workmen's compensation legislation, and its amendment, was referred to a Committee in the year 1925, so far as I remember.  That Committee reported in about a year. Deputy Dillon makes the point, which is a sound point, that since 1926 there has been quite an amount of judicial interpretation of the Act upon which this Bill is founded.  If that Committee were sitting to-day, there is reason to believe that it would produce a different report.  If it had this Bill before it as a skeleton measure, there is reason to believe that it would recommend a number of improvements. The suggestion is made that it would be well to have the advice of people who are experienced, both on the legal and on the workmen's side, brought to bear upon the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes the point that this is a matter of public interest.  So it is, and putting it before a Special Committee would not detract from its public interest because it would again have to be discussed here; but it would come here for discussion in a way that would shorten the proceedings considerably. The Minister says that this measure has been under consideration for a long time.  So it has.  If the Minister has any programme in mind for the enactment of this as law, and if he will state that programme, we could then form impressions as to whether a Select Committee would delay its progress.  If the Minister says he is likely to give a long period between the Committee and Report Stages, and even to re-commit the measure on the Report Stage, I assume he has abandoned any intention of getting the Bill through prior to Christmas.  If that is so, there is no reason why this Bill could not be submitted to a Select Committee for consideration. I am convinced that that Select Committee would present to the House a measure which, in the light of what has happened since 1926, would be a better measure and it would not be subject to a discussion here which <Col N="82" /> would in any way tend to delay its ultimate operation.</P>
    <P>If it is not intended to have this Bill made law, passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas, prior to the end of February or the beginning of March, I can assure the Minister there will be no hindrance by reason of having it sent to a Select Committee. There is ample material arising out of judicial decisions since 1926 to enable the Select Committee to make useful suggestions.  In view of the bad working in England of the legislation on which this Bill is founded, there is ample material to enable a Select Committee to do good work.  The normal course of the Bill will not be held up and I believe the Bill itself, following its consideration by a Select Committee, will be much better from the angle of the workman.  If the Bill is let through in its present form it will be very much better from the angle of the legal profession.</P>

      <P>Surely it is manifest to the Minister that this measure is practically word for word the same as the British statute, and very reasonably so.  No one is commenting adversely on that at all, but in the light of that fact, with this similarity and the mass of judicial decisions, a variety of things <Col N="83" /> will arise for consideration.  I will give one example.  Take Section 5, sub-section (2), paragraph (b) (i), &ldquo;employed for the purposes of his employer's trade or business.&rdquo;  That in itself requires reconsideration because that was put in to try and improve on an older section and in the opinion of many judges it has made confusion worse confounded.  In the light of all the decisions given on those words, if skilled persons were to give assistance to a Select Committee it might well be that we could draft a new form of words which would obviate an enormous amount of litigation that is bound to come on existing decisions, if these words are allowed to remain.</P>

We cannot do that here without the expert advice and guidance that this type of person can give us.  This House in Committee has no means of getting that advice, whereas a select committee has.  My proposal is purely for the purpose of seizing the opportunity we have of codifying the workmen's compensation law in the best possible way. Once the measure is passed, probably no attempt will be made in our generation to codify the law.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 1:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), lines 17-18, to delete paragraph (b) (iii).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has to do with the problem of the casual labourer.  To follow the section is not so easy, because we have first a definition of a workman, and in sub-section (2) we have a declaration, &ldquo;each of the following persons shall be an excepted person for the purposes of this section,&rdquo; that is to say, a person to whom this Act will not apply. Paragraph (b) states that one of these excepted persons shall be a person whose employment is of a casual nature.  Paragraph (iii) brings into the operation of the Act a casual <Col N="86" /> labourer employed for the purpose of any work in or about the residence of his employer.</P>
    <P>The decided cases have given a very wide interpretation to the word &ldquo;about.&rdquo;  It is rather difficult to discuss the effect of the word &ldquo;about,&rdquo; but it seems to be very elastic, and a casual labourer &ldquo;employed for the purposes of any work in or about the residence of his employer,&rdquo; might mean a labourer employed within a half mile of his employer's residence.  The danger of bringing casual labourers of that class within the scope of this Bill is that in effect it will prevent such persons getting any work at all.  In the Report prepared by the Departmental Committee in 1925 or 1926 &ldquo;casual labourer&rdquo; is referred to.  &ldquo;Most of the witnesses representing the employers,&rdquo; the report says, &ldquo;appreciate the difficulties in including such cases while yet excluding the type of casual worker represented by a person engaged to carry luggage, say, to or from a railway station or elsewhere.&rdquo; They have been segregated by confining the application of the Bill to &ldquo;in or about the residence of his employer.&rdquo; But that definition brings in a man employed to clean the windows, and it brings in a man who might earn 2/6 for sweeping off the dead leaves in the garden, or almost everybody of the type to whom one would give a job of work, out of charity rather than out of a desire to get a day's work done.  It seems perfectly clear that if by giving a man a few shillings to sweep a chimney or clean up garden paths you are going to make yourself liable under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and for everything that the Workmen's Compensation Act will make you liable, you will not be very ready to employ such persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite see the Deputy's point.  The argument can be made that a man working as a casual labourer should have the benefit of the Workmen's Compensation Act, and that he ought not be denied the benefit of that Act.  But what is the use of giving him the benefit of the Act by statute if the <Col N="87" /> net result of it is that he will never get any work at all?  You can over-protect people so much that you can deprive a man who is getting a decent livelihood doing odd jobs from getting any employment at all.  It is a nice question which side of the balance is being weighed down.  The result of one action against an employer of that class of man will be that you will stop such men getting any work at all.  That will be the result of telling the employer that he is liable for these men.  Take the City of Dublin, for instance.  There are dozens of families in the City of Dublin who are saved from destitution by the fact that members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society go round amongst their friends and ask them to give these unemployed men a day's work.  You give such men a job about the house occasionally.  But if these people are to be made liable for workmen's compensation in respect of these casual labourers they will not employ them any longer.  We are not making them liable for the consequences of our neglect for any injury that the workman sustains as a result.  He has all the protection already through the ordinary law in respect of any accident that may result by our neglect.  But the liability that this Bill will impose will be a liability for the personal neglect of the casual worker himself, if a casual labourer is employed.  It is a nice question, whether you are to give him the benefit of the Act and run the risk of depriving him of any opportunity of employment, or whether you will say that these people should not be deprived of earning their livelihood and getting a casual day's work here and there.  On the whole I am against their inclusion in the Bill.  I believe that the benefits they will derive from being included in this Bill are far out-weighed by the risk that will result to the worker by reason of losing an opportunity for employment.  That is the only thing that weighs down my judgment.  That is why I propose the amendment which stands in my name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment.  Deputy Dillon must have convinced himself <Col N="88" /> that the amendment is right, because he has adverted only to one side of the case, but if he looked at the other side of the case he ought to be able to convince himself that there are sound reasons for including the person so described in the Bill within the benefits of the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  It is true that in existing circumstances people are condemned to obtain any employment they can in circumstances which give the employment a charitable aspect, and in circumstances where the person employed has to while away his time because somebody takes compassion upon his difficulties.  But Deputy Dillon has not told the House what is to happen the dependants of that man if in the course of his employment he loses his life.  Deputy Dillon says if he employs a man and the man loses his life because of negligence on the part of the employer, there is a remedy.  There is a remedy, but the natural and effective remedy is his inclusion in the Workmen's Compensation Bill.  The casual worker would have to prove very definite negligence on the part of the employer.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is surrounded by a battery of lawyers who, no doubt, have advised him, but if he had the experience of any trade unionist in the country he would know how difficult it is to succeed in law in such a case.  The Deputy wants these people excluded because he says &ldquo;you may endanger their employment.&rdquo; Possibly you may with persons of a particular mentality, but when you consider that these employers can be covered under the Workmen's Compensation Acts by a relatively small sum you will see how reasonable it is to include them.  I do not see that the new liability upon an employer should operate as a reason against employing casual labourers.  The weakness in the Deputy's case is that he has not told <Col N="89" /> the House at all what is to happen to the wife and the four or five children that such a man may leave as dependants. He has no remedy for these circumstances and no remedy has been suggested.  It is because I think it is desirable to provide for the benefit of the children in such cases that I am opposing this amendment.  That is much more necessary than to consider the percentage of potential employers who may refuse to employ such men. That is why I ask the Minister not to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I find myself in complete agreement with Deputy Norton in this case and against Deputy Dillon, and for the reasons that Deputy Norton has given, that employers of casual labour can cover themselves by comparatively small amounts.  So far as I know the position at the moment is this: if I employ a man to do a job in or about my house and that man is endangered in the course of his work or killed in the course of that work, I am personally responsible in so far as I have to meet the responsibility.  I would like to know from the Minister if there is any definition of casual worker or of what is casual work.  I do not think it is in the Bill, and in my opinion it is desirable that we should have some definition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that this is, perhaps, the most important point in the whole section, because, as I see it, if the section is passed with or without Deputy Dillon's amendment the whole matter is going to be left to the interpretation of the courts, and the courts will have to decide what is and what is not casual.  There is no lead being given to the courts here. I want to suggest that it is not fair, either to the labourer or to the employer, that the matter should be left as loosely as it is.  I think we ought to get down to that.  On the amendment, I must say that I find myself in agreement with Deputy Norton.  I have had a fairly long experience in the number of these cases in my own area, and I must say that I think the sub-section is necessary. I agree absolutely with Deputy Norton that it is almost impossible to prove negligence in the courts.  As one who has been associated for a great number of years with workers and with trade unions, I can speak with some knowledge on this.  My experience has been that not only have you to prove negligence but you have got to prove gross negligence in the courts, and so far as the ordinary workers are concerned, while that continues to be the practice, their dependants in a case where a man loses his life might as well throw their hat at it as take a case to the courts. They will get nothing and might as well go and look for outdoor relief. That, I fear, will be the result even in cases where people have a trades union behind them, and of course it has to be remembered that in very many of these cases those chiefly concerned have no trades union behind them at all.</P>

      <P>So far as the definition of casual labourer is concerned, it may be possible to find it in the dictionary, but so far as legal decisions go dealing with the expression &ldquo;casual labourer,&rdquo;<Col N="91" /> the judges in England at all events have decided that it is incapable of exact legal definition.  Here we have a few pages of definitions, or attempts at definitions, of casual labourers, and attempts at defining, in a certain state of facts, whether a particular individual was or was not a casual labourer.  I think Deputy Morrissey will have to wait for some considerable time before he gets any sort of definition of casual labourer.  The purpose that Deputy Dillon had in mind in putting down the amendment was really to safeguard a particular class of casual labourer.  It is true that anyone with any sense, who is in the habit of employing labourers or servants from time to time for casual work or in a casual way, will take the elementary precaution of covering himself with an insurance company for a small sum, but before you can get an insurance policy you have got to tell the insurance company what particular type of individual you are going to employ or how often you intend to employ him.  You cannot simply go to an insurance company and ask them to issue a policy to you for a small sum which will cover you against every possible contingency and every possible employment that you give out of charity.</P>

    <P>What Deputy Dillon is aiming at is to cover this class of people who are given work out of motives of kindness by various people from time to time, and it is really to protect their wives and children while they are alive that Deputy Dillon has put down this amendment.  Deputy Norton asked what is to become of the wife and children if a man dies as a result of his employment.  The object of Deputy Dillon's amendment, as I understand it, is to try and provide for the wife and children while he is alive, because the effect of the section, as Deputy Dillon said, and I am in agreement with him, is that while he is alive he will not get this casual employment, and that is the danger.  Deputy Dillon's amendment is put down in the interests of working men.  I will give an instance of the kind of thing that I think is in the back of his mind.  It <Col N="92" /> used to be the custom in the City of Dublin, when I was a boy&mdash;I do not think it exists so much now&mdash;for people to go around with a shears to cut grass in peoples front gardens.  A man would call on people asking if he might cut the grass for them.  The job usually took about an hour.  He would call at a number of houses.  People, in order to give him employment&mdash;not because they could not go and cut the grass themselves with a machine but because they wanted to give him something to do and because he was anxious to do the work&mdash;would give him a few shillings for cutting the grass.  Now that will stop if this section is put in.</P>
    <P>I may remark in passing that this particular section is not in the British Bill.  I would like the Minister to say for what particular reason it has been inserted in this Bill.  I should welcome it, and so should Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Rice, because, in this particular two-line clause, there are vast possibilities of our earning money in the courts.  Therefore I think Deputy Norton can make his mind easy as regards our advocacy of this sub-clause in the section.  It is put forward in the interests of working men.  If it were being put forward in any other interest there might be something to be said for Deputy Norton's point of view.</P>

      <P>I agree that there is a lot to be said, and I think Deputy Dillon admitted that there is a lot to be said, pro and con for this amendment. I should like to have considered impartially, whether it is not better for the class of employee intended to be covered by this that they should be left outside this Bill rather than be put into it.  I can appreciate Deputy Norton's desire to have every working man get every possible advantage under this Bill.  We all have that desire, that this Workmen's Compensation Bill should in every possible way be for the benefit of working people, but in carrying out that desire we have got to safeguard the position that we may be interfering with the <Col N="93" /> interests of working men in our desire to protect their interests.</P>
      <P>Though what I am about to say may not be entirely relevant, I may perhaps call Deputy Norton's attention to what, I am sure, he must have had experience of himself&mdash;that is, to cases where workmen are not able to get employment at all because of the fact that insurance companies will not take up their risk.  The result is that these people are put on unemployment relief or on poor relief although they are anxious to get work and are capable and willing to work, and although the work is available for them.  Despite all that, employers will not employ them because of some physical defect or for some other reason they will not be taken on as a risk by insurance companies.  I can give one instance from my own experience of a man who lost his leg.  He is admittedly an expert tradesman.  The loss of his leg would not prevent him from carrying on that particular trade in which he is an expert.  That man is being relieved by the St. Vincent de Paul Society because he is unable to get employment from any employer carrying on the business in which he is an expert, and that is due to the fact that no insurance company will take up his risk owing to his having only one leg.  The fact is that although this man has only one leg, that does not interfere in any way with his carrying on with his particular trade.  Similar consideration might apply to the class of people Deputy Dillon intends to protect.  This amendment is for the benefit of the workmen.  Similar considerations might apply in their case. I think the amendment is worthy of impartial consideration.  While appreciating Deputy Morrissey's point of view and Deputy Norton's, I think that there is a lot in this amendment which should receive very serious consideration from the Minister.</P>

      <P>The principle of this Bill is set out in the first sub-section of section 15, which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) If in any employment personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment is caused to a workman, his employer <Col N="94" /> shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be liable to pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>Because of the obvious practical difficulty, casual workers have had to be excluded from the terms of the existing workmen's compensation code and are excluded from this Act with the exceptions stated in paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of sub-section (2) of Section 5. What is casual work?  Whether a particular employment is casual or not is a matter of fact to be determined by a court.  The term &ldquo;casual,&rdquo; as the report of the Committee points out, is not capable of exact legal definition. We all know what casual work is.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is to get a definition that will stand the test of criticism by a court of law.  It is, in any event, a question of fact whether, in a particular case, employment is casual or not.  Excluded casual workers were persons, for example, who carry your handbag from the station, or other people so casually engaged. Under the existing law there were excepted from the excluded class persons casually employed for the purpose of the employer's trade or business.  We cover also the persons set out in paragraphs (ii) and (iii).  I am asked why we are doing that, particularly having regard to the fact that the British Act does not cover those under (iii).  My answer is that we are doing it because the Committee recommended it.  The assumption must always be in favour of the Committee's recommendation unless there is a clear case against it.</P>

      <P>The Committee stated on page 29:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We suggest that the following clause might effectively define the <Col N="95" /> class of workers proposed to be included, viz.: A person whose employment is of a casual nature and who is employed otherwise than for the purpose of his employer's trade or business if employed in or about the residence of such employer.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons employed for the purpose of the employer's trade or business are covered by the existing law.  There is no change in respect to them.  The Committee continued: So as to bring in persons employed for the purpose of any game or recreation, if engaged or paid through a club, the manager or managing committee of the club in such cases being deemed to be the employer.  With regard to persons employed in or about the residence of the employer it has been argued that the effect might be to prevent persons getting casual employment in or about the residence of private persons.  I do not know if there is any weight to be attached to that argument.  It is true there are people who give employment out of charity to persons seeking it, and there might be the danger that, because of the liability they would have to accept under this Bill, in so doing, they might cease to give such employment.  But we must not lose our sense of proportion. For one person employed, because of charity, there are nine persons employed to do work which the employer actually wants done.  I should say that not 10 per cent. of those casually employed in or about the residence of the employer are employed out of charity.  They are employed for the purpose of getting work done, and, in respect to such persons, it is very desirable that there should be that liability upon the employer that if the employed person suffers an injury compensation must be paid.  Taking the balance between the injustice that may be done to persons so employed if they are involved in accidents, and the possibility that certain persons may not get casual work, <Col N="96" /> because of the enactment of this section, I say the balance is in favour of the inclusion of these people in the Bill.  The number of cases in which work given for charity will be stopped, because of the position created by this Bill, will be very few as compared with the number of cases where employment is given because work has to be done.  If one person is not employed another person will have to be employed.  Deputies opposite have assumed that a case should be made for the inclusion of these persons. I contend that a case must be made for their exclusion.  I do not think that any case has been made for the argument that charitable employment would be refused under this clause.  I think, although it may not be so in some cases, the number of persons employed for charitable reasons is a very small proportion of the people employed in or about the private residence of such employer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is quite fair for the Minister to say that it is merely charitable employment that will be excluded.  Perhaps that was the argument that was most stressed or dwelt on, but I think that employed people working on their own will be excluded and that the tendency will be to employ big firms and that people doing casual labour will be put out of work altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asked a question and I answered it.  The Committee said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present definition of a workman seems impossible of extension in an Act of Parliament to include such casual employment as tree cutting, gardening, window cleaning, etc., and yet exclude the handbag carrier if the definition is to be kept within reasonable limits.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely that indicates that they did feel that there were limits as between reasonable and unreasonable types of <Col N="97" /> employment that should be brought within the measure, and they did allow that there was a reasonable limit to the type of employment that should be excluded.  They went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unless particular classes of casual employment other than for the purpose of the employer's trade or business can be scheduled it would appear that an extension would have to be made in the Act to include every person performing a service for another for reward, which would lead to casuals finding it difficult to pick up odd jobs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the whole argument.  Do not confuse this with charity.  It is odd jobs.  Nobody would be reasonably excluded if it was possible to have an exact definition.</P>
    <P>Let us have the points in contrast: the chance, because of a too wide and unreasonable definition, of people not getting employment which they might get if the definition was reasonable, and opposed to that is the chance, and it is a very small chance, of some of these classes unreasonably included, meeting with a fatal accident.  That is what has to be balanced.  It is not everybody who gets an odd job who is killed.  We have not to consider in every case of an odd-jobs man the man's dependency.  It is not in every case that there is an accident.  It is not in every case where there is an accident that there is a fatal accident.  So that the compassionate plea which Deputy Norton makes does not apply in a great number of these cases.  The balance has to be weighed as between these two things: this particular odd-job person unreasonably included because of the impossibility of an exact definition, and the sympathetic consideration that one will have for the dependency of that person.  Put against that the number of odd-job people who may not get work at all, because of their being unreasonably included in this.  The calculation has to be made on that. Deputy Norton may still think, weighing these two things, that his mind goes in favour of inclusion, but he should not mis-state the case.  The proper statement of the case is what <Col N="98" /> the Commission said, that if you are going to extend this you are certainly not going to have your definition kept within reasonable limits, and, if it is not kept within reasonable limits, it will lead to casuals finding it difficult to pick up odd jobs.  That is what we have to make a decision between.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with Deputy Costello first.  The Deputy can deal with Deputy Dillon after that.  Deputy Dillon says he wants to help the family of the man, that he wants to enable them to live while the man is alive. The price he wants to pay for that is the price of probably starving the family if the man loses his livelihood.</P>

      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Deputy's new policy is going to save them from that horrible fate.  Deputy McGilligan said that I quoted the case of a man who might lose his life.  Let us take something else.  Let us suppose he is injured.  What happens to him? Presumably he will lose his employment, and will receive no compensation under this Bill.  Deputy McGilligan says that there is very little likelihood of a man casually employed losing his life.  Assuming that is so, what then is <Col N="99" /> the explanation of high premiums being charged for insuring a man against the possibility of losing his life?  Even if Deputy McGilligan thinks that there is very little prospect of a man losing his life when casually employed, it is possible for the man to sustain an accident, in respect of which he will receive no compensation, an accident which may not only prevent him from continuing in his employment, but probably prevent him from working for any other employer in future.  That is a difficulty that Deputy McGilligan did not advert to.  He did not advert to the possibility of a man being maimed in the course of his employment, and of his being not only unable to follow his existing employment, but any other kind of employment.  I think that Deputy Dillon's interest in this matter is one of desiring to preserve the employment of a person who might get the kind of employment to which he refers.  I think his sympathy is completely misplaced, taking the risk, on the one hand, that there may be certain opportunities for casual work of that kind denied a man in future, but bearing in mind the fact that if he is following any employment of that kind in future his wife and family will be covered in fatal cases, and he will have compensation to receive in a non-fatal case arising out of his employment, if he is maimed or in any way prevented from following his employment by any kind of injury.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get a definition and something laid down in this Bill to guide the judges.  All this talk that we have had about safeguarding the interests of the casual labourer is, in my opinion, so much rubbish, because eventually, whether the amendment is carried or not, the casual labourer will be completely at the mercy of the judge who has to interpret the Act without getting any guidance from the Oireachtas.  There is, perhaps, a good deal in the point made by Deputy Dillon and by Deputy Costello with regard to people who give employment to individuals, not so much because they want to get work done, but for some charitable reason. I suggest, however, that that is not at all as general as Deputies would seem to suggest.  I am rather inclined to agree with the Minister that in some cases it is a matter of fifty-fifty.  There may be certain work which we would like to get done, but we would like to have the feeling that while we are getting the work done for ourselves at the same time we are being charitable. A case came under my notice within the last week where a gentleman wanted to be charitable, but the extent of his charity was to get a man to prune trees and to clean up half a mile of an avenue which was covered with leaves.  That is not the sort of charity we want.  I am satisfied that there is a responsibility on the employer, whether the employee is casual or permanent, to safeguard the employee.  I cannot see my way to support Deputy Dillon's amendment and I am not at all as keen on the <Col N="101" /> section as I would be if the Minister would attempt even to define what is casual work.  The Minister quite frankly runs away from that.  He will not go even so far as the Committee went.  The Minister says he will not do it; he says he cannot do it.  The Minister is putting the responsibility on the judges and we are told by men of legal experience that judges are bound to differ and when judges differ of course the dependants of the unfortunate people who may lose their lives or their limbs are going to suffer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no answer to the question I am putting to the Minister. I know it is in operation, and the Minister has in this case lavishly taken over, <i>in toto</i>, British statutes, and put them in here.  A great part of those British statutes cannot be improved upon.  In practice they have been proved to be excellent.  Other <Col N="102" /> parts have proved to be cumbrous and absurd.  That description applies to more than one part of this section. However, I do not want to press that aspect of the situation, but I do think it is very necessary, if we are to discuss this Bill to the best advantage, that no side of the House should regard it as a Party matter, and that Deputy Norton should at least take the view consistently that any amendments which have been put down here have been put down for the purpose of improving the Bill from the point of view of the workmen, and of everyone for whose benefit this legislation was first introduced.  Deputy McGilligan has put it as clearly as it can be put.  You have got to weigh in the balance the protection that this Bill will afford in the very rare cases where a casual employee will meet with fatal or grave injuries, and cannot prove negligence against his employer, as against the case of the number of men who will be unable to get casual employment of any kind in or about the premises of their employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One difficulty which I can foresee arising is this: We are told it is manifest that if you give a fellow a shilling to carry your bag he is not to be looked upon as a casual employee employed for the purpose of any work in or about the residence of his employer, but if you look at the case of M'Adam and Harvey you will find that a fellow who was casually doing a job nearly half a mile away from his employer's house was found by the court to be employed in or about the residence of his employer.  The words &ldquo;in or about&rdquo; occur in another section of the Bill as the Minister will recollect.  The words &ldquo;about the premises&rdquo; are very elastic, and the fact of it is that this sub-section (3) brings in virtually every casual employee that could be thought of. You have got to weigh the benefits that will accrue to that class against the disadvantages.  I can quite believe that Deputy Norton, in making the balance, takes one view, but I must impress upon him and upon Deputy Morrissey&mdash;although I do not think I need impress it on Deputy Morrissey&mdash;<Col N="103" /> that I, in making the balance, take the other view.  Both&mdash;actuated by the same desires&mdash;are arriving at a different conclusion.  I do not propose to press the amendment if the Minister has made up his mind to oppose it, but I should be sorry if the Minister would not turn it over in his mind between this and the Report Stage. Possibly some means could be found of reintroducing the principle of my amendment on the Report Stage, if, between now and then, the Minister comes to the conclusion that there is more force in my contention than at first there seemed to him to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I am quite prepared to accept any amendment to this Bill&mdash;except an amendment to the principle of it&mdash; for which, in my opinion, a good case is made.  Of course, I must put in those qualifying words &ldquo;in my opinion&rdquo; because, no doubt, there will always be differences of opinion.  In this particular case we have a form of words recommended by the Committee which was set up and reported in 1926&mdash;a form which was, in fact, inserted in the draft Bill by Deputy Costello on the instructions of Deputy McGilligan. This is one of the sections I did not change, and when the responsibility was theirs they also decided to adhere to the recommendation of the Committee. There is of course, the main consideration that the only argument against the Committee's recommendation is the argument which Deputy Dillon has now made, and which, in my opinion, if pushed to its logical conclusion could be made an argument against the enactment of a Workmen's Compensation Bill at all.  If a casual worker of a certain kind is to be excluded because his inclusion is likely to deter persons from employing him, is it not clear that the same argument might be used against any form of workmen's compensation? A charitable householder might give a man a job cleaning his windows, repairing a few slates on his roof or working about his garden; a charitable industrialist might give a man <Col N="104" /> employment in his factory, even though there is no particular need for it.  If the householder is likely to be deterred by the fact that in employing the man he is exposing himself to certain liability in the case of accident, will not the industrialist be similarly deterred?  That argument&mdash; although it would be extending it considerably&mdash;could be used against the whole principle of workmen's compensation. In any event, I do not think it is strong enough, having regard to the facts I have mentioned, to justify us in rejecting the recommendation of the Committee.</P>

      <P>I want again to press the fact that if there is a recommendation made by the Committee it is made with reservations, and the reservations are contained in the phrases which I read.  If you are going to extend this definition you are going to extend it unreasonably, and if you extend it unreasonably you are going to lead to lack of employment of the odd-jobs man.

      <P>I do not believe he should have.  I know the way that Bill went from Department to Department, and it was in a definitely experimental way from beginning to end.  There will be found minute after minute referring to things that were brought casually to the attention of various members of the Executive Council, referred down, and made into a memorandum as to whether they should be regarded when the Bill was finally being cleaned up. The easiest thing and the proper thing for the people who were drafting the Bill was to take the clauses and relate them to the previous legislation.  Of course, in doing so, without any examination of detail, this phrase will emerge, but that the Bill had been subjected to any sort of analysis with a view to seeing what the final copy was going to be cannot be stated.  The Minister also forgets that since 1928, indeed one might say since 1926, there has been quite an amount of judicial <Col N="105" /> interpretation&mdash;or rather attempted judicial interpretation&mdash;of some of those phrases, and a person who was satisfied that the Committee did, in fact, report favourably on this phrase in 1926 might not just automatically find himself ready to accept that recommendation in 1933 by reason of what has happened in the interval.  I want to take a test on this, the handbag carrier.  Does anyone really believe that the handbag carrier should be included; that that employment should be regarded as a contract of service, because that is the basis of workmen's compensation law?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is he not?  Wait until the courts get at this.  Why does the Committee say that if you are going to extend this provision you are going to have included the handbag carrier?  That is taken from a memorandum that was produced before the Committee.  They call attention to the memorandum that was put before them on the other side by Mr. J.C. McBride, who tendered evidence on behalf of the Accident Offices Association.  They quoted an extract which said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present definition of workman seems impossible of extension in an Act of Parliament to include such casual employment as tree cutting, gardening, window cleaning, etc., and yet exclude the handbag carrier if the definition is to be kept within reasonable limits.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is certainly a statement of the mind of that individual passed on by the Commission.  Including the handbag carrier is extending the definition to an unreasonable point.  If a person is carrying a handbag in or about the residence of his employer, to have that included would be an unreasonable extension.  I referred to contract of service.  The idea of contract of service is a little bit beclouded when applied to some of the additions.  The basis of the Workmen's Compensation Act was that if you have a man under contract of service, and if the man does some work which is dangerous, or happens to turn out dangerous, then you should pay for having caused him to injure himself.  Even though we <Col N="106" /> have got away from that idea, it is still included.  Judicial interpretation has extended to that and has led to the refuge in the phrase &ldquo;independent contractor.&rdquo;  If you come along from a railway station with a handbag and give it to a casual to carry, rather than give him 3d. or 4d. that you might give him for doing nothing, really that person is acting under contract of service, and it is going to be interpreted on decisions given.  This provision brings him in if it is about the residence of the employer.  Does anyone think that that should be included?  Is he being put in any danger?  The Minister made the absurd analogy that you are up against a casual employee, and that he can be called a workman.  There you get back to the real rock of service. Then there will be extensions of that. What is there corresponding to the man who drops off at a railway station and hands his bag to someone to take home?  What is there about a factory that could make the case analogous to the one the Minister talked of?  There is nothing analogous.</P>
    <P>I want to return to what Deputy Norton said.  I take him up on the point about a fatality.  He now extends the class of people he wants included, and said compassionate cases could be made.  There are heaps of people who under stress would go to absurd lengths to which the courts were driven on the contract of service line.  Against that there is an absurd extension of the independent contractor. Of the many people classified as independent contractors by the court, which of them deserves Deputy Norton's sympathy so much as the bag carrier?  The difficulty is that when you extend legislation to cover these cases you come to a certain point where certain laws will operate.  People will say: &ldquo;Very good, I am not going to run the risk of a certain accident happening and&mdash;possibly not being insured against casual employment&mdash;be landed for heavy damages.&rdquo;  These people will keep their bags but others will lose a certain amount of money. People will not receive money for casual jobs, and against that is set the odd case of a man who suffered a <Col N="107" /> fatality or whose dependants were left unprovided for, because, arising out of casual employment, the job of handbag carrier was not included in this measure.  On any reasonable view I think the balance is not for extending this provision.  We ought to have pity for everyone, but, if you are going to substitute a different thing, because people will not get casual jobs, I do not think you are doing better for these people by trying to be sympathetic. The whole thing is to balance consideration, to see which is the better.  Deputy Dillon's amendment is the better way.  It would probably lead to hardship but to nothing like the amount of trouble that will be caused if the Bill is left as it is.</P>

      <P>On the section, I notice that amongst the persons exempted from the scope of the Bill are members of the employer's family dwelling in his house.  That seems to me to be likely to impose a possible hardship on persons who are exempted.  It is true that where a man employs his son or daughter, and that they are dwelling in the house, there is a case for excepting them.  But when we come to the employer's family, that could extend to a stepson or possibly to a half-brother, or to a variety of people not just sons or daughters of the employer.  While normally a member of the employer's family would be excluded I suggest to the Minister that provision should be made so that persons should not be excepted where it is shown that they work for wages, as distinct from contributing to the family.  Where a person is an independent employee there is a case for including him as an ordinary workman. That person is taking the place of a workman and the employer is liable to have him covered for workmen's compensation.  The position would be different where a son or daughter worked with their father and receives no wages, except sufficient pocket money to supply individual needs. Where a person is actually a wagedrawing employee or drawing a salary <Col N="108" /> there is a strong case for including that person in the scope of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;independent employee&rdquo; can hardly be used in relation to a member of the employer's family dwelling in his house and it is only member of the employer's family dwelling in his house who are excluded. The son of the employer or any other relation of the employer not dwelling in his house is covered by the Bill.  It is assumed that in these cases there is a very special and definite personal relationship and, in fact, it would be almost impossible to prove whether or not the employment was under a contract of service for wages.  At least considerable difficulty would undoubtedly arise and the assumption is that in these cases, it is not necessary to make the same provision as in the case of other persons because of the personal relationship existing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of a business premises in town.  The Minister is not unfamiliar with that kind of case.  A man has a certain business premises in town, and he takes into that business a relative.  He employs that relative who would come within the definition of the employer's family. He pays that person a weekly wage, and very often that kind of employer, while there might be a blood relationship, might be a much harder task-master than the ordinary employer and he occasionally is.  If that person works for wages, I think he should be brought within the scope of the Bill.  The Minister says it is difficult to ascertain whether that person is, in fact, working for wages, but all that information comes out quite easily when the employer approaches the insurance company to cover his workmen, and there is not the slightest difficulty about having the information provided by the employer there.  There is not any difficulty at all in the workman being able to indicate to the court when the matter comes before it, whether in fact he is receiving wages or not.  If the employer is paying him wages, presumably he is getting a receipt, because it would seem to be necessary for ordinary income tax purposes, and <Col N="109" /> if a person is not getting wages he will surely find it difficult to go to the court and say that he was in fact getting wages.  I think there is a strong case for its inclusion.  The Minister may not wish to indicate his mind on it now, but I think it is a point which should be looked into.</P>

He has got to find a definition for them which will stand the test of legal criticism, and which will include these persons and these persons only.  I should like him to try his hand at it, but I should like to say this, that I think it is to be noted that no representations have been made to my knowledge that any amendment is required in respect of that part of the law which is, of course, merely an enactment of the existing law.</P>

It may be his stepfather or stepmother, but we know perfectly well that it really applies to his son or daughter, his grandson or granddaughter, his step-son or step-daughter&mdash;possibly brother and sister, and half-brother and half-sister.  That is the class of person we really have to consider.  Here we have a man living with his sons and daughters, or his step-sons and stepdaughters. He insures himself for employers' liability against accident in respect of two employees who are his sons.  He need not state in his insurance policy that they are his sons at all.  They are just two employees. One of his sons, coming down the stairs in the morning, trips and breaks his leg.  He never worked for his father; he never had wages, and he immediately takes an action against his father, goes into court, swears that he was in receipt of wages, and the father says that he was paying him wages. He gets compensation, which the insurance company must pay, and the father nets £1 5s. or £1 6s. a week, whatever it is the court decides must be paid to the injured son.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but does the Deputy not see that the premium might not have been paid against that risk but against quite another risk, and that where you have the possibility of collusion between two members of the one family, father and son, who between them are going to extract the money out of the insurance company, you are simply preparing the ground for perjured litigation? Normally, you have employee and employer and the probability of their entering into a conspiracy to defraud <Col N="111" /> the insurance company is comparatively remote, but where you have a son and a father living together in the same house, presumably sharing the family revenue, there is every inducement to them to conspire together to knock out of the insurance company something to which, in fact, they are not entitled at all.  That, to my mind, is the only effective argument against including the members of a family living in the same house as the employer in the benefits of the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>There are two houses in a street and if the employee lives in No. 1, he is insurable and can be compensated; but if he happens to live in No. 2, where his employer lives, he can get no compensation.  Is there not as much risk of collusion when he is living in No. 1 as when he is living in No. 2?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is seeing fine points in his argument about collusion now.  The test in the whole question is the place of residence of the employee and I say that the fact that he resides in the dwelling-house of his father, for whom he may also work, or the fact that he resides in the dwelling-house of his grandfather, for whom he may also work, should not debar him from the compensation which he would receive if he lived next door, provided he is working for weekly wages.  If he is working for weekly wages for his grandfather, he ought not to be debarred from getting compensation merely because he happens to reside in the same dwelling-house as his employer.  That is the simple question in the matter and I do not think that it is open to the collusion the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <P>There is a type of person whom I have in mind and I am wondering if the machinery of this Bill is capable of dealing with his case. Within recent years it has been the practice of county boards of health, instead of giving home assistance in the way in which it has been distributed hitherto, to bring in people who are in receipt of this home assistance to do certain work in the vicinity of county hospitals and county homes. Up to this these people have not been insurable and I think they should be insurable.  I know of a case in my own constituency that happened during the last two years, where a man in the course of his employment lost his eye. He applied for compensation to the county board of health and it was not forthcoming.  He employed a solicitor, who went to court, but his case was thrown out.  In consequence of the fact that that man lost his eye, he has not been employed within the last two years.  He got a job last year for a couple of days but because of the fact that he had lost one eye he was almost instantly discharged.</P>

I know cases where a contractor was brought in to do a certain job, and these people who were in receipt of home assistance were sent to this contractor as labourers.  I do think in a case of that kind at any rate that these people should be insurable.  Many of them may be maimed, and some of them may lose their lives in these occupations. It is certainly a very peculiar state of affairs that no compensation can be paid.

      <P>I wonder would Deputy Norton agree to the deletion <Col N="114" /> of the expression &ldquo;member of the family&rdquo; altogether?  Would that meet his point?  The expression &ldquo;member of the family&rdquo; is defined in Section 6, and I understood from the opening of the Deputy's remarks that there was to be a very big extension of that phrase in relation to the exceptions. The Deputy cannot have it both ways. If you are going to have &ldquo;member of the family&rdquo; defined in a rather extensive way for the purposes of the amount of dependency, the reason which is behind that extension is also equally behind the extension when it comes to the matter about work, whether a man is to be called a workman if he is a member of the employer's family.  The Report of the Commission, on pages 28, 29 and 30, opens by saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have received considerable evidence with regard to the classes of persons to be entitled to compensation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They have given definitions in the Act of 1906 and lower down they say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With regard to the classes of persons excluded from the definition of &lsquo;workmen&rsquo; it was urged by trade union witnesses that there should be no exclusion of any wage earner from the Workmen's Compensation Acts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have searched through the Report and I find that they have concluded by saying, about quarter of the way down page 30:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No satisfactory reasons have been submitted to us for the inclusion of any of the other classes of workers at present outside the scope of the Act and we do not consider any change necessary in that respect.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not find that any evidence was put forward in regard to the special classes that are mentioned in relation to members of the employer's family dwelling in his own house and when I get to the back of the book, page 84, I find that evidence was given by Mr. R.S. Anthony, Mr. Denis Cullen, Mr. Luke Duffy, Mr. E.P. Harte, Mr. John S. Kelly, Councillor Thomas McGrath, Mr. J. O'Kelly, Mr. M.J. Reardon, Mr. Dermot J. Stewart and Mr. C.D. Waters.  They apparently did <Col N="115" /> not think fit to raise this point.  I wonder is it really a very valuable point to raise in the discussion here this evening when all these people who were called as witnesses did not consider it worth while raising?  The only thing that the Commission say in their Report about it is that no satisfactory reasons had been submitted for the inclusion of any of the other classes of workers at present outside the scope of the Act.  It is nowhere indicated that this point was brought up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, but I remember following the evidence that was given, and I do not recollect that that point was raised.  If Deputy Norton tells me that it was raised specifically I shall yield to his superior knowledge of the matter.  I do not believe it was.  I never heard it was. Supposing we take out this exception. Then it amounts to this, that a member of the employer's family dwelling in his house may be accounted a workman for the purposes of compensation. What is he to prove?  That he met with an accident, certain things about dependency, partial or complete disablement and that he works under a contract of service.  With whom is he working under a contract of service? With his father or mother or some other member of the family?  What does the contract of service cover?  When does the contract begin or end?  Would sleeping in the house be part of his work?  What exactly would be the categories of employment that the Deputy thinks should be covered in this that would be capable of exact disclosure to the court and that would not be the subject of immediate suspicion because the contract of service has got to be proved in relation to the other members of the family? They are the very people who would be giving evidence in relation to this matter.  There is the other side of this, that the person who is living with the family is supposed to be in a somewhat better position than an ordinary <Col N="116" /> workman.  He is not subject to the harshness of the outside world.  That sort of compassionate thing runs all through this matter.  It seems to me it would be a very big upset, without any evidence having been tendered to the Commission and without the Commission reporting in favour of it, that we should change it.  I should like to point out one peculiarity that emerges from it, that although in Section 7 the question of legitimacy has been referred to from the angle of dependency it is not referred to here, so that an illegitimate child can claim under a contract of service in certain conditions, even although living in the house with his father, whereas a lawfully born child cannot. It seems to me to be an anomalous thing.</P>

      <P>Following on what Deputy McGilligan has said, take the case of a member of an employer's family, working in a factory owned by his grandfather, but who happens to live in the residence of his grandfather ten miles away; why should the fact that he met with an accident in the factory debar him from compensation, simply because he lived in the residence of his grandfather, ten miles away?</P>

      <P>His grandfather might own the whole street of houses there. There is not much difficulty in living in another house in circumstances of that kind, but if the grandson meets with an accident in the factory, the fact that he resides with his grandfather ten miles away from the factory should not debar him from compensation, seeing that if he did not live with him he would be entitled to it.  I suggest to the Minister that he should take these things into consideration seeing that the list is long only apparently for the purpose of widening the scope of people who would be excluded from the purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to consider extending the definition of the class to the adopted child.  There may be considerable difficulty about that and, of course, the class is a comparatively small one.  It is not of very frequent occurrence, but one can easily conceive cases occurring where, for instance, a workman may take in a child of a deceased brother or sister for the purpose of rearing the child.  That child is, to all intents and purposes, a member of the workman's family, and I can see no good reason for not giving him the benefits that are given to the son and daughter.  I know that the definition there of a member of the family is that of the existing law and also the definition in the British Act of 1923.  I also know that adoption has no legal status here. There may be this difference in England, that you have the Adoption of Children Act of 1926 which gives the adopted child a definite legal status.  I do not say that it would be bringing the adopted child within the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  I mean that I do not believe there has been any decision in that direction.  It is possible, I should say, from the reading of the 1926 Act, that the adopted child would be considered to come within the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  I merely raise the matter as one for consideration, and I do not take my stand on the word &ldquo;adopted.&rdquo; It might be better to limit it to the child of a deceased brother or sister, who is living in the house of the workman, or something of that kind.</P>

      <P>The difficulty there arises out of the fact that there is no Saorstát statute legalising the adoption of children such as the 1926 Act of England, to which the Deputy referred. <Col N="118" /> It would appear to me that this is a matter more properly to be dealt with by an Act here dealing with the adoption of children than in this particular Act.  In another Bill, when we were faced with that difficulty, we adopted the phrase &ldquo;a child in respect of whom the person has placed himself <i>in loco parentis.</i>&rdquo;  I think, however, that it would be dangerous here where it might be given a much wider interpretation. In the other Bill&mdash;the Unemployment Assistance Bill&mdash;it did not matter how wide the definition was provided there was dependency.  However, I will have the matter examined.</P>
      <P>Section 6 agreed to.</P>

      <P>(1)  In this Act the word &ldquo;dependants&rdquo; means such of the members of the family of a workman as were wholly or in part dependent on the earnings of such workman at the time of his death, or would but for the incapacity due to the accident which resulted in such workman's death have been so dependent, and where a workman being the parent or grand-parent of an illegitimate child leaves such a child so dependent on his earnings or, being an illegitimate child, leaves a parent or grand-parent so dependent upon his earnings, shall include such illegitimate child and parent or grand-parent respectively.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 2:</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather surprised that this amendment does not stand in the name of Deputy Norton, because the sub-section that I propose to delete is a sub-section which is really to the disadvantage of the dependants of workmen. I put down the amendment in order to see what was the justification for this sub-section, because there is practically no reason given in the <Col N="119" /> Departmental Report for the recommendation that this sub-section should be put in.  I quite realise that it is the same sub-section as in the British Act of 1923 and the British Act of 1925, but that fact does not commend itself to me at all.  The position with reference to partial dependants has been in a certain state for the last thirty-three years in this country, and, under one of the earlier Acts dealing with Workmen's Compensation, a decision was given as to what was necessary to constitute partial dependency and it was held in the first case that it consisted in dependency for the necessaries of life.  That decision was given in the year 1899, and, in the following year, 1900, the House of Lords upset that decision and reversed it, and decided that a contribution towards the necessaries of life was not a necessary element in partial dependency. That has continued from 1900 to 1933 in this country.  It is a decision which was given really in the interest of the partial dependants of workmen. This sub-section that I propose to delete will have the effect, and is intended to have the effect, of upsetting the law that has obtained in this country for the last thirty-three years. On page 35 of the Departmental Report the recommendation is set out, and all the report says is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the evidence we received on behalf of the clerks of the peace, it was submitted that an amendment on these lines (that is, the lines of sub-section (2) of this section) would debar many claims which have no merit or justification.  We agree with this view, and recommend that in the Saorstát a similar amending section should be adopted, as it seems to us to give effect to the original intention of the legislature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to be found in the Act of 1906, and that was passed when the Act of 1900 was the law, so it seems to me to be peculiar to say that this sub-section (2) now gives effect to the original intention of the legislature when the intention of the legislature has existed for thirty-three years and was admitted to be the real intention of the <Col N="120" /> legislature.  I do not know what the justification for this sub-section is at all.  Really, the sub-section as it operates, and all these questions of partial dependency, very largely arise under that class of case which is known as the family fund case.  That is the case where numbers of members of a family are living in the one house and all contributing to the common fund.</P>
    <P>They all contribute to the common fund and, out of that common fund, they are supported and maintained and the rent of the house is paid.  The father receives certain contributions from the wages of the members of the household. Out of the fund that is made up by these contributions, the entire family is maintained.  If anything happens to one of the sons arising out of, or in the course of, his employment, the question arises to what extent the father is partially dependent on the contributions given by his son.  Under the old principle, laid down in 1900, it was sufficient for the father to prove that he got a pecuniary contribution from the son.  While in assessing the amount to be awarded for partial dependency the fact that the son had to be maintained out of the common fund was taken into account, nevertheless, it was not necessary for the father to show that he was dependent for his own necessaries of life on the contributions of his children.  It will be necessary under the present proposal in sub-section (2) for the father, in that state of facts, to show that he is dependent on the son for the necessaries of life. It will not be sufficient to show merely that he gets a pecuniary contribution out of which he may make a profit. He must show that he was dependent on the son, in whole or in part, for the necessaries of life.  That appears to me to be a reactionary proposal and to be against the interest of the workman. It sets aside a principle which has been acted upon in this country for 33 years.  I want to know the justification for that change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that this is an amendment which could be usefully accepted.  I can <Col N="121" /> imagine interminable litigation over this section because, as Deputy Costello says, in considering the question of partial dependency the claimant must be able to show that he was partially dependent on the injured person for the provision of the ordinary necessaries of life.  To define &ldquo;ordinary necessaries of life&rdquo; would seem to me to be a difficult job, but when you come to construe &ldquo;ordinary necessaries of life&rdquo; in relation to the position and station in life of the person concerned, I can imagine one getting tied up in a knot.  It would be extremely difficult to get anything like a fair definition on any dozen cases which would establish what the general legal line was on that particular section.  Take the case of a workman and his wife, both employed.  The workman loses his life.  His widow will have to show that, although she was working herself, she was partially dependent on her husband's contributions for the ordinary necessaries of life.  In addition, she has to prove that these necessaries were imperatively necessary for a person of her class or position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking as an example the case of a wife who is working. Presumably, she cannot prove complete dependency.  She would have to prove partial dependency and, in doing that, must prove that she was partially dependent on her husband's contributions for the necessaries of life and that those were necessaries appropriate to her class and position.  That seems to me to be a peculiarly complicated provision.  It is in the British Act of 1923, but that of itself does not prove that it possesses any particular virtue. If it has been included in this Bill merely because it was included in the British Act, there is a strong case for deleting it.  It is calculated, as Deputy Costello said, to restrict the interpretation here at the present time of &ldquo;partial dependency.&rdquo; In the administration and construing of this Act, this clause will be found to complicate matters and <Col N="122" /> the Minister should leave to the courts the determination of what partial dependency is.  It will be easier for them to do that if they are not hampered by having to define what are the ordinary necessaries of life and the suitability of these ordinary necessaries to the class or position occupied by the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton says that the insertion of this sub-section will lead to litigation.  The case for its insertion is that it is going to minimise litigation.  The really effective argument in favour of this section is that it is going to diminish the amount of litigation which ordinarily arises. The Committee's statement is that it will debar many claims which have no merit or justification&mdash;that was the evidence given them by the clerks of the peace and that they agreed with it.  The amendment appears here primarily because the Committee recommended it.  The Committee, no doubt, got the phrase from the British Act of 1923, and I have no reason to believe that in Great Britain it led to the great amount of litigation which Deputy Norton appears to fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered that the total amount of compensation is a limited sum.  It is not a case of handing out to all persons who are injured by the death of the workman a sum that will compensate them for that injury.  There is a limited sum available, and whereas, under the existing law, the payment to a partial dependent is such portion of the total as, in the opinion of the court, is proportioned to the injury received, experience has shown that it is desirable there should be another test. The other test is that suggested here&mdash; that the sum should be divided having regard to the extent to which the parties were dependent for the ordinary necessaries of life upon the deceased person.  I am unable to see upon what ground that definition is challenged. That is obviously a sounder basis upon which to go in apportioning a limited sum, than the other one which does not take into account the actual circumstances of the recipients.  It is much more important that the circumstances <Col N="123" /> of the recipients should be taken into account than that there should be another basis of calculation which would only take into account the loss created by the death.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They will, but they have determined already in regard to the phrase in the 1906 Act that it is not the extent to which the person was dependent for the necessaries of life must be taken into account, but the injury.  The Committee quotes from the decision in the case of Main Colliery v. Davies, to which Deputy Costello referred, as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;What the family was, in fact, earning, what the family was, in fact, spending for the purpose of its maintenance as a family, seems to me to be the only thing which the county court judge could properly regard.&rdquo;  The question of the extent to which the claimant was dependent upon the earnings of the deceased person to provide the necessaries of life does not enter into it.  We think it should, having regard to the fact that there is a limited amount available. This sets a standard upon which the judge is supposed to go.  It does reverse the position that has prevailed heretofore, but it has been reversed in Great Britain, and so far as I am aware, there has been no objection in Great Britain by any responsible body of persons representing the workers or employers.  That is the case for accepting the recommendation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is under a complete misapprehension as to the purpose underlying the recommendation of the Departmental Committee in reference to this sub-section. As I understand it, the recommendation of the Committee is not for the purpose of avoiding litigation; it is for the purpose of avoiding unmeritorious cases getting compensation.  In so far as you can read any purpose into the scrappy recommendation that they did make, that purpose is to prevent unmeritorious cases getting compensation. In other words, where you have a family living together, a father and <Col N="124" /> several sons and daughters, with the sons and daughters contributing to the family fund, the father, as a result of the contributions, would make a little profit for himself.  The clerks of the peace seem to think that is unmeritorious.  It is not the employers who make the case for this section; it is not the workmen who make the case for this section; it is the clerks of the peace.  Whatever interest they have in it, I do not know.  Clerks of the peace are not a class for whose opinion in this matter I would have any great regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am expressing the opinion that the Minister misunderstands it, and that is where we are at issue.  Here is an extract from the report of the Departmental Committee:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the evidence we received on behalf of the clerks of the peace it was submitted that an amendment on these lines would debar many claims which have no merit or justification. We agree with this view and we recommend that in the Saorstát a similar amending section should be adopted as it seems to us to give effect to the original intention of the legislature.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is nothing there saying that this will tend to limit litigation.  It will not.  The same sort of cases will come up again.  In fact there will be more cases as a result of this sub-section than there were under the old state of law.  Hitherto everybody knew where they stood in reference to partial dependency under the old Acts. Decisions had settled for 33 years what legal principles were to be applied to certain cases.  The Minister referred to the Main Colliery case mentioned in the Committee's report.  This sub-section, so far from giving effect to the decision in the Main Colliery case, sets it aside.  The Minister cannot rely on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it sets it aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly it does. The Minister appears to consider the Departmental Committee's report as something that is sacrosanct, that it has to be followed out.  I <Col N="125" /> do not accept that recommendation. If I had any responsibility for the draft Bill I would have scrutinised every single recommendation in order to see that it gave effect to the interests of the workmen.  If I had any responsibility&mdash;I had not&mdash;for this Bill, even when it was being prepared in the old days, I would have applied that principle to this sub-section, and this sub-section would not have appeared. I do not know if the Minister suggested that I was responsible for the original draft.  I do know that I gave one instruction only in reference to the Workmen's Compensation Bill, and that was to produce a good codifying Bill bringing the law up-to-date, so that there would be as few decisions as possible outstanding.  That was my sole contribution to this work of codifying the law with reference to workmen's compensation.  I retained my full power to reject, no matter from what quarter it came, any provision that in any way interfered with or jeopardised vested or other interests of the workmen.</P>
      <P>This sub-section takes away the right which the dependants of a workman have had for 33 years.  It is interesting to see the Minister standing over that.  From the point of view of the defence he has made that this sub-section is going to prevent litigation, that will not bear any scrutiny. There will be more litigation out of this.  Instead of having to prove that the deceased workman contributed so much to the applicant&mdash;and certain deductions had to be made from the point of view that the deceased workman had to be supported out of his contribution&mdash;you now have to consider how the dependant of the deceased workman used the contribution that he got.  You have to consider if he bought bread, cheese or tobacco, and, if he bought tobacco, was that a necessary of life.  One judge might think it was and another judge might think it was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe you are going to have, under this Bill, considerably more litigation because everybody knows that litigation in connection with workmen's compensation cases is fought by insurance companies and they are <Col N="126" /> going to raise every point they can. This is one of the points they will very properly raise.  They will fight every case of partial dependency in future whereas up to this there was every chance of a settlement between the applicant and the insurance company. If this sub-section goes through, every partial dependency case will be fought.  I have no objection to that and I am sure Deputy McGilligan and other lawyers in this House have no objection to that, but it is not going to be for the benefit of the workman.</P>
    <P>I am amazed to find the Minister standing over the sub-section.  The only justification he has given, so far as I can follow his speech, is that the report recommends it, and that it will stop litigation.  The report does recommend it but gives no solid reasons for the recommendation.  It gives no reason that appeals to me.  It deals with the matter in three or four lines.  It gives no justification for setting aside rights which the partial dependants of workmen have enjoyed in this country for upwards of 33 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to present to the House the position as it has been and the position as it will be if this particular section is included.  If this provision were something that aimed at enlarging the scope of the insurance against workmen's compensation or against workmen's actions or at enlarging the amount of payment that might have to be made, then I would halt before I would give assent to it.  It is quite clear that if there are any new claims made or any avenues to new claims opened up the reaction will be an increase in the premiums demanded for insurance, and I do not think it would be fair to put any further burden by way of insurance upon employers.  But this is not extending; this is definitely going to limit.  The Minister's answer is that it is not going to limit because it will restrict litigation.  It will in one way.  The report says it will debar many claims which have no merit or justification. That is the opinion of clerks of the peace.  The Committee say: &ldquo;We <Col N="127" /> agree with this view,&rdquo; and they go on to recommend it and they add as their reason for the recommendation &ldquo;it seems to us to give effect to the original intention of the legislature.&rdquo; Possibly it means the intentions of the legislature prior to 1906, but the world has moved since then and it is questionable whether we should regard the intentions of the legislature which passed the first Workmen's Compensation Act as something before which we should bow down.</P>
      <P>There will be a restriction of litigation. There will be certain people who will say that they cannot have this section because any of them cannot put forward a claim to be partial dependants because they cannot claim that they were dependent for the necessaries of life on the injured person and that these necessaries were suitable for their circumstances in life or their class and description. Without narrowing the class, the litigation will be restricted if the field for litigation is in this.  Up to this all that need be proved for partial dependants is some payment made, some payment received say, by the father to the wages fund of the family which that father spent in the upkeep of the family.  That is all that has to be proved at the moment.  There are heaps of cases on that.  But there is some limit to it at any rate.  For the father there has got to be proved that the person has got some money, that some question of dependency arose and that the money received was spent on the ordinary necessaries of life.  No objective standard can be laid down for that, and we get a mass of cases all to be argued upon; and having got that position we can go on further to argue whether all these necessaries of life were properly spent; and are the necessaries of life to be regarded as suitable for the person in his class or position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister balance these things one against the other and say whether there is to be more or less litigation if this is passed?  Take the position as it is in the country at the moment in the ordinary case of partial dependence between father and <Col N="128" /> son.  The father proved that the son was earning something and that the son gave to the father a certain sum, and that the father spent that sum on the family.  That is the law at the moment.  Now we have reversed that. You have got to go further.  Having got that money you have to prove that you spent it on the necessaries of life and hereafter there has got to be decided what are the necessaries of life, and afterwards you have got to decide are these necessaries suitable, that is, suitable to that person in his class and position.  Remember that if we leave the law as it is we do not give the insurance company any reason for saying that premiums have got to be advanced because that is what they are operating on at the moment.  If we do restrict it we ought to see that premiums for insurance ought to come down.  But will they? We have everything in favour of leaving the law as it is.  If there was a good sound argument produced against it, it would have to be debated further.  At the moment all we are told is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In ascertaining the extent of partial dependency decided law has established the principle that regard must not be had to the standard of living in the district or in the class to which the family of the deceased belong.  The matters to be considered were stated by Lord Halsbury in the appeal case of Main Colliery v. Davies (1900), A.C. 385 thus: &lsquo;What the family was in fact earning, what the family was in fact spending, for the purpose of its maintenance as a family seems to me to be the only thing which the county court judge could properly regard.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we are asked to reverse that and the only reason submitted to us was the general evidence from the clerks of the peace.  We have that here in the report.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the evidence we received on behalf of the clerks of the peace it was submitted that an amendment on these lines would debar many claims which have no merit or justification.  We agree with this <Col N="129" /> view and we recommend that in the Saorstát a similar amending section should be adopted, as it seems to us to give effect to the original intention of the legislature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the recommendation of the clerks of the peace on that?  That unmeritorious claims would be debarred and that that seems to be going back to the intention of the legislature which passed the first Workmen's Compensation Act.  It is the law as it is at the moment and ought not to be disturbed.  There should certainly be a vast amount of extra litigation arising out of the change.  In itself it is not a desirable thing to have the law suddenly changed and to have cases that have been accumulating over 33 years' experience of the law as it stands at the moment changed, and changed merely on the basis of that report.  To me it does not seem a good reason.</P>

But the House of Lords said that that decision was wrong.  The House of Lords said what was the original intention of the legislature.

      <P>The amount of compensation is limited.  Let us get that clear.  The more of that compensation that goes to distant relatives of the deceased the less will go to the real dependants.  Persons who are merely the recipients of some of the earnings will get more and the more they get the less will go to the real relatives.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister is not serious.  If I may interrupt the Minister for a moment I would like to be informed how is it that because there are partial dependants, the amount they will get will affect what the total dependants get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about total dependants.  I am talking about the number of partial dependants.  If there is a total dependant the total dependant gets the adult's lump sum to which under Rule I, Schedule 2, he is entitled.  Rule 2 says: &ldquo;Where the workman does not leave any adult member of the family wholly dependent on his earnings but leaves any adult members of the family in part so dependent the adult's lump sum shall, subject to Rule 5 of this Schedule, be such sum not exceeding in any case the amount of the adult's lump sum which would have been payable under the immediately preceding rule,&rdquo; and so on.  That is to say if there is a series of partial dependants, the more we give to those dependent on the earnings of the deceased for the <Col N="131" /> necessaries of life, the more the lump amount is going to be given to the people who need it.  If you bring in the other standard, the standard which is established by the existing law which ignores dependants for the necessaries of life and brings in injuries inflicted in consequence of the loss of the man, then you are spreading the total sum wider and the more that goes to one class then naturally the less will go to the other.</P>
      <P>If there is a total dependant, the total dependant gets the lot.  It is only where partial dependency comes in that this position has to be considered. This is not going to mean more litigation.  I contest that entirely. Obviously, the number of claims will be less.  But, in any event, there is the fact that this has been the law in Great Britain for ten years, and it has not led to a very considerable amount of litigation.  The Deputies opposite appear to contemplate that there will be a big amount of litigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the decision of the courts in Great Britain would not bind the courts here, at the same time the decisions given there are likely to prevent litigation taking place here, because it is to be assumed that the same form of words will be interpreted in much the same manner here as they have been interpreted in Great Britain, and people are likely to be deterred from taking a <Col N="132" /> case to court by the knowledge that the case they propose to have argued here has already been negatived in the British courts.  Let me say that this is not a matter on which we need get agitated.  The question is, what is the best course to take?  There was the existing law which provided for the payment of compensation to persons who were injured by the death of a worker.  The payments made did not have regard to the extent to which those persons were dependent for the necessities of life upon the earnings of the worker.  The Committee recommended that the extent to which those persons were dependent for the necessities of life on the worker should be taken into account, and that the compensation available should be distributed on that basis.</P>
      <P>Is there a case in favour of turning down the Committee's report?  What is the case?  The case is that it is wrong, in any event, that dependency for the necessities of life should be the standard, and that injury should be the standard.  I do not feel convinced about that.  The rest of the case is that the change in the law is going to lead to litigation.  One argument in favour of a change is that it will reduce litigation by reducing the number of claims.  In Great Britain it has not led to that great volume of litigation which the Deputies opposite appear to contemplate will take place here.  At any rate, the litigation that has taken place in Great Britain will operate to prevent a very great amount of litigation arising here.  In these circumstances, my inclination is to leave the Bill in its present form, embodying, as it does, the Committee's recommendations.</P>

      <P>What is said in the Bill. You assess compensation in another way if you could show that you are a dependent person partially in reference to contributions that he makes to you.  Then you got compensation anyway under the 1906 Act, and under the earlier Act.  The Minister was incorrect in stating that it was adduced as an argument in favour of this amendment that the sub-section as it stands would bring about litigation.  I did not adduce that as an argument in favour of my amendment, but I gave it as an answer to the Minister's argument that the sub-section he is inserting in the Bill will prevent litigation.</P>

      <P>I did not support my amendment by saying that it would prevent or minimise litigation, but I gave that as an answer to the Minister's proposition that the sub-section would prevent or minimise litigation. In the case of a family living together, the sons and daughters contribute through the father to a common fund or pool, and out of that common fund or pool the members of the family are supported, with the father, perhaps, having a few shillings over and above for himself.  He has got to go into court and show how he spent every penny and half-penny, and even every farthing of the contributions that he got from his family, before he will be able to establish the fact that he was partially dependent on those contributions. Not merely will he have to show how he expended every half-penny of those contributions, but he will have to prove that the things he spent them on were, in the opinion of the judge, spent on the ordinary necessaries of life.  As we know, people may differ as to what are the ordinary necessaries of life.  That is going to happen, and that father who was in receipt of contributions from his children, and who was able to make a few shillings profit, if you like, is going to be deprived of getting anything by way of compensation for the death of his son or daughter who has made these contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> I fail to see how there is anything unmeritorious in a father who has been able to save a couple of shillings out of the contributions given to him by his son or daughter getting compensation for the death of those who were contributing to him.  He has undoubtedly lost something.  I fail to see any justification for the Committee's statement or the statement of the clerks of the peace that people of that kind have no merit.  I think they have every merit. I think that children who contribute in that way to their parents are doing a very meritorious act, and that the father who gets it, is getting it, perhaps if you like, as a sort of payment for the services he has rendered in bringing those children up on his hard earnings. To say that the few shillings he has been able to save, if he has been able to save them, are not to be compensated for when he loses them by the death of his son or daughter is, in my view, unmeritorious.  In my clear and emphatic opinion this is a most reactionary sub-section.  It is a nice thing to see a Fianna Fáil Minister standing vigorously over this reactionary sub-section.</P>

The intention of this sub-section and of the Committee's recommendation is that there should be payments to people who are dependants.  What is a dependant?

      <P>No doubt he can produce minute after minute to show that the Bill was headed in white prints in order to have it better considered, but the Minister should not get into a white heat about that. What is the definition of dependants? Let us see the 1906 Act and the reaction of the House of Lords' decision upon it.  What about that as a definition of dependency?  The Minister wants to change things.  It is not hard to see his change is a reactionary one if he wants to change back from one definition to another to suit his purpose.  Dependency at the moment, according to the decision of the House of Lords in the earlier case, means that if a father or mother was, as a matter of fact, receiving from the son's wages something which <Col N="136" /> that father expended upon the support and maintenance of the family, there was dependence.  The Minister now wants a new definition.  To get dependency clearly proved there must be proof that money was received and expended, not upon what the father thought necessary, but what some court afterwards would think proper and necessary to the person's position in life.  That is more liberal.  There are two definitions of dependency.  The Minister then attempts to make a case this way.  He takes the sum of money coming in as giving partial dependency and he argues that to the extent that people have counted on you have partial dependency, and you have to divide the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The total sum is limited by a maximum, but there are many cases in which the maximum is not given, and there are many cases in which a very small sum is given.  There are cases in which the arbitrator says there are so many people depending on the person.  Does the Minister realise that?  Where does the point come in about dividing the sum of money for a number of people?  Who divides it?  The Minister tried to mislead the House.  The point argued about here is this: What is going to affect an arbitrator, or a judge's mind, in determining what sum up to the maximum, or less than the maximum, is given in a case of partial dependency, if given?  We hold that the judge or the arbitrator should be allowed to take into consideration the sum to be given, whether the maximum be big or small amount, and that he should take this into consideration.  As a matter of fact, in the ordinary course of family life the workman and the children subscribe to the family fund, and so the father expends it on the maintenance of the family.  If so, the arbitrator will have his mind on that, and will give a certain sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  When you come to the Bill the arbitrator has to make up his mind and see whether the <Col N="137" /> father got from the son money, and whether this money was expended on necessaries, and on necessaries such as the arbitrator, or judge, thinks were fit for the person's station in life. There is a distinction, and the effect on the arbitrator's mind in deciding what compensation is to be is the principal thing.  It is nonsense to introduce that idea of division over the larger class of dependants.  The big thing is: What is the sum to assign or award?  That is what the Minister has to keep his mind on.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear the other interpretation.  That is what I consider to be partial dependency in this particular case.  What the family was, in fact, earning and spending for the purpose of its maintenance was what the county court judge could take into consideration.  The arbitrator or judge is going to have other things in his consideration hereafter, not what the family was, in fact, earning, or, in fact, spending, for the purpose of the maintenance as a family, but what money was properly spent and whether it was spent in necessaries appropriate to the situation in life of the people under consideration. The Minister has limited it.  He may have found a better definition, that dependency should mean dependency for necessaries as in fact shown by the practice of the family.  But we have our view that the other is a better standard, and this amendment will set up that better standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If this particular section were introduced in the interest of insurance companies I could understand it.  The effect of the section would be definitely to limit the possibility of receiving compensation in the case of persons partially dependent upon the injured workman.  It is totally different to the case put forward by Deputy Costelloe and Deputy McGilligan in the case where the son loses his life, if the son is contributing to the maintenance of the home.  It is necessary under this section, as now drawn, for the family to come into court, and for the father or the mother, as the case may be, to be able to show that the family was definitely dependent upon portion of the earnings of the deceased son. And when they make a statement to that effect in court, the court then comes along and says: &ldquo;We must ascertain whether that contribution was necessary for the provision of the ordinary necessaries of life.&rdquo;  An unchangeable standard&mdash;and under existing circumstances there are a variety of standards of life&mdash;might be involved in that; and the court has to decide what is necessary or not necessary.  The court has to say: &ldquo;Is this necessary or suitable for persons in the class of life or position of the claimants?&rdquo;  I think that is unnecessarily limiting the power of the court in the matter.  I think the section as drawn in this way is calculated to enable insurance companies to avoid the payment of compensation in circumstances where they would be liable to pay under the existing law.  It is possible, as I pointed out to the Minister, that in case of a deceased worker who loses his life in the course of his employment, if this section stands, that his dependants will have to come into court and prove that the wife, for instance, was depending upon the support of her husband for the provisions of the necessaries of life, and that these necessaries were such as were needed by persons in her class or position.  If she fails to show that these necessaries of life were provided by contributions from the husband and were necessary for her class and position in life it is quite <Col N="139" /> possible that that woman has not only lost her life's companion but that she will get no compensation for the loss of her husband and for the loss of the reserve which he would be to her in old age or for the loss of the security which she was able to get from the combined earnings of both of them while the husband continued to live. This seems to be narrowing completely the whole position as it exists at present.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he ought not to press this matter.  The fact that clerks of the peace discovered that this was necessary or desirable is no justification for introducing it. The fact that the Minister found it in a white print of this Bill when he came into office is still no justification for the introduction of the section. The fact that it is in the British Act of 1923 is less justification for putting in the section.  The Minister might well have left the position where it was when Lord Halsbury decided the matter.  That judgment was a better one in the interests of the injured workman and better than will be possible under this particular section. If the object is to limit the liability of the insurance companies I can understand this particular section, but if the object is to be fair to the workman and not to limit the possibility of his getting compensation in circumstances that the court in the ordinary way would give him compensation, then I suggest that there is a very strong case for reconsideration of the section, which is only limiting the chances of the workman getting compensation, and the people who will gain under this will not be the dependants but the insurance companies.</P>

      <P>This section is not inserted because the clerks of the peace discovered that claims might be made which had no merit or justification. It is appearing in the Bill because it is recommended by the Committee which included a number of prominent members of the Labour Party.  It appears in the Bill because a similar section has been in operation in <Col N="140" /> Great Britain and no evidence has been forthcoming that it has had an undesirable effect on the dependants of workmen.  It is appearing in the Bill because twice during the past few weeks I met deputations from the Trade Union Congress, the members of which had gone into the Bill with great thoroughness and raised points with me relating to every section, but they did not raise that point and had no objection to make to it.  It is appearing in the Bill because in fact some definition of dependency must appear.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite have dodged the issue of giving us a definition of dependency.  I am quite prepared to accept the decision of the Dáil upon this section.  As I said, this is a matter upon which opinions may differ, and whichever side has the majority of opinions with it, will no doubt carry the day.  Whatever that decision is, I am quite prepared to accept it.  The section is in the Bill, because the Committee recommended it; not because the clerks of the peace recommended it to the Committee, but because the Committee were prepared to stand over what the clerks of the peace had suggested. It is there because it seems to be essential that there should be a definition of dependency.  The original Act of 1906, the main Act in operation, refers to people who are partially dependent on a deceased workman. What is meant by &ldquo;dependent on&rdquo;? Deputy Norton apparently agrees that compensation should only go to people who are partially dependent on a deceased worker.  Is it suggested here, where a worker is killed in an accident in the course of his employment, that payment should be made to people who were not dependent on the earnings of that worker?  That is apparently the suggestion.  If the payments are to go to dependants of the workers, what do you mean by &ldquo;dependant&rdquo;?  A person who is dependent on the earnings of the worker for the necessaries of life, or what do you mean?</P>

      <P>The Deputy rushed in and is now trying to rush out.  The <Col N="142" /> section says that the word &ldquo;dependants&rdquo; means such of the members of the family of a workman as were wholly or in part dependent on the earnings of such workman at the time of his death, or who would have been so dependent.  &ldquo;A person shall not for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be a partial dependant of another person unless he was dependent partially on contributions from that other person for the provision of the ordinary necessaries of life suitable for persons in his class and position.&rdquo;  I submit that it is undesirable that we should leave the Act in the form in which the Deputies want to leave it, where we talk of a person being dependent on the earnings of such workman at the time of his death, unless we say dependent for what.  If the Deputies wish they can withdraw the amendment and see if they can produce a form of words which will define dependency. If we are going to pass an Act that, as Deputy Dillon said, is to stand for a generation, we should have a definition of dependency, if our aim is to secure that on the death of a workman the compensation would go to his dependants.</P>

      <P>The Minister has twice stated that we dodged the issue as to the definition of dependency.  I have once denied that and for the second time I wish to deny it again.  The definition of dependency that we want is the definition of dependency that is in Section 13 of the Act of 1906, which has remained the definition of dependency in this country for 27 years, and which gives effect to the decision of the House of Lords given in 1900.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the point might crop up again, perhaps I ought to give this explanation.  The Minister referred to the fact that certain labour and trade union people signed the report of the Committee on Workmen's Compensation, presumably, because of that fact everything in the report is to be sacrosanct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  The Deputy made a suggestion that this section had been inserted in the <Col N="143" /> interests of insurance companies, and my answer was that the section had been recommended by prominent members of the Labour Party and not objected to by the Trade Union Congress representatives when they came to discuss the matter with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that it has been inserted in the interests of insurance companies.  I said I could imagine its being inserted by somebody speaking on behalf of insurance companies. What happened is that there are many bad sections in the report of the 1926 Committee on Workmen's Compensation and there are many sections in the report with which the Labour Party disagreed.  One of the Labour members is a member of the Oireachtas, and I am sure he will have no hesitation in telling the Minister that many objectionable sections in the report were tolerated in order to get a unanimous report.  That does not mean that the report in itself was necessarily a good one.  Many objectionable things were tolerated in order to get a unanimous report, and we spoke of a Workmen's Compensation Bill based completely on the report.</P>
      <P>This Bill is not based completely on the report, and if we put up with bad sections in the report in order to get a uniform report, we are surely not being asked still to tolerate those bad sections when the Bill itself is not based on the report.  The Minister makes the point that this matter was not mentioned to him by the trade union delegates, who made representations to him.  It was marked on the Bill which I had with me on the day I went to discuss the matter with the Minister in the first instance, and were it not for a meeting which I had to attend on the second occasion the matter would have been specifically brought to his notice, because I was charged with the responsibility of doing so.  The point is not a new one, and is not now referred to for the first time.</P>

      <P>I was speaking on this motion some weeks ago when I had to move the adjournment of the Dáil.  At the time, I was dealing with prices.  I had said that the prices were much lower now for farming commodities than they were in 1931, and that the fall in prices was due more to the fall in world prices than to the effects of the economic war between the two countries. When the adjournment was moved I was just proceeding to quote some of the figures as issued officially by the Department of Industry and Commerce in this country and the Ministry of Agriculture in Great Britain, comparing the week ended 16th September, 1931, with the week ended 16th September, 1933.  I propose, therefore, to continue to discuss those prices, but as four or five weeks have elapsed in the meantime I can now take a more recent week, namely the week ended 4th November.  Taking the figures for that week in the Irish Free State and in Great Britain we find that there is a reduction of price in most cases in both countries.  I will begin with the case of eggs.  In the Irish Free State for the week under discussion eggs were 1/10¼ per dozen in 1931 and 1/8¾ in 1933&mdash;a reduction of 1½d. a dozen.</P>

The reduction in the price of eggs in Great Britain in the week ended 4th November, 1933, as compared with the week ended 4th November, 1931, was 2d. per dozen, so that really the price fell more in Great Britain than in the Free State in 1933 as compared with 1931&mdash; ½d. a dozen more.  That is quite understandable, because it happens that in the case of eggs the bounty is, in most cases&mdash;unless eggs go higher than they are at present&mdash;at least equal to the tariff.  In fact, in most cases it is more than the tariff.</P>

      <P>The facts are that the figures issued by the British Ministry of Agriculture for the week ended 4th November, 1931, and the week ended 4th November, 1933, show that eggs have gone down by 2d. per dozen. According to the figures issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce in this country the price has gone down by only 1½d.  It may be, as in the case of offals&mdash;the point was made by Deputy Dillon&mdash;that the shippers were paying the tariff themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next item is farmers' butter. In the Irish Free State the same price of 10¼d. was paid in the week ended 4th November, 1931, and the week ended 4th November, 1933.  Turning to Great Britain we find that the price was reduced from 1/5¼ to 1/3½, a reduction of 1¾d., so that the British farmer is much worse off than the Irish Free State farmer one year compared with the other.  The next item is milk at creameries.  We have no creameries to compare ourselves with in Great Britain, so we have to take Northern Ireland.  Over a six or eight months' period the average price paid by our creameries was 4d. or 4½d. per gallon, while it was 2½d. in Northern Ireland so that we beat them hollow in that respect.  We are doing very well in the economic war&mdash;much better than if we had no economic war.  In the case of fat sheep, there is a reduction in the Free State of 8/6 per cwt. and in Great Britain a reduction of 4/8, so that the Irish Free State farmer is worse off with sheep than the farmer in Great Britain. Coming to lambs, the figures in the Irish Free State show a loss of 9/6 a cwt., and in Great Britain a loss of 4/8.  For lambs and sheep the Irish farmer is considerably worse off as a result of the economic war than the farmer in Great Britain.  The next item is fat cattle.  The price of fat cattle per cwt. in 1933, compared with 1931, has gone down in the Free State by 11/6 per cwt. and in Great Britain 6/-.  For the week ending the 4th November, 1931, the price was 34/6 and for the same period in 1933, 23/-. The price of fat cattle in Great Britain shows a reduction from 43/8 to 33/9. They give two classes, the reduction in <Col N="148" /> both cases coming to 5/4.  In 1933, as compared with 1931, store cattle show a reduction per head in the Free State of £5 13s. 3d. and in Great Britain of £4, so that the very big reduction in the price of store cattle in this country is mainly due to a reduction in world prices.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should reserve some of these good points until he is winding up.  There is an increase in the price of bacon in both countries over the price obtaining in 1931.  In the Irish Free State bacon was 5/6 higher and in Great Britain 6/6 higher, so that roughly the farmer in Great Britain is 1/- per pig better off than the farmer in the Free State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The average for fat and lean was 46/6.  Oats, about which there has been so much talk recently, and about the price of which accusations have been made against the Government, were, on an average, 4/9 per cwt., while our neighbours across the border got only 3/11, so that the Free State farmer is better off there than those in the North of Ireland.  There are no figures issued for Scotland, but I got an extract from the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> of October 10th, 1933, in which it is stated that a meeting of farmers was held at which the Government was condemned.  That seems to be an international disease amongst farmers.  At the meeting it was stated that the farmers could not continue to produce oats for 13/- and 14/- a quarter.  I believe a Scotch quarter represents two barrels in this country, so that they would be getting from 6/6 to 7/- a barrel, while our <Col N="149" /> farmers were at least getting a little more.  At the meeting one farmer criticised the British Government for its inaction.  He complained that as far as he could see the Government had neglected agriculture.  He said that when the next election came along the farmers would not be found voting for the present British Government.</P>

      <P>I have the prices of various commodities, and any Deputy who cares to look at them in the Library will find that prices here have, in some cases, been better; that we have held our prices better than British farmers and in other cases worse.  On the balance, I would say that we have not; that the farming community is worse off in 1933 than British farmers.  But, against that it must be remembered that farmers here are well compensated for their losses owing to the economic struggle by a permanent reduction of £2,000,000 yearly in their land annuities.  There has been a reduction this year of £3,000,000 in land annuities.  Some Deputies made the point that derating was different to the reduction of land annuities.  On this side of the House we have held that it is fairer to give a reduction of land annuities than to give any further reduction in rates, because rating is fixed more or less on a fairer basis than on the valuation of the land.  Every farmer has to pay rates <i>pro rata</i>, according to the value of his land, as closely as it can be fixed.  There may be certain complaints about rateable valuations, but, on the whole, the owners are paying more or less according to the value of the land.  On the other hand, the annuities were not assessed on the value.  Some farmers had to pay £2 an acre, while others paid only 2/6 an acre.  It was much fairer to halve the annuities rather than to halve the rates.  Having done some research in this matter, I am very glad to find that Deputy Belton held that opinion on one occasion.</P>

As Deputy Batt O'Connor is not in the House at present, I do not like to quote what he said.  In the course of his remarks, Deputy Belton said that the burden of rates could be reduced by a reduction in land annuities.  That is sound.  I agree with that.

It was really only designed to show that if Deputies on the other side were really honest on this matter, we would have not only this Party, a big majority of this House, in favour of the policy of keeping the money at home, and of reducing land annuities, but we would have many of the Deputies on the other side with us, too.

      <P>I have said that the big reduction in the prices of farm commodities in this country was due to the fall in world prices and not to the economic struggle between the two countries.  We have tried to compensate the farmer for his losses on the world market.  We have tried to compensate him, by protecting and subsidising certain of the farming industries, such as milk products.  I believe that our prices for milk in this country can compare favourably with those in any other country in the world.  I know that during the summer, I got prices from many of the continental countries and from Australia and New Zealand, the big milk producing countries, and so far as I could find, at the time, at any rate, no country was paying as high a value for milk as we were paying in this country for milk going to the creameries.</P>

We have tried, in spite of the Party opposite and against the opposition of the Party opposite, to give the farmers of this country a decent price for wheat, at least as good a price as we thought we could afford, taking all the circumstances into account, and I think that the farmers who grew wheat this year are well satisfied with their experiment. <Col N="153" /> There is not the slightest doubt that we shall have a much bigger acreage under wheat next year, and that, I say again, not only in spite of opposition at the time the Cereals Bill was going through, but in spite even of the prophecy of Deputy Dillon to-day on our whole cereals policy.  We have also tried to encourage tobacco and beet, and next year we hope to have 40,000 acres more under beet than we have had hitherto.</P>

      <P>I think it would be great to let them all talk.  In addition to beet, we also offered inducements for the growing of tobacco, fruit and vegetables, and Deputy Belton will agree that we have done everything possible to get the home market in vegetables for the Irish farmer.  The next question that one would naturally ask in this debate is, whether the farmer can pay his rates or not, taking all these things into account, and taking into account present prices compared with those of 1931, and the fact that there are certain industries within agriculture that are subsidised, and perhaps put on a better paying basis than even in 1931.  Having taken into account that they are now asked to pay only half their rent and, in fact, this year only a quarter, but for the future half their rent, we want to know whether the farmer can pay his rates or not.  I am of opinion that the farmer can pay his rates, and will pay his rates if he is only left alone and not encouraged not to pay them.</P>

I want to give a little history of the part that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and others have played in this matter of the payment of rates.  I think they have not played a very noble part.  If they had left the farmers alone their rates would have been paid already, and if any Deputy will look up the record of the payments of rates in average counties, he will find that they have paid just as well as last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is taking this matter a little too seriously.  There was a meeting of the Ard-Chomhairle of Cumann na nGaedheal held on 30th March, 1933.  I think it was Cumann na nGaedheal at that time.  At that meeting, there was a proposition by General Mulcahy:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Ard-Chomhairle instructs the Standing Committee to examine the situation at once with a view to indicating by what means, however drastic, the economic war could in their opinion honourably be brought to an end.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the motion of Mr. Hogan of Dublin, seconded by Mr. Brophy, the Ard-Chomhairle passed a resolution strongly condemning the Government action in relation to the Chief Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána.  That has nothing to do with it, except that it was rather a strange resolution to pass, seeing that we had placed a heaven-sent leader at their head.  This resolution, however, was proposed by General Mulcahy and passed, to the effect that a committee should be appointed to go into the matter, and take action, however drastic, to bring the economic war to a head.  At the same meeting, there was later a resolution passed that the convention should go into private session.  The convention went into private session and considered methods of stopping the economic war, however drastic, and so we heard nothing about them for a little while longer until we came to May 4th, when another meeting was held.  The committee had considered the matter with a view to devising methods, however drastic, and Mr. M. R. Heffernan, a prominent figure in this House at one time, proposed a resolution setting out that the South Tipperary County Council was fully justified in not striking a rate.  He gave various reasons for his resolution, into which I need not go here.  It was discussed for some time, and Mr. P. Belton, T.D., said that he thought the resolution should be amended to refer to Dublin and the other county councils which had taken a similar stand.</P>

      <P>He did not want to be left out in the cold.  Mr. Gearóid O'Sullivan said that the only way to deal with this matter was by direct action&mdash;direct action, mind you.  Of course, the thing was passed.  Mr. Heffernan withdrew his resolution in favour of an amended resolution by Deputy Belton approving of the action of the County Councils of Waterford, Dublin, Cork, South Tipperary and Kilkenny in refusing to strike a rate. So we had the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation meeting and officially approving of the actions of those county councils that refused to strike a rate and giving encouragement to their followers, whatever few followers they have, throughout the country not to pay a rate under any circumstances but to hold out against an unjust Government.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am just visualising what took place at the private session. Deputy Cosgrave, in putting the resolution, defended the technical legality, and was taken to task I noticed a few days afterwards by the <i>Irish Times.</i>  Deputy Cosgrave, leader of the Party at that time, defended the technical legality which the Government depended upon to make these county councils do their business. There you had Deputy Cosgrave, their leader; Deputy Belton, one of their most prominent members; Deputy Heffernan, one of their ex-members; General Mulcahy, Deputy Gearóid O'Sullivan, all defending this action of the county council in not striking a rate.  These Deputies knew very well at the time what they were doing. They knew very well that they were encouraging the people not to pay rates.  They knew they were setting a headline to the country in giving their blessing to the county councils that stood out.  They knew they were giving a headline to every ratepayer not to pay rates.  The county councils were right and the Government were wrong!</P>

I say that that meeting held on the 4th of May gave the imprimatur of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to the non-payment of rates which they were trying to push on the country at the time.  They failed in that.  They came to the conclusion themselves that they failed, and they did not try to pursue the policy any further.  The next occasion that I can find any public appearance of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or their leaders was when Deputy Cosgrave went to Ferns.  I find a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> describing how with bands playing native airs and flags flying he was escorted to the ancient castle of Dermot MacMorrough where he addressed the people.  He spoke at the ancient castle of Dermot MacMorrough, a fitting place for him to make his speech.  He made the usual speech which he had been making for the previous five months, but he omitted any reference to the rate campaign.  He let Deputy Belton <Col N="158" /> down.  He let them pay their fines and get out of the mess into which they had got.</P>

The motion says: &ldquo;That the Dáil condemns the action of the Government in reducing the total of the grants payable for the relief of rates on agricultural land.&rdquo;  Now, I am just going to come to that motion. The Government has had this matter under consideration.  They came to <Col N="161" /> the conclusion, as I have said already here to-night, that the reduction in the land annuities was much more beneficial and much fairer to the farmers as a whole than a reduction in rates and, as I said before, I am supported in that by Deputy Belton. However, we have considered the matter further, and we think that a more equitable scheme could be got as a permanent scheme.  We are considering that permanent scheme at the moment and I hope it will be introduced and passed through both Houses in time to give the relief of rates for next year.</P>

      <P>I must get back to the motion now, if I am allowed by Deputies.  As I was saying, some Deputies say that the dairy farmer is the biggest employer in this country. Others say that it is the man engaged in the growing of corn, barley, oats and wheat who is the best employer.  Others claim that a great deal of employment is given in the tending of livestock; others, in the tending of grass; others hold that great employment is given in the growing of vegetables.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, even cutting turf or growing fruit.  I think it would be rather a hard task for the Government or for anybody else to decide as <Col N="163" /> between all those contending parties, and what we say is that we will give all you want, let you all have your own way, whether tending livestock, feeding pigs or anything you like, but the derating of land will be given on the basis of the amount of employment you give.  That is the fairest basis possible, and that is the basis on which we mean to bring it in next year.  I think that Deputy Belton should not press this motion until he sees what a fine scheme we have under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was announced last spring.  Deputy Belton claimed here once that he was responsible.  First of all he said that there was no tariff on rhubarb, and, when I said that there was, he said he was responsible for getting it.  This derating scheme, for which we hope to bring in a Bill during this winter, will be based on the amount of employment given.  We want to be fair to everybody&mdash;to the dairy farmer, the oat grower, the fruit grower, the turf cutter, and everybody else&mdash;even the man who keeps rabbits or who keeps horses, or the man who wants to keep his tennis courts clean.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy got a little cold storage now it might improve him. The highest standard of derating was given in 1932, and we took the year 1932, therefore, as the standard year, the most favourable year possible.  On the first £15 valuation that a man has we say that the man is entitled to that valuation himself and will give him whatever the standard derating may be for the particular county on that, and for every person employed, whether son or brother, a relative or a hired man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, a daughter does not come in&mdash;only males.  As long as the man is getting full-time employment with that farmer he will get a certain allowance on every £10 valuation or <Col N="164" /> so much for every man he has employed.  It will be absolutely fair for the whole country.  It will be based on the amount of employment given, no matter what kind of farming is being done.  Some people hold that the rancher is an asset to the country and gives employment.  If that is so, he is all right.  He can go on being an asset, but he will only get derating according to the amount of employment he gives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving only a very bare outline of the scheme which will <Col N="165" /> come before the Dáil some time during the winter session.  Deputies will then have an opportunity of studying it. When I was rather rudely interrupted, I was speaking of the policy of the opposite Party on this rates question. I said that Deputy Cosgrave, when he went to Ferns in June, had dropped this plank from his programme.  When it came to a question of the policy of the new Party, I was anxious to see whether they would adopt this no-rate item.  They did not.  What they said was that they would halve the annuities.  Of the 24 articles of their policy 23½ were Fianna Fáil.  The only difference was the other half, which concerned the question of going into the Empire.  That was the only difference they could make from our policy.  I suppose that was a sop to Deputy Dillon's Party&mdash;going into the Empire.</P>
      <P>As regards halving the annuities, I am sure Deputy Belton will say that he led them into that, because he spoke of that in 1926.  In 1926 he advocated reduction of the annuities and he ought now to claim that he got that Party to do something, because he is always claiming that he got us to do something.  Everybody who took any interest in the matter thought that this new Party would be out for derating. But they are not.  All they said was that they would consider the matter. That is about 1,000,000 to one against derating.  In the first place, they must get into power and, in the second place, they must consider the question. A double event of that kind is surely 1,000,000 to one against derating.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very keen on derating at a time when I thought the annuities could not be reduced.  But when I was educated by Deputy Belton and realised that the annuities could be halved, I said that that was a much better thing than derating.  Now, we have halved the annuities and we shall go farther in derating the man who deserves derating next year, but only the man who deserves it.  I think that Deputy Belton ought not to persist with this motion because we intend <Col N="166" /> to bring in a scheme to relieve the rates of the farmer who deserves relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now five minutes to ten, and the Minister for Agriculture rose at nine o'clock.  Before moving to report progress on the last occasion that this matter was under discussion, the Minister for Agriculture had spoken for more than an hour. We have now been listening to the Minister for Agriculture for one and three-quarter hours.  His purpose in rising was to resist the motion standing in the name of Deputies Belton, O'Higgins and Minch: &ldquo;That the Dáil condemns the action of the Government in reducing the total of the grants payable for the relief of rates on agricultural land.&rdquo;  I propose to follow the Minister in so far as it is possible to follow any man through a fog of verbiage.  I shall try to follow the points raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister began, with a courage born of desperation, by blandly asserting that agricultural prices were not materially lower here than they are in the six counties of Ulster and in Great Britain.  He makes that assertion in face of the fact that numbers of cattle are being driven across the Border every night&mdash;smuggled across the Border&mdash;and that men are prepared to risk imprisonment and heavy fines in order to get their cattle across the Border.  According to the Minister for Agriculture, in Leinster House, they are doing that for fun.  They are doing it to see if they can run more quickly than the R.U.C.  Rational people, such as the practical farmers who stand in the fairs from day to day, would not run the risk of imprisonment and heavy fines if there was not something to be got out of it.  They will be comforted and chastened to know that the Minister for Agriculture cannot understand why they go on like that, because they could get just as good prices in the County Monaghan as they can get in Derry, Fermanagh or Tyrone.  Look at the prices.  The Minister admits that the price of cattle has fallen here since we have had the blessing of a Fianna Fáil Government, from 34/6 to 23/-.  Last week, the comparison would have been <Col N="167" /> between 36/- and 22/9.  The price of fat sheep has fallen since we were blessed with the advent of Fianna Fáil from 34/3 to 23/-.  The price of lambs has fallen from 37/6 to 25/9.  The Minister rejoiced to be able to report that pigs had held their own.  He did not go on to say that the price which ruled the pork industry last January, after 12 months of Fianna Fáil, was 24/- per cwt., and that that operated so effectively to reduce the pig population here, that in the 44 weeks ending November 2, 1933, 751,000 pigs were cured, or exported, whereas in the 44 weeks ending November 5, 1931, 907,000 pigs were cured or exported. The Minister for Agriculture has managed to keep the price of pork here just level by reducing the pork trade by 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Every single branch of agriculture at present is a losing branch so far as the producer is concerned.  It is only right to say that the period of loss for the big cattle dealer and the man with extensive fattening lands is over, for he can go and buy cheap cattle from the small farmers and, having bought cheaply, he can sell cheaply.  He suffered loss last year.  In some cases, these men were wiped out.  Those who survived are making profits now.  The man who is being crushed down into the earth is the man who is producing the cattle, and that man is the small farmer in the west of Ireland, the south of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I challenge the Minister for Agriculture to name any single branch of the agricultural industry in which a small farmer could occupy himself to-day and make a profit.  I am speaking for the small farmers in the Gaeltacht, in the west and south of Ireland.  I know of no branch of agriculture in which a small farmer can engage profitably at the present time. The fowl trade has been wiped out; the egg trade has been turned upside down and, with regard to the pork trade, no man knows what is going to happen to it in the next two or three <Col N="168" /> months.  Those engaged in the industry have to close down the factory to-day and open it to-morrow.  No one who is sending pigs to a bacon factory knows what price he will get.  At any moment prices may slump.  They rise one day and perhaps slump the next day.</P>
      <P>The Minister speaks of 4d. and 4½d a gallon for milk as the average price throughout the country.  Where does that average obtain?  Are there any Fianna Fáil Deputies prepared to substantiate the Minister's statement that they have got an average of 4½d. a gallon?  The Minister says that in some cases more than 4½d. a gallon for milk was obtained.  Where are those creameries?  They may be in existence but, so far as I am concerned, I never got more than 3.6d. during the last 12 months.  I will be glad to know where the creamery is which pays 4.5d. a gallon for milk.  The Minister tosses off a series of figures which he says are published by the Department of Agriculture. They are not published by the Department of Agriculture.  He gave figures which he alleged are the ruling prices for selected and extra selected eggs.  Where are those figures published?  I suggest there are no such figures published.  Of course, the Minister may trot out any figure he likes.  All I can tell him is that the price of eggs during the last 12 months, week after week, in the country markets&mdash;and that is where the people sell them&mdash;has been 20 to 30 per cent. lower than last year, and 50 per cent. lower than in 1931.  Anyone who is in everyday touch with the country markets knows that perfectly well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to go into the figures for sheep and fat cattle.  The Minister admits the indictment there. A rational man listening to the Minister cannot but be amazed that he has the audacity to stand up in this House and maintain that agricultural prices at the present time do not show the effects of the economic struggle that is going on between President de Valera's Government and the British Government.  They do, of course, and as evidence of that the Minister is pouring out money as fast as he can to try to mitigate the appalling effects <Col N="169" /> that that economic upheaval is having on our people.  He is pouring out money in so reckless a way that a judge of the bench in this city felt bound to express the strongest disapproval of the methods adopted by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture in administering these bounties; felt bound to call into question their conduct in the administration of these moneys; felt bound to point out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Chair will, perhaps, remember that when the Minister for Agriculture was speaking he made the case that there could be no reason shown for restoring what had been taken off the agricultural grant because the price of agricultural produce had not fallen and, therefore, the farmers were not suffering from any inconvenience at all as a result of the economic war.  I rebut that allegation. I say that they are suffering very grave inconvenience and that that is manifest to every rational person.  I say further that the Minister is pouring out money recklessly and improvidently in an endeavour to mitigate the disaster that has come on the agricultural community and, so grave is the crisis, that he is committed to pour out money in so irresponsible a way as to bring down on his own head and on his Department censure from the bench.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I need hardly say that any such interjection would be deservedly dissented from on this side of the House.  The House must excuse me, for it is somewhat difficult to maintain the thread of one's argument amidst such a tornado of susceptibilities and sensitiveness.  But I was dealing with the manner in which the Minister found it necessary to disburse £2,000,000 of public money in order to mitigate the effects of the disaster which his Government had brought upon our people, and the existence of which he now takes so drastic and catastrophic a step to counter.  By the Department over which he presides, £2,000,000 of public money is being poured out without apparent authority, without any regulations and without any scheme of administration, and in such a way that it seems to be that nobody, no matter how the fund was plundered, can be convicted of fraud, because there were no rules or regulations against such a fraud being committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That such a state of affairs could exist is in itself deplorable and shocking, but that it could exist side by side with the declaration from the Minister for Agriculture that there was no necessity for any such fund is not only shocking, but audacious.  I pity the Minister for Agriculture.  He comes in here bewildered by the impossible task set him by his colleagues, <Col N="173" /> and he rambles and rambles interminably, thirsting for irrelevant interruptions, and cheerfully galloping after them when they are made.  But he never comes down to the point.  He never comes down to give any account of his stewardship in his administration of the Department of Agriculture in this country.  The Minister has audacity.  He has forgotten the existence of the word &ldquo;shame.&rdquo;  But there is still left him some fear of something which warns him that if he comes face to face with the results of his own policy, not even his exterior of brass will be proof against the poison.  I do not very much mind the Minister for his rambling, because that only redounds to his own disgrace. I do not mind the back-benchers of the Party getting up and making reckless charges, because charming as these back-benchers may be, most of the people of this country know them to be an irresponsible lot, and do not pay much heed to them.</P>

      <P>No, they chose a suitable train for the leader they want, and after all if they are a bit gay and irresponsible could not the same be said of the Government that takes £2,000,000 and pours it out in such a way that there are neither rules nor regulations and that there is such a want of system for its disbursement that the very judges on the bench have remonstrated and expressed amazement that any public department should act as they have acted?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already done so. My reply to the people who put them there was: &ldquo;They fooled you once, shame on them, I am sorry for you; they fooled you twice, more shame still on them, I am sorry for you; but by the Lord if they fool you three times, the devil mend you.&rdquo;  That is what I have already said to the people, but the people are at last beginning <Col N="174" /> to understand them, to understand that though they are decent, kindly fellows, still they are an irresponsible lot.  But when one of these warriors gets upon the front bench he ceases to be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and becomes a Minister of this State.  That changes the feeling of respect that attaches to what he says, but it does not change the man, and that is his misfortune.  Deputy Dr. Ryan from a back bench could do very little harm, but Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture, in the front bench is very different.  People read what he says.  Those who do not know him personally might believe him.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tried by devious ways to create the impression here and in the country that there was a conspiracy set on foot by members of this Party to induce people in this country to break the law and withhold payment of rates.  The Minister knows that is not true, and he dare not repeat it outside this House nor make a specific charge in connection with it, because if he did so he would be made responsible.  He knows the charge is not true.  It was never a fact.  But members of this Party have, in their capacity as county councillors, resisted the striking of a rate.  That was a perfectly legal thing to do, and there were perfectly proper methods of going about having that matter tried out in court and a verdict got.  They took a certain course of action that the circumstances justified.  They were entitled, as public men, if they believed it to be in the public interest, to decline to strike a rate.  They did it on the grounds that the Government in withholding a large part of the agricultural grant after the original rate had been struck, was doing a gross injustice and was doing something manifestly contrary to the will of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now what did they do?  When the Government moved in a constitutional and legal way to have the matter brought before a proper court, they did not come into court and cry as an answer to the charge &ldquo;Up the Republic.&rdquo;  They did not deny the authority of the court and show their contempt for the authority of the <Col N="175" /> court of the people.  They went into the courts of this country.  They made their case.  They conducted themselves respectfully and they made no bones about abiding by the verdict. Is that to their discredit?  I do not think so.  It is greatly to their credit. Admittedly they suffered serious personal loss.  It was a serious personal loss to many of them.  It was not the first personal loss they sustained doing what they conceived to be their duty in public life and probably it will not be the last.  But at least they did what they believed was right.  When the courts of the country found against them, they made no bones about the matter.</P>
    <P>They made their protest in the matter of these rates, and in making it they believed they were doing what was right.  But it is a mean and contemptible thing for the Minister of a State to make back-hand charges against members of this Party; to charge that we conspired to break the law.  If the Minister believes that, he has a solemn duty to place his information in the hands of the Chief of the Crimes Department of the Gárda Síochána and have us arrested and tried.  That is the proper thing to do. If there has been a conspiracy amongst the members of this Party to break the law or to defy it, the proper thing for the Government to do is to bring the members of this Party to justice. The same applies to the members of the Minister's own Party.  No one on this side of the House asks for any preference or consideration.  On that matter we are quite prepared to accept the verdicts of the courts of this country.  We are quite prepared to stand our trial before any court set up by the laws passed by the Oireachtas.  It is a contemptible and an irresponsible thing for a Minister of State to charge his political opponents with crime under the shelter of parliamentary privilege when he has not got the courage to institute proceedings.</P>
    <P>Now, the fact of it is, that we believe, and we make no concealment of our belief, that we consider that so <Col N="176" /> long as this economic war goes on the Government ought to find the rates from the Central Fund.  They make the war; they are carrying on the war, and they ought to find the finances for it.  That is a perfectly rational position to take up.  We believe that the Government ought to accept that responsibility from the Central Fund.  We have consistently said that unless and until the Oireachtas does that, the people must pay their rates if they are able to pay them, and that where they are not able to pay them they ought to take pen and paper and sit down and write to the responsible authority explaining the reason why they cannot pay and that there ought to be no attempt to ignore the rate collecting authority.  Where you have the money you ought to pay.  Where you have not the money you ought to sit down and write to the competent authorities and tell them the reason why you cannot pay and what offer you are prepared to make.  That is our position, perfectly plain and perfectly clear.  I challenge the Minister for Finance and the President to say if they believe there is any conspiracy amongst their own members.  I would advise the Minister for Finance to go down to Kerry and look into the situation there.  It is the worst county in Ireland for the payment of rates. There was a worse collection in Kerry than in any other county in the Free State, and Fianna Fáil has five members from it out of seven.  Let the Minister do a bit of searching in Kerry and he will find that there is a conspiracy there to withhold rates, and maybe that is not the only thing that they are conspiring to do in Kerry.  Let him deal with these conspiracies with the same courage and the same abandon that he is ready to deal with a conspiracy not to pay rates, and this Party will have nothing to complain of.  But there ought to be an end, once for all, to mean back-sliding insinuations.  Let anyone that wants to make a charge come out and make it and they will be met, but do not chose some small fellow who has nothing but his £360 a year.  Put up someone who has <Col N="177" /> something to be taken off him, and if he makes that charge outside we will take it off him.  Do not put up some fellow who will plead privilege for his parliamentary salary and then go bankrupt.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the Minister for Finance ever think back to the time when he was a member of the Opposition, when in 1928 he got up and told Mr. Blythe, who was then Minister for Finance, what a miscreant he was when he introduced his Budget.  He said that it broke his heart to think of a burden of £20,396,000 in taxation being laid upon the poor people of this country.  That was in 1928.  I want to refresh the Minister's memory and to remind him of the price that ruled for cattle in 1928.  It was about 45/- per cwt.  The burden of taxation that he thought was absolutely heartbreaking at that time was £20,396,000.  I will quote what the Minister for Finance, who was then in Opposition, said at that time:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The actual amount raised last year was £20,396,000, so that at the very lowest computation taxation during the current year will be heavier than last year to the tune of £339,000.  Can we impose such an additional burden?  Will industry sustain it, for if industry cannot sustain it I submit that we are not justified in imposing it?  At the present moment, in proportion to our resources, in population and in wealth, we are the most heavily taxed country in Europe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Just imagine Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, striking the table as he used those words.  He went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I dare say that we are almost the most heavily taxed country in the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, bad and all as we were in 1928 we are £12,000,000 worse in 1933.</P>

      <P>He would want to be.  In a lengthy speech in the Official Debates Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, wept over the condition of the country and said that it broke his heart to think of the poor struggling farmers labouring under such a burden.  I have no doubt that by the time he was finished the poor Minister for Finance of the time, Mr. Blythe, felt a very small man.  He must have said to himself &ldquo;If this man ever becomes Minister for Finance marvels will come to pass.&rdquo;  Well, he was right, but they were the kind of marvels that he never anticipated&mdash;the greatest marvels that ever came to pass in any country in the world.  It is because these marvels have come to pass, and because the Minister has placed upon the backs of the poor people of this country a burden which he himself declared was unthinkable and monstrous, that the people now cannot pay their rates.  You can convict him out of his own mouth and out of the mouths of his colleagues and of every man sitting on the opposite benches with the Greek chorus of Alderman Tom Kelly joining in.  They know as well as we know that the people are being ground into the earth.  They know as well as we know that this motion is justified, and the testimony and the proof of that is that they themselves are coming forward with a scheme in order to meet the point raised in this motion.  It is a harumscarum scheme.  They cannot do the sensible thing.  It would not be the Fianna Fáil way.  It would not be Pretty Fanny's way to do the sensible, commonsense thing.  It is to have trimmings and ribbons and Fianna Fáil decorations on it, but in fact they dare not get up to meet this motion.  The sensible thing to do would be what we ask, but that is not <Col N="179" /> their way of doing business.  But even so we would sooner get something for the poor people in the Fianna Fáil way than get nothing.  We cannot expect commonsense or reason from them, but thank heaven we have managed to extract some little measure of justice out of them.  We wanted <Col N="180" /> the whole thing, but we are glad to get a bit of it.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice of the Land Commission to issue maps of registered holdings which are subject to land purchase annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Copy maps of registered holdings are issued by the Land Registry, and applicants to the Land Commission for such copy maps are referred to the Land Registry Department.  The Land Registry furnish maps to applicants therefor when possible, and if the folio map has been destroyed by fire, application is made by them to the Land Commission for a loan of the estate map in order to make a copy.  In cases where a Land Commission estate map (lent to the Land Registry to prepare folio maps on registration) has also been destroyed by fire in the Four Courts and a new map has not been constructed, a copy map cannot be supplied. It is understood that the Land Registry is gradually reconstructing <Col N="20" /> the maps destroyed and thereby restoring the records.</P>
