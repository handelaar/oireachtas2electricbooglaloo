      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have received a petition under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, for the drainage of the Greise River (Lower), County Kildare, and an engineer is at present in the district engaged on making a detailed survey of the length of river concerned.  Subsequently, the lands affected must be valued and the Minister for Finance and County Council approached for the necessary free grants before a detailed drainage scheme can be prepared and submitted to the votes of the occupiers of affected land.  These investigations will occupy a considerable time and it is not possible to forecast when the works can be begun.</P>

      <P>Before moving for leave to introduce the Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, which is No. 3 on the Order Paper, I should like to explain that it is really No. 13 &mdash;Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Bill&mdash;in an amended form.  Its introduction is occasioned by the following circumstances: an amendment stood in my name on the Order Paper which would give effect to certain proposals in relation to a period anterior to January, 1919.  While the amendment was within the title of the Bill and within the terms of the Money Resolution, it was, nevertheless, considered by the Ceann Comhairle to be so material an enlargement of the scope of the Bill, as read a Second Time, that is would be more advisable to withdraw that Bill and embody the amendment which I have submitted in a new Bill.  Accordingly, with the leave of the House, I should like, before moving the First Reading of the Bill which is No. 3 on the Order Paper, to move that the Order for Committee Stage of the Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Bill be discharged and that leave be granted to withdraw the Bill.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 35.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 35 I should like to make this one point.  As I propose to make some observations on the general question of excess profits duty on the next section, I would like to confine my remarks to this particular section and just to make one point. This section, as it appears, is introduced in order to remove doubts, and as I understand it those doubts have arisen by reason of the fact that certain taxpayers who were assessed for excess profits duty for the first time in recent months took exception to those assessments on certain technical grounds and the matter came before the courts.  The cases are at the present moment awaiting hearing and I understand they will be heard in the <Col N="1005" /> course of a few days.  Now I would suggest to the Minister that, even though he might insist on this section going through as it stands at the moment, to remove the doubts that exist, and even though we may have very serious objection to the reimposition of excess profits duty even after the matter had been terminated seven years ago by an Act of this House, the Minister ought to consider putting down an amendment on Report Stage to exclude from the operations of Section 35, as it stands at the moment, those cases that are pending before the courts at the present time.</P>
      <P>It is a very bad principle for the Legislature to interfere during the actual progress of cases in the courts to take the decision out of the hands of the court and to legislate on the matter before it is determined one way or the other.  It may be that the Minister may win this case.  It may be that the taxpayers may win, but I suggest to the Minister that as a matter of principle he ought to accept my suggestion, merely as a matter of principle, so that this House will not lay down the precedent of intervening at the last minute, practically speaking, in the hearing of a case pending in court.  I think it is a very bad principle for the Minister for Finance or for any Government Department in cases where they may have doubts, or even where they may not have doubts, to introduce legislation of this kind in order to remove any such doubts and take the decision out of the hands of the court.  The suggestion I make will not affect more than three or four cases and it will preserve the principle to which I have referred while preventing the creation of a very bad precedent in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could bind myself to accept either in whole or part the suggestion which has been made by Deputy Costello.  I would be very reluctant to do anything that would encourage taxpayers to initiate litigation with the Revenue Commissioners, and it would appear to me that there would be some encouragement to that course if I were to accept the suggestion which Deputy <Col N="1006" /> Costello has made.  It is not our belief that these actions were ever necessary to clarify the law.  I think the ground upon which this litigation stands is that the Act of 1932 reimposed or purported to reimpose the excess profits duty for the accounting periods up to 1921.  That in fact is not the case.  I am advised that the charge always remained.  I think that the Dáil always believed that the charge did remain, and we are merely, as it were, codifying the law so that this might quite clearly manifest what it, in fact, always had been.  It is true that we did suspend the machinery of the law.  That is something different from imposing a charge or making a fresh charge or rescinding the provisions of a section.</P>
      <P>I think myself that there could not be any doubt in the mind of any of those litigants as to what the true position was, but there was this hope that by embarking on this litigation they would interfere with the collection of the taxes and that possibly the Government or the Exchequer wearied out by futile litigation might decide to abandon its rights in the matter altogether.  Therefore, as I said previously, this litigation appears to me to some extent at any rate to be vexatious.  I am asked to grant a certain Act of Indemnity to those litigants, and not merely to those particular cases, but to those who in the future undertake vexatious litigation with the Revenue Commissioners.  I think that would be an intolerable position in which to put the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time I do realise that in these cases the litigation was started before the Budget was introduced in the ordinary course.  After all there is one period in the year at which litigation dealing with the imposition and collection of taxes is submitted to the Dáil and in the ordinary course of time when that period came around and when it had been made clear that some attempt had been made to confuse the issue, and that the Legislature itself might be confused, I put down the proposal in the Bill which I hoped would clarify the position.  I put that down in due <Col N="1007" /> course.  I did not delay unduly in putting it down.  It was put down at the proper time and, therefore, I could not accept the contention that I had waited until the last moment to ask the Legislature to make this the view of the law and its intention on the matter.  It is possible that if this thing had been done in 1932 or a little earlier we should not have this litigation. I am prepared to give full consideration to that.  As I said before there are many matters to be considered and many points of view to be weighed. I would not be prepared at this stage to concede what Deputy Costello has asked.  I shall be prepared, however, to consider the matter.  I should like to mention, however, to safeguard myself, that my present frame of mind is such as not to lead me to believe that I would be able to make any substantial concession on the point the Deputy has raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister will, at least, give the matter his consideration, because I am interested not so much from the point of view of the individual taxpayers, who are fighting the actions in court at the moment and about whom I know nothing, but I am interested in the question of principle, the question of this House intervening during the course of litigation to take the matter out of the courts and take the decision as to what the law is upon themselves. I do not suggest that this House should give to certain taxpayers anything in the way of an Act of Indemnity, but that the decision in the pending cases should be left as they are at the moment to the decision of the courts. If the Minister is so clearly advised, as he says, that his decision is correct, then he has nothing to fear from the courts.  They will decide in his favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I suggest is to exclude from the operation of this section the actual pending cases.  As I say, it is in the question of principle that I am interested and not in the case of the individual taxpayers who are fighting actions.  I am not at all impressed by the argument of the Minister that the Revenue Commissioners would ever be wearied out <Col N="1008" /> or put off their trail or their scent by litigation initiated or pursued by taxpayers.  There are no more persistent followers of a trail than the Revenue Commissioners and I have no doubt whatever that however vexatious&mdash;I think that was the word the Minister used&mdash;the litigation might be the Revenue Commissioners would pursue it to the bitter end and collect, in addition to their tax, the costs of the vexatious litigation from the unfortunate taxpayer.  As I say, I am not interested from the point of view of the individual litigants but I am interested in not creating a precedent in this House that an Act of Parliament should be rushed through, particularly in the case where a Government Department is concerned, declaring what the law is before the Courts have had an opportunity of saying what, in fact, the law is.</P>
    <P>Section 35 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 36.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke, I think, during the progress of the Financial Resolutions, on what is now embodied in Section 36 and, as I read it, Section 36 of the Act proposes to give statutory effect to the famous Wankie Colliery decision. Deputies will, perhaps, remember that excess profits duty was imposed as an emergency tax in the year 1915 shortly after the commencement of the European War, and the object of it was to enable the British Exchequer to participate in the war profits which were being made, or which it was anticipated would be made, as the result of warlike operations or consequent on the necessity for maintaining the munitions of war from 1915 to 1922.  The relevant section of the Act of 1915 imposing this excess profits duty had not been tested or finally decided in the Courts on the question of the liability of a successor in a business to excess profits made by his predecessor.  But in 1922, after some prolonged litigation, the House of Lords, in the Wankie Colliery case, decided that although excess profits might have been made in the year <Col N="1009" /> 1915 by A., that B., who had in the year 1921 acquired by purchase the business of A., was liable for the full amount of the excess profits made by A. and had no right to claim an indemnity or a contribution from the person who made the excess profits.  The result of that decision was that an innocent purchaser, who paid his good money for a business in the open market, found himself liable to pay to the Revenue Commissioners half the excess profits made by a person years before he had acquired the business, and the person who made the profits was entitled to retain the profits for his own benefit.</P>
      <P>That decision was somewhat startling, and I drew the Minister's attention, I think, on the last occasion on which this matter was discussed, to the injustice of that decision.  I pointed out to the Minister that the ultimate decision was arrived at only after a very serious conflict of judicial opinion.  I was speaking at that time from recollection, but I have since looked up the matter and I discover that the decision in the Wankie Colliery case, which is being given statutory effect for the first time in this country in the year 1933, was decided by five judges in favour of the decision and five against it.  That is the legal decision that it put forward to the House by the Minister for Finance as being something which is undoubted law and which has been undoubted law in the Irish Free State since 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell you in a moment who they were, and I may make this remark in passing with regard to that decision, that it is a remarkable fact that from 1922 until the present moment the Revenue Commissioners never brought a case into court to test the question as to whether the Wankie Colliery decision was law in this country or not.  It was certainly the belief in legal circles that the Irish courts would not follow the Wankie Colliery decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who decided the Wankie Colliery case, and who were in favour <Col N="1010" /> of the ultimate decision, were two members of the British Court of Appeal and three members of the House of Lords.  The judicial authorities who had expressed themselves as against the ultimate decision were two of the law lords who heard the case, Lord Dunedin and Lord Carson; one member of the Court of Appeal in England; and Mr. Justice Rowlatt, who originally heard the case, and who is recognised as the leading income tax authority in England; and Lord Finlay, in another case, which had been heard prior to the Wankie Colliery case, expressed his very definite view against what was the ultimate decision in the case.</P>
    <P>So, there you have five leading authorities, five men of the highest eminence, Mr. Justice Rowlatt, Lord Justice Atkin, Lord Dunedin, Lord Finlay and last, but by no means least, Lord Carson, who were in favour of the taxpayer, and five of the other judges in favour of the revenue and, of course, the latter, because of a majority decision in the House of Lords, were upheld.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is a remarkable fact that all these high authorities found such difficulty in arriving at a decision which the Minister told the House on the last occasion was the ultimate decision and undoubted law in the Irish Free State since 1922.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Lord Buckmaster, as far as I can find out. I want first of all to make it quite clear that while speaking very strongly against this section I am not interested on behalf of those taxpayers who have succeeded by fraud in depriving the revenue of what is properly due to <Col N="1011" /> them, because every taxpayer who, by trickery or fraud evades his duty and his liability to pay tax, thereby increases pro tanto the liability of the honest taxpayers who make a proper return of their incomes, and pay their tax properly, regularly and honestly. I have, therefore, no interest in the people who have evaded even this particular tax by fraud, but I am interested in this section from the point of view of the injustice which it may create, and also from the point of view of which I have personal knowledge of the unsettling effects which it will have on the business community in this city. I will refer later to a case in which I myself am at the present moment engaged, arising out of the introduction of this particular section.  First of all, on the injustice that will be created by it, I hope I will not weary the House if I read a portion of the judgment of Lord Justice Atkin, who commented on the contention of the Crown in the Wankie Colliery case.  Every line and every word he said in that case are applicable to the provisions contained in this section.  He says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Now the case for the Crown here is this, that when a business has changed hands a person who has not made profits during the accounting period and had nothing to do with the business at the time at which the profits were made, and may have made a loss while he was concerned with the business, is bound to pay to the Crown half of the profits made by his predecessor, even though those profits remain in the pockets of his predecessor, and he is so bound to pay, and I think this is a most significant fact, and it is admitted in the contentions of the Crown&mdash;he is so bound to pay without having any recourse against the person who in fact made the profits and who in fact remains in possession of the whole of the profits, while 50 per cent. of them is being paid by his successor. It sometimes perhaps illustrates a case better to take a concrete example.  It means this, that if a person had made during an accounting period before the Act came into operation, in the year ending June <Col N="1012" /> 30, 1915, excess profits to the extent of £50,000, a purchaser of that business, after that date, who would have bought the goodwill upon the footing that there was that amount of profits being made by the business, and had paid that price, would have to pay the Crown £25,000, though he himself may have conducted the business at a loss, and though the vendor from whom he bought the business remained in possession of the whole of the £50,000 profits, and he would have no right of any sort or kind against his vendor under this Act or at common law to recover back that sum of money. He would have no right unless there was some express arrangement made that he should have a right of recourse against the vendor, a right which having regard to the fact that this Act is retrospective, it is extremely unlikely he would have bargained for.</P>
    <P>Now that is the bold contention of the Crown, and it appears to me to amount to a suggestion of gross injustice, and to a piece of confiscatory legislation which is without parallel in the history of Parliamentary Government in this country, and which, I should think, would exceed the wildest dreams of the most imaginative high prerogative lawyer in the very worst time of our history.</P>
    <P>That was the comment on the contention of the Crown in 1922.  I suppose the Minister, who pleaded in the courts recently for a high prerogative right against certain members of this House and certain members of the Dublin County Council, will have no hesitation in doing what Lord Justice Atkin referred to, exceeding the wildest dreams of the most imaginative high prerogative lawyer in the very worst time of our history, because that is what is being done under this section. They are doing under this section what Lord Justice Atkin, 12 years ago, said about the British Crown, exceeding the wildest dreams of the most imaginative high prerogative lawyer in the very worst time of our history.  He refers again to the question of injustice, and it is a remarkable <Col N="1013" /> fact that he refers to an almost similar suggestion to that which was made by the Minister during the Report on the Financial Resolutions, namely, that, of course, the Revenue Commissioners would not do anything unjust or improper in connection with the administration of this Act.  I drew attention to the fact that A might have made profits in 1915 and sold his business to B, who sold to C, who sold to D, who sold to E, who sold to F, and F in 1933 would have to pay tax on the excess profits made by A in 1915, and would not have any right to go after A for the amount he had to pay.  The Minister said that of course the Revenue Commissioners would not come at F, that they would go after A, or B, or C or D, or E.  This is what Lord Justice Atkin said about a similar suggestion:</P>
    <P>They say that there is a discretion given, that for relief you are to trust to the good, kind Commissioners, and that if there is any injustice of that kind when the Commissioners have an option, if they think fit, not to work that injustice, To my mind it has has not been the custom of this Realm of England to leave the question whether the subject's property shall be confiscated or not to the discretion of the official tax-gatherer in the confiding hope that he may restrain his predatory instincts, and I should imagine that the commercial world would prefer not to have their heads broken by such precious balms.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants us to trust to the good, kind Irish Revenue Commissioners. I have had very long experience of the good, kind Irish Commissioners, and I will say this for them, that they and their staff are the most experienced and efficient staff in this State, and that is saying a lot. Their outlook on the gathering of taxes is this: &ldquo;If there is a law there which says we are to collect tax we have nothing to do with the justice or the injustice of it; we have nothing to do with the merits or demerits of the case. We have to go after the law or the Comptroller and Auditor-General will go after us, and we prefer to go after the law.&rdquo;  I do not trust myself to the predatory instincts of the Irish <Col N="1014" /> Revenue Commissioners any more than Lord Justice Atkin had confidence in the predatory instincts of the British Revenue Commissioners.  He puts, in words better than I could put it, the injustice that may be perpetrated by the provisions which are contained in this section, and I want the House to understand that all the improper consequences which arose or accrued from the Wankie Colliery decision, and which were pointed out and admitted during the course of the argument, are embodied in this particular section. There is not even the right for the purchaser for value, the bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any claim by the Revenue Commissioners, to have recourse to the person who made the excess profits and who is entitled to keep them in his pocket and pay neither the person who bought the business from him nor the revenue authorities.  That is going to have a most unsettling effect, apart from the injustice of it, on purchase and sale transactions in this country.</P>
    <P>I am engaged in a case in which a business was purchased and, having had some experience of excess profits duty, I raised the point that the vendor should show me that there was no claim outstanding for excess profits duty.  We found ourselves in this position, that the vendor was willing to complete, the purchaser had his money to complete and a mortgagee of the premises was ready to complete, but the Revenue Commissioners said: &ldquo;We do not care whether you are ready to complete or not.  We will not give you a certificate that there is no claim outstanding.  We will not tell you whether or not there is a claim outstanding.&rdquo;  The net result is that we cannot complete the transaction. I know that the proposal contained in this Bill is having a most unfortunate effect on the sale of every class of property in the country, because nobody knows whether or not there is a claim for excess profits duty and you will not be told.  Even if the vendor, as he did in the case to which I have referred, tells the purchaser that he had produced to the Revenue Commissioners verified accounts made up by a properly qualified <Col N="1015" /> chartered accountant, that these accounts had been accepted by the Revenue Commissioners, and that he had paid the excess profits duty on the basis of them, we still cannot get from the Revenue Commissioners a certificate that there is no claim outstanding for excess profits duty, nor can we get from them any assurance that they will look to the vendor of the property, and the purchase money paid to him, for their tax.  That is the position as regards the ordinary taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I felt extremely disappointed when I got the Finance Bill and discovered that there was no amendment providing for the giving by the Revenue Commissioners of a certificate in connection with the payment of tax.  It is not in the Bill and there is no amendment, although I gathered from the discussion on an earlier Stage that some such amendment would be brought forth.  I hope the Minister will see his way to do that much.</P>
    <P>I would also like this assurance, that as far as possible claims that have been settled years ago should not be reopened.  I have no sympathy with the fraudulent taxpayer; but where a case has been settled between the Revenue Commissioners and the taxpayer many years ago, where accountants have been brought in at the request of the taxpayer or the Revenue Commissioners and the accounts accepted, that transaction ought not to be reopened on the suggestion by the Revenue Commissioners that there was some sort of non-disclosure or fraud.  The person who committed the fraud at that time, if there was a fraud committed, is going to commit another fraud and he will be in a better position to do so now than he was seven, eight or 15 years ago.  The honest taxpayer who has made what he conceived to be a proper return will be intimidated by the action of the Revenue Commissioners in sending on this typewritten document which they have been broadcasting as assessments within the last couple of months. These are the people who are most <Col N="1016" /> to be sympathised with by the House &mdash;the honest taxpayers who come within the net of the predatory instincts of the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners may think a fraud has been committed, but fraud is a very serious thing and it lies not with the Revenue Commissioners to determine whether or not a person has been guilty of fraud.</P>
    <P>I suggest there ought to be a provision in the Bill that, unless in cases of actual fraud, settled accounts between taxpayers and the Revenue Commissioners ought not to be reopened.  Third parties are by law and equity protected against fraud committed by persons with whom they have no privity and if you find that an executor of a deceased person in the year 1915, when the beneficiaries under the deceased's will were minors, made returns to the Revenue Commissioners and those returns were accepted and excess profits claimed on the basis of them, they ought not now to be reopened, as they are being reopened, against beneficiaries who came of age many years ago.  That is a state of affairs which, I think, is very unsettling in the commercial world; it is bad for business and for the country generally.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I will revert to the House of Lords' decision in the Wankie Colliery case.  Lord Summer said:</P>
    <P>I think, however, that considerations of justice and injustice have not much to do with modern direct taxation; they belong to a different order of ideas.  Taxation is concerned with expediency or inexpediency.</P>
    <P>This section can only be based on pure expediency, bringing into effect a tax which was an emergency and temporary tax for war time and was created in 1915 and abolished by the British in 1926 largely, I believe, as a result of the Wankie Colliery decision. It was abolished by this House also in 1926, leaving outstanding cases of fraud or wilful default.  Surely the Revenue Commissioners ought to be satisfied with being allowed to prey upon the fraudulent and not be allowed <Col N="1017" /> to prey upon the fears of the timid but perfectly honest taxpayer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a point raised by Deputy Costello in the latter end of his speech in connection with which I think it is advisable I should give the House some information at this moment.  The House may remember that when this Resolution was being reported I undertook to consider the feasibility of asking the Revenue Commissioners to issue certificates in a case which would normally be covered by this section.  The drafting of a section to make it possible for future purchasers of business to obtain, through the vendor, a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners protecting purchasers from any future claim for excess profits duty is now under consideration. I hope to be in a position to introduce the necessary amendment on the Report Stage.  It has not been easy to draft this, in a form which will protect a person who is faithful in his relation to the Revenue Commissioners, and, at the same time, make sure that no protection is given to the taxpayer who is wilfully fraudulent. However I think we have succeeded in getting a form that will cover the cases that Deputy Dillon and Deputy Costello have in mind and I shall introduce an amendment to give effect to it on the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello has made great play with the even balance of judicial opinion in regard to the various Wankie Colliery cases, but I think he omitted to inform the House that the weight of senior opinion is very strongly in favour of the revenue.  In actual fact of the judges who sat in this case there was a clear majority in favour of the revenue.  In the King's Bench the judge was against the revenue.  In the Court of Appeal one judge was against and two for the revenue, and in the case of the House of Lords, the final tribunal, two were against and three for the revenue.  I may say that that gives a majority of 50 per cent. in favour of the revenue.</P>

      <P>I have been twitted with the fact that the Revenue Commissioners never carried a case through our courts on this issue.  The Revenue Commissioners, never until now, have had to carry the issue there.  Since 1922 cases have been settled continuously on the basis of the Wankie decision and settled in many instances with counsel.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners did not go into court, because they are not, as Lord Justice Atkin said, &ldquo;the ravening beast&rdquo; that is going about to seize everything it can, but rather merciful and compassionate, and will take into consideration every fact that fairly should be considered in a matter of this sort. I do not know whether there is much good in a layman bandying judicial opinion with a lawyer, but, at all events, since we have heard from Lord Justice Atkin, I think we ought to hear what was said by another eminent lawyer on the other side.  The Master of the Rolls said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I think that what was contemplated, and I do not know that it is unreasonable, was that the Crown, as represented by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, would and <Col N="1019" /> might be trusted to exercise that power in a proper case where it ought to be exercised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello was good enough to give to the House one instance where this power was exercised in a proper case where it ought to be exercised.  I am perfectly certain that case does not stand alone and that there are many more in which the Revenue Commissioners exercised in a proper way the powers that we are asking the House to give in sub-section (2) of this section. The Master of the Rolls goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and that they were not to be looked upon, even in taxing a subject as a sort of ravening beast that is going about to seize anything he can irrespective of the injury or injustice which may be done to other people, but may be trusted to exercise the powers given properly and reasonably. That, to my mind, is the real meaning of the section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another Judge, Lord Justice Younger, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I agree that it is possible that upon that construction of the statute which I have placed upon it, there may be cases in which real hardship would be caused, but on this I would observe that the tax when it was imposed by the Act of 1915 was imposed as a retrospective tax.  It was an unforeseen burden wherever it chanced to fall and what the Legislature in this sub-section appear to me to have done&mdash;a procedure to which I think, perhaps, the epithets &lsquo;summary&rsquo; and &lsquo;rough and ready&rsquo; rather than any stronger or more flamboyant term are reasonably applicable&mdash;is that they have thought fit to throw the duty on the owner in being on the footing I have already stated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like on the point, since reference is made to the retrospective nature of this, to point out that there might be a difference in the case of the Wankie Colliery and a case that might fall for consideration under the section now before the House.  The purchase in the Wankie Colliery case was effected before excess profits duties were introduced at all.  Though I presume that <Col N="1020" /> the person who is properly assessable is the person in ownership at the date of the making of the assessment, notwithstanding the fact that the Wankie Colliery was purchased before the excess profits duty was law at all, the position of the Revenue Commissioners was fully upheld.  Now we are dealing with a case of a different nature. We are dealing with a case in which Exchequer excess profits duty was known at the time of the sale and could, of course, have been provided for in the contract at the time.  In that connection we have to bear in mind the judgment of Lord Justice Younger, in which he says</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that they have thought fit to throw the duty on the owner in being on the footing I have already stated.  If that owner is identified he does not suffer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Purchasers now and particularly for a year or two must be aware that in the case of a business in existence here during the period 1915 to 1921 there may have been a liability for excess profits and quite possibly a large number in fixing the price for their property and the price that they would get for it kept that fact in mind and did, in the words of Lord Justice Younger indemnify themselves against all contingencies that ever might arise as chargeable under the practice of the Revenue Commissioners which was to rely upon the judgment in the Wankie Colliery case.  If the owner is identified he does not suffer.  If he is not, the Lord Chief Justice went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no reason why the owner of the continuing business, and a continuing business like this, a continuing fruit bearing tree, is not the proper person left to bear the burden imposed upon that business. I should myself suppose that the cases in which a burden of this kind consciously or unconsciously, is not in fact regulated by contract between the transferor and the transferee, are relatively few, and it is perhaps a matter of observation and that consideration that I have just referred to may account for it, that no case of the injustice arising from this construction of the sub-section to which the Lord Justice has so powerfully <Col N="1021" /> referred, has up to the present been brought to the notice of the Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No case of injustice arises out of the policy which the Revenue Commissioners have pursued in this country ever since 1922&mdash;no case of injustice has been brought to the notice of the Dáil.  So that what was regarded, I quite frankly admit, as a powerful argument in determining the judgment of the House of Lords still remains to us as a powerful argument in determining the judgment of the Dáil on this matter: that we may trust the Revenue Commissioners to act with a proper sense of justice, not merely with a sense of justice but justice tinged with mercy and compassion for the unfortunate taxpayer who may find himself at this stage of his life compelled to pay up a tax which he ought properly to have paid ten years ago.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, every case receives most careful consideration on its merits.  I am perfectly certain that if there are any cases in which it can be contended that hardship is being inflicted the Revenue Commissioners will be prepared to consider those cases specially, as in fact they have done since 1921, and do their utmost to relieve that hardship, if it in fact exists.  In that connection I should like to make this also clear, however, that not everybody who cries &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; is to be believed in this matter.  I have on occasions had cases brought to my notice where we were told we were going to put people out of business.  Closer examination of the plea in one case disclosed the fact that the person making it had ample assets invested elsewhere than in the business which he was alleging the Revenue Commissioners were going to put him out of; that without doing any injury to the business whatever, without reducing his own personal comfort materially, he could have paid fully what the Revenue Commissioners were claiming from him.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the question of the certificate.  The fact that in future the Revenue Commissioners will have power to issue such certificates I feel must entirely remove <Col N="1022" /> any fear that Deputy Dillon may have had, and any fears which Deputy Costello may still hold, that the operation of this section was going in any way to impede the transfer or sale of property in this State.  The fact is now that, for the first time, under the section as I hope it will be amended on the Report Stage, people can get some form of indemnity that will preclude the Revenue Commissioners, either now or subsequently, reopening and making a fresh assessment or claim for excess profits duties in a case in which they have no reason to believe that fraud or wilful neglect has arisen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the concession the Minister has announced is a very important one and it certainly disposes of many practical objections I had to this section.  The more I think of it the more I wonder whether the Revenue Commissioners are glad that they raised this question at all.  I think the obligation to issue a certificate is going to be a very useful and effective blister on the Board.  At the same time, admitting that the certificate does remove a great many of the practical objections, it does remain that you are giving statutory effect to a decision upon which grave doubt has been cast. It means that every person who has bought a business as a going concern in this country since 1916 has fixed over his head the sword of Damocles and he may discover at any moment that the Revenue Commissioners have a statutory right to assess him in respect of excess profits duty that a predecessor in title became liable for, say, in 1917, although, as Deputy Costello pointed out, there may be four or five people in title between him and the person who became liable.  The Minister made some play out of the fact that such an adroit and able member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party as Deputy Costello did not fight the decision in the Wankie Colliery case in this country and suggested that that was in itself evidence that legal opinion leaned towards the decision in the Wankie Colliery case.  I recommend to the Minister's attention a book recently published in England <Col N="1023" />&ldquo;In Quest of Justice,&rdquo; and he will there discover the costs which it was the privilege of a public-minded litigant to pay when he deemed it his duty to contest well-established decisions.  I think the Attorney-General will bear me out that in one of the most famous cases of that kind where the law was settled, in Barnard v. Coggs, the costs ran into six figures and the original subject matter of the action was £32.  It is quite true that we all have the law settled for us one way or the other ever since.  Profound confidence as I have in the Attorney-General's opinion, if he told me that I had either to compromise with the Revenue Commissioners for £120, or else run the risk of costs amounting to £25,000 in order to set right the wrong done in the Wankie Colliery case, I would sooner stake my £120 than put £25,000 on the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly it might, but I would sooner secure cheaper fame. Everybody knows that is why the decision in the Wankie Colliery case has never been upset, because no man is going to lock horns with the Revenue Commissioners when he knows that he is going to be dragged to the ultimate court in the State on the strength of a House of Lords' decision, if there is the possibility of a settlement.  In fact, I think we have grown to know in this country that it is cheaper to fly the country than to lock horns with the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;to clear out lock, stock and barrel.  I think it actually happened in a certain case.  I think the effect of the difference in the judicial decisions here is simply to leave the question on its merits.  When I first raised this question on the Financial Resolutions I said, as reported in Volume 47, Column 1937, of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am discussing the thing really on its merits.  I do not know what the practice or procedure has been in the past.  I am not very much influenced by whether that remedy <Col N="1024" /> has been in existence heretofore or not.  It seems manifest to me, however, that the only obligation we ought to put on any citizen is to take every reasonable precaution to avoid collusion in any fraud upon the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that remains incontrovertible. There should be no right to penalise a person for something which he has absolutely no intention of being involved in.  I am well aware that other precedents for that can be produced in respect of the taxpayer <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Revenue Commissioners, but I do not think we ought to extend it any further.  I should like to know whether the amendment which the Minister proposes to introduce on Report Stage will compel the Revenue Commissioners either to institute proceedings, or to grant the certificate forthwith.  Will there be a time limit fixed on the Revenue Commissioners of say, three months?  I thought the safeguard would begin to melt away when we got down to business.</P>

      <P>Indeed, I do, and I have the greatest respect and veneration for the Revenue Commissioners.  I paid a high tribute to them yesterday and I am prepared to repeat it to-day, but it is perfectly manifest that, unless we can get a guarantee that the purchaser can administer a requisition of title and that the vendor can then go to the Revenue Commissioners and say: &ldquo;Give us a certificate or make your assessment and allow us to get the thing settled by the court immediately,&rdquo; the certificate is absolutely worthless because I believe that, at the present time, the Revenue Commissioners have power to issue some kind of certificate if they want to do it, but they never do.  Before we consent to this section of the Finance Bill, I think the Minister should be in a position to say that, on Report, he will introduce an amendment which will give any vendor the right to go to the Revenue Commissioners, ask them for a certificate or, in the alternative, for an assessment which can be tried out forthwith within a certain given time, <Col N="1025" /> and the Bill ought further to give that vendor the right to exact from the Revenue Commissioners a certificate in the event of their failing to make an assessment.  Unless we have an undertaking of that kind, this section, in my opinion, is going to do a very great injustice on the grounds so exhaustively set out by Deputy Costello.</P>

I know myself, and anybody who <Col N="1026" /> is in touch with the Library knows that it has been frequently mooted here that the decision should be challenged, but it has not been challenged.

Deputy Costello referred to the Wankie Colliery case.  I think there are two matters which he did not mention in connection with that case.  The Minister has already referred to the judgments which commented on Lord Justice Atkin's judgment and I do not suppose that any purpose is served by drawing attention to the fact that what Lord Justice Atkin said there was criticised very severely by the judges who differed with him.  It was pointed out that the considerations which he dragged in were really not relevant in the courts and were matters for Parliament.</P>

      <P>I know it is but, in passing, I might observe that Lord Justice Atkin is a Cork man and there was an Ulsterman also sat in judgment on this case, Lord Carson, and curiously enough, although he agreed with Lord Justice Atkin, he did not criticise the legislation in the way in which it was criticised by the judge in the other court.  In fact, he pointed out, and throughout the whole case it is obvious, that the only question at issue was whether the Legislature had clearly expressed its intention that a person who acquired a business should be made liable for the debt of his predecessor <Col N="1027" /> and all that Lord Carson says about it, in pointing out the difference of opinion amongst the judges, is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That shows how unfortunate the Legislature has been in its attempt to clearly impose a tax on the subject.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If ever there was a hard case, this Wankie Colliery case was such a case because, as the Minister has already pointed out, the date on which the Wankie Colliery was wound up excess profits duty was not collectable at all. The legislation imposing it was not introduced until the following year, 1915, and it was only by the retrospective effect of that legislation that the Wankie Colliery Company became liable.  The winding up of the company and the transfer of its business had all taken place prior to the Act and, in the courts, great use and very effective use was made of that fact and, apparently, it weighed very strongly with some of the judges that it was a manifest injustice where the original company could not have been aware and could not have anticipated that their business would have been made liable for this debt at any date before they wound up and that those who succeeded them in title should not have taken the precautions, which can now be taken, to protect themselves, that is, by putting in a requisition as to whether such debt was due or whether it had been met and paid so that that case was a case which stands absolutely by itself as a case of hardship.  Notwithstanding that, with that case before them and with the strong views which were pressed on them so effectively that they captured the minds of a number of judges, it was decided, after the case had been through three courts in succession that, interpreting what to some were rather doubtful words, the intention of the Legislature to be taken from these words was that it was intended that the debts incurred by the predecessor in title should fall on the person in actual occupation of the premises.  One of the judges pointed out that the whole case turned around the meaning of the words &ldquo;person <Col N="1028" /> for the time being&rdquo;.  Lord Dunedin said: &ldquo;The whole controversy arises as to the proper meaning of the words &lsquo;person for the time being&rsquo;&rdquo; and when Deputy Costello says that this might not have been held to be the law in this country during the last 11 or 12 years, I think it is reasonable to say this that before 1921 the persons who are now being charged with this excess profits duty were liable under the law as interpreted by the English Courts. Undoubtedly, if this decision given in May, 1921, had been given a year previously no complaint whatsoever could have been made by these people that they would be entitled to the benefit of the change in the legislature and could ask for a different interpretation of the law.  But the position is that as the law then stood, as enacted by the British legislature and as interpreted subsequently by the British courts, those person whom the Revenue Commissioners are now seeking to make liable owed this duty. A large number of people have paid it.  It has been collected year after year and was being collected before this Government took office.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is not really necessary to discuss the merits of the case made as already a decision has been taken by the House on it, but it would appear to me to be most unreasonable that while a number of people should have been called on to pay that a number of other people, who happened by good luck to have escaped down to the present, should now raise a wail of woe because the Minister for Finance comes along and says: &ldquo;We are going to put you on exactly the same level as all the other persons who made excess profits duty during the war.&rdquo;  I am sure Deputy Dillon will agree with me that excess profits duty was regarded during the war period as a very fair tax. During that period prices shot up and unbelievable incomes were being made in business and otherwise.  It was only reasonable that the legislature should come in and help to finance the war, and help the Exchequer during the succeeding years, by taking a share out of the profits which were being made and which arose out of <Col N="1029" /> the circumstances created by the war. I do not think it can be questioned that it was a perfectly fair tax.  That was the position as it then stood under British law.  The fact that it has not been challenged up to this justifies us in thinking that those whose opinion counted in the matter &mdash;some of the leading opinions in the library on questions of tax&mdash;cannot have encouraged this wealthy body, I understand that it is a rich association, which could quite readily have provided the sinews of war to test this matter.  They did not do that until the present year.</P>
    <P>Liability to excess profits has not been questioned at all.  This particular section has not been brought in to review it, but what is being done here is that clear words are being put in; to leave beyond all doubt what the legislature intended and what the British courts held in 1921 the English legislature intended. Four years elapsed after the decision in the Wankie Colliery case before the legislature stepped in and altered the law with regard to assessment of excess profits.  During those four years no attempt was made to induce the legislature to correct what it is suggested is a wrong interpretation put upon the law by the courts.  If, as suggested by Deputy Costello, the action of the British Parliament in 1926 was due to the Wankie Colliery decision then certainly they allowed a long number of years to elapse before they gave effect to their view. That decision was given in the courts at length, interpreting the intention of the legislature at the date that the Act was originally passed.</P>
    <P>As regards one other point, Deputy Dillon said that there is power in the Revenue Commissioners at the moment to grant a certificate.  I do not think the Revenue Commissioners have power to grant certificates as regards excess profits.  They have power to grant certificates as regards income tax, but I do not think they have that power in regard to excess profits.  I do not think it is reasonable for the Deputy to charge the Revenue Commissioners with refusing to exercise <Col N="1030" /> this alleged power when, in fact, they have not got it.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation. This is a quotation from a speech of the Minister for Finance:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It seems to me that if the House passes the resolution and makes the position clear, it will be open to any person who is going to purchase a business, a business which was in existence in the year 1914 to 1921, to ask the person who was owner of that to go to the Revenue Commissioners and bring from them some sort of proof or documentary evidence that in their opinion the business is not chargeable with excess profits duty at this date.  That can be quite easily done. A man purchasing a business will, no doubt, employ just as skilled a lawyer as he would to inquire into the title when he is purchasing a house, and no lawyer will take possession until he has a certificate that there is no liability for excess profits.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I took it from that that the Revenue Commissioners had the power to grant certificates.  Following that statement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Costello intervened and said: &ldquo;I do not think the Revenue Commissioners would give such a certificate. I should be surprised if they did.&rdquo;  I took it from the statement of the Minister for Finance that they had the power, while an ex-Attorney-General said, by implication, that it was in their power to do it.</P>

      <P>I have been charged by the Attorney-General with recklessly making a charge against the Revenue Commissioners which I should not make.  I want now to point out that I was misled into the belief that they had the power by the Minister for Finance, and misled by an ex-Attorney-General into the belief that having the power they would not issue the certificate.  I ask has any member of the House ever had better authority to rebut a charge made against him?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I qualified that by saying that, so far as I knew, they had not the power.  I think if the Deputy reads carefully the statement made by the Minister for Finance he will see that what the Minister stated was that the Revenue Commissioners could state &ldquo;that in their opinion.&rdquo;  That would have no statutory effect.  I take it the suggestion is that if the Revenue Commissioners gave a written document that, in their opinion, no tax was chargeable a person would probably accept that as sufficient guarantee that he would not in future be called upon to pay, but the very reluctance of the Revenue Commissioners, as mentioned by Deputy Costello, to grant a certificate, or give such a document, shows, I think, that I am right in thinking that it would have no binding force and that, in fact, it would have no protection except so far as the goodwill of the Revenue Commissioners would allow them to treat it as binding upon them.  As the law stands, there is nothing, I think, in the shape of a certificate.  There is nothing that the Revenue Commissioners can grant which a taxpayer could safely and with certainty rely on as a guarantee against a future claim for excess profits duty.  That is academic at the moment because, as the Minister has pointed out, steps <Col N="1032" /> will be taken between this and Report to frame an amendment which will enable the Revenue Commissioners to grant such a certificate.  I suppose that the adequacy or otherwise of that certificate can be discussed when the proposed new sub-section takes shape. I think that, notwithstanding what Deputy Dillon has said, if he reads what was said by the Minister, it does not quite bear the interpretation that he attempted to put upon it.</P>

      <P>These are the words of the Minister for Finance.  I can quite see that a slight slip may have been made.  The Minister for Finance may have been thinking of income tax or something of that kind.  I wanted to make it clear that the present situation was that they had power but that they would not use it, and I intended to give the taxpayer the right to compel them to use the power of certification unless they were prepared, within a given time, to go to assessment.  That is the amendment suggested.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I am not quite as simple as Deputy Dillon, and I shall present the Minister for Finance with bouquets when I see the draft of the amendment proposing to give the Revenue Commissioners power to issue a certificate, and when I see the provision therein contained, which Deputy <Col N="1033" /> Dillon in his simplicity thinks will impose an obligation upon the Revenue Commissioners to give such certificate, because I am prepared to prophesy here and now&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that there will be no such obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to issue such certificate.  If at the present moment there is no statutory power, as the Attorney-General said, to enable the Revenue Commissioners to issue such a certificate, I am prepared to prophesy that there will be no statutory power after the Act is passed to force the Revenue Commissioners to give any such certificate.  I can foresee the type of amendment that will be put in imposing on the Revenue Commissioners the obligation to give such a certificate.  This certificate will be so hedged round by safeguards by the Revenue Commissioners that it will be utterly and absolutely useless in the hands of the taxpayer.  I should like to make a bet with my colleague, the Attorney-General, that I can produce almost in ten minutes the draft of the amendment which will be there put in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more aware of the mentality and practice of the Revenue Commissioners than the difficulties that exist in these cases.  I want again to put it seriously to the Minister, from the point of view of purchasers for value without notice, that this certificate will be of no earthly use to such a purchaser because while the Commissioners are making up their minds to give this certificate, which Deputy Dillon is his simplicity thinks the Revenue Commissioners will issue immediately after purchase, the purchaser will have to remain out of his property and the vendor will have to remain out of his money for a long period until the Revenue Commissioners are convinced that they have got, or are likely to get, the last penny in excess profits duty out of the vendor. When they have satisfied themselves about that after months or even years of inquiry and investigation&mdash;and I underline investigation&mdash;they will present a certificate to the unfortunate vendor and the purchaser which will be <Col N="1034" /> utterly and absolutely of no use to them.  If Deputy Dillon ever saw the certificate that is issued by the Revenue Commissioners in reference to estate duty he would find that what I have pointed out is true.  It is not a free discharge.  He will find stuck down at the end of it adequate safeguards for the Revenue Commissioners which will enable them to come again at the unfortunate successor in title of the original taxpayer in certain circumstances. I say that this certificate which brought such balm to Deputy Dillon and called off his attack on the Minister would be of practically no use whatever.  I would again seriously press on the Minister the desirability of safeguarding property of bona fide purchasers for value without notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>How are you going to do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to suggest that a certificate is of no use in such circumstances.  What should be in this section is a provision to the effect that the rights of the Revenue Commissioners, if any, should attach to the purchase money, and not to the particular person who happens to be in possession of the premises.  The Minister is very happy about that suggestion, but I intend before I sit down to make him slightly unhappy.  I may tell him and the Revenue Commissioners that this section which they think so watertight is not quite so watertight as they think.  I make a present of that suggestion to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we shall have a little bit of litigation in the course of time if it goes as it stands.  If an executor sells the property of a testator, the death duties which are a charge on the property attach to the purchase money and the property conveyed is discharged from those debts.  In the present circumstances, in cases where a grave injustice may arise, I do suggest that is the remedy.  You may put in any amendment you like to provide safeguards for the Revenue Commissioners but I do suggest that their rights in reference to Excess Profits Duty which have not been met should attach to the purchase money <Col N="1035" /> and not to the business or the person who happens to be at the moment in possession.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General referred to the fact that it is wealthy persons who are charged with excess profits.  In a particular case in which I happened to be engaged professionally the person concerned was a man who was practically bankrupt.  He came within the very words of Lord Justice Atkin in that case.  He purchased a public house and public houses at that time were doing exceedingly well.  Subsequently they did exceedingly badly and after he purchased the premises he did exceedingly badly because he hit bad times.  That was after the Wankie Colliery decision.  My recollection is that he purchased the premises before the Wankie Colliery decision and he was faced with a claim by the Irish Revenue Commissioners for duty in respect of excess profits made by his predecessors in the good times, although he was himself losing money and in difficulties.  The amount concerned, as far as my recollection goes, was about £1,500, so that the claim was not in respect of a big transaction or a wealthy person.  Of course, the advisers of that gentleman were faced with the decision in the Wankie Colliery case which had just been decided.  I want to make the point that the Revenue Commissioners accepted considerably less than the amount of the assessment.  If they were satisfied that the Wankie Colliery case would have been followed in this country they would not have accepted a penny less.  He had a public house which they could have got.  The Revenue Commissioners could have laid their claws upon that.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General also said that there should be no complaint by people now, having regard to the fact that in 1921 the Wankie Colliery case was decided by, I think, the British Court of Appeal.  That decision was given so far back as 1921 and it is now being put into operation in this country. The Attorney-General overlooked, or forgot, one very important consideration in this respect, that is the fact that we stopped in the Finance Act of <Col N="1036" /> 1926 all further assessments to excess profits except in cases of wilful default or fraud.  From 1926 until last year, except for a footnote in the Finance Act of 1922 which, unless it was very sedulously looked for, would never be discovered, and which purported to impose liability for excess profits, for six years prior to that there was no liability for excess profits duty except in a small number of cases of fraud. Now we are faced with a situation, that a purchaser purchasing a property cannot in any way safeguard himself. I will present a bouquet to the Minister for Finance, with the most complimentary phrase I can think of, if he produces a certificate which will satisfy me when advising a purchaser.</P>
    <P>In the particular case in which I am engaged we are faced with a further difficulty, that when a person advises a purchaser of a business and asks for proofs that there is no claim for excess profits duty arising, the answer is: &ldquo;There is no claim,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We will find out from the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo; The answer is that you are not entitled to ask that question because it is not a requisition on title.  The Attorney-General will appreciate that particular technical point, although other Deputies will not.  In other words it amounts to this, that excess profits duty not being charged on the property, a purchaser is not entitled to ask or to be told whether or not there is any excess profits duty liability outstanding. At the present moment I know of no way to safeguard the rights of a purchaser.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>All the more if it is included.  That is the answer that is given.  I do not say that there is no right, but this matter would have to be brought to court and decided.  I think I have said sufficient, at all events, to persuade the Minister that there is a genuine case being made by me on behalf of genuine persons.  In connection with this section the only consideration should not be the Revenue Commissioners.  The public should be considered as well.  Dealing with excess profits duty no consideration is <Col N="1037" /> being given in Sections 35 and 36 to anybody's interest except that of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is only right that the <i>bona fide</i> and the honest taxpayer should get a fair deal from this House.  If he gets a fair deal here he will get a fair deal from the Revenue Commissioners.  Otherwise he will not, because the Revenue Commissioners will follow the strict letter of the law.  I do not want to put myself in the position of advising anyone who is in such a position that he will have to rely upon the Revenue Commissioners to temper justice with mercy. The Minister should consider the position of the ordinary <i>bona fide</i> purchase and sales transaction.  The certificate he proposes to give is, I assume, from the practical point of view of no value whatever, no matter what form he puts it in.  I am quite convinced that there will be no obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to give it.  I am also convinced, if there is an obligation to give it, that it would be so hedged round with safeguards for the Revenue Commissioners that it will be no use in the hands of the purchaser.</P>

I am learning that from the Deputy.  It may be so with the Attorney-General or with the Minister for Finance, that while they are prepared to defend the rights of the subject here, as the ex-Attorney-General has done, after half an hour with the chairman of the Revenue Board they come back here as mild as milk.  I am trying to put a little bone into them, so that when they go to the Revenue Commissioners they will be as bold with them as they are here.

I am asking the Minister for Finance simply to insist that after the lapse of a certain time, when an application is made, the Revenue Commissioners will give an absolutely clear discharge in respect of the business, without reservation of any kind in respect of the liability imposed by the Finance Act of last year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy says: &ldquo;The Revenue Commissioners will hold you up so long that it would be useless.&rdquo; Again I say the citizen has some right. His right is to go to the Minister for Finance and to say that no matter how efficient these people are there must be a limit.  We are entitled to demand that whatever enquiries are to be made will be made forthwith.  If the time be long, and if the conveyancer thinks <Col N="1039" /> it a practical proposition, I do not see why Deputy Moore's suggestion should not be incorporated.  Anybody has a right to go and negotiate with the Revenue Commissioners and expect finality in the making of assessments for excess profits duty.  If we start such enquiries we can take the consequences. We want to have it clear that the Revenue Commissioners will make such enquiries on request as they want and give the individual citizen a discharge from liability.  I know that that is heresy from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners.  From the point of view of that distinguished Board, a man must be in thrall to it from the day he opens a banking account or from the day he puts £5 in his stocking.  Notwithstanding the reverence in which I hold the Revenue Commissioners, I think that the Dáil should insist that the citizen has some rights as against them.  A person should be entitled to go to the Revenue Commissioners and say &ldquo;I want a discharge.&rdquo;  He should be entitled to a discharge without loopholes, albeit the Dáil should place the obligation upon the businessman of opening his affairs to the Commissioners and being ready to meet an assessment, if one is made against him within a reasonable time.  I do not think that the debt should attach to the property purchased because the purchaser has as much right as the vendor to be freed from liability to the State.  A man should have the right to get rid of his liabilities to the State in any form. So far as I know, no Statute of Limitations runs against the Revenue Commissioners.  If, in the case of an ordinary contract debt, a creditor were to act in this way, Deputy Costello would wax eloquently about his monstrous conduct.  Tears would come to his eyes and his voice would tremble. But where it is a case of the Revenue Commissioners, the debtor is an evildoer who is suppressing information and who has at last been brought to justice.  I do not think that that is right.  I think the same law should run against the Revenue Commissioners as runs against the ordinary citizen in respect of time.  If they do not make <Col N="1040" /> their claim within a reasonable time, another situation will arise.</P>
      <P>I recognise that you must fix the liability somewhere in cases of fraudulent concealment.  I do not propose to follow Deputy Costello into the more intricate details of the law in that regard, because I am not fitted to do so.  It may be that in cases where the Revenue Commissioners are in a position to prove fraud, liability should attach to the purchase money in order to deliver the successor in title from the liability.  But I do not think it is necessary to allege fraud under Section 36.</P>

      <P>Once the purchaser knew a certificate of this kind could be produced, he could create a situation which would render it obligatory on the vendor to produce it.  We should insist, before passing this section, that the Revenue Commissioners be compelled to grant any person who applies a complete discharge in the most emphatic terms in respect of excess profits duty, so that the certificate can be tendered to any purchaser desiring to purchase the business.</P>

      <P>Quite a number of interesting considerations have arisen in this debate and a number of very <Col N="1041" /> useful suggestions have been made.  I am not at all averse to establishing finality in respect of people who may be liable for excess profits duty.  We are anxious to get the whole thing wound up as speedily as we can but I do not think it is quite so simple a matter as Deputy Dillon suggests.  I do not think that the Revenue Commissioners should be put in the dilemma that they must issue a certificate within a certain time or that the person concerned should go scot free of excess profits duty.  Quite obviously, a man who knew he was liable for duty would go to the Revenue Commissioners, apply for a certificate and refuse to give the Revenue Commissioners the information they would naturally ask before they could satisfy themselves that he was not, in fact, liable.  He could put every obstacle in their way, hoping by the mere effluxion of time to be rid of any liability which attached to him for excess profits duty. That is the one big difficulty I see in regard to Deputy Dillon's suggestion. At one time, I myself, thought that an advance might be made along this line but I am no longer satisfied that that is practicable.  I think that the only thing we can do is to give the Revenue Commissioners power to issue certificates in cases where they are satisfied that no liability for excess profits duties attaches to the business.  I do not see how the matter could be operated in any other way.  The fact that the Revenue Commissioners have power to issue a certificate of this sort will speedily become known and any prospective purchaser of a business will be at pains to satisfy himself that that certificate has been secured before he becomes a serious bidder for such a business.  I think that that fact will compel people who contemplate selling their business to take time by the forelock and go to the Revenue Commissioners before the business is put up for sale or negotiations for sale opened, so that they may be enabled to make a transfer of the business free of liability for excess profits duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, we are rather beating the wind.  As I have already said, we propose, in an amendment which will be before the House next Wednesday, to give the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1042" /> power to issue a certificate which will, in certain circumstances, be a clearance between the vendor and the purchaser.  This debate might be more usefully continued when the exact conditions under which that certificate will be issued are before the House.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 37.</P>
    <P>(1)  Where a deceased person would, if living, be chargeable with and assessable to excess profits duty in respect of any accounting period, the executor or administrator of such deceased person shall be charged with and may be assessed to excess profits duty in respect of such accounting period in like manner and to the same extent as such decased person, if living, would be so chargeable and could lawfully be so assessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 12:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 10, to delete the word &ldquo;charged&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;a person chargeable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The intention of Section 37, as introduced, was that, while the Revenue Commissioners should be at liberty to charge the executor in case of death, they should not be forced to do so in cases in which this would be unjust.  The purpose of this amendment is to make the intention of the Legislature clear.  It is considered that the effect of the section will not be altered by the amendment but that the purpose will be made clear.  In the absence of this amendment, it might be argued that the executor was the only person chargeable and, in certain types of case, this might be unfair to the residuary legatee.  Accordingly, I propose that this amendment be adopted by the House.  In doing that, I propose that the section itself, as amended in this way, should also be adopted.</P>

    <P>This amendment is intended to meet Deputy Costello's point that the executor or administrator should not be liable for duty in excess of the assets coming into his hands.  It follows closely the drafting of (3) of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1894, with regard to an executor's liability for estate duty to which I think Deputy Costello referred some time ago.</P>

      <P>Section 37 (5) provides for the giving of a certificate to the executor or administrator discharging him from all claims for further excess profits duty.  I asked the Minister on the last occasion whether that certificate would operate to discharge the beneficiaries under a will or the next-of-kin in the case of an intestate from future claims for excess profits duty. To the best of my recollection the Minister said it would not.  I do suggest that such a certificate should have that effect.  Possibly it was intended that it should have that effect.  I do not know.  I am raising the point for the purpose of finding out what was really intended.  But it seems anomalous, an executor of a deceased person having discharged his liabilities in the case of a deceased person for excess profits duty, that it should be found perhaps some years afterwards, that the beneficiaries would be liable; that while a certificate had been given the Revenue Commissioners ascertained, subsequently, that the executor did not give the full measure of duty that he should have given and that, therefore, <Col N="1044" /> innocent beneficiaries would be liable. I think that is open, under Section 37, taken in conjunction with Section 36.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy's interpretation is quite correct.  Section 37 relates only to executors.  The certificate is intended only to relieve them of their personal liability in those cases in which they did their duty honestly both to the estate and to the State.  A person who would inherit property in respect of it and who is liable to excess profits duty would be in exactly the same position as the person who would purchase the property. Under Section 36 the beneficiaries would continue to be liable as they have always been liable for excess profits duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is trying to remedy a peculiar anomaly which at present exists.  Where a debtor not resident in the Saorstát possesses assets in the Saorstát and owes money to Saorstát creditors the latter can take proceedings and, by leave of the court, serve him outside the Saorstát either in Great Britain or elsewhere. Now, in the case of debts due by that person to the Revenue, the position while it is the same for countries other than Great Britain, is not the same in regard to Great Britain. Service in Great Britain for a debt due to the Saorstát Revenue cannot be effected even though the debtor has assets here in the Saorstát.  On the other hand, the British Revenue authorities are in a much more fortunate position in so far as they can and do arrange that a person in the Saorstát who owes money to them can be served in the Saorstát.  This section is designed to remove that anomaly and to make it possible to effect service in Great Britain in the case of a person owing money to the Revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they always had them.  These anomalies arose originally by reason of the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  It was provided there that the term &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; should be interpreted as meaning also the Saorstát.  Formerly there was this provision for Revenue summonses for the <Col N="1046" /> United Kingdom and when the Adaptation of Enactments Act was under consideration it was presumed that this would be dealt with under the rules of court.  We have been so long getting the rules of court that for ten years this has remained and we feel that this is the easiest and the best way of removing the anomaly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is misinformed of the questions of the rules of court.  The High Court rules were amended and the High Court rules were brought into operation a very considerable number of years ago, some time about 1926 or thereabouts.  I do know that there is a difficulty that, while a writ issued by the English courts can be served in this country, a plenary summons issued by our courts cannot be served in England.  While the Minister is taking this step with regard to Revenue cases, I should like to know why it is not made of universal application and that all plenary summonses should be served in England as they were previously, and as English writs can be served here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the last point, I do not think that the Ceann Comhairle would certify this Bill as a money Bill if it were proposed to deal with all plenary summonses.  I am merely dealing with sommonses issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  The position is that when the Rules of Court were being drawn up here Revenue sommonses were excluded because there was a special procedure for Revenue summonses covered by an Act of 1894, I think, and therefore it was thought to be all right because the Adaptation of Enactments Act covered that but the Adaptation of Enactments Act merely provided that where the words &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; occur the words should be interpreted as &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  The consequence was that Great Britain was excluded from the area covered by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 14:</P>
      <P>In Ref. No. 5, second column, after the word &ldquo;separately,&rdquo; to add the footballs and soccer footballs sold from 12/6 down to 3/6.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In suggesting this amendment I did it in the interest of making quite clear what is meant by this Reference.  I do not know if the Minister has it in his mind to cover all footballs that are not made in this country.  I understand that at the present time there is a certain grade of footballs made in this country and I do not think that anybody would object to giving protection to them.  At the same time, there is a high-grade class of match ball which is a patented article and imported into this country.  I am sure that the Minister will not suggest that a patented article could not be made in this country.</P>
      <P>The other item that I wish to make clear is what the Minister means by a football.  I do not suggest for a moment that if a standard match ball were put on the table in front of the Minister that he would have any difficulty in recognising it, but at the same time there must come some point at which the line will be drawn, I suggest that footballs get smaller and smaller down to a point at which they are really only Christmas toys. I am sure we are all familiar with having seen children at Christmas time playing with footballs that are really very little better than tennis balls, and I suggest that the Minister might properly exclude that type of ball, especially as it is not made in this country.  I do not wish to delay the House except to ask the Minister how far he can afford to meet this amendment.</P>

      <P>All covers made of leather for balls, whether used for the game of football or any similar game, say, the game of water polo, would be liable, I think, under this section. That, at any rate, was the original intention.  As long as they are covers made wholly or mainly of leather and imported they come under this.  I think the original intention of the <Col N="1048" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce was not to confine it merely to balls which would be used in the game of football.  I do not know that I can do anything to meet the Deputy in regard to the amendment he has put down. I think it would render the duty utterly unworkable and give rise to unfair and unwise discrimination against the game of Rugby.  The Revenue Commissioners felt that it was impossible efficiently to administer a duty the liability of which was on the sale price, whether wholesale or retail.  Under the amendment as proposed Rugby and Gaelic footballs, not patented, would be liable to duty while patented balls, if for Association football, would be eligible for exemption.  The general intention was that the leather industry in this country should be protected and there is quite a considerable manufacture of football covers in the country already; it might be that they are not quite so perfect for their purposes as the patented articles which the deputy proposes to exempt by this amendment, but then I think they are quite good enough and on that ground I do not think we could grant the exemption.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister cannot see his way to grant this request because I would like to assure him that there are patented Rugby footballs as well as patented Soccer footballs so that there would be no discrimination in that respect. I think that where an important match has to be played it only means that there is an additional burden on the promoters of the game.  The Minister also said that a water polo ball is the same as a football.  If you got a crack on the head from one or the other you would know the difference. I do not see how the Minister can describe a water polo ball as a football. However, I suggest that is one of the things he had better look into. I do not see how anybody could contend that a water polo ball was a football.  It seems to me that his whole contention falls to the ground. With regard to the question of the price of a ball, I am quite prepared <Col N="1049" /> to admit his contention.  At the same time I suggest to him that he should draw the line between a football and a toy.  However, that is a matter that I would ask him to consider.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to exclude something which is not at present being made in this country and which I do not think is likely to be made in the country.  If the Minister at any time finds that it is, he could quite easily give a preference to the Irish manufacturer.  I suggest that there is no fireclay in this country, and in accepting this amendment the Minister would really only be saving the mercantile community and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce the frightful amount of labour involved in issuing permits for practically every single group of articles imported into this country under one consignment.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is opposed to the acceptance of these amendments on the grounds that they whittle down the extensive scope of the duty on clay products, and that in fact the issue of licences will meet any case of real hardship which may arise.  I think, in view of the fact that there is a general licensing provision here in this section, that the explicit exemption asked for in the amendment is not necessary.  I do not know whether a time will come when we will be able to make first class fire bricks, fire blocks, fireclay sunk fires and fireclay backs, including interiors, boiler and flue blocks, and flue linings.

I am strongly in favour of this amendment.  In fact, I intend to speak on the Schedule governing the whole range of articles made of clay.  I shall have quite a lot to say on that.  I am in favour of the amendment proposed by Deputy Dockrell, in view of the fact that those articles are not at the moment manufactured in the country, and as far as I can see or learn there is no immediate sign that they will be manufactured here in the near future, and that those tariffs are increasing very much the cost of those commodities.  They are inflicting a hardship on the bricklaying trade to a certain extent, not alone these tariffs but also many other tariffs, and it is also a hardship&mdash; although it is not quite relevant here&mdash;<Col N="1051" /> that cement is being used at the moment as against brick.  I think that in view of the Minister's own statement he should accept this amendment of Deputy Dockrell's, until such time as some manufacturer in this State will be able to supply those commodities.  I think, after all, it is about time we should cry halt on this policy of imposing discriminating tariffs, thereby increasing the price of the commodities and decreasing the capacity of the people to pay the increased costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to amendment 15, and also amendment 16 which is really very much the same and arises from the same consideration, I do not attach much importance to the objection to licences from the point of view of discrimination, because certainly my experience has been that in the ordinary way there is no discrimination at all. You simply go to the Department and if you have a case you get the permit, and that is the end of it.  There is never the slightest difficulty.  If you make a case you get your permit. What is a very great difficulty, and what Ministers are likely to forget when they are not engaged in everyday business, is the nuisance of going to get the permit.  You have to define very accurately what it is you are going to import.  It usually means that you have to submit your invoices. Remember that with every tariff resolution you are bringing in you are multiplying the occasions for licences.  If the Minister would make an expedition to the Department of Industry and Commerce at Lord Edward Street it would be most illuminating.  The place is knee-deep in files.  They are up to their eyes in applications for licences, and the result is that there is a very great measure of delay.  I quite admit that if you go into Lord Edward Street and represent that the matter is urgent they will pick out your file and put it through with all despatch, but everybody cannot go to Lord Edward Street, and the result is that there is sometimes considerable delay <Col N="1052" /> in getting a permit.  Supposing you are in anything like general business &mdash;and Deputy Dockrell will understand it well&mdash;where you have a vast range of articles, such as there is in the building trade, or where you have a wide variety of articles such as you have in general business, you would want to keep a man for nothing else but applying for permits.  The vast majority of those permits are made necessary because the Minister for Industry and Commerce likes using a term such as &ldquo;all things made out of clay,&rdquo; the reason being that he is too lazy to sit down and make a schedule.  A phrase like &ldquo;manufactured articles, which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are made wholly or mainly of clay, and are completely unglazed and are not of the nature of statues, statuettes, or busts,&rdquo; simply means that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is too lazy to make out a schedule, and so he thought &ldquo;We will take them all in and let the fellows down the country, the poor innocent business men, make applications and we will give them permits.&rdquo;  That is what is happening.  It is not happening in respect of this item alone; practically every one of them is an omnibus item, and the merchants down the country have to do the work that the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his officials ought to do. They want to catch certain things; they proceed to catch everything and license some, which is making business virtually impossible.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that the Minister has taken up rather a strange attitude in this matter, Deputy Dillon says that there is never any discrimination; that anybody who really has a case will be sure to get a permit.  Therefore, everybody who wishes to import those things&mdash;and nobody wishes to import them merely for the fun of importation &mdash;will get a licence.  What is happening is simply that you are going to say that everybody who wishes to import those particular articles will get a licence. You cannot hold it back from any particular individual, because that <Col N="1053" /> would be discrimination.  Therefore, you might put it in your schedule as I have already put it, &ldquo;everybody who wishes to import those particular articles shall apply for a licence.&rdquo;  It is going to be no gain to the revenue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Ref. No. 11, second column, after the words &ldquo;or cisterns,&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;but excluding galvanised steel storage cisterns of 400 gallons capacity and upwards.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is within even a narrower limit than the preceding articles.  This amendment is concerned with storage cisterns up to a certain size.  One manufacturing firm in the Saorstát has a tank and another firm is installing a larger tank.  This amendment is submitted with the idea of allowing in only cisterns that are incapable of going into galvanising tanks in the Saorstát.  If at some future time some manufacturer goes to the expense of installing a larger tank&mdash;and that necessitates a considerable outlay&mdash;the Minister can rule this proposal out.  I suggest, however, that there is no possibility at the moment of a cistern being manufactured and galvanised in the Saorstát of the capacity which I have indicated.  I do not suggest that these large storage cisterns are used in Dublin.  The reason is they are too big. Any cistern which would be used in the city can be manufactured in the Saorstát.  There are large cisterns required for the country for storage purposes, and in those circumstances I suggest the Minister ought to accept the amendment.</P>

While it might be true to say that it would not be possible to get galvanised steel storage cisterns of 400 gallons capacity and upwards at this moment in the Saorstát, I understand arrangements are being made by possibly two firms to manufacture them in the near future.</P>

It might happen that there would be tanks available, possibly not galvanised, and they would equally serve the purpose for which the galvanised tank would be intended.</P>

      <P>If the Minister will apply his mind to that he will find it is not a practical proposition.  It would be much easier to pay the extra duty than to go to the expense of connecting two cisterns.  He has not answered my question as to whether one can get a licence for a 400 gallon cistern at the present time.  The Minister has mentioned that a particular manufacturer is installing a galvanising plant.  If the Minister assures us that a manufacturer is installing a plant which is capable of galvanising a tank of 400 gallons, I am quite satisfied.  I suggest, however, that it is not likely for some time to come that cisterns manufactured in this country will be galvanised here.  If the Minister will look into that matter, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

Once a licence has been issued to one person I am sure it will be issued to any person who may apply and show good reason.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask a few questions in regard to Part I, Reference No. 1 of the First Schedule. The articles to which I want to refer are &ldquo;articles which in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners are sole leather or insole leather,&rdquo; and there is a tariff at the rate of 37½ per cent. and a preferential rate of 25 per cent. I respectfully submit, if this tariff becomes operative, it will inflict very great hardship upon a very deserving <Col N="1056" /> class of the community, namely the small shoemaker and boot repairer in the small towns and, also, to some extent, in the larger towns and cities. If we had, in this country, a sufficient supply of sole and insole leather there would be some justification for this duty.  There is no doubt that shoemakers and boot repairers will be very largely affected by this particular item. In the Report of the Tariff Commission No. 11 dealing with the tariff on leather we find in paragraph 72 the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The boot manufacturers, with their present access to cheap markets for leather, are able, in many cases, to sell the better quality agricultural boots at prices approximating to those ruling in Great Britain, as the effect of the tariff is to keep out opposition rather than to enhance the price of the home manufactured product.  A continuance of such free access to markets is absolutely necessary for the further developments anticipated.  The prospect of the imposition of a tariff on sole and insole leather is viewed with dismay.  The proprietors of the new factories point out that these factories were established without the expectation that a tariff on leather might be imposed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, on page 27, paragraph 95, we find the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>We are satisfied that the case for granting the application as far as sole leather and insole leather are concerned has not been established by the applicants.</P>
      <P>In their recommendations they further state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>We do not recommend the imposition of a customs duty on sole or insole leather, or leather intended for the manufacture of machinery belting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister as to whether he received any information from leather merchants and others who sell this sole and insole leather to bootmakers and others engaged in the industry.  In most cases these small repairers and boot makers employ from two to four men.  The effect of this tariff, if it is imposed, <Col N="1057" /> would be to wipe out these people altogether.  I am sure that that is very far from the mind of the Minister, but I do not believe that he has had time to give this matter the consideration it deserves.  I ask the Minister would he accept an amendment dealing with this matter on the Report Stage of the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one other item to which I should also like to draw attention.  Many of our artisans, tradesmen and mechanics have, of necessity, to import from abroad the tools they require to prosecute their business from day to day.  Here again great hardship is imposed upon them because, as I say, they have to import these tools from outside the Saorstát. In nearly all cases these tools are tariffed.  I received complaints from many workmen on this subject, and the cost and inconvenience they are at owing to the tariff.  I would also ask the Minister to have these articles cleared as soon as possible from the clearing depot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House would be profoundly interested to hear from Deputy Jordan on the subject.  There is going to be a tax of 37½ per cent. on sole leather and a preferential rate of 25 per cent.  Now it is well known <Col N="1058" /> that you cannot get the sole leather which is required from the Irish towns. This is a tax upon the poor.  Of course, it is not the only tax upon the poor.  There is not a single item they use at present upon which they are not paying a tax.  I would like the Minister to say whether there has been a tax on sole leather here before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They can be supplied for the purpose that it was intended that sole leather should be used, under this tariff.  If the Deputy would direct his attention to the fact that there is a very wide licensing provision, and that the present intention is to allow each big factory to import bottom leather, free of duty, under licence, he will appreciate that while large demand is ruled out, the demand will be limited to the demand from the boot repairers and people of that sort.</P>

      <P>Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It simply means that every man who goes in to buy leather will have to pay this duty.  There is no market day in any country town that sides of leather are not sold in 1/6 and 2/6 lots to the poorest of the poor, the people who mend their own boots, and they are the people who are going to pay that tax.  It absolutely baffles me how any sane Government will do this thing.  However, we shall learn.  I want to pass from that because it is incapable of discussion, it is so manifestly unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clear up any misapprehension which may exist.  I understand that there is only one firm in this country producing insole leather and leather for soling boots, that is Messrs. Callaghan of Limerick.  They produce one commodity known as Callox and they could not, even if they quadrupled their premises, supply the needs of the home market.</P>
      <P>This tariff will fall on the poorest of the poor.  Certainly, the factories will be advantaged to some extent, but the ordinary leather merchant, who in turn sells to the poor shoemaker in the country towns and cities will not as far as I can learn be able to sell the leather over his counter to the working shoemaker without passing on this duty, which, of course, in turn will mean that the poor man will have to pay more for soling and heeling his boots.  I make the suggestion in good faith, and I should like the Minister to deal with that, as I feel it is not generally understood.  I can understand it, but I should like the Minister to get rid of a whole lot of doubt that appears to exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in mine, but there appears to be doubt abroad, because these poor people may feel that they <Col N="1060" /> will still be entitled to get their requirements from the leather merchant at the same price and my information is that the leather merchant will not be able to sell them this leather without putting on the tariff.  I am sure the Minister will admit that that is an injustice to these people, particularly in view of the fact that we do not manufacture that commodity ourselves in sufficient quantities to supply the home market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given way now very generously all round, and I want to deal with the question of glass bottles.  I raised the question of glass bottles on the First Stage and I was informed that the supply was temporarily controlled, but wait until the Irish Glass Bottle Company get in their tank and then we shall be on the pig's back.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that all our demands were going to be met by the Irish Glass Bottle Company.  Here is what the Company have to say about it:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At present we are building a tank for the manufacture of clear glass bottles, which we hope to have completed about the end of June. We have, however, so many orders to be executed for mineral water bottles, etc., that we do not anticipate to be in a position to manufacture bottles for you until the end of the year, when we shall be glad again to receive your inquiry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is any business man to do in face of that?  He is told by the Minister that there is going to be an abundant supply and this is what happened, and what is happening every day.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce wants to know something about bottles, about which he knows nothing.  He does not send <Col N="1061" /> round to the people in the bottling trade in Dublin or to people in the chemists' business.  He takes up the telephone and he says to the Irish Glass Bottle Company: &ldquo;Can you make bottles?&rdquo;,  and they reply: &ldquo;Certainly we can make bottles,&rdquo; and he puts a tariff of 50 per cent. on them.  That is all there is ever about it.  He did the same with regard to slates.  &ldquo;Can you supply slates?&rdquo;  he asks some company, and they reply, &ldquo;Certainly we can.&rdquo;  He does not put a tariff on slates but he gets the Minister for Local Government to announce that no grants would be given for housing except Irish slates were used.  The whole building trade in the country is in chaos.  It is worse than a tariff; it is a prohibition. It is the same all the way through.  Tariffs are being put on without any consideration whatever for the interests of the consuming public whose interests are being affected and no adequate inquiry is being made.  To my mind the situation is becoming absolutely chaotic and hopeless.  Whenever objection is raised, a licence is given to import and the operation of these licence proposals is making the administration of the Revenue Commissioners incredibly difficult and the conduct of the ordinary general business in the country absolutely unbearable. Anybody engaged in general business or in trade who comes in contact with these tariffs could tell the Minister, if he inquires, that it is becoming practically impossible to carry on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the duty on leather, it is quite true that the present intention is to administer it in such a way that boot factories will be allowed to import their supplies free of duty under licence.  There is very good, reason for that.  We admit that there are limitations to the present capacity of the existing factories.  The class of work which boot factories do represents one limited field of demand.  On the other hand, there is also a specialised demand for leather for boot-repairing purposes.  It is quite a different type of demand.  It is a demand for leather <Col N="1062" /> for certain handicraft work, and the capacity of existing tanneries is sufficient to meet that demand if they were working to their full output.  In addition to that, I understand that, even if the existing factories were left out of consideration, there are other people who are quite prepared to come into the business, now that they see it is going to get a chance, and to start new tanneries for themselves.  The number of persons employed in this industry at present is about 50.  We anticipate that there will be no difficulty in increasing that number to 300 or 400.  Naturally, we cannot do that without cost to somebody in the community, to some section of the community.  The only thing is whether, in the interest of the community as a whole, it is more desirable that these people should be employed in a skilled trade to the number of 300 or 400 or whether we are going to employ them on minor relief schemes.  If we decide that it is undesirable to employ more persons than is avoidable on minor relief schemes, proposals of this sort, which are designed to provide employment in the skilled trades, must be given a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the glass bottles, I think that Deputy Dillon has corroborated the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that, in due time, the Irish Glass Bottle Company would be in a position to supply white bottles.  He has been in communication with them and they have informed him that the orders they have on hand are such that they do not anticipate that they will be able to supply them before, I think he said, December next.  Deputy Dillon has his remedy under the Schedule.  There, once again, appears this despised licensing provision and I am sure that the moment he gets in touch with the Department of Industry and Commerce and submits to them the letter he received from the Irish Glass Bottle Company, he will have no difficulty whatever in getting a licence to import white glass bottles.  It will, I quite frankly admit, involve a little additional trouble for Deputy Dillon.  He may have to telephone twice instead of <Col N="1063" /> telephoning once but I am sure that there would be no impediment placed in his way if the Department considers that he bona fide requires to import these bottles and has the letter from the Glass Bottle Company showing that they are not available here of home manufacture.</P>

    <P>I was, unfortunately, unable to be here last Tuesday, when an amendment was moved in my name by Deputy Esmonde in connection with the tobacco tax.  The Minister did not, I understand, accept that amendment, and now, on the Fourth Schedule, I am moving these amendments&mdash;I suppose they can be taken together&mdash;to see that if we cannot get the whole loaf from him we can get half a loaf.  The object of the amendments is to reduce the excise duty by 50 per cent. where that duty is fixed on tobacco grown after January 1st, 1934, from 5/6 on the pound by weight to 2/9 on the pound by weight.  When the Minister and the Executive Council last year, in the 1932 Budget, decided to remit all the excise duty on tobacco, they must have had some very good reason for doing so.  That reason, obviously, was to encourage the growing of tobacco in <Col N="1064" /> Ireland.  If they thought that tobacco growing was an industry which should be encouraged in 1932, they must surely agree that it is equally deserving of encouragement in 1933 or 1934.  The Dáil Committee, which, in 1926, investigated tobacco growing in Ireland, stressed, as one of the great disadvantages that tobacco growing in Ireland had suffered from, the unsettled nature of the trade.  During the British regime, there was, at one time, aid given to tobacco growing to the extent of a bonus of 1/- per lb. by weight to the growers.  This was later changed to a subsidy of £50 an acre, which was subsequently reduced to £25 an acre, and the committee go on to a conclusion that the industry suffered from the fact that there was no settled policy with regard to tobacco growing. Here we have that same disadvantage occurring to an even greater extent this year.</P>
    <P>What was the result of the pronouncements with regard to the policy of the Executive Council on tobacco growing?  In County Meath, for instance, a tremendous number of votes were gained by the Fianna Fáil Party by the promises of my colleagues from Meath&mdash;whom I do not see present at the moment&mdash;which were, undoubtedly, carried out by the Executive Council, to drop all the taxes on tobacco.  Naturally, that proved a great attraction for the Meath tobacco growers.  In one year their hopes are dashed to the ground and the tax is suddenly raised from nothing to 5/6 or 6/8 in the pound, as the case may be.  That is not quite fair to the tobacco growers.  I would say that it is not even quite fair to my colleagues in Meath.  I do not know how they are going to explain in Wilkinstown and other districts, where tobacco is widely grown, what they said in 1932 and what has happened after the Budget of 1933.  Leaving out, however, the political side of it, it is a grave injustice to these farmers who were encouraged in every way to grow tobacco, and a wonderful vista of prosperity pointed out to them, to have their hopes dashed to the ground after one year and before they had properly started to grow the leaf at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> I think the Minister will agree that when he was in favour with other members of the Executive Council of remitting the excise duty altogether on tobacco last year, he had a very definite reason for doing so.  What has happened to change his mind? Apparently, it is purely a question of revenue.  Would the revenue suffer a great loss by reducing the excise duty by 50 per cent. or is the Minister in a position to answer that question?  I suppose it is a very hard question to answer but would the revenue suffer to such an enormous extent that it would not be made up by the justice of the case so far as the growers of tobacco are concerned?</P>
    <P>I saw, in this morning's paper, that the tobacco growers of Wexford, including a very well-known advocate of tobacco growing in Ireland, Father Sweetman, have actually agitated for this particular reduction in the amendment and, if the tobacco growers of County Wexford are of that opinion, they must have very good reason for their statements which went so far as to claim that any of the good done by the Minister's remission of taxation last year would be completely wiped out by the imposition of the taxes of 5/6 and 6/8 this year.  That was the considered opinion of the Wexford tobacco growers and I know, too, that it is the considered opinion of many of the Meath tobacco growers.  If the industry is ever going to be any good at all, it should get a fair chance and it should not be bandied about from Billy to Jack, with no tax upon it one year and, the next year, taxes of 5/6 and 6/8.  There is no guarantee that, in the Budget next year, the tax may not be increased to 9/4 or reduced to 4/6 and I would suggest, with all due respect to the Minister, that, if he would accept these amendments and state that, in accepting them, he would produce some germ of a settled policy with regard to tobacco for the years to come, it would be a great benefit to the tobacco growing industry.</P>
    <P>At the moment the person who smokes cigarettes or pipe tobacco has not had very much experience of Irish tobacco.  The general opinion growing up amongst the ordinary consuming <Col N="1066" /> public is that Irish tobacco is terrible stuff.  It was admitted by the Committee that considered this question in 1926 that the only future for the growing of Irish tobacco, for some period at all events, was that it should be mixed with a certain percentage of American leaf.  If that were done the mixture would not be noticed very much by the consumer.  I am quite sure that if the average Dublin working man was given Irish tobacco to smoke in his pipe he would not continue to smoke it and for two reasons: (1) that the Irish public are not yet educated to the taste of the Irish tobacco leaf; (2) or else that the Irish tobacco is so bad that the consuming public never can be educated to the taste of it.  I prefer to think that the first is the real reason though possibly the second counts to a great extent.  Both reasons, however, lead to this conclusion that some time must elapse before the Irish tobacco leaf will improve and until the Irish people will get more of a taste for Irish tobacco.  There must be a lapse of a number of years before those two conditions are fulfilled.  I suggest it is not giving a fair chance to the Irish tobacco industry to suddenly clap on a tariff of 6/8 one year after the growers had been promised complete relief from taxation.</P>
    <P>I would like to press this point on the Minister: I know for a fact that in the County Meath tremendous disappointment has been occasioned by the Minister's Budget statement this year as regards the tobacco duty. Perhaps from a political point of view it would be wiser for me to say nothing about that, but rather let the Fianna Fáil representatives for the County Meath suffer all the disadvantages that are bound to arise from the putting on of this tax because I am quite sure they will have to answer to the voters in regard to it.  But I prefer to take up the attitude that we should think of the people and of the tobacco growers first.  It is on their account that I am moving these amendments and I hope the Minister will accept them.  I think that from every point of view&mdash;of justice and commonsense, and especially from the point of view of <Col N="1067" /> justice in the carrying out of promises made in the 1932 election and again in the 1933 election&mdash;the Minister should accept these amendments and give a chance to the Irish tobacco growing industry.</P>

      <P>There is some information I would like to get from the Minister in connection with the duty levied on Irish tobacco.  I understand that the Minister estimates to get the sum of £3,500,000 from tobacco duty this year; but, supposing the Irish grower was able to produce sufficient to meet the requirements of the home market, what would this duty of 6/8 in the £ bring to the Exchequer? Those of us who are interested in the growing of Irish tobacco are anxious to get that figure.  It would give us some idea as to what the future of the tobacco growing industry here is likely to be.</P>

      <P>I desire to support what Deputy Davitt has said.  It is now very many years since this question first came before the Dáil.  I was Chairman of the Committee appointed seven years ago.  The report we sent in was only a provisional one. We suggested that there should be a remission of the duty provisionally, subject to reconsideration of the whole question by an impartial committee with wide terms of reference.  The Committee of which I was Chairman had not very wide terms of reference. It only had to deal with the question of the remission of duty.  We had not to consider the question of marketing and other matters vital to the tobacco trade.  The present Minister for Finance is adopting the same attitude as Mr. Blythe, when he was Minister for Finance, that he is not taking this matter seriously.  I object to that, as I did when Mr. Blythe was Minister.  I know that the present Minister has many grave problems to consider, and probably tobacco growing is a very minor matter in his mind.  In my opinion, and in the opinion of those who have studied the question, the matter is one that deserves careful consideration.  It has national possibilities. <Col N="1068" /> This kind of tinkering with it by the Minister and his Department does no good.  It does not help to promote the industry in any way.  This chopping and changing, putting on duties and taking them off with no fixed policy, only tends to discourage those who are trying to develop the industry.  I would urge on the Minister not to rely entirely on the opinions of civil servants and officials of his Department who are anxious, above all, to watch the revenue.  I would ask him to take the advice of persons who are not solely interested in revenue, but are able to take a wider and more general attitude towards the problem.  In that way, possibly, he might arrive at a settled policy, and not have this continuous confusion and chaos which only disheartens those who are trying to develop the industry.</P>

      <P>I am not able to accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Davitt.  What is asked for would run into a very considerable sum next year and the year after&mdash;to something in the neighbourhood of half a million pounds.  I am not in a position at this stage and in present circumstances to undertake what would be, in effect, a contingent liability of half a million pounds.  So far as tobacco growing is concerned we have done the best we possibly could.  We have given the growers two seasons to make up their minds as to whether they think it is worth going into this or not.  On the figures available at present, the potential crop for the present year, if properly marketed, will cost the Exchequer £280,000.  That is not by any means an inconsiderable sum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>£350.  That is what the remission might cost if the crop is properly marketed.  It does represent a considerable subsidy to tobacco growers, and they had better realise that it is a subsidy that no other Government would venture to give them.  It has been given.  Any person who cannot, with that subsidy, make a very considerable profit out of tobacco this year, well the sooner he gets out <Col N="1069" /> of the industry the better because he will never make a success of the industry under the circumstances and conditions which we contemplate will exist in future.  At any rate these people have had an opportunity to make a considerable profit on the tobacco they put down this year, a profit which we think will enable them to finance their further experiments in this field.  There is not going to be any further help from Government funds towards tobacco growers.  They got a chance and anybody who took that chance has secured a reward, a reward which possibly will enable them to start the business seriously and on a proper footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the prospects of the future, Deputy Minch asked me what was the ultimate yield from tobacco duty at 6/8.  As far as I can calculate it at the moment, it would be in the neighbourhood of £2,600,000 or £2,700,000. That is on the assumption that our demands were satisfied entirely from Irish tobacco and that the rate of duty remains in the neighbourhood of 6/4 or 6/8.  The resultant loss to the revenue would then be in the neighbourhood of £800,000.  I should like to say I would not be at all appalled at other times at that prospect.  If there is a satisfactory end to the conditions which at present exist, I think we can face that loss with equanimity, particularly, if, as a consequence, we have established here tobacco-growing on a sound foundation.  I have still faith in the industry and I believe that if it is solidly established, it will be able to bear a considerable excise duty, and that even possibly in other times it may be able to bear a heavier duty than 6/8.  We are quite prepared in certain circumstances to allow that duty for a reasonable time so that these people who do go into the industry seriously should reap a fair return for their enterprise.  I cannot bind myself beyond next year.  The duty will not be changed next year.  It will still remain at 6/8.  I hope in other years it may not be necessary unduly to increase it, but the one overriding condition under which this experiment has to be conducted is that we shall always have to have first regard to the revenue <Col N="1070" /> position.  We cannot, for the sake of having tobacco grown in this country, risk curtailing Governmental services. We cannot risk having to impose in substitution for the duty we may lose on tobacco a heavier duty upon any other necessary of life.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave us an estimate of the cost.  Has he any idea of the number of persons employed on the 800 acres?  Had he any information in regard to that this year or had he not that information last year when he was making the concession?  I should think it is a mistake to lead people to believe that there is a prospect for this industry without any imposition of duty, to get them drawn into it and then a year afterwards put on a pretty considerable duty.  There is a remarkable difference between growing tobacco which is to be free of duty and growing it when it has to bear a duty of 5/6 per lb. or some figure of that kind.  Had the Minister made any examination of the possibilities of the industry at the time the remission was given last year?  Did he examine the costings and the other information dealing with the industry which.  I understand, is available on certain files in the Department, or is it as a result of the experience which the Government has gained that this recommendation is made now?</P>

      <P>This position has arisen, not because we are satisfied that the industry has no prospects here.  On the contrary we are satisfied it has, and it is because the success of the experimental mission was so great we found that the revenue position would be gravely endangered. Many more people were attracted to the business than we thought would be the case.  I cannot give the exact figures as to the number of people employed, but as Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Esmonde know, the labour content in the industry is particularly high, higher I think, though I am not an agriculturist, than in the case of any other crop that can be grown here. That is one of the reason which makes it particularly attractive to the Government and one of the reasons which makes it incumbent on the Government to do everything it can within reason to see whether this industry cannot be made a success here and now.  It is not correct to say that we have taken off the duty one year and imposed it the next. This duty does not come into operation until the year 1934.  The remission was granted in 1932 and the crop grown in 1933 remains free of duty under that remission.  There will be no duty charged until 1934 so that everybody engaged in the industry has ample forewarning of the conditions which will prevail in 1934.  I cannot see that I would be justified in binding myself beyond that year.</P>

He said that this duty will only apply to the 1934 crop, and that a person need not grow tobacco in 1934 if he thinks it will not show a profit.  I would ask the Minister, does he think tobacco can be grown on lea land, land which is growing grass this year, or is it not necessary to prepare the ground this year by sowing some other crop so that the land may be prepared for tobacco next year?  If that is the case, as it obviously is, have not those persons who have decided that they were going to grow tobacco in 1934, and who set another crop this year, to leave their ground vacant unless they plant tobacco next year?</P>

These are the people who are prepared to go into this business, and who have the necessary enterprise to seize a good opportunity when it is presented to them.  That is the class of people who must take up this crop.  We do not want people who would think upon it, and scratch their heads when the opportunity knocked at the door.  We have to take the people who had the enterprise to seize the opportunity and who have the crop down in 1933.  They know something about tobacco growing, and they will be in a position to satisfy themselves whether it is going to be a success in 1934.</P>

Considering the general criticism that there has been on the part of tobacco growers, it seems to me, considering the action now taken by the Ministry, that some fuller statement requires to be made on the tobacco position, from the point of view of, say, the Minister for Agriculture.  Poteen makers turn out a &ldquo;first run,&rdquo; an chéad rith, but I understand that popularly it is only kept for external application. From the attitude of the Minister for Finance, in this connection <Col N="1074" /> it would appear, as far as the tobacco policy is concerned, that we have had a touch of the céad rith of their minds rather than a studied plan.  If it is intended that the tobacco industry could and should be established here, as an important part of agricultural development, before we leave the short discussion we have had it would be well if we heard&mdash;if not from the Minister for Agriculture, at any rate from the Minister for Education, who is a strong advocate of the wheat, tobacco and peat policy&mdash;an assurance that it was really intended as part of Government policy to make the growing of tobacco an important part of the development of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to emphasise in the beginning that this Peat Scheme is entirely experimental. It has been subjected to a great deal of criticism, indeed, to a regular barrage of criticism.  But I think that Deputies who have been most vocal in their criticisms have not understood that it is necessary to make a beginning somewhere or sometime.  In this country we are in a very fortunate position because we have immense resources in the way of peat deposits.  We have something like 3,000,000 acres of peat and about 3,000,000,000 tons of peat.  So that it is high time for a native Government to take some steps to develop these deposits and resources.  Our attitude in regard to this scheme, as I said in my opening statement, is that we would have been much better pleased had some independent or semi-independent body come along, to whom it might have been necessary to give financial assistance but who would make themselves responsible for the organisation, the production, the marketing and the disposal of peat. There is no such body.  It is necessary if this scheme is to proceed that the Government should give certain assistance.  We are giving that assistance in connection with organisation. As regards the actual commercial transactions and the commercial arrangements we hope that the Government will be completely excluded from them and that it will not be necessary for us to take part in any trading transactions.  We hope that after a short period this scheme will work itself: that once contact is established between the consumers and the body of merchants who have expressed their willingness to cooperate and who are ready to sell peat that it will be possible to do so at <Col N="1078" /> a price that will secure a market.  Once contact is established between the producers and the markets there is no reason why the Government should be interested in the scheme beyond that we may give some assistance in the way of co-operative societies and carry the scheme forward to a further extent until it is finally on a sound foundation.  This scheme is really only a preliminary.  We do not expect that a fully effective scheme can be evolved now.  Next year we hope it will be possible to market the peat through the ordinary commercial channels and we hope that by then these contacts will be fully established.</P>
      <P>The railway company have met us and they promised to try to give us a very reasonable rate indeed&mdash;a flat-rate for the whole of the Free State by which the producer of peat in the farthest off area will be able to compete successfully with the man who is only forty or fifty miles away.  That flat rate will be of immense advantage in enabling producers in bog areas to compete successfully for the Dublin market.  The Irish Agricultural Organisation Society is also at work in the formation of co-operative societies in the bog areas.  I explained in my opening statement that some time would elapse before these societies were established on a proper basis.  I have had some experience now of the preliminary arrangements, and I think it is essential for the success of the scheme that these societies should be established in a large number of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may also be necessary for commercial men to come in and make their own arrangements with the producers at one end and with the consumers in Dublin at the other end.  Obviously the co-operative societies will ensure that the largest possible share of the money paid for the peat will reach the producers' pockets.  The Government is most interested in that side of the problem, in seeing that the arrangements should be as simple as possible and that we should take all the steps necessary to establish direct trade between the producers and the markets so that they will get the largest possible share of the money <Col N="1079" /> paid by the consumers and that very little of it need go to middlemen. Transport charges will be reasonable as far as the railway company is concerned. As far as the canal companies go we are in touch with them and hope to have their co-operation also.</P>
    <P>The price mentioned by me of about 10/6 per ton for peat delivered at the railway station has been criticised. I could possibly have mentioned a somewhat higher figure, but I think that in the beginning we have to find our way, to instruct the producers and to make it quite clear to them that the best quality of turf will fetch the best price.  When I mention 10/6 I am assuming that some profit will have to be made by the middleman who would handle the turf as agent.  But if through the co-operative societies it is found that the producers are in direct touch themselves with the consumers the middleman's profits can be eliminated and then there will be no reason why a higher price than 10/6 per ton should not be paid to the producers.  But it is necessary to be conservative in the beginning.</P>
    <P>As has been emphasised by so many speakers, there are different shades and standards of turf.  I am assuming that turf of good, dry quality will fetch at least 10/6 a ton to producers, even where the agent has to be paid a commission.  Where there is no agent, then the producer will get more.  Good black turf such as we have in Achill, in County Mayo, can compare favourably with coal from the point of view of heating.  The ratio that we believe will generally characterise the heating value of peat will be two tons of peat to one ton of coal.  In fact, the peat which was delivered to the Curragh last year, when the Minister for Defence purchased 2,000 tons for local supplies, was proved definitely and was certified by Army engineers to have a higher heating value per ton than a half ton of coal.  There will be the same flat rate for transport from Achill or from the Midlands.  It is up to the people themselves to make a success of it.  There is no doubt that <Col N="1080" /> good black turf has a high heating value and that it compares favourably with coal.  If you went into a house where that turf was being burned you would believe that it was coal was being burned.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, however, that the price will be regulated as in all other transactions by the quality of the turf. The danger is that some people may think, on account of the fact that the Government is providing certain facilities and is making itself responsible for the organisation of the scheme in the beginning, that we are prepared to have bad or wet turf forwarded to the railway stations.  The forwarding of bad or wet turf to the merchants and distributors will simply injure the scheme as, of course, producers in every other branch of business associated with agriculture know very well.  The sending of bad stuff injures the whole trade.  It is up to the producers themselves to see that only turf of the very best quality is sent.  Turf not so good can be used at home.  In the beginning we must have the co-operation of the producers. We must have with us their public spirit; we must make them realise that it is to their own advantage to co-operate with us, and that it will militate against the scheme if we have not good turf and if we have not that good turf in large and regular supplies. If we get 500,000 tons extra during the coming year it would mean a great deal for the producers.  That 500,000 tons is not a great deal when one considers that we are importing 2½ million tons of coal and burning 6,000,000 tons of peat.  There is no reason why we should not redress the balance more favourably to our own advantage.  I would like to say to Deputies that a quarter million pounds for that 500,000 tons of peat would represent incalculable benefits to the people in the poorer areas.</P>
    <P>Those who are not acquainted with these areas do not realise that a pound counts more there very often than £10 in Dublin.  People who are rarely accustomed to have money passing through their hands at all, who have only a few acres of land, a <Col N="1081" /> certain amount of turf and a little bit of fishing and with a valuation of anything from 10/- to £2&mdash;nobody realises what it means to these people to have even £20 or £30 in hard cash coming into their pockets.  The fishing industry, we know, has failed and it is extremely difficult to live on these small holdings.  I am convinced that the people on these holdings, if given a proper lead and organised properly, can make the scheme work and make it successful.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies seem to think it is absurd that we should burn turf.  Why on earth should we not?  If we try to develop our resources and increase the consumption of peat we are keeping hundreds of thousands of pounds in this country that would otherwise go out of it to provide employment elsewhere. The scheme may have its defects, but it is largely in the experimental stage.  The object of it is to keep that huge amount of money circulating in the areas where it is badly needed.  It gives the people an opportunity of creating other employment for themselves and enables them to stand on their own feet.  The fact that other people did not think of this scheme and made no effort whatever, while they were in office, to develop our peat resources should not affect us although they had a report from the British Government in 1921-22 and reports from experts like Professor Purcell and the late Dr. Hugh Ryan calling attention to the fact that these peat resources were of enormous importance and more important to us than the peat resources of other countries were to these countries.  Notwithstanding this, no steps whatever were taken to develop these resources although we know that schemes have been going on in various countries, in Germany, Holland, Denmark and Russia.  No steps whatever were taken here, but when we introduce a scheme like this, a scheme which is quite simple and which has for its object that a large proportion of this money, that is at present being spent for fuel, should go back to our own people, we are attacked for doing something ridiculous and absurd.  The grates will not burn it, we are told.  Well, make <Col N="1082" /> grates that will burn it.  Deputy Dillon said that the grates in the big Dublin houses would not burn it; they were not installed for that purpose. It was pointed out to him that in fact they were.  That is the kind of criticism we get of a scheme that, perhaps, offers more hope than any other scheme introduced by the Government of real assistance and benefit to these poor people.</P>
    <P>It may be also that there will be improvements in the methods of packing, the methods of marketing and the methods of cutting turf; but at the moment we have to take the situation as it stands and to realise that there are difficulties.  Turf cutting and turf saving in bad weather, for example, may be described as most laborious and tedious and almost impossible, but in reasonably good weather, where the whole family can turn out on the bog, there is no work more health-giving or pleasant that you can turn your hand to or that the people themselves would prefer.  It is only amusement to them if they get favourable weather conditions.  There may be a certain amount of trouble and the price may look small, but we can only hope that, when the scheme is definitely established and no longer purely experimental and when we have a population in the towns and cities who are purchasing turf, and a regular contact established with the market, other improvements will come. Undoubtedly, the people will see that it is worth their while to invest money in improvements, in local transport for the cartage to the local railway station, in the packing of turf and, perhaps, as I say, even in the actual cutting of the turf.  The delivery of turf in Dublin, for example, will be in the hands of the distributors&mdash;the coal merchants&mdash;and it will be the distributors who will have to make the necessary arrangements.  Obviously, as Deputy Moore pointed out, it will be much cheaper to deliver the turf direct to the consumer from the railway station than to have the turf delivered to the coal merchants' yards first and delivered afterwards to the consumer.  I think the distributors are fully cognisant of that and they <Col N="1083" /> will endeavour to deliver directly from the railway station so as to reduce costs to themselves and the consumer. These problems, however, will ultimately solve themselves if we can ensure sufficient supplies.  At the moment, that is the important thing. In order that the railway company and the merchants will be able to handle the traffic it may be necessary to deal with consignments of peat in quantities of, say, 50 tons.  Obviously, it would be impossible for those who have promised to co-operate with us in this scheme to communicate with individual producers.  The producers will have to group themselves together and communicate either with the local station-master or directly with the Kingsbridge or with the peat office which we are setting up, and to state where supplies of turf are available and in what quantities.  Once the distributors or the marketing end of the turf are put in direct contact, as I have already emphasised, with the suppliers, the situation will solve itself, but organisation will be necessary at the producers' end.  They must come together in societies or groups and see that the turf is brought to the station on certain days and in certain quantities.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what the Minister has just said, I should like to know is there any arrangement being made by which the road services of the railway company will be made available for the transport of turf.  Some of the best bogs in the country are ten, twenty and even more miles away from a railway station or a canal station. Is it the intention to exclude these areas or bogs from participation in the scheme?  So far, the Minister has not said whether it is or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy was present when I mentioned in the beginning that the Government were anxious not to enter into the commercial transactions in connection with the scheme.  We are prepared to give a certain amount of assistance in the organisation of the scheme and to help to put the producers in direct contact with the <Col N="1084" /> distributors, but we are anxious not to be mixed up in the commercial transactions.  The railway companies will give every assistance possible but they will not be responsible for actually ordering the turf or paying for it. Within these limits, however, they have promised us the fullest co-operation in the loading and transport and packing of the turf, seeing that the turf is right and that the labelling is properly done, and everything else.  With regard to the transport from the bogs to the railway station, if there was a canal near the bog which Deputy Moore refers to I have no doubt but that whatever arrangements will be made with the Canal Company will cover it, but we have not made any arrangements with the railway company.  It should be a matter between themselves and the producers, or the societies of producers, for the haulage of the turf from the bogs to the railway station.  All we are concerned with is that there should be a definite price payable for standard turf, packed in sacks of one cwt., at the railway station.  Obviously the railway company cannot go into the trading side, and will not go into the actual trading transactions.  They will not make definite contracts with regard to the purchase or sale of turf, but outside that they will give all the assistance possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, therefore, does not fix the price of turf.  A figure of 10/6 has been mentioned.  In view of the fact that agents may be and probably will be eliminated in most of the areas, first, by the amount of assistance that the railway companies are giving us, and secondly, by reason of the fact that we hope to have co-operative societies established in most of the bog areas, there will be no necessity to make allowances for agents' profits. It is therefore, practically certain that more than 10/6 will in fact be paid. I am not going to mention any definite figure, because I feel that once the scheme is established the very finest quality of black turf, such as I have mentioned, will of course fetch a far better price than the inferior turf.  I should like to impress upon the producers and upon those who will be <Col N="1085" /> organising those schemes in the country, that we have got to keep up the quality.  If the quality is not satisfactory it means that the consumer is not attracted.  There are the disadvantages that have been dwelt on at such great length by speakers as reasons why the people will not like to buy turf&mdash;it is new, it is inconvenient, it does not suit the grates and so on.  All those arguments may be there, but the coal merchants are satisfied that under our present arrangements they will be able to retail turf at a price that will enable it to compete with coal, and will make it a serious competitor.  I think the price would be not much more than 25/- under present arrangements, but we have to be conservative at the beginning.  Once the market is established and once the consumer is accustomed to purchasing peat, the question will settle itself, and we can improve the price and improve the quality all round.  The best turf will get the best price; the bad turf will be rejected; the coal merchant will not deal in it, and will not deal with the man who supplies it.  The only effect of supplying bad or wet turf will be to injure the whole scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister complained that the last Administration never thought of taking £22,000, setting up a staff costing £2,000 a year, spending £10,000 on advertisements, £12,000 on sacks, and sending the sacks down to the bogs so that the turf might be delivered in sacks in future.  They never did it.  If there has been criticism of the Minister's statement from the various benches in the House it is because that is the bald presentation of his case on this Estimate which he has put before us. His attention has been drawn to the fact that the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement said that he proposed spending £50,000 this year on the development of the bogs.  The Minister has made no reference at all to the plans of the Minister for Finance in connection with this matter.  What the House would like to know is if the present scheme is simply an experimental one which says frankly: &ldquo;Turf is not used as much as it might be in our towns and <Col N="1086" /> cities.  We should like to see it used more.  We will do something to help the railway companies to make the transport of turf more easy, and thereby make it more easy for the people in the bog districts to dispose of their turf by sale.  We are going to experiment and see how we can better solve the transport of turf, and we are going to spend £22,000 on that.&rdquo;  If the Minister had said that, there might be some criticism of that particular scheme, but it would pass as an experiment.  However, the hopes that have been raised by Ministerial statements before the introduction of this Estimate, the hopes that were raised by the statement of the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech, and the publicity that since the discussion of this Estimate has been given in the Government Press to a new plan for the development of peat, would warrant, so far as this House is concerned, that the Minister would say something further with regard to the general plans for turf, before asking us for the £22,000 that is involved in this Estimate for an experiment which hardly seems worth the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was pointed out by some of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party that the Government guarantees a price of 10/6 per ton.  The Minister now says that that is not so.  It has been pointed out to a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party at a meeting down in Limerick that the rate is too low; that turf could only be ricked for that, not to mention cutting and drying. So far, therefore, as County Limerick is concerned, and some other counties that have been spoken of here, 10/6 is not sufficient, and I understand that the Government takes no responsibility for the price that is going to be paid in connection with this scheme.  To the scheme in general I, personally, have no objection, but it is one that I do not feel ashamed of not having thought of.  I would urge again that there should be some fuller statement as to what is going to be done with the further £30,000 that the Minister for Finance said would be spent on peat development this year.  I would also ask the Minister, now that Professor Purcell's name has been mentioned in connection with this scheme, whether <Col N="1087" /> he has anything to say to a report which appeared in the Government Press of the 5th June that Professor Purcell had returned from Copenhagen, where he had been sent by the Government some weeks ago for the purpose of reporting on turf development, and as a result of which the Government Press suggests that a peat plan of £160,000 is in process of being developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the answer given by the Minister to Deputy Moore was not at all a satisfactory one with regard to the transport problem. As Deputy Moore rightly pointed out, the majority of the bogs lie a very great distance from the railways, and although, apparently, the Ministry has made some arrangements&mdash;at least has approached the railway company with regard to a flat rate&mdash;it does not appear that they have made any arrangements whatever in regard to the transport of peat from the outlying districts to the railway. Consequently, I think that something ought to be done in that respect.</P>
      <P>The Minister complained of a barrage of criticism in relation to this experiment.  I rather thought that the Minister was a bit premature in boasting of the experiment.  I am afraid I am very pessimistic about this thing.  I am prepared to stand behind any effort that tends to develop the resources of the country, but I feel somewhat pessimistic about this particular proposal.  If the Minister thinks that 10/6 per ton is sufficient to compensate the producer of the best turf, I would not advise him to go down to Roscommon and convey that news to the people there who are interested in turf cutting.  The turf cutters there bring loads of turf from their banks, each load containing about 4 cwt., and they sell those loads for no less than 4/- or 5/-.  I would not advise the Minister to tell them that he is prepared to give them 10/6 a ton for their turf delivered at the station.  Turf could not be cut and saved at that price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Executive Council understand the position with regard to turf cutting?  The majority of people who <Col N="1088" /> cut turf in this country have just sufficient accommodation to cut turf for their own use.  The bulk of the people have not sufficient turbary, sufficient accommodation, to cut more than will supply their own requirements.  In my own locality in County Roscommon a lot of people have to burn coal as well as turf because we cannot get anything like the amount of turf we require. There are many people who have no turf banks of their own.</P>
    <P>I think before we can expect any success from an experiment of this sort we ought to have the question thoroughly examined.  The Minister does not appear to have examined the results of experiments carried out in other countries.  He referred to them but he did not tell us what results had been achieved.  I would very much like to know what were the results of the experiments carried out in Germany and other countries.  If the Government are really serious in their intention to go ahead with this scheme one would have imagined that investigations would be carried out with a view to finding some other method of cutting and drying turf and generally getting it suitable for the market.  I believe that in some instances where they introduced machinery for the purpose of cutting and compressing turf they did not meet with much success.  If we have to fall back on the ordinary methods of cutting and drying turf and if we have to rely upon the areas of turbary that are being utilised in connection with farms, I do not see much prospect of success.  I do not know where all the turf is to come from.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about standard bags. We are to have bags containing a standard weight of turf, say 1 cwt.  I am sure Deputy Jordan will agree with me that in the Midlands and West of Ireland there are bags and bags, so far as turf is concerned.</P>

      <P>If the turf is to be measured by weight, then I think we will want very different bags for some of the turf.  I do not think there is any likelihood of success in this thing at all.  It is merely in the experimental <Col N="1089" /> stage and whether it is worth the £22,000 that the Minister proposes to expend on it is a matter to which we should give very serious consideration. I am not at all optimistic about the proposal and I feel the money might be much better spent in some other direction.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that no matter what scheme is put forward from these benches it is always met with the same type of criticism.  We heard much the same criticism levelled against the Wheat Bill as was levelled against this proposal to-day.  A short time after certain Deputies criticised the Wheat Bill here they were inclined to adopt a different attitude and evidently the Government's scheme in that connection is going to be a success. We have heard much the same thing said in connection with turf.  For years past Fianna Fáil have maintained that it is the duty of a Government to provide work for the citizens.  Cumann na nGaedheal maintain that that is not so.  The country has turned them down and they should at least allow us to put our schemes into operation. There is no emigration at the moment and we have 24,000 or 28,000 young people anxious and willing to work.  I know farmers' sons who, in a particular part of the season when ordinary farm work is not being rushed, will go into the bog and cut sufficient turf to provide them with pocket money during the ensuing winter.  Certain criticism has been levelled at the price.  No one is compelled to sell turf at 10/6 a ton if he can do better.  But then, turf cutters are guaranteed 10/6.</P>

      <P>There is no one preventing Fianna Fáil from making this project a success, if they can do so. We would all like to see the scheme a success, but in our opinion the Government are going the wrong way about it.  We believe they should have given closer examination to this scheme.  In the old days turf was marketed in carts and creels, which were much handier for the producer.  Now, apparently, we will have to get accustomed to bagging it.  I think there is reason to complain about the price.  I would not intervene in this debate were it not that a Galway Deputy on the Government Benches mentioned last week that Galway County could supply I do not know how many hundred thousand tons of turf at the rate of 10/6 a ton.  You may get turf at that price in the district from which the Deputy comes, but that would not apply to other areas.</P>
      <P>I have made a careful examination of the cost of producing and transporting turf from the bog to a railway station. I have investigated the cost of cutting, footing and preparing turf for the market and then taking it to the railway station.  The average distance from the bog to the railway station could be put at three miles.  I am sure some Galway Deputies will confirm my statement when I say that many farmers have to travel ten or 12 miles with turf from the bogs to their homes. For the purposes of my calculation we will say the distance is three miles. You will have to pay £1 a week to the person footing the turf and you will have to pay a good wage to the cutter. Most of the cutters in County Galway come from Connemara and they are paid about £2 a week.  You cannot get them to work for less.  Deputy Briscoe may smile or sneer as he wishes; he does not know anything about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies from the country districts know very well that you cannot get a man to cut turf for less than £2 a week.  I think the cutter earns his money very well, because there is no harder work.  A good cutter is certainly well worth £2 a week. <Col N="1091" /> I calculate that the cost of a load of turf 17 or 18 cwts., would be 13/10.  I do not mind what method of transport you employ, but it would certainly cost 3/- a ton.  That amounts to practically 17/-.  If you take 20 sacks to the ton at 2d. each that will bring the cost of turf delivered at the railway station up to £1.  All you could give the men supplying the turf in these circumstances would be £1 or £1 3/- per week.  I would like to see this scheme a success, but I believe you cannot make it a success on the lines you are going.  In the bog districts, as Deputy Brennan said, people have enough turbary to suit themselves.  Where turbary has to be opened up to get increased supplies you have not the population.  You will have to import people to get out the turf and to get it on the road for rail.  The result will be that the turf will cost very much more.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said as regards the use of turf for power, and that turf fuel is able to drive engines.  It would, so far as the ordinary stationary plant is concerned.  It would work satisfactorily in threshing, stationary, and stone-crushing machinery, but it would not be sufficient to work rolling plant.  It has not the heating power necessary for rolling plant, but I agree it is sufficient for the class of machinery that I have mentioned.  The Minister for Education told us that if the fireplaces for fuel consumption were not suitable for turf they could be taken out and others put in.  Of course, that is so; but in the smaller towns, in all the houses built during the last 20 or 30 years the stoves, ranges and fireplaces that have been put in were intended for coal burning. The Minister for Education said there was no trouble in taking out fireplaces that did not suit and getting in those that would.  But the new process is going to cost something, and it is going to cost something in connection with the housing schemes in hand at the present time, because, as I say, all the stoves, grates and ranges manufactured up to the present time are intended for the burning of coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> The Minister also told us that the price would be 10/6 per ton delivered at the railway station.  He went on to say that producers could combine and send away large quantities, 50 tons or so, in one particular order.  In many of these areas where turf is produced you have very good black turf and you may also get brown turf.  Now if big loads are sent off the people who have black turf will suffer under that scheme because they will only get the price that is paid for the poorer brown turf. The Minister says that there are places in Achill where there is what is called black stone turf and that these people could establish agencies for the sale of their produce.  So far as I know there are very few bogs in which you will get that real black turf.  I disagree entirely with the Minister when he said that the Galway farmers could supply 500,000 tons of turf at the railway station at 10/6 per ton.  The very least at which turf could be delivered profitably at the railway station would be £1 a ton.</P>

      <P>With regard to the turf scheme, under discussion, I think the greatest possible tribute paid to the Minister for Education is the interest that has been taken in the scheme by all sides of the House.  Even Deputies who often delayed the business by their speeches have contributed to this debate.  It may even be very helpful, at the beginning, to have people pointing out the difficulties and the possibilities of complete failure of such a scheme.  I think, however, it is not proper, when an effort of this kind is being made to develop what, with the necessary enthusiasm and financial aid, might possibly come to be a very big industry, in areas where very little hope was held out in the past of having any good come to them for development in the locality in which they live, to put nothing but obstacles in the way, and to have nothing but the possibility of failure pointed out by Deputies of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  Deputy Brodrick has spoken, and evinced great interest in the scheme.  He is in a stronger position than I am in regard to this peat scheme, because if it is a failure he will say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; and if it is a success he will say, &ldquo;I gave some help because I spoke in favour of the scheme.&rdquo;  It is not fair for Deputies to place themselves in opposition, as the Cumann na nGaedheal Party has done, to a scheme like this.  We would be glad, says Deputy Brennan, to help the Government <Col N="1094" /> in the development of the resources of the country if we could. Of course we are thankful for small mercies.  We are thankful that Deputies opposite promise to give some little aid to help to establish industries, but we are not thankful for the type of contribution such as we heard from Deputy Brodrick.  He thinks the farmers in the County Galway could not supply turf at 10/6 a ton at the railway station.</P>
      <P>If the Minister finds any difficulty in getting a certain amount of good turf from Galway at that price, he will not run short while he has bogs in Mayo to develop.  The people there will be very glad to supply first-class material at that price.  I was travelling in the train recently with no less than 64 migratory labourers, who were going across to England in the hope of finding work.  If this scheme had been developed earlier, and was in a more complete condition, and these people thought they would be able to get the price suggested here for turf, they would have remained at home and applied themselves to cutting turf for the last two or three months.  The scheme for this year is to a certain extent a little bit late.  It is never too late to begin a good thing, however. I think we should be thankful that the scheme has been started even now.  If, say, 15/- per ton were guaranteed, would we not have practically every Opposition Deputy getting up and saying that it was a most extravagant scheme; that it was a very drastic thing to guarantee such a price for turf; that it was bound to be a failure, because it would be too expensive for the consumer?  That is where Deputies in opposition are able to place themselves on both sides of the fence in a matter of this kind in the initial stages. To my mind, the price is low, but it will be availed of.  If the obstacles in the way of the scheme are removed, it will be a very successful venture.  In the County Mayo the obstacle is not shortness of bog, such as has been suggested by Deputy Brodrick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be speaking of a particular area in Galway, and I give him the benefit of the doubt.  In Mayo, the biggest population is in the areas where there is a large amount of bog.  In that county the obstacle is not finding bog or finding people to do the work.  The big obstacle is the drainage problem and the making or repairing of roadways to some of these bogs from the highways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister applies himself to seeing that proper drainage schemes are carried out in these large bog areas and that proper roadways are provided into the bogs he will find that the scheme will be welcomed by the people living in these areas in Mayo.  They will not object to the price being so small for the first year, and I believe that, as time goes on, it will be possible to have a better price in the future.  People outside particular counties have not developed a taste for turf.  We heard from Deputy Anthony recently that certain people have developed a taste for Scotch whiskey; they have not had time to develop a taste for turf.  In the interests of the country, instead of people developing a taste for Scotch whiskey, we must try to develop a taste for Irish products such as Irish whiskey and turf.  Any Deputy who has seen the proper kind of turf used must admit that it is a cleaner fuel than coal.  In some cases the fire grates may be rather small for burning turf, but that can be remedied.  I think it would not be an over-estimate to say that 80 per cent of the fireplaces in the country districts, and 40 per cent. in the towns and cities, were originally constructed for the use of turf and are still capable of burning it.  If you take the North side of Dublin, for instance, you will find that the grates in the older houses were constructed for burning turf.  One Deputy advanced the fantastic idea that the use of turf would create dirt in a house and that the fireplaces are not suitable for burning it.  Deputies talk in that way because they know nothing about it or because, knowing about it, they want to pretend they do not.  I was <Col N="1096" /> in one of the eastern counties a few weeks ago and people there were surprised to hear that it was possible to cook a dinner with turf.  These were people who never saw turf burned. I think it is not fair for Deputies, from the West of Ireland, for instance, who know that the contrary is the fact, to say that people will not use turf and that this scheme is going to fail.  The same might have been said about the use of coal or electricity years ago.  The scheme only wants to get a chance and I believe that it will become a very great success.  It should, however, be approached in a sympathetic manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brodrick said he thought the scheme had not been sufficiently considered, but he did not make a single suggestion as to how it could be improved on.  As we are more or less approaching this question in a spirit of goodwill, I should have liked to have heard some suggestion from him other than that of increasing the price.  I should like Deputies to consider this problem sympathetically with us and, with enthusiasm behind the scheme, I feel sure that we will get people to use a very large amount of turf in counties where at present nothing but coal is used.  Up to the present turf has not got a fair show.  Even at the present time there is being sold on the streets of Dublin as turf a commodity that is only compressed moss.  I know people who bought it because they had heard of this turf scheme, and when they burned it it smoked them out and filled the place with dirt.  It is not turf at all.  I should like the Minister, through the organisation he is setting up, to establish some kind of a propaganda system to inform people in Dublin, who might be inclined to use turf, that what is being sold from door to door at present in the city is not turf at all.  There is another matter that the Minister should consider. There are some bog areas, particularly in County Mayo, which are 40 miles from a railway station.  These areas are interested in this scheme and the people are cutting this year an extra supply of turf in the hope that they will be able to get a market for it. The Minister must meet them in some <Col N="1097" /> way in regard to the cost of transport for the turf over a long distance to the railway station.  I have no doubt at all that in time this scheme will be a success and that as time goes on we shall be able to remove any weaknesses which may be in the scheme at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words by way of conclusion to the debate.  A number of points have been raised since the Minister for Education left.  I was not here during all the debate on the peat but, from what I read and from what I have heard here to-day, it is quite easy to understand why nothing was done for peat while Cumann na nGaedheal was in office.  Their philosophy is that nothing we have in this country is any good.  We cannot do anything ourselves and instead of burning our own peat we must get the dirtiest fuel in the world&mdash;British coal&mdash;fuel that would not be allowed <Col N="1098" /> to be burned in any clean city in the United States.  We do not hold that peat is an ideal fuel or that nothing better was ever discovered or thought of, but we have to realise the circumstances of our country and the circumstances of other countries where people find that it is increasingly difficult to export anything in order to pay for what is imported.  We have been sending out £3,000,000 per year for foreign fuel and I think it is jolly well time that we tried to keep some of that money at home.  I would appeal to Cumann na nGaedheal, to the farmers, to Labour and to everybody else to come forward and, for the sake of our own people, try to make this scheme a success and as great a success as it can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a Fianna Fáil idea really.  I have here a report of the First Dáil in which they set out their different recommendations after examining the problem.  They recommended that a certain sum of money should be spent in taking over a large tract of bog and working it with machines.  That is all very well for the future but we have here an enormous number of people who are idle or half idle in the poorest parts of the country&mdash;on the bogs&mdash;and it is very difficult for this or any other Government to get productive work for them to do.  The House is aware of the sums of money spent last year on giving relief work.  Some of the work was not very necessary but the work was given so that the idle people in these poor bog areas might get wages to buy food.  Here is a scheme for which the community will get back penny for penny.  If we had come forward with a scheme something like the beet scheme, where the Government subsidy was something like three times the price the producer got, we, undoubtedly, would have had to face a lot of criticism in the Dáil but, instead of doing that, we have tried to make this scheme economic. Instead of spending vast sums of money on it, we have tried to organise it so that it might run itself, in other words, that we might help the people simply to help themselves and, viewing it from that point of view, we examined the <Col N="1099" /> problem to see how exactly turf stood in relation to coal and what were the relative values.  We found that, roughly speaking, you may take them as being in the ratio of two to one&mdash; two of turf to one of coal&mdash;and, if you get fairly decent turf, half black and half brown, five tons of it is equal to three tons of coal.  In other words, fairly good turf at 24/- per ton, delivered to the consumer's house, is as good value as coal at 40/- per ton.</P>
    <P>There are vast areas in the country where people have to pay more than 40/- per ton for their coal and, as a matter of fact, I think it may safely be taken that, in nine-tenths of the country, the people have to pay more than 40/- per ton for their coal.  Under this scheme there is not a single part of the country in which turf cannot be sold to the consumer at a fair profit to the producer, the railway company and the retailer at 24/- per ton, so that the thing runs itself.  It is, value for value, as good as coal.  A Deputy on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches said something about bags, but I do not think he understood the scheme as it is.  It is proposed that there should be a standard bag, 24 inches by 45 inches.  That will hold roughly about four cubic feet of turf, and that four cubic feet of turf will have to weigh one cwt.  The standard bag was adopted in order that people could not sell inferior, light turf.  There is turf that runs as far as about 300 cubic feet to the ton, and this particular turf, the standard turf which it is proposed to sell in these standard bags, will run to 80 cubic feet to the ton.  The turf will also be of a standard dryness.  It will have not more than 30 per cent. moisture, and it will have a standard ash content of not more than seven per cent, so that the consumer, when he buys a bag of turf, will know that it is fairly dense turf, not more than 80 cubic feet to the ton; he will know that it is dry turf, with not more than 30 per cent. moisture, and he will know that it is clean, good turf with not more than seven per cent. of ash content. In that way, he will have greater security than he has in buying a lot of the imported British and other coal. <Col N="1100" /> There is no standard of quality there, but here the consumer will get an article on which he can rely at a decent price and I hope, therefore, that everybody concerned, consumers and everybody else, will help to make the scheme a success.  Every penny paid for Irish turf will go into an Irishman's pocket; it will go to the producer, to the railway company, to the railway operatives, to the retailers and to the carters in the towns and cities.  It is a scheme which is deserving of the utmost co-operation by all parties and by all classes in the community.</P>
    <P>The people in the village adjoining a bog area should be interested in it because, if there is money coming back to that bog area for turf, the people in the village will have a chance of seeing it, but, if the money goes out for British coal, there is very little chance of somebody in England coming over and spending holidays in that particular village.  Every penny used under this turf scheme will be a penny saved to the country.  It will circulate in the country and it will energise all business in the remote areas and in the towns and cities as well.  There is a big prize to be gained&mdash;about £3,000,000&mdash; and I have not the slightest doubt that we could, within a couple of years, replace that import of £3,000,000 worth of foreign fuel by our own native fuel. We are not going to force the people to buy turf.  There is good Irish coal as well and people should get busy and buy Irish coal in preference to any imported coal.  Deputy Belton stated, the other day, that it would take six tons of turf to equal one ton of coal and that statement shows just how little people know about it.  I want to say that experiments carried out by all the professors and experts in the use of turf, plus the experiments carried out by army engineers, under my own direction, go to show that five tons of this standard turf equal three tons of the best imported house coal. So that turf at 24/- a ton is equal to coal at 40/- a ton. Now as regards the price at 10/6 per ton, that is a minimum price.  No one is stopped from getting 40/- per ton for turf if he can get it. I think it would be much better for <Col N="1101" /> people to sell ten tons of turf at a fair price rather than be getting an exorbitant price for half a ton of turf in the year.  Some turf that is being sold at the moment in Dublin is costing, roughly, 72/6 a ton.  It is being sold under the penny a sod system.  It is not turf; it is only peat moss litter.  I think it is much better that an effort should be made to organise the turf industry so that, instead of people being charged 72/6 per ton for inferior stuff, they should get good turf delivered to their houses at about 23/- or 24/- a ton.  The bag container will help greatly to have that done because in the transport of loose turf each sod has to be handled about a dozen times.</P>
    <P>Take one operation alone&mdash;the loading of a barge with turf.  It takes 27 man-days to load a barge&mdash; that is nine men take three days.  To load a barge with bags of turf can be done in seven man-days.  On that operation alone you can save 20 days in loading 50 tons of turf on a barge. In the case of putting turf on to railway wagons, the railway companies were compelled to charge a very high price for the carriage of turf, because, first of all, the wagons were held up for a long time building up the turf on them.  The turf was very light and they could not get sufficient on a wagon.  With this standard turf they will be able to get as much almost on an open wagon as they would of coal. They will be able to get about the same tonnage.  A remarkably reasonable rate has been fixed for the carriage of turf on the railways.  That will help in the transport of the turf.  It will enable the turf to be transported between any two points in the Irish Free State over the Great Southern system and sold at a flat rate.  That rate will look coal in the face, even in the cheapest districts for coal.</P>
    <P>Quite a large amount of turf can be consumed in this country without going through anybody's hands other than the hands of the producer.  The people in the turf areas are both producers and consumers.  We hope to help people to produce turf and to consume it themselves as well as to produce turf for sale.  The Government have <Col N="1102" /> set aside the sum of £100,000 for the making of bog roads and the drainage of bogs.  Some people have said that it takes at least £1 a ton to get turf out of the bog.  There are some bogs in which the price of 10/6 per ton delivered to the nearest railway station, a station, say, two or three miles away, would represent £2 10/- a week standard.  There are other bogs where the cost of producing turf would be £3 or £4 a ton, because people have to carry it on their backs for a mile before reaching a sound road where they can put it on a vehicle and take it home.  We hope as speedily as possible to make the bogs available through people in the localities concerned building fairly decent roads and helping them to drain their bogs.  We hope that when the turf associations get going the people will do minor drainage works themselves without waiting for the Government to come along and do it.  If you go down to any bog you will see a lot of men on the face of a bank, each of them up to his waist, digging out turf.  If they all moved forward from the bank one day making a drain would enable them to dig with a dry foot.  We hope that, through the organisation of turf associations, people will be enabled to do little jobs like those themselves instead of waiting for the Government to send down officials to pay them and supervise their doing it.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked about the schemes for the pressing of turf.  That is all for the future.  This particular scheme is confined to the winning of hand won turf for fuel purposes this year.  There are many uses to which turf can be put.  It is only to-day that I heard of a proposal that in a town in my own constituency people are trying to get turf for a town gas supply. It has been done before, and it will be done again.  Turf can be used in many ways.  This particular scheme is confined to the organisation and supervision of the winning of hand-won turf for fuel purposes this year.  Other schemes can look after themselves. Schemes such as have been spoken about to-day require special consideration. The Department of Industry and Commerce is dealing with it at the <Col N="1103" /> moment.  I hope that when Deputies go back to their constituencies they will endeavour to encourage people to take advantage of the turf scheme, so that as much money as possible can be kept at home.  We should send as little money as possible out of the country for fuel, either British or German.  We want all the money that we have for fuel to be given to our own people, a lot of whom have no work, and at the moment are living on a very low standard of comfort indeed.  The experiment is deserving of the support of all sections of the community, and I trust it will get it.</P>

What wages does he think it will be economic to pay a man if you send him out to the work, to cut turf and save it, suppose the bog is only half a mile away, and to cart it to the nearest station?

      <P>What I desire to say is that turf of standard quality at 24/- per ton is as good value as coal at £2 per ton.  Therefore if coal in a certain district is £2 per ton, the turf men can legitimately demand 24/- per ton for turf from a customer.  If coal is more than 40/- per ton, say 50/-, the turf man can get another few shillings in addition to the 24/-.</P>

      <P>I think it has been estimated that the turf will cost 10/6 per ton on the bog.  Deputy Cleary has stated that there are certain bogs 40 miles from a railway station.  What is going to be the cost of delivering turf from such a bog to the railway station?  Let us suppose that coal in Dublin is £2 per ton.  Will the Minister guarantee in face of that <Col N="1105" /> that turf will be sold at 24/- per ton in Dublin?</P>

      <P>The Minister will not give any guarantee.  He only undertakes to put the scheme under way. The figures given by the Minister for Defence are approximate.  With reference to the bogs that are 40 miles from the railway station, it will no doubt be more economical to deal with bogs that are not 40 miles from the railway station.  The other bogs can be dealt with later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>

I should like to know what machinery has been set up to see that that standard and no other will be delivered to customers under this scheme?</P>

      <P>There has been no such machinery set up.  The consumer will settle that.  As I explained in my speech the consumer will pay a price for turf that he considers economic, but we suggest to the House that when the scheme is operated it will be found economic to purchase turf in comparison with coal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

I want to know what machinery has been set up to see that turf of that particular quality, as regards moisture and ash content, will be delivered and no other turf?  We all know that all the turf in a bog is not of the same quality.  The Minister also said that five tons of turf were equal to three tons of coal.  I do not question that <Col N="1106" /> for a moment, but I should like to know what machinery is being set up to see that this standard turf is put on the market because, as I visualise it, it will take an inspector in every place turf is being produced to see that that standard and no other is produced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Samples of turf will be taken from time to time.  The coal merchants after the first consignment or two, which I suppose must be largely experimental, will endeavour to assure themselves, as business men, that the turf is of a certain standard.  The standard mentioned by the Minister for Defence is a standard with regard to weight and size.  It is not pretended that the ash content or the moisture content can be standardised, but it is contended that it can be ensured, for example, at the railway station that no fraudulent action will take place in filling the turf, if it is filled into bags at the railway station.  That can be assured.  As regards the standard, the standard that is being laid down is good quality turf&mdash;good dry turf.  It is not pretended that every sack or bag will have exactly the same kind of turf, but it will have roughly four cubic feet of good quality turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that when the turf is being cut, an inspector will have to <Col N="1107" /> go round to ensure that stones will not be put into the sods.  This scheme could lead to a good deal of dishonesty. I know what I am talking about in this matter.  A dishonest person could make money by employing a man to put stones into the turf, more money than he could by selling turf honestly.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates. - Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill, 1933&mdash;Fifth Stage (resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we have arrived at the last stage through which this Bill will have to pass in this House, I think it well to re-state the position of our Party, as it was stated last week by Deputy MacDermot when he was speaking on the Bill.  We have throughout the course of this Bill supported the Government.  We have supported the Government in their management of it, because we have consistently maintained that it is vital to the interests of this country that rigorous economy should be practised in the public administration.  We regard this Bill as a gesture, albeit we are of opinion there remains plenty of room for further reform, in regard to <Col N="1108" /> the expenditure of public money.  Personally, I have always believed, and I still believe, that divers economies might be effected in the public service by approaching the question from the point of view of reducing the personnel of the Civil Service.  At least, if the Government cannot address themselves towards that task, they ought, definitely and finally, make up their mind that there will be no further additions to the ranks of the Civil Service. I would remind the House that, in a debate that took place here about a month ago, I said to the Minister for Agriculture that I thought the policy he was pursuing was calculated to produce a considerable increase in the numbers of civil servants, in just the same way as the policy being pursued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was doing.  The Minister replied that he knew that was so; that he was creating hordes of new officials every day.  I do not think any Minister, in existing circumstances, should publicly state that it was his intention materially to add to the numbers of civil servants.  On the contrary, the whole mind of the Executive Council, in my opinion, should be addressed to the opposite direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this Bill is concerned, to reduce the salaries of public servants, we feel, and have always felt, that while every man in this State is entitled to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, you have got to bring public expenditure into some relation with the capacity of the people who have to pay.  In the long run, everybody in this House knows that the agricultural industry has to carry the burden of public expenditure.  Everybody knows the deterioration that has taken place in the prosperity of the agricultural industry for the last ten years; everybody knows the catastrophe that has overtaken the agricultural industry in the last 18 months. I cannot help feeling, when I hear the Labour Party rigorously protesting against the provisions of this Bill, that their attitude is inconsistent.  When the whole question of the economic war was debated in this House, I remember saying to the President: &ldquo;Think well before you go into this business, <Col N="1109" /> because a lot of the people who are urging you to strike the first blow for Ireland, and to make any sacrifices that may be necessary, when the time comes for the sacrifices to be really felt, they are the very people who will be your sternest critics and take you most sorely to task.&rdquo;  I remember that Deputy Norton and the Labour Party indicated disapproval of what was said on these benches, urging the Government carefully to count the cost before putting their hands to the economic war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble, that Deputy Norton does not realise, or seem to realise, what the economic war means to the people of this country and what it has already cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

They are being made by the agricultural community.  As I pointed out to the President on that occasion: &ldquo;When the pinch comes, and when the consequences are upon us, those who urge you on this course will be the very first to cry halt.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We have taken the view on this Bill that if there was to be a concession made it was a concession in respect to the salaries paid to the sergeants and members of the Gárda.  I think it is a matter for regret that the section imposing reductions on their salaries has been allowed to stand.  When this Bill came before the House on Second Reading, we moved a reasonable <Col N="1110" /> amendment to the effect that further consideration should be postponed until some proposals were introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I ruled in accordance with practice and in accordance with the Standing Orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon stated that Deputy Norton and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle could not claim to be entirely free from some blame for what the Deputy did on that occasion. I want to repudiate that emphatically and to say that any direction I gave, which was not a ruling, was as to how the vote should be taken.  It was not given to induce anyone to take the wrong turn when they went to the top of the stairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not wish to be in any way associated with a suggestion that I made a charge, direct or indirect, against the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  All I said was that I believed that he could not discharge himself from responsibility for a misunderstanding that arose out of his ruling.  If that is a reflection on the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, without reservation of any kind, I withdraw it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A reasoned amendment was introduced to the effect that we should postpone consideration of this Bill unless and until proposals were introduced by the Government for reduction of the allowances made to Deputies.  In supporting that amendment, we suggested to members of Fianna Fáil that it represented neither justice nor equity that we should say that a member of the Civil Service or any public servant could afford to suffer a reduction in his salary from £360 a year to £300 a year if, at the same time, we said that a member of this House could not afford to suffer the same reduction of his allowance. It seemed that on both sides of the House that position was understood. Deputy Cosgrave went so far as to say that if he was taking up our position of general support of the Bill, he would be inclined to vote for the amendment. President de Valera said that he fully understood what inspired the motion but he did not seem to be able to go further and say that he accepted the principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire on this, the last stage of the Bill, to repeat that I do not consider that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party in promoting and supporting this Bill for the reduction of the salaries of public servants&mdash;which reduction, taken with the decrease in <Col N="1112" /> the cost of living bonus, represents in some cases a fall from £360 to £300 a year&mdash;are doing justice or are serving equity when they do not insist on their own Executive introducing a measure to make a similar reduction in the allowance of members of the Dáil. The Cumann na nGaedheal Party have represented themselves throughout this debate as uncompromisingly opposed to the Bill, root and branch. I could not but feel that here again there was evidence of inconsistency, for it was admitted that proposals were on the carpet before Cumann na nGaedheal went out of office for a reduction in the Gárda salaries considerably greater than the reduction proposed to be made by this Bill.  It is only fair to add that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney went on to say that though this proposal did exist and, at first glance, seemed to be an irrevocable decision, in fact it was not an irrevocable decision and was only intended for submission to the Representative Body of the Gárda Síochána.  He explained that Cumann na nGaedheal were turning over in their minds other means of economising in respect of the police force. Nevertheless, a proposal was made by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and it would not have been made unless they thought there was justice and reason to defend it.  They did not make a proposal that they knew to be grossly unjust.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A point of order has been raised&mdash;properly raised &mdash;by Deputy Morrissey.  The Deputy is right in stating that this is not a Second Reading debate.  Deputy Dillon has been given considerable latitude by the Chair.  His speech so far has been in the nature of a Second Reading speech.  On the Fifth Stage of a Bill, debate is confined to what <Col N="1113" /> is in the Bill and reasons for supporting or rejecting the measure.  The Deputy must now come to such reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be entitled, when considering the reasons that were advanced for supporting the Bill in its present form, to consider the reasons advanced by other Deputies for rejecting the Bill on account of its present form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fifth Stage of a Bill is not a continuation of the Second Reading.  Deputies should realise that it is very unwise to put hypothetical questions of order to the Ceann Comhairle.  The Ceann Comhairle decides when a Deputy is out of order, but it is not his function to guide Deputies as to what might be relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has been made that because there are certain schedules of reduction in the Gárda salaries, this Bill should be rejected. Considering that these arguments come from a source which was also a source of a proposal for much more substantial reductions on another occasion, I have been induced to look upon them with a certain suspicion&mdash;even with the thought occurring to me that they were sufficiently inconsistent to be invalidatory. Further, considering that representations were made from a similar source that there were proposals in this Bill materially to reduce the salaries of teachers, I felt bound to examine the source from which these arguments emanated when they came up for consideration. It occurred to me, in the process of considering them, that from that source also there were proposals for much more material reductions in the salaries of these self-same teachers. That seemed to me to be an evidence of inconsistency.  Taking that into consideration with the merits of the case, it seemed to me that the argument was not a valid one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further objection, and one that was heavily laboured, was that there were proposals in this Bill to extend reductions to the transferred civil servants. I need hardly say that anybody considering a Bill of this kind would be deeply concerned by any such objection, <Col N="1114" /> because there can be no doubt that this State is bound by the most solemn undertaking to the transferred civil servants&mdash;that the rights accorded to them will not be interfered with now or hereafter.  I cannot quite understand the case that was made in this connection.  My understanding of the rights of the transferred civil servants was that when the Treaty was made their position was to be no less favourable than that which they would have enjoyed under Schedule 8 of the Act of 1920.  That was further confirmed by the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act of 1929.  What was the nature of the guarantee that was given to these civil servants?  It was contained in Section 14 (2).  Whenever a civil servant to whom this section applied &ldquo;is required to perform duties which are not analogous to and are an unreasonable addition to his duties at the time of his said transfer, or when owing to changes in the conditions of his employment the position of such officer has been materially altered to his detriment&rdquo; that officer is entitled to retire, if he so desires, with the consent of the Minister or with the permission of the Wylie Board.  It is only right to add, when considering this objection to the Bill, that when the Minister for Finance of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was defending the Bill of 1929, he went out of his way to say that, with the passage of this Bill every loophole would be stopped, that there was no possibility, by statute or otherwise, of interference with the rights of these men.  I am not quoting his words exactly so far, but I shall now give a quotation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Objections have been made to certain sections of the Bill on these grounds.  It has been objected that anyone who supports this Bill with these sections in it is doing something wrong.  I am defending the presence of these sections in the Bill.  In connection with that, the Minister for Finance in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government pointed out that no Act could deprive the transferred civil servants of their rights unless it specifically repealed the statute which was steered through this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Again on that I have to quote what the then Minister for Finance said, speaking in this House on 7th November, 1929, as reported in Volume 32, column 985, of the Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Government is going to attack the rights of the transferred officers it must come out and repeal the section.  It must decide to go the whole hog.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my submission the statement of Deputy Blythe, the Minister for Finance on that occasion, is perfectly right.  There is nothing in this Bill which is calculated to interfere with the essential rights of these transferred civil servants.  There is nothing except a statute of this House repealing the Bill, which could interfere with their rights, or with their right to go to what was then known as the Wylie Commission, and have their compensation assessed.  That right is in every way as much intact to-day as it was before this Bill was first read, because <Col N="1116" /> any man could go before that Commission and argue that his conditions of service had been materially worsened as a result of this Bill.  It was further argued on this Bill that there was ambiguity in its context, and that that ambiguity might flow to interference by the Minister with the autonomy of the National University of Ireland.  If my recollection serves me well, that contention was argued with force and eloquence for the greater part of an hour.  I desire now to say that in our opinion, by no stretch of the imagination, can such an interpretation be fairly put on the Bill.  There is in it in our opinion, a section specifically providing that no attack and no interference could be made with the internal administration of the University.  Now I come to the speech delivered by Deputy McGilligan.  Stripped of its vituperation&mdash;and it is not always easy to divest Deputy McGilligan's speeches of vituperation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I listened to Deputy McGilligan with great attention, and I must say that so far as I was concerned I found nothing in his speech calculated to prove that or to bear that out.  He made an interesting suggestion towards the end of his speech.  I do not know whether it is in order now to refer to it.  He said that the economies which this Bill proposed, or at least he implied that the economies which this Bill proposed, could have been more properly secured by recourse to an increase in the income tax or an alteration in the incidence of the income tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I pass on. Deputy McGilligan went on to say in the case of civil servants that not only had their statutory rights under the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act of 1929 been denied, but that there was in this Bill a manifest breach of contract.  Deputy MacDermot dealt with that at an earlier stage on the debate.  I cannot imagine that any reasonable person will contend that it is fair to say that the basic salary at which a civil servant is employed is in any sense a contractual matter, and that it is not open to the Government of the day, at any time they see fit, to alter the basis of remuneration in accordance with public policy.  Certainly, the alternative contention is one that we would not be prepared to accept.  So far as the Bill is concerned on the whole, we are glad that the Government has put its hand to the business of economy. We only hope that in the future this Government and its successor will keep before them the view that is enshrined in this Bill, that it is not <Col N="1118" /> good policy for the State to take to itself the distribution of larger and larger sums of money which must be extracted from the pockets of the taxpayer; that it is not good policy to build up in this country a larger and larger bureaucracy which results in the ranks of our Civil Service growing until we have a personnel of about 23,000 people, including temporary and permanent officials and exclusive of all those persons who are engaged as artisans and labourers or persons indirectly in the Government employ. So far as we are concerned, we are prepared to help the Government on any occasion when they put their hands to the task of public economy, and we hope that they may shape their policy with a view to doing something, and something very material and substantial, to take off the sum of public expenditure all of what they have put on in the course of the last 12 months and a little more, and that they will shape their policy steadily towards the reduction of national expenditure in order to provide an opportunity for the people who have to make their living in the country of living here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Fifth Stage of this Bill, I suppose one may look back on the road we have travelled and I, as the person upon whom fell the responsibility and the duty of sponsoring this Bill in the House, may reflect that scarcely ever, I think, has so much odium been heaped upon one sinful head.  In this debate I have been accused, virtually, of every crime in the calendar.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has invoked the Ten Commandments against me and told me that what was being done in this Bill was crying to Heaven for vengeance.  Deputy Norton, after having made two speeches on the Report Stage, seizes the opportunity on the Fifth Stage of this Bill to repeat an attack which he made in his second speech on the Fourth Stage of the measure.  He said that I had not, in the course of this debate, distinguised myself by accuracy nor even by fair methods of debate in connection with this Bill.  He said that with special <Col N="1119" /> reference, I think, to two things: the first, my statement that in connection with the proposed deductions from the amounts paid to scaled sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses it would not be necessary to have a separate investigation into each particular case before we were able to determine what part of these payments might properly be regarded as recoupment of expenses, and what part of the amount paid to scaled sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses might be regarded as personal remuneration.</P>
      <P>I said on the Fourth Stage that Deputy Norton, in a characteristic way, had been careful to mislead this House, as always.  Naturally, when a man has to make the best of a bad case he makes the best of a bad case and, in the course of his speech supporting an amendment which he had down to this measure and which was defeated, the purpose of which was to exclude scaled sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses from the scope of this Bill, Deputy Norton gave as a typical example the case of a person who might be in receipt of £18 or £20 per annum for keeping a post office.  He did not tell the House, however, that that payment was made, not for any real operative work that the person who kept the office might do, but more properly as the rental for part of a counter space and for the comparatively easy tasks that the renting of that space imposed upon the individual who made the rental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said then, and I repeat now, that Deputy Norton was as well aware as I was that it would not be necessary to make an individual examination, nor to say whether of that £18 or £20, £5, £10, or £15 might properly be chargeable for expenses, because he knew as well as I knew that every three years all these sub-post offices are assessed in terms of the units of work turned out by them; that every stamp sold, every postal order given out, every telegraph message delivered, and every telephone message accepted is in a definite schedule at so many units of work, and that the remuneration subsequently paid to these sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses is determined by the <Col N="1120" /> number of units of work that passed through their offices in the preceding three years.  Deputy Norton knows as well as I do that this survey goes on continuously throughout the Twenty-Six Counties, so that in any given instance you can always say what the given output of work was in any office, and Deputy Norton knows that when payment for this unit of work was first laid down, there were two components of it, one representing the payment for personal service, and the other representing the payment in recoupment of expenses.  That merely necessitates looking up the original basis upon which the value of a unit of work was determined, and making the necessary assessment without having to carry out an individual investigation throughout the post offices of the Free State, and that is the manner in which we propose to proceed.</P>
    <P>The second charge levelled by Deputy Norton against me was framed in these words on the Fifth Stage of this Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is not the only instance I can give of the Minister's inaccuracy.  It has become more illuminating since we last discussed this Bill.  Under the Bill, national teachers will be cut, in very definite defiance of the guarantee given to the national teachers by the President.  On the Report Stage the Minister for Finance, speaking in opposition to an amendment moved by me to exempt salaries below £400 from the operation of the cut in respect of the teaching profession, made a definite statement.  Resisting that amendment the Minister for Finance said: &lsquo;The President's speech in Rathmines on this Bill was made there in my presence.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Norton say that statement was inaccurate?  Deputy Davin has come into the House now.  It was in a statement made by Deputy Davin, possibly in the heat of debate, that this matter originated.  Deputy Davin suffers, if I may say so, possibly from the same fault as myself; in the heat of debate he is given a little to overstatement. We both have a rather <Col N="1121" /> fervid imagination.  At any rate, I certainly thought I should draw the line when I was told that on January 29th, during a meeting which virtually opened the election campaign in my constituency, at which the President of the Executive Council was speaking, I was assuring the people at a meeting somewhere down the country that we would not cut the teachers, whereas I was on the platform listening to the statement the President was making. I ventured, first of all, to correct the inaccuracy of Deputy Davin's statement that I was down the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say the same night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes.  I, at any rate, understood the Deputy to imply that on the very night that the President was making this announcement in Rathmines I was somewhere else down the country.  I have already endeavoured to point out, as I endeavoured to point out in the debate on the Fourth Stage, in this passage to which Deputy Norton referred in his speech on the Fifth Stage, that I was not down the country, but was, in fact, in Rathmines Town Hall, and that I heard what the President said.  I went on to say that when the President, in making the statement at the time, referred to public services, it was quite clear from the context of his remarks that the only people he had in mind were the civil servants. I said, mark the words, &ldquo;When the President, in making the statement at the time, referred to public services, it was quite clear from the context of his remarks that the only people he had in mind were the civil servants.  I have here the actual words of the President on that occasion: &ldquo;With regard to the smaller salaries of £300 or £400 I hold that those in receipt of them are getting nothing excessive. Those were not the salaries I had in mind to cut.&rdquo;  He was dealing with the cuts on the civil servants, and not on the teachers.  In that speech, delivered on 29th January, 1932, I say he had not them in mind.  It was quite clear from the context that he had not then in mind the salaries of the teachers.  If Deputy Norton were <Col N="1122" /> here I would ask him to show me the inaccuracy in my statement, when I said that.</P>

      <P>One moment now. All in good time.  Then Deputy Norton went on to say, &ldquo;Logic chopping will not save the Minister's reputation on this Bill; it has been badly sullied and badly stained already.  Subsequent to that remark, by the Minister, I quoted the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; on the morning of the General Election&mdash;a very significant date.&rdquo;  And I said: &ldquo;Nineteen days after the speech.&rdquo;  I like, if I can, to be exact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I like, if I can, to be exact, and I certainly cannot, in my own mind, conceive how any person would think that a speech made at a public meeting in a town hall on 29th January, 1932, was one and the same thing as a statement which appeared in the Press on the morning of the General Election of February 16th, 1932. My remark on the Fourth Stage of this Bill had no reference to that statement which appeared on the morning of the General Election.  It refers only, as is quite clear from the Official Report, to the speech which was delivered in the Town Hall in Rathmines.  It is not my reputation that is sullied; it is not my record that is stained.  It is merely the case which Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin were making which is being damaged by that sort of misrepresentation. It is characteristic of them, and is very significant that, so far as their opposition to this Bill and its application to the teachers is concerned, they referred to the statement which was made on the morning of the General Election, 1932.  They were quite silent about the endeavours that were made to exact a similar pledge during the General Election of 1933, and the very significant fact that no such pledge was given during the General Election of 1933.  The President and every member of the Government came back here with a free hand in regard to the national teachers, at any rate, and in every pronouncement <Col N="1123" /> which the President made on that matter he was careful to say and to make clear that, while he was quite prepared to abide by the spirit of the declaration of 1932, he was not prepared to give any pledge or any undertaking without special consideration and consultation with the Minister for Finance.  That is the truth of the matter.  All those allegations of broken pledges of sullied records and stained honour, are based upon what was published during the General Election of 1932.  Those who made those charges have been very silent about what happened during the General Election of 1933, when, with the full knowledge of the financial position which we were in and of the sacrifices that might have to be made during the present year, the President refused before the election to be bound by pledges like those which had been given during the election of 1932.</P>

      <P>Each election and each Dáil stands by itself, and Deputy Davin knows that as well as I do. When a Government goes to the country, and goes on a definite programme and on nothing else, it comes back with responsibilities and obligations in regard to that programme, and it is not fettered in any other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I am on this question of the national teachers, because I said that one of the justifications we had for imposing this cut was that the national teachers themselves had accepted a heavier cut from our predecessors, in times which were much less serious than these, I have been told that an attempt is being made to draw an analogy between that and the Secret Agreement of 1923. Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin took that line, but there is no similarity and no parallel between the agreement of 1923 and the agreement which was made by the teachers in December, 1931, to accept a heavier cut than we have been compelled&mdash;failing any <Col N="1124" /> agreement from them, failing any attempt to meet us in the national emergency&mdash;to impose upon them under this Bill.  It has been said that, after all, if they did withdraw from that undertaking, and break that contract, we also are trying to do that in regard to the agreements of 1923 and 1926. The position is altogether different, as Deputy Davin knows.  Representatives of the natioual teachers went into conference with the then Minister for Finance and the then Minister for Education, and they came forward and offered voluntarily to accept a cut of 9 per cent. in view of the financial situation which existed in 1931. They came forward and they made that as a voluntary offer, and as a gesture of good will to the then Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the pension fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the pension fund later.  I am sure my reference to it will be in order, because it also was referred to.  That offer was rejected by our predecessors as being insufficient.  A proposal to inflict a heavier cut on the teachers was then made.  I have here in front of me cuttings from the newspapers describing the excursions and alarms with which the position was then viewed by the national teachers.  I have here a cutting from the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; of the 8th December, 1931, and the headings are &ldquo;National Teachers Perturbed,&rdquo;&ldquo;Members of the Executive Meet Ministers,&rdquo;&ldquo;Serious View of Position,&rdquo;&ldquo;Minimum Salary Reduction may be 15 per cent.&rdquo;  It was not 15 per cent.; it was 10 per cent.&mdash;a reduction in pension and salary of 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal was taken back by the then members of the National Teachers' Executive, considered by them and, as a result of the consideration, a notice appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Independant&rdquo; on the 7th December, 1931.  I will ask Deputies to note the significance of the date.  This is the advertisement which appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo;: &ldquo;Irish National Teachers Organisation.  All branch secretaries in Saorstát Eireann are hereby directed to summon special meetings of <Col N="1125" /> their branches for Saturday next, December 12th, to consider a communication from the head office and to appoint delegates to a special conference which will be held in Dublin on Saturday, December 19th.&rdquo;  I said the date of that was significant.  It was dated 7th December, 1931.  This pronouncement, with heavy leading, appeared in the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; on December 8th, 1931, and it was quite clearly indicated to the teachers that the purpose for which they were to select delegates to the conference was to consider a proposal to reduce their salaries.</P>
    <P>They came to that conference knowing, at any rate, what they were going to discuss, and the purpose for which they were being selected and sent to Dublin.  They did not come to the conference blindfolded.  There was no attempt at secrecy.  They knew exactly what was going to be done, and they came with a full mandate from those who nominated them.  The delegate conference duly assembled.  I think it assembled either on Saturday, 19th December, or on Sunday, 20th December. At any rate, in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; on the 21st December there appeared this announcement: &ldquo;Teachers Accept the Cut.  Dublin Conference Result.&rdquo;  That was the heading, and then it goes on to state: &ldquo;The Conference, which was held in private, lasted from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m.  At the conclusion the following official statement was issued: &lsquo;That in view of the existing economic and financial position in the Saorstát, this conference agrees to accept the proposals submitted to our Executive by the Government.&rsquo;&rdquo;  If ever there was an organised body of men bound by a decision, taken with full knowledge of what they were called upon to decide, it was the Irish National Teachers' Organisation when they decided to accept a cut of 10 per cent. from our predecessors.  It is significant that the National Teachers' Organisation did not repudiate that until the following April, after the change of Government. They accepted it, and I think this must be remembered, that they accepted it in view of the existing economic and financial position in the Saorstát&mdash;the <Col N="1126" /> economic and financial position which existed in December, 1931.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate, among the other statements that have been ascribed to me and other members of the Government is the statement that I wrote letters to the newspapers criticising the cut and condemning the teachers for accepting the cut.  I have asked Deputies who referred to these letters and dealt with them at length to produce the letters and read them here.  Deputy Norton, on the Committee Stage or on the Fourth Stage of the Bill said he would come furnished with them on the following morning and that he would produce them here to my confusion.</P>

      <P>Is there a word in them about the 10 per cent. cut?  I have the letters here and there is not a word in them about the 10 per cent. cut.  The heading of one letter, which appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; on the 18th January, 1932, was &ldquo;The Pension Fund.&rdquo;  One which appeared on January 23rd, 1932, was headed &ldquo;The Teachers' Pension Fund.&rdquo;  At that time I did criticise the proposal to hand over the Teachers' Pension Fund to the tender mercy of my predecessor. Mr. Sharkey, who was then the advocate for the teachers in this matter, charged me with having developed a deep and perhaps not disinterested anxiety in the fate of this bankrupt fund and he alleged that I had an interest in keeping the pension <Col N="1127" /> fund out of the grip of Mr. Blythe.  My reply to that was, &ldquo;I deny that the fund is altogether bankrupt.  I emphatically plead guilty, however, to having a not altogether disinterested anxiety in the fate of the fund and to having an interest in keeping it out of the grip of Mr. Blythe, and all of this for the following very good reasons ...&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not, but I heard what he said about me.  It is contained in Deputy Norton's speech.  I think I have shown there is very little foundation for any charges or allegations that Deputy Norton, Deputy Davin, Mr. Sharkey or any other person may bring against me of broken faith.  There will not be anything of the sort found, at any rate, in these letters&mdash;anything to show that I at that time opposed the imposition of a 10 per cent. cut on the teachers.  I did quite frankly&mdash;because I knew there was a feeling among the teachers themselves on the matter&mdash;oppose the handing over of the Teachers' Pension Fund to my predecessor.  I have not taken over the fund yet.</P>
      <P>One of the criticisms levelled against our proposal is that it makes no provision for dealing with the pension fund. That is quite so.  But no reasonable suggestion has emanated from the teachers as to how this pension fund should be dealt with.  They took up the attitude that it is entirely our responsibility. I deny that, and our predecessors denied it.  I think the records will prove that wherever the responsibility may lie it is not solely the responsibility of the Government, and I am not prepared to say either that it is solely the responsibility of the teachers.  It is not solely our responsibility. They have responsibility for the position of the fund.  They also have a great and abiding interest in the future of the fund.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald is making a clear point.  I am waiting to see how far the Minister is endeavouring to carry out his intent. The Minister said there is not anything having any connection with the pensions fund in this Bill.  I ruled that the pensions fund cannot be discussed.  Referring to salaries, and referring to them with other matters associated with the salaries question. is merely a subterfuge for the purpose of introducing the pensions question.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon, I am referring to salaries.  One of the criticisms made by the Labour Party against this Bill is that the deductions proposed in it might be temporary.  I think that is the line Deputy Dillon takes, and that others would take.  It might be, from the point of view of some people, advocated in the Bill.  On this question of national teachers' salaries and as to settlement upon a permanent basis, they must send people prepared to treat, and to come to a final settlement at a council table; it is not necessary to say more.  Otherwise we will be prepared to take our own measures and deal with the problem in our own way.</P>
      <P>Now I come to the civil servants. There has been no charge, from the Labour Benches, at any rate, that we have broken faith with the civil servants. There has been some criticism from the Cumann na nGaedheal benches on the proposals to cut the salaries of civil servants.  Of course, there is also criticism of our proposal to cut the Guards and the national teachers, notwithstanding that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party proposed to do that and to follow out that course if they had been returned to office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Guards never signified their assent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that in due course.  But what surprised me was that certain members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party should have been satisfied with the deductions in the Bill from civil servants' salaries.  Deputy Belton, for instance, who unfortunately is absent at the moment, made many speeches in violent opposition to the proposal to reduce the salaries of civil servants. I must say that it came as something of a surprise and a shock to me to hear him make those speeches.  I have here the &ldquo;Civil Service Journal&rdquo; and I find that on September 15th, Deputy <Col N="1131" /> Belton was so impressed that one-twentieth of the country's income was required to carry on the economic war that he said let the Government impose a 20 per cent. imposition on the salaries of all civil servants, university professors, and others.  On September 15th, Deputy Belton was advocating a cut of 20 per cent. in the salaries of civil servants, university professors and others.  And the others, of course, included teachers, Guards and members of the National University.  No one will accuse Deputy Belton of consistency, but they might, if they listen to him here speaking so many times on this Bill, accuse him of an undue and unusual persistency.  I would like to hear him defending his retreat from the position he took up in September 1931. Of course, asking Deputy Belton to defend his change of front is like asking a weather-cock to excuse itself for turning round with every wind that blows.  I am rather surprised, as I have said, that the Deputy did not get up and endeavour to give effect to the principles which he enunciated on 15th September, 1931, when he was endeavouring, as he always does in every Party, to become leader of the then newly-born Farmers' Party. They say that coming events cast their shadows before.  Possibly that is the reason why Deputy Belton evinces a sort of longing to occupy the seat that is occupied by Deputy Fitzgerald at present.  The House will have noticed that when Deputy Cosgrave is absent Deputy Belton seizes the opportunity to occupy his seat to enjoy the momentary prominence that falls upon an occupant of that position in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was saying that no person could accuse the Government of breaking their pledges in regard to the Civil Service.  We did say that we did not propose to impose any super-cut upon the civil servants whose salaries were of the order of £300 or £400.  But we have been accused of breaking pledges to the transferred officers.  In connection with the transferred officers and with the civil servants generally and, indeed, with all the public servants <Col N="1132" /> who are affected by this Bill, there has been on the part of members of the Opposition many covert incitements&mdash;incitements, to disloyalty, incitements to treachery, incitements to mutiny, incitements to disaffection of all sorts.  We had Deputy O'Sullivan getting up and, with that hypocrisy which one must on this question associate continuously with the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, saying that he did not think there was any danger of sabotage.  He then employed very subtly the weapon of suggestion to create, if he could, discontent in the service by saying: &ldquo;But even if there was no decided purpose not to give the same service as was given before, the actual discontent existing in the service, at the unfair terms imposed, is bound, taking human nature as it is, to act on the efficiency of the service given to the Government. It is only human nature that it should be so.&rdquo;  Deputy Costello pursued the same line of argument as did also Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, Deputy Davin and the others.</P>
    <P>Now I think it should be made quite clear that if these cuts are imposed the Government will not tolerate any slackness in any branch of the public service.  I do not believe that the great majority of the public servants would for a moment be affected by these covert incitements, but there may be men who will be misled by them. and if there are, Deputy Costello, Deputy O'Sullivan or Deputy Davin will not be powerful enough to defend them from the consequences of that disloyalty.  We have heard about the effect on the Guards and on this one and on that one, and about the necessity for placating this public servant and that public servant.  Any public servant in this State will have loyally to abide by the conditions prescribed for him within the service of the State by the Government of the State.  If he does not, he will have to find employment elsewhere. That goes for everybody, because there are any amount of able young men who would be very glad to step into their places at present and give just as loyal service as any existing public servant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> Deputy Costello in the course of his speech said: &ldquo;We have our international responsibilities and also our national responsibilities.  We have our duties as well as our rights in reference to other members of the family of nations.  As I said, during the various stages of this Bill, we will in the course of our discussions on economic matters, not to talk about political matters, be up against the best political brains and the best financial brains in the world, and if our problems are to be solved, if we are to get the best that can be got out of these discussions and negotiations which will inevitably have to take place, then we must have the best brains we can get, and we must pay the best salary we can afford for these brains.&rdquo;  With the last sentence I am in the fullest agreement, but I am not in agreement with the implication there, that the people who are at present in the service of the State have a monopoly of the brains, have a monopoly of the zeal, have a monopoly of the ability, or of patriotism, or of enthusiasm.  I do not want to be taken as reflecting at all upon the present public servants.  There is no man who has better reason to be grateful to the present public servants than I have.  I know how well and how loyally they have served me.  No tribute that I could pay to them would be too high.  But I am not going to accept the position, and I do not think the country is going to be fooled into accepting the position, that in the public service at the present time there is a monopoly of the brains, a monopoly of the enthusiasm, a monopoly of the energy, or a monopoly of the ability in this country.  There are just as good men outside the Guards, outside the Civil Service, outside the ranks of the national teachers, outside the ranks of the post office, and if there is any question of disloyalty, if any person is misguided enough to take the statements of Deputy O'Sullivan and the others at their face value, these people are going to find themselves very sorely let down.</P>
    <P>Another statement made during the course of the debate has been that we <Col N="1134" /> were breaking some sort of pledge that was given to the members of the Gárda Síochána by our predecessors.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, Deputy Davin, Deputy Costello, Deputy Corish and Deputy Murphy, all in one form or another repeated that statement.  But of all of them Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney did himself and his Party the least credit.  The statement has been made that this decision to cut the pay of the Gárda Síochána in 1931-32 was a tentative decision only.  That is not so, and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney knows it.  He knows that a pay order was prepared for submission to the Representative Body of the Gárda Síochána and that the moment that pay order had been submitted to them the cuts became effective.  There was no such thing as a provisional pay order.  It was a gun ready loaded to go off at the moment the Representative Body could be called together.  The Representative Body of the Gárda Síochána knew that so perfectly and so well that rather than be called together and permit that pay order to be promulgated and made effective the Representative Body dissolved itself by every member of it handing in his resignation.  That is the only reason why the cut was not put into force in January, 1932&mdash;this cut of 5 per cent. upon the Gárda Síochána, a much heavier cut than we proposed to impose on them.  Because, mark you, more than half of the ranks of the Gárda Síochána will be excluded altogether from any reduction in pay under this Bill.  Those in the Gárda Síochána who are married men, and who enjoy special allowances because they are married men, are going scot free under the Bill.  It is only the single men whose pay is being cut.  Under our predecessor's proposal every member of the Gárda Síochána, whether married or single, whether he had family responsibility or not, would have been cut, and only, as I said before, that the Gárda Representative Body, by dissolving itself, defeated the purpose of the Government, those cuts would have been in operation in March of 1932, when we first took office, and we would not now have had the necessity of coming to the Dáil to get these <Col N="1135" /> special powers to impose these cuts.  It was denied by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that the original pay orders promulgated to the Gárda had any reference whatever to the cost of living.  I read for the House, on, I think, the Committee Stage of the Bill, the original memorandum which accompanied that pay order and it was quite clear, on the text of that memorandum that the pay of the Gárda Síochána was definitely related to the cost-of-living figure.  Deputy Corish and, I think, Deputies Davin and Murphy said that pledges were given to the Gárda by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, when he was Minister for Justice, and ex-Deputy Blythe, when he was Minister for Finance, that the pay of the Gárda Síochána had reached bedrock.  Here are the exact words of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney on this matter.  Speaking in the debate on the Gárda Síochána (Allowances) Order, 1929, on 8th May, 1929, as reported in Vol. 29, Cols. 1660-1661 of the Official Debates&mdash;and he might have been me defending this Temporary Economies Bill in the House&mdash; he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have before me the memorandum which accompanied the penultimate order and it is this:&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>almost my exact words</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not proposed that the rates of pay of the force should be subject to variation to meet trifling or temporary fluctuations in the cost of living, and the rates now proposed are based on the cost-of-living figure of 85 (above pre-War) and are intended to be applicable while the cost-of-living figure varies from 70 at the lower limit to 100 at the higher limit (above pre-War).  These rates will accordingly be subject to readjustment if the cost-of-living figure passes outside that range.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With these words, the quotation from this memorandum which accompanied, in the words of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, the penultimate order, ended. He went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has not passed outside that range.  That is the promise made by my predecessor.  That is a promise, <Col N="1136" /> as I have told the Representative Body of the Civic Guard, that will be honourably observed.  The rates of pay of the Civic Guard will not be altered, and I take it that since that is a promise made by a responsible Executive, that promise must be binding on all future Executives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking later in the same debate, Mr. Blythe, the then Minister for Finance, took up the running and said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But, obviously, if something occurred which caused the cost of living to come down 25 or 30 points a new situation would be created and the value of the pay on the present scales would be very considerably increased if that happened.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it must be clear from these words that there was no undertaking of the nature implied by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney or by Deputy Corish, Deputy Davin or Deputy Murphy in the course of their speeches given to the Gárda Síochána in the debate which took place in May of 1929, and, therefore, in proposing the deductions which are to be made under this Bill we are not breaking any pledges which were given to the members of the Gárda Síochána and, as I have said already, we are, in fact, treating them with much more consideration than that with which they would have been treated by our predecessors if they had been in office and not we.  I do not know whether it is necessary for me to say any more on this matter.  I have kept the House at some length, but the misrepresentations to which we have been subjected have been so many and so varied that were I to take up every point that was raised in the various speeches that have been made in the course of this debate I am afraid my speech would become almost interminable, and certainly, much less endurable than I think it has been.</P>
    <P>There is, however, just one statement made by Deputy Dillon on which I should like to join issue.  He has implied that these cuts are imposed because we made a declaration of war.  I think that to talk like that is to talk in terms of overemphasis. There has been an economic dispute between ourselves and a neighbouring country.  We have each endeavoured <Col N="1137" /> to assert and maintain our rights but we have done nothing more than to endeavour to assert and maintain our rights.  We have not endeavoured to take anything that does not justly belong to us or to keep anything that does not justly belong to us.  There need have been no war and there would have been no war if only the people on the other side of the water had been prepared to submit this issue to the arbitration of an international court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why it is necessary that what is in the Bill should be given effect to by the House is that we have to balance our Budget.  Statements have been made during the course of the debate that, if it were not for certain circumstances, it would be possible for us to balance our Budget without inflicting the sacrifices that this Bill proposes.  I deny that, and I say to Deputy Dillon or any other Deputy who has that point of view that, even if there were not the disturbances in our trade that exist, it would probably be necessary for us to do something of this nature on account of the general decline in world trade and the general depression that exists in world conditions, apart altogether from what has arisen or from what may have been occasioned arising out of the dispute with another country.  That, to my mind, has got nothing to do with it.  We have asked every class of taxpayer to make certain sacrifices in order to help us to carry on the public services in the conditions in which we find them existing at the present day. I do not believe that the disturbance to which Deputy Dillon has referred has at all affected the finances of the State in the way which he implied.  I think that its reactions on our finances have been very much less serious than he considers and I feel that what is in the Bill would still be necessary whether that quarrel existed or whether it did not.  I must say, however, that I have a great deal of sympathy with the point of view he expressed&mdash;that one way in which we might get economies would be if we could make some reorganisation of the public service.  That is an idea that appeals to me.  It is an idea that I know appeals to many members of the <Col N="1139" /> Government.  We have taken over a machine from another country.  We have had rather hastily to adapt it to our own needs, and I am sure there must be many anachronisms, many survivals of old time procedure that possibly could be dispensed with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring at all to personnel but to procedure that possibly could be dispensed with if we had time to overhaul the machine.  But, as we are at present, we are working full time putting through an economic policy and we have to work with the instrument that we have at hand until, at any rate, we have laid the basis of a general change and the foundations of the new economy.  When we have that <Col N="1140" /> done we shall have time then, I hope, to bring in specialists from outside to co-operate with the best brains in the Civil Service to see whether we cannot improve the machine we have taken over so that the cost of it will be in proportion to our resources.  I am not putting this Bill forward at all as a permanent substitute for the overhaul of the Civil Service, which, I believe, must be undertaken at as early a date as possible, but what I am saying is that in our present circumstances when we have not time to stop the machine in order to overhaul it, to remould and to remodel it.  We think, therefore, that this Bill must go through because it is necessary if the State is to continue to function properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan (Minister for Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was compelled to move the adjournment about a fortnight ago, I think, I had been asked to deal with the question of foreign markets.  It was owing to the fact that the time had arrived for moving the adjournment that I did not get an opportunity of dealing with the question at that time.  First of all, a question arose with regard to the British market.  Whatever we may think about the British market, whether it is the best market that we can have, or otherwise, I think it must be admitted that the British market is going to be a declining market for this country, whether we have an end to the economic war or not, because the British Government have decided on a policy of restricting imports.  If they are not diminishing imports from the Dominions, at least, they got an undertaking from the various Dominions that their exports of different commodities would not be increased in future.  As a matter of fact, they have tried to get an undertaking from them that they would reduce their exports of certain commodities to the British markets in future.  It is, of course, only commonsense to expect that the British Government would come to that conclusion with regard to their own country because they have embarked <Col N="1143" /> on a policy of developing their own agriculture.  If they are to develop their own agriculture they must naturally look for a greater market at home for their products.  In order to encourage their people to produce more they are endeavouring to increase prices by restricting imports.  In the first place, they are restricting imports for the sake of encouraging their own agriculture, and in the second place, I think it would be found if we examine the British trade statistics that over a period there has been a tendency towards declining exports.  If their exports are declining they must naturally curtail their imports.  So that we can agree, I think, that if we are to increase agricultural production here&mdash;and as I already said, Deputy O'Sullivan on the other side pointed out that the policy we were pursuing would eventually lead to an increase in agricultural output if we succeed in getting increased tillage&mdash;we must find other markets than Great Britain, whatever relations we may have with Great Britain in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings us to the question of foreign markets.  We must seek these alternative markets unless our home market expands very rapidly and unexpectedly.  Take the question of foreign markets outside Great Britain.  In the first place we had foreign markets to a certain extent already.  The charge is made sometimes by our opponents that we cannot get foreign markets.  Alternatively, they say that if we do succeed in getting them, it is only because we have brought prices so low that foreigners can come in and purchase our products.  At any rate, there were some markets outside Great Britain for some years.  There were certain commodities this country had been sending abroad, not alone to the Continent but to America.  There was, for many years, a limited market for butter outside Great Britain.  There was also a market for other milk products. As a matter of fact our condensed milk factory in Limerick for the year 1932 has exported 50 per cent. of its output to markets outside Great Britain.  The condensed milk factory <Col N="1144" /> in Limerick is a very big concern.  We had also for many years limited markets for bacon, ham, horses, wool, and other things, outside Great Britain.  When we came into power it was a question of holding these markets for our products, and increasing them, and, if possible, finding markets in other places.  We have been, at least, to a certain extent successful in doing so, perhaps not as successful as we had hoped, but I would say much more successful than our opponents thought when we assumed office. If I were not in the position of being afraid to trust my opponents in this House, with certain information about the markets we have got on the Continent for certain products, which are likely to turn out very well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, they are not.  As soon as they are properly established these markets will be open to anyone to develop.  I repeat that I am in the position in this House that, if I were to give information at this particular moment, my opponents, who are at all times ready to score a political victory at the expense of the country, would not be above sabotage in this instance also.</P>

      <P>It is.  I do not know if it is altogether the word I want, but people know what I mean.  However, the fact is that we have succeeded in getting markets for many of our agricultural products in many Continental countries, and if we could only develop these markets, and make as much progress as we have been making, we will have solved the difficulty that may arise at any time, whether we are here or whether the other Party are back here, with friendly relations with <Col N="1145" /> Great Britain, when the quota system comes in.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming to the matters that arose on the debate, Deputy Hogan spoke of the disadvantages, perhaps, of the Live-stock Breeding Act. The Deputy stated that before he left the Department of Agriculture he had felt for some time that, if things go on as they are under that Act, it will be very hard before long to get a good milking cow in this country.  I do not think the Deputy put his finger on the real cause.  As a matter of fact what is responsible for that is, that the Department has found it very difficult to get people, especially in the West of Ireland, to take premium bulls of the Shorthorn class.  They have been much more anxious to get Aberdeen Angus and Herefords.  People who know anything <Col N="1146" /> about the breeding of cattle know that in-breeding of the Shorthorn breed, Aberdeen Angus, and Herefords is designed to conduce to milk production. The Department has tried to help in various ways.  As a matter of fact they have tried to push the Shorthorn breed as much as possible, but their powers are limited in that respect and, in the end they must bow to the wishes of the persons concerned, or to the county committees of agriculture. We have also tried to encourage milk testing societies.  Where there is what is known as an ear-marked calf, when the animal comes to be examined for a licence as a bull he generally gets preference over another calf, not ear-marked, where conformity and so on would be equal in both cases.  Another Deputy stated that the Department had not given as much for milk testing societies this year as in previous years.  That is not true.  The Estimate showed that while the amount voted was less than in previous years, the real fact is that the number of societies has been going down.  For the last two years the Department voted a greater sum per cow entered in the milk testing societies but, as the numbers were going down, the Estimate appeared to be less than in previous years.  The amount was 1/- in previous years, but it went up to 2/- this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if he has any proposals with regard to Shorthorns, so as to correct the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say that I have proposals, but I think the matter will certainly be considered before the scheme for next year is announced, so as to give preference, perhaps, to premiums for Shorthorn bulls.  Deputy O'Donovan stated that there was no necessity at all for this Estimate, and expressed the opinion that it would be better if the gross amount of it was given directly to the farmers, rather than being spent on the upkeep of the Department.  Like others who spoke in that way, the Deputy had a complaint to make about the amount spent under some heads.  He went on to <Col N="1147" /> complain that the amount for flax growing had been reduced.  He also raised a question which, I believe, is raised annually, regarding Clydesdale stallions for County Cork.  With regard to that, the Department have had a policy for some years.  The Department think that the Clydesdale breed of horse should not be encouraged here, that the old Irish draught is more suited to the needs of this country and that Irish draughts should be encouraged, as well as pure breds for the breeding of hunters and, if you like, racers.  The Department are of opinion that for ordinary farm work we should encourage the Irish draught.  Personally, I agree with that.  I have seen Irish draughts working again and again against Clydesdales.  The Irish draughts did as good a day's work as the Clydesdales and were just as fresh in the evening.  The only difference is that the Clydesdale will eat twice as much as the Irish draught when put out on grass.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary made a speech, which was rather a novelty, as he has been the most persistent interrupter here for the last 18 months.  This was, I think, the only speech he made during that period.  All he had to say was that the hens and pigs were hungry because they had to live on home-grown grain.</P>

It is the usual complaint with Cumann na nGaedheal speakers&mdash;that anything produced in this country cannot compare with the stuff coming in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish-grown barley or oats <Col N="1148" /> cannot compare with the foreign maize. It is the same way with everything else, including industrial products&mdash; cement and so on.  Cumann na nGaedheal speakers are always complaining of the inferior Irish stuff they have to use because of the Government's protection policy not permitting them to take in the superior foreign stuff.  Deputy O'Leary would be quite satisfied that the hens and pigs would be well fed if they had foreign maize. They would be all right if fed on maize grown in those extraordinary foreign countries&mdash;America, the Argentine and other places&mdash;but they are hungry if fed on Irish oats and barley.  That was Deputy O'Leary's contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

I do not think that it is fair to ask Deputy Keely to go down there after an interval of three or four months.  Deputy Keely beat Deputy Brodrick there three or four months ago.  He put the position before the farmers, as Deputy Brodrick did, and the farmers gave their verdict.</P>

      <P>That should be quite sufficient.  I suppose that 90 per cent. of the talk of the Opposition was about the economic war.  The day after the debate here, I came across an answer given by Major Elliott, Minister for Agriculture in Great Britain, to a question put in the British House of Commons by Lieutenant-Colonel Acland Troyte as to the price of fat cattle then and at the corresponding <Col N="1149" /> period last year.  Major Elliott replied that the average price per cwt. live weight for first-quality fat cattle for the week ended 17th May at markets in respect of which the Ministry obtains reports was 40/10 as compared with 49/10 for the corresponding week of 1932.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I have to say that, just like Deputies of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and of the Centre Party, I should like to see a successful end to the economic war.
