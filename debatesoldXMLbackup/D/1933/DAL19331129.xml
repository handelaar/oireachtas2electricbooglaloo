      <P>The question as to the position of the statutory corporations and bodies to which the Deputy's question refers has, as the Deputy is aware, occupied the attention of the Departments concerned over a long period.  These statutory corporations and bodies fall into two groups, illustrated, respectively, by the examples given in the Deputy's question, namely, the Erne Drainage Board and the Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners.  As regards bodies belonging to the first group and still <Col N="516" /> functioning, such administrative difficulties as have arisen from time to time have been dealt with, as far as possible, by co-operation between the two Governments.  With regard to bodies belonging to the second group, namely, the Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners and the Carlingford Lough Commissioners, the position was the subject of discussions with the British Government and the Government of Northern Ireland in the year 1928, but no decision was reached.</P>
      <P>Detailed investigations as to the position with regard to all the statutory corporations and bodies referred to in the Deputy's question are at present taking place in the Departments concerned.</P>

No member of the additional police force was taken off the special duty of investigating the offences referred to in the question. No useful purpose would be served by an attempt to make a separate estimate of the cost of this particular piece of police duty.</P>

      <P>At the City of Dublin Circuit Court on the 5th February, 1930, Archibald Doyle pleaded guilty to the charge of possession of a revolver or pistol with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, and was also found guilty by the jury on the charge of robbery under arms, to which he had pleaded <Col N="521" />&ldquo;Not Guilty.&rdquo;  He was sentenced for each offence to ten years' penal servitude, to run concurrently.  This sentence was subsequently reduced to one of five years' penal servitude, the remission being one of those granted on the occasion of the Eucharistic Congress held in Dublin in 1932.</P>
      <P>Having regard to this remission and to the ordinary remission earned for industry and good conduct under the prison rules, Doyle was eligible for release on the 21st October in the present year.  He was actually released, however, on 12th April last, having then served a period of three years, 82 days.  The release took place in deference to strong representations made to me by a deputation of members of this House.  I am not aware that any other person was convicted in connection with the robbery in which Doyle was implicated and, accordingly, the portion of the question dealing with the sentences inflicted on such other persons does not appear to arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer both questions together.  Persons carrying on or proposing to carry on manufactures frequently consult with the Department as to whether their operations require a licence under Section 2 of the Control of Manufactures Act.  Arising out of such consultations or independently of them the Department has investigated some 500 manufacturing undertakings, covering a great variety of manufactures, for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are carried on in conformity with the section.  In the great majority of cases the undertakings have been voluntarily brought into conformity with the law.  There has been no prosecution under the section, but the matter of a prosecution in some few cases is under consideration.  To date my Department has been successful in obtaining voluntarily information as to the nature of manufacturing undertakings without recourse to the compulsory powers under Section 11 of the Control of Manufactures Act. The final part of the second question does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <P>The amounts paid out of voted moneys on export bounties and subsidies during the financial year 1932-33 and in the present financial year to the 31st October were £1,060,830 and £1,264,786, respectively.  In the period between 1st April and 14th July, 1933, before the Vote for export bounties and subsidies was available, export bounties and subsidies to the extent of £471,170 were paid out of the Emergency Fund.  A large proportion of this amount represents payment of claims in respect of commodities exported in the financial year 1932-33 which did not mature for payment until the current financial year.  In addition, during the first two periods mentioned sums of £296,171 and £831,089 were paid out respectively in bounties on butter, etc., out of the levies collected under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act, 1932. The payments out of voted moneys for export bounties and subsidies have been made in all cases in accordance <Col N="532" /> with schemes sanctioned by me as Minister for Finance.  Full information and details of the schemes and the rates and conditions may be obtained from the Department of Agriculture in respect of agricultural bounties and from the Department of Industry and Commerce in respect of industrial bounties.  The payments out of the levies collected under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act, 1932, are made under the provisions of the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state what quantity of barley of this year's crop brought the price of 15/- per barrel, which is the price quoted in the circular issued by the Department of Agriculture dealing with agricultural conditions in Saorstát Eireann on 1st November, 1933; in how many instances was this price obtained; was any Wexford grown barley bought at this price; what does the term &ldquo;proportionate figures&rdquo; mean in the following quotation from the same circular, &ldquo;prices for white oats were from 7/- to 8/6 per barrel (4/- to 4/10 per cwt.) with black oats at proportionate figures&rdquo;; what in actual cash is the market value per barrel of this year's crop of black oats; what proportion of the black oats crop grown this year in County Wexford has found a market at any price; what steps he proposes to take to secure a market for all the black oats in County Wexford that cannot be sold this year, and what proportion of the white oats in County Wexford offered for sale to the buyers under the scheme bushelled 40 lbs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general information regarding crops and the prices obtaining for agricultural produce, which is published monthly in the report referred to in this question is collated from <Col N="543" /> reports furnished monthly to the Department of Agriculture by the instructors in agriculture for every county in Saorstát Eireann, supplemented by information furnished by special market reporters.  In the particular report referred to, the prices for barley were quoted as 13/- to 14/6 and 15/- per barrel; the latter, obviously an exceptional price, being reported from five different areas, but not from Wexford.  The prices obtainable in County Wexford since the opening of the season appear to have varied from 13/- to 13/9 per barrel.</P>
      <P>It is well-known that best white oats normally fetch a higher price than black, the difference usually varying from 1/- to 2/- per barrel according to district, although in some districts it may be more marked where the quality of the oats is comparatively poor.  It would appear from the information collected by the Statistics Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce relating to the average weekly prices at representative markets in the Saorstát, that the average price of black oats, sold between the 30th September last and the 18th inst, varied from 6/7 to 7/3 per barrel.</P>
      <P>While it is not possible to state even approximately the proportion of the crop of black oats grown in County Wexford which has been marketed, it is evident from the statistics already mentioned that sales have taken place each week since the opening of the season, as prices are quoted week by week, varying from 5/6 to 6/- per barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme recently introduced for the purchase of white oats bushelling 40 lbs. or over under a Government guarantee against loss to the merchants partaking in it was promoted with the object of relieving the pressure on the market by taking off such quantity of best quality oats for other purposes as would leave an opening for the sale of the balance of the surplus production of both white and black varieties to meet normal demands.  That scheme has been in actual operation for only a few weeks, and the first returns from the merchants, who became registered as partakers in it, showing their purchases, will not be due until the 7th <Col N="544" /> proximo.  It is not practicable, therefore, to give a definite reply to the concluding part of the question.  It is, however, known from individual instances which have come under notice that fairly considerable quantities of white oats bushelling 40 lbs. have been purchased in County Wexford, as elsewhere.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that over 12,000 tons of millers' offals have been exported from the Irish Free State for the past six months, at a price approximately 5 per cent. below that charged to Irish consumers, and if, in view of the necessity of providing farmers of the Irish Free State with cheap feeding for their stock, he will take the necessary steps to prevent any further export of these valuable feeding stuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the exports referred to, and if at any time I am satisfied that there is necessity for such action, having regard to the possible reactions arising therefrom, I will consider favourably the question of making an order prohibiting the export of wheat offals save under licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>In the question as on the Order Paper, I am represented as inquiring whether offals have been <Col N="545" /> exported at a price approximately 5 per cent. below that charged to Irish consumers.  That should be 50 per cent. below the retail price charged to Irish consumers.  The Minister will remember that the great object of the Cereals Bill was to give cheap food-stuffs to the Irish farmers.  In face of that, I think the Minister should do everything possible not only to discourage the export of these food-stuffs but to prohibit them, so that they would be available at the present time when the Irish farmer needs cheap food-stuffs so badly.  The Minister is aware that pollards went up from £3 15s. 0d. to £6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entirely wrong in his figure of 50 per cent. or even 5 per cent.  I have here in the &ldquo;Farmer and Stockbreeder&rdquo; the official prices on the exchanges in England.  In Liverpool, middlings were from 5/6 to 6/- a cwt.; bran, from 5/9 to 6/-.  In Bristol, middlings were 5/9; bran, 6/3, and straight-run bran 5/7½.  The average price of pollards and brans was from £5 10s. 0d. to £6 per ton at the exchange.  But that is not the price at which the farmer gets them.  Here, as I mentioned before, I have the latest quotation for pollard and bran delivered to my own house and it is £5 per ton.  It is quite obvious that bran and pollard are selling much more cheaply in this country than in England at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wanted to point out the export price of pollard and bran from here.  For bran, the price was 4/3 per cwt. and for pollard 3/- odd.  I got the figures from your statistics department and I shall produce them later&mdash;that is, the prices at which they were sold to Northern Ireland.</P>

After the date of the passing of this Bill they will be entitled to allowance only from the date on which they comply with the Standing Orders.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill vests in the Minister the power to close prisons. He is given that power under Section 2.  In that connection, I think the attention of the House should be drawn to the fact that the detention of convicted <Col N="567" /> persons in prisons falls under two heads: juvenile and adult offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>The Deputy will see from the Title that this Bill deals solely with the closing of prisons and with the use, control and disposal of prisons which have been closed. Therefore, any discussion on the classification of prisoners or their treatment would be irrelevant to this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is entitled: &ldquo;An Act to amend the law relating to the closing of prisons and to the use, control and disposal of prisons which have been closed, and to make provision for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.&rdquo;  The first purpose of this Bill is to amend the law relating to the closing of prisons and to other matters connected with the closing of prisons.  Section 2 of the Bill gives the Minister power to direct that any particular prison or any specified part of a particular prison shall be closed as on and from a specified date.  That is a power which he can exercise in the future.  Quite apart from this part of the Bill, it authorises the things that he may have done in the past.  I submit that on the Report Stage we are entitled to consider the adequacy of the accommodation which, at present, is at the Minister's disposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I thought it right to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, in dealing with this question, we might imagine we were dealing with every case of detention under the control of the State, and that, in imagining so, this House would be mistaken.  The House must bear in mind that, in making provisions under this Bill, they are dealing only with adult offenders and that the places of detention reserved for juvenile offenders are under the Department of Education.  A peculiar anomaly arises because, while the commission of juvenile offenders to a place of detention is within the province <Col N="568" /> of the Minister for Justice, the detention of juvenile offenders is in the province of the Minister for Education. Therefore, it becomes extremely difficult ever to find an appropriate occasion for raising the question of the adequacy of the accommodation provided by the Department of Education for the detention of juvenile offenders; and it occurred to me that a suggestion might be made here on this Bill that if, in the opinion of the Department of Justice, accommodation over and above what is provided by the Department of Education for the detention of juvenile persons was necessary, the Department of Justice might consider providing that accommodation. Accordingly, I take this opportunity of suggesting to the Minister for Justice the desirability of consulting with the Department of Education as to the expediency of either an inter-departmental commission or a parliamentary commission to consider the general question of prison accommodation, and accommodation for both juvenile and adult offenders.  I believe that the deliberations of such a commission would be of material assistance both to the Department of Justice and the Department of Education.  I believe that there is wide scope for improvement, and I believe that the two Departments responsible could be materially assisted if they would take counsel with a committee of this House or with such other commission as the Department saw fit to set up.  I think I might be safe in saying that they would have no difficulty in finding persons interested in social work of this kind who would undertake the duties of carrying out such investigations as they thought necessary without fee or reward, and who would co-operate in every way they possibly could to relieve the Exchequer of any responsibility that the setting up of a commission of that kind might be expected ordinarily to incur.  I would be glad to know from the Minister for Justice if he would examine the general question of the adequacy of the present places of detention for adult and juvenile offenders and if he would consider the desirability of securing the co-operation of the Minister for <Col N="569" /> Education in setting up a commission to examine this whole question.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the matter the Deputy has raised is strictly relevant to this Bill but, at the same time, I have no objection to consulting with the Minister for Education.  It may be possible to obtain some more information and to see if there is anything that may be necessary to be dealt with and to see in what way it would work out.  I was aware that the Deputy would raise this matter from the speech he made on the Second Reading, and I asked the Minister for Education last evening about conditions obtaining in some of these places under his control.  I shall get more information and consult with the Minister, and if we are satisfied that there are any grounds for setting up a commission that would serve a useful purpose I have no objection to doing so.</P>

That question was put to him because he had reported to the House that the moneys allocated <Col N="570" /> for the provision of school meals had not been spent.  That would seem to reflect on the local authorities whose business it was to spend these moneys. I pointed out at the time that the reason the money was not spent was that the districts, which were manifestly Fíor-Ghaeltacht districts, were not included and that, therefore, there was no permission available to the local authorities to provide these school meals in areas that were really Gaeltacht areas within the meaning of the Bill.  Accordingly, on the Report Stage, I submitted an amendment which I thought, in view of the permissive character of this Bill, might have been relevant to its contents.</P>

      <P>Yes, sir, the Chair thought otherwise.  I submitted an amendment for the Report Stage believing, in view of the discussion on the Committee Stage, that it was in order to submit an amendment on that matter since a doubt remained in the minds of the members of the House as to whether these powers were available to the Minister.  When it became evident that he had not those powers I suggested that the matter could be raised on the Report Stage.  The Chair says that it cannot and, accordingly, I shall raise it on the Fifth Stage.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest&mdash;in a purely formal way&mdash;that the Bill do not pass. My reason is that I do not consider it adequate to the situation.  The purpose for which this Bill was brought in was to facilitate the Parliamentary Secretary in directing the expenditure of certain moneys, voted by this House, in a way that would be in close accord with the purposes for which these moneys were voted.  The Parliamentary Secretary explained that certain counties actually had not spent their share of the £10,000 allocated to them for the provision of school meals.  After a careful perusal <Col N="571" /> of the Principal Act, it became manifest to me that that is a purely permissive Act authorising local authorities to do certain things, which things are the provision of meals for children attending primary schools in certain electoral divisions described in the Schedule to the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>I have carefully gone through that Schedule with the Gaeltacht Report before me, and it became manifest to me that a very large number of electoral divisions in the county with which I am most familiar in the Gaeltacht, which are really Gaeltacht divisions are not included in the Schedule to the Principal Act at all.  Accordingly I put down an amendment to this Bill, on the Report Stage, bringing a number of new electoral divisions into the category of the Gaeltacht areas for the purposes of the Principal Act and this Bill.  Many of these are, in fact, more Irish speaking than those districts already incorporated in the Schedule to the first Act.  It was decided by the Chair that owing to the nature of this Bill that amendment was not permissible, that it went outside the scope of the Bill.  I suggest, therefore, to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should now review the question of the Schedule to the Principal Act, and introduce a new short Bill, on the lines of my amendment, giving permission to the local authorities in Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Kerry and Cork, and other Gaeltacht counties, to use a wider discretion in the additional electoral divisions there for the provision of school meals.  I would invite him, particularly, to give that discretion in such an electoral division as Lough Eske where you have an increase in the Irish-speaking population as between 1911 and 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister will find that some electoral divisions, which can boast an increase of that kind, have actually been omitted from the original Schedule.  I find one outstanding instance is the electoral division of Straid, Inishowen Rural District, where the Irish-speaking population increased from 36.7 in 1911 to 43.2 in 1925.  Yet, that electoral division <Col N="572" /> has not benefited under the Gaeltacht School Meals Act.  The same applies to Fanad North and Fanad West.  It is unnecessary for me to go through the electoral divisions not dealt with, but I think it is a matter to which the Parliamentary Secretary should direct his mind without delay. If he does, I have very little doubt that the Bill we are now asked to pass, finally, will become unnecessary because every county will be able to spend its allocation, and will look for more.  I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would let me know, now, if it is his intention to introduce a short Bill on the lines of the amendment I submitted and which was ruled out of order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree as to the difficulty that has arisen within places in the Fior-Ghaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht. I would ask the Minister, although it is really a little outside the scope of the Bill, if he would, in his remarks later on, state whether in those districts some extension of the School Meals Order could not be carried out, and whether the Minister has compulsory powers to enforce them on boards of health where these boards are not showing any such intention.  There are many districts where boards of health are very reluctant to carry out these schemes. Everyone agrees to do so but they do not clearly know if they have power. If the Minister has power I would like if he would put it in operation particularly in the Breac-Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the intention of the Government, at the present time, to introduce legislation on the lines suggested by Deputy Dillon.  As Deputy Dillon is aware, the sum of £10,000 is made available for the purpose of financing school meals in certain portions of the Gaeltacht scheduled under the Act, in accordance with certain formulæ laid down in the Principal Act as to the number of schools coming within the Order, on the basis of 50 per cent. of the entire expenditure. <Col N="573" /> Deputy Dillon would like to see a good many of the electoral divisions of Donegal included in the scheduled areas.  The trouble in Donegal is that the County Council refuses to strike a higher rate than 1½d. in the £.  The result is that in the limited area in which the particular meals scheme operates, on the basis of a rate of 1½d. in the £, it is only possible to operate that over a few districts in the area. Obviously if the Order were extended, and if the County Council still refuses to strike a higher rate, then the area that can be operated must be still further reduced.  On the other hand, as Deputy Dillon probably knows, a considerable portion of the £10,000 made available out of money provided by the Oireachtas reverts to the Exchequer for the reason that local authorities such as the Donegal County Council do not operate a sufficiently comprehensive scheme to absorb that portion of the £10,000 ear-marked for their particular area.  On the other hand, counties like Galway, where school meals are provided all the year round in the scheduled areas, on the basis of the Order, and the proportion of the number of children coming in, are not entitled to a refund of 50 per cent. of the entire expenses.  The poundage rate in Donegal, for example, is 1.25 of a penny; in Galway it is 2.52 of a penny.  It appeared to the Department that it was more advisable to make he surplus, if Donegal failed to avail of the moneys, available for a county like Galway, which might be in a position to ear-mark 50 per cent. of their expenditure on school meals.  If Deputy Dillon could persuade the Donegal County Council to strike a higher rate, and operate a more comprehensive scheme, they might be able to absorb the entire amount of the grant that has been ear-marked for them, and the necessity for this Bill might not arise, but until there is a disposition on the part of the local authorities to raise more funds locally I do not think we can make a case to the Minister for Finance for a larger sum than £10,000.  I do not know whether the Deputy first discussed this question with the members of the Donegal County Council, or <Col N="574" /> how they would react to his suggestion to increase the rate, but I do know that they consistently refused and persisted in their refusal to strike a higher rate than 1½d. in the £.  I am quite sure that there will always be a certain amount of criticism of and dissatisfaction with any defined area to which the free school meals scheme will apply.  Deputy Dillon, of course, is aware that the present Government has no responsibility for the definition of &ldquo;area&rdquo; appearing in the Principal Act.  Our predecessors in office are responsible for that.  Of course I quite realise that they had not the benefit and assistance of Deputy Dillon's advice at that time.  It is quite possible that the area might be different if his Party were now introducing that measure for the first time. I would suggest to him that, if he is &mdash;as I presume he is&mdash;quite serious in his desire to secure a better result from the operation of those free school meals in the Gaeltacht area, he should concentrate first on the local authority in Donegal and see how far he can get their co-operation in operating a more comprehensive scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister does not intend to accept No. 1?  The regulations in Section 24, which he cited, as far as I can judge, do not give him power to prescribe what is a stallion.  Where is there any mention that he gets authority to specify what is a stallion in this case?  The whole point at issue and the only point that can arise is at what age a colt becomes a stallion.  The proper interpretation of the term should be after the racing period when the horse goes to the <Col N="576" /> stud.  Everybody who has any experience of racing&mdash;although that does not exhaust the whole Bill&mdash; knows that no horse in training can be used for stud purposes.  That is what Deputy Bennett had in mind when he put down this series of amendments. It would be quite possible and easy for the Minister, in connection with regulations which he could make, to put himself right with regard to horses that are not in the bloodstock category.  There is no objection at all to the ordinary terms of this Bill directed towards the horse-breeding industry, outside bloodstock.  Every&mdash; body would like to see even better stallions purchased by the Department. Perhaps it might not be impossible to get better ones at a not much increased price.  Money might be reasonably spent in getting a better quality animal.  However, the Minister may, if he likes, make his regulations under Section 24, but I am not so sure that he could maintain them in a court of law.  It would be better, in a case of this sort, to have a definition of what is meant, so as to make easy, at any rate, the minds of those who have invested so much money in this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point Deputy Bennett wanted to get at was to have certain stallions exempted in this Bill. The way in which he wanted to achieve his point was by saying that the word stallion meant &ldquo;an entire horse used or intended to be used for stud purposes,&rdquo; in other words, horses used in racing excluded. That has been provided for under amendment 5, sub-section (1) (b), where stallions over the prescribed age and used exclusively for racing are exempted.  The point made by Deputy Cosgrave and the point that Deputy Bennett wanted to achieve is covered by the amendment.  We have power to prescribe the age and other matters which are dealt with in the sections. Apparently there has not been any difficulty in prescribing under the present Act what a stallion is.  I think that was not the real point Deputy Cosgrave wanted to get at but as to what is a stallion for the purposes of this Act.  As the Deputy is aware by <Col N="577" /> amendment 5 we have exempted under (a) a blood stallion at the stud, if I might refer to it in that way; and in (b) blood horses for racing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The section states that the owner of any stallion entered in a prescribed stud book, used for the service of a number of mares other than mares entered in the stud book in which such stallion is entered, may apply to the Minister for a certificate. Persons not engaged in the business of horse breeding&mdash;racing people&mdash;have to apply to the Minister if they possess entire horses two years old or three years old, and not being used for stud purposes.  We are living in a modern age and, to my mind, this is an antediluvian proposal.  As the Minister has lost his copy book concerning the amendment I suppose I am entitled to deal with this question. I am positively certain, from the way that section is drawn, that the persons who devised it knew nothing about this business.  Take the case of some of the best bloodstock in the country, the Mayday strain or the Prospector's strain, which are not in any prescribed stud book.  What is going to happen where a stallion is in one book and a mare in another?  There is a filly at present in England belonging, I think, to Lord Derby, called Versicle and I doubt if it is given in any stud book. There was a horse racing a short time ago, Solenoid, one of the best two year olds, and it was not in any stud book. The late Mr. John Gubbins won the Derby twice with some strain of bloodstock that is not in any prescribed book.  The way this section is drawn shows that apparently Miss Prior's stud book was not heard of.  There were some other horses&mdash;Irish Elegance was one&mdash;which were not entered in any stud book.  Did the Minister really mean to meet Deputy Bennett or was this a Departmental arrangement, made by someone who knows nothing about the question?  If the Minister means well I advise him to act up to what he says, and not to cause dissatisfaction to people with bloodstock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. V. Rice Mr. V. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>The leader of the Opposition has mentioned the case of <Col N="578" /> Irish Elegance, a horse that is not mentioned in any stud book because there was some technical fault in his breeding.  There was a horse in this country some years ago that was the sire of many of the best animals ever produced here, which sold for large sums in England, but the progeny were not in any stud book because there was some difficulty about pedigree. The dam was not in any stud book either.  I should like to emphasise what has been stated by Deputy Cosgrave, that horses which are not in any stud book often produce the best blood. Owing to the extremely technical way in which the stud book is kept, if there was a flaw in the breeding of the sire or the dam many generations back the horse is not entitled to be recorded in the stud book as of pure blood.  Even though it is only a technical point, it prevails to such an extent that the stud book does not include animals whose progeny cannot be traced for a number of generations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was considered on the Committee Stage, but was left over in order to give the Minister an opportunity of reconsidering the matter.  The amendment purposes to exempt what I describe as colts, but which the Minister insists are stallions. That is, horses for racing preparatory to proving capacity to be used at a subsequent date as stallions.  If young entire horses racing are not to be exempted from the provisions of the Bill then the Minister and the Department will be put to very great difficulty in operating it.  There will be difficulties also for the managers of racing stables, the owners of racehorses, and other people.  The racing fraternity are very much opposed to this section.  When the Bill was before the House previously Deputy Norton suggested that the Minister should accept the principle of excluding racehorses. I am sorry Deputy Norton is not here now to lend his assistance in agitating for the deletion of this section.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment, or some amendment <Col N="580" /> of a similar nature, that he may approve of.</P>
    <P>If young racing horses are to be subject to licensing provisions and other such disabilities, there will be tremendous opposition to the operation of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  I do not see that it serves any useful purpose and, in fact, the Minister did not put forward any very strong argument on the Committee Stage for the retention of this particular section. There is not any great fear, as I pointed out on the Committee Stage that any of the young entire horses which are racing will be used as stallions or sires.  In fact, every indication is the other way about and, as I pointed out on the Committee Stage, horses in hard training for racing are not suitable as sires for very many reasons, and there would be no fear of any principle of the Bill being violated by any owner of a particular racehorse while he was a racehorse.  I think the Minister ought to accept some provision exempting horses while they are racing from the operation of the Bill other than placing the onus of applying for a licence on the owner of a young horse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. V. Rice Mr. V. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I dislike Deputy Bennett's amendment from the point of view that I do not think it goes far enough.  It is confined to thoroughbred horses in recognised racing stables.  There are many people who have horses which they intend to use for racing and for one reason or another they do not put those horses into a racing stable at the critical age so far as this Bill is concerned. A horse may be backward or may have sustained an injury and may not be fit for training at the moment, and we all know that a man who breeds horses for racing purposes may come to the conclusion that his horse may not be fit this year for racing but may be fit next year and he will naturally keep him at home because he can keep him there more cheaply than in a racing stable. That case would not be covered by Deputy Bennett's amendment.  I thought that Deputy Bennett would have put down a better amendment <Col N="581" /> because I mentioned this matter to him last week.  There are many cases in which a man keeps a horse at home which he intends and keeps only for the purpose of racing because he feels that the horse is not fit at the moment for training.  I remember seeing, a number of years ago, a horse in a certain racing stable, and I was told by the trainer that he had been kept at home and trained at home and was sent to this racing stable only a fortnight before the race for which it was entered.  I can conceive a case in which a horse like that would not come within the exemptions in this Bill and, therefore, I object, as I say, to the amendment in so far as it proposes to give the exemption he asks for to horses in recognised racing stables.  Many people have horses intended only for racing and not for stud purposes at all and, purely for reasons of economy, they do not send the horse to a racing stable in its two year old days.  They keep him at home because they feel he will be no good as a two year old and they decide to send him to a racing stable if he is fit enough to be trained as a three-year-old.</P>

      <P>It is very seldom that one sees a horse thrown by at home or kept over for a year or two unless he is castrated.  These horses are not thrown by idly because they would be very likely of no use for racing when put to racing after two years idleness.  A provision, however, which I think would meet the difficulty would be a provision to fine an owner very severely for allowing his horse to serve a half-bred mare unless he was registered so to do.  I think that would cover the difficulty.</P>

      <P>I quite see Deputy Rice's point and after the Second Reading, when I had had an opportunity of thinking further on the point, with perhaps the object of extending my previous amendment, I came to the conclusion that it might lead to difficulty for the Minister or whoever would be in charge of the Bill afterwards.  If a horse in the possession of an owner without being in a racing stable were exempted for racing, as the Minister hinted in his <Col N="582" /> speech on the Second Reading, possibly some unscrupulous owners of horses might make the case that they intended to race these horses subsequently.  I can see the Minister's difficulty there and it was because of that that I left the amendment as it originally was so as to make it more easy for the Minister to accept it.  If the Minister accepts the amendment as it stands, I do not see any danger of what he desires from the Bill not being brought about.  The amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>except to thoroughbred horses in recognised racing stables and under the charge of a trainer holding a licence to train under Irish Turf Club Rules.</P>
      <P>That amendment covers every possibility of fraud so far as I can see. They will have to be raced under Turf Club Rules.  The Minister might make the case that if we did put in the provision of naming the Turf Club or some other body, a person racing horses illegally&mdash;flapper meetings, for instance&mdash;might claim exemption and it was to prevent such a possibility that we inserted the words &ldquo;under Irish Turf Club Rules.&rdquo;  I do not see any danger, if the Minister accepts the amendment and excludes horses while they are training in the hands of a recognised trainer and racing under recognised Turf Club Rules, of horses so trained and raced being used at all as sires.</P>

I said that perhaps rather hastily a moment ago, because I would be entirely satisfied with his amendment 5 (b) if the words were &ldquo;is of or over the prescribed age or is used or intended to be used exclusively for racing&rdquo; because you have, as I say, the case of a man who has a horse and intends to use it only for racing, and that would not be covered by the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>I should not like to accept it here and now, but I will promise to look into it&mdash;because that was our intention&mdash;and it can be amended in the other House, if necessary.  One objection was raised by Deputy Cosgrave, who said that it was antediluvian to ask those people to make application for exemption.  I do not see any other way in which we can do it because, after all, it is surely more reasonable to ask them to make application than to ask us to go around looking for them and saying: &ldquo;There is a horse we are going to exempt for you.&rdquo;  We have to keep account of them somehow or other, and if there is a stallion horse, we want to know whether he comes under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of the exemption or, if not, if he is licensed or not.  I do not think that it is any great hardship on people that they should be asked <Col N="584" /> to apply for exemption.  I do not know as much about racing as some of the Deputies who have spoken on this matter, but I am told that if an owner is putting a horse in for racing he has, on an average, to fill up four or five different forms.  If he races his horse five or six times a year he has, therefore, to fill up twenty or thirty forms. We are only asking him to fill up one form, an application for an exemption, and that form will be as simple as we can make it.  I got no suggestion as to an alternative way of dealing with it.  There must be some document.  If we are going to exempt a horse, we will have to send down an exemption form.  Otherwise how are we to know of the existence of the horse, or that he is used as stated in paragraphs (a) and (b)?  I cannot see any hardship in this matter.</P>
      <P>There was another objection raised by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Rice, that some of the horses would be thoroughbred horses which would not be in the stud book.  I do not see how we can deal with them.  I do not see how we can go further than we have provided here, that he is in the stud book and is used for the service of mares in the stud book.  If we go further than that and include horses mentioned by Deputies opposite, very good horses perhaps, with very good records as race horses and with very good progeny also, how could anybody frame an exemption clause to include such horses?  It is true that these horses may have been used successfully for racing purposes, but still for the few exceptions there are&mdash;and I take it Deputy Cosgrave mentioned whatever exceptions came into his mind&mdash;I do not think we should try to frame this Bill to include them.  We could not frame such a clause without its being altogether too loose, or without altogether losing the effect of what we are trying to achieve in this Bill. Another point has been raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The following Government amendment appeared on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>5.  In page 2, before Section 4, to insert three new sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The owner of any stallion, which is entered in a prescribed stud book and which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is used for the service of no mares other than mares entered in the stud book in which such stallion is entered, or</P>
      <P>(b)  is of or over the prescribed age and is used exclusively for racing,</P>
      <P>may apply to the Minister for a certificate (in this Act referred to as a certificate of exemption) exempting such stallion from the application of this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every application made under this section shall be made in the prescribed form and manner and shall contain the prescribed particulars.</P>
      <P>(1)  On receipt of any application, made under and in accordance with this Act, for a certificate of exemption in respect of any stallion the Minister may, if he so thinks fit, grant such certificate and from the date of the grant thereof so long as such certificate remains in force such stallion shall be an exempted stallion within the meaning and for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Every certificate of exemption granted under this Act shall, unless previously determined, revoked, or suspended under this Act, remain in force until the 31st day of December next after the date on which such <Col N="586" /> certificate is granted and shall then expire unless renewed under and in accordance with this section.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, on the application of the owner of any exempted stallion, grant in the month of December in any year, for a period of one calendar year from the 31st day of that month, a renewal of the certificate of exemption granted in relation to such stallion and whenever the Minister grants such renewal such certificate of exemption shall, unless determined, revoked, or suspended under this Act, remain in force until the 31st day of December in the next ensuing year.</P>
    <P>(1)  Every certificate of exemption granted under this Act shall determine if and when the right to the possession of the stallion to which it relates passes by any means from the person to whom it was issued.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where the person to whom a certificate of exemption is issued under this Act dies while such certificate continues in force, the stallion to which such certificate relates shall continue by virtue of such certificate to be an exempted stallion within the meaning and for the purposes of this Act until the happening of whichever of the following events first happens, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the expiration of three months from the death of such person, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the passing by sale, assent to a bequest or otherwise of such stallion from the possession of the personal representative of such person, or</P>
    <P>(c)  the revocation of such certificate by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(3) The Minister may at any time, at his absolute discretion, revoke or suspend for any specified period any certificate of exemption issued under this Act.</P>

      <P>In regard to this amendment, Deputy Cosgrave also said that I had brought in the amendment without consulting anybody, either inside <Col N="587" /> or outside the Department, or without knowing anything about the business. I admit that Deputy Cosgrave knows a good deal about horse breeding.  In fact, I read an account of his very perfect knowledge on that subject in some of the Sunday papers.  But there are others, both inside and outside the Department, who know something about horse breeding also.  I have consulted these people.  There are men in this country who have given most of their lives to the breeding of horses.  I consulted some of those men and they were the first to make the suggestion to me that this amendment should be brought in.  I do not know whether we have got exactly in the amendment what they wanted and what I wanted.  In the case of the 1920 Act in England, the draftsman inserted this clause: &ldquo;A stallion entered in any prescribed stud book.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting a bit cross.  Because he came in here as an expert in horse-breeding he wants to live up to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> reputation.  He is afraid he will be caught out.  Deputy Desmond asked whether it would be possible to allow an owner to keep a horse and said that in case he was caught out he could be fined.  That is the present position which we want to rectify.  The present position is that any person can keep a stallion and, if he wants to use it for stud purposes, he must get a licence under the present law.  In practice we have found, in some cases, that they have not applied for a licence or, perhaps, knowing that the horses would not be passed for a licence, have used them as sires.  We are fairly certain that they are using them but the difficulty is to catch them.  The Bill is brought in to meet that, and I think the suggestion of Deputy Desmond could not be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, on the Committee Stage, undertook to accept the principle of an amendment that I had tabled for the exemption of certain thoroughbred horses.  I believe the Minister was honest in his intention to accept in full the principle <Col N="590" /> of the amendment but, perhaps, in different words.  I am sorry to say that the Minister's amendment, whether drafted in goodwill or not, does not meet the case.  My amendment read as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;A stallion which is entered in any prescribed stud book and is used for the service of none but mares so entered.&rdquo;  That simple amendment would have covered all the cases we had in mind and practically every possibility we had in mind with regard to the rearing of thoroughbred horses.  There were no addenda to it requiring application to be made for a permit to have such horses nor was there any case made for the necessity for such an application on the Committee Stage. Certain horses were to be exempted without any necessity on the part of the owner to make any application for a permit, which might or might not be granted.  In accepting the principle of the amendment, the Minister made no terms, if I may so put it, that the owner of the horse would be put to the trouble of applying for a permit, as is provided for in this amendment, which may or may not be granted.  There is no definite guarantee in this that the permit will be given.  It might or might not be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief objection I have to this amendment is the wording of paragraph (a) &ldquo;is used for the service of no mares other than mares entered in the stud book in which such stallion is entered.&rdquo;  The Minister recognises the existence of a couple of stud books. There is the chief stud book.  Then there is another stud book commonly called Miss Prior's, in which horses and mares of recognised merit which have built up a reputation for themselves, though technically not recognised as thoroughbred, are entered. To exclude horses in that stud book would exclude the Mayday strain which is a most important strain in Ireland and which entered largely into the pedigree of many racehorses for forty years past.  It would exclude another great strain, that represented by Verdict and other notable horses.  Curzon, a horse which was second in the Derby, would be excluded.  The dam of Curzon <Col N="591" /> would be excluded.  Coming down to later history Verdict, one of the greatest mares in England, would be debarred from being mated with a recognised thoroughbred stallion in Ireland.  If the amendment were accepted and Lord Lonsdale, or whoever owns Verdict, sent her over here to be mated, the owner of a sire here would have to say that he was debarred by the Minister's amendment from mating her.  Versicle, the daughter of Verdict, would be debarred from being mated with a thoroughbred stallion here if the Minister's amendment were carried.  My original amendment made no distinction. While the Minister recognises two stud books, a sire entered in one would have to be mated with a mare entered in the same book.  A mare entered in one and a sire entered in another could not be mated together.  That is the chief objection I have to paragraph (a).  It would place tremendous difficulties in the way of those engaged in the rearing of bloodstock.  I venture to say that the Mayday strain in this country and the other strain I have mentioned would be excluded altogether if the amendment were accepted.</P>
    <P>I would again ask the Minister to accept the simple amendment which I put down on the Committee Stage.  It was taken from the 1918 Act and must have been put in after careful consideration of all the difficulties which, perhaps, a wider amendment would cause&mdash;&ldquo;a stallion which is entered in any prescribed stud book and used for the service of none but mares so entered.&rdquo;  That simple amendment would meet all the difficulties that those of us who spoke on this Bill had in mind.  I do not see that there would be any harm in accepting the exact wording of the amendment, but if the Minister wishes to change the wording without affecting the meaning of it he can do so.  That certainly has not been the effect of the Minister's statement.  There was no provision in the original amendment for applying for a permit.  The exemption followed <i>de facto.</i>  If a horse fulfilled certain conditions, was in a stud book, and was used only for thoroughbred <Col N="592" /> mares, there was exemption without any proviso.  The acceptance of that simple amendment would meet every difficulty that the breeders of thoroughbred stock had in view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be disastrous if you excluded the Mayday strain from the provisions of the Bill.  They have bred some of the best winners in England.  When I was a boy they tried very hard to get Wetherby's to recognise the Mayday strain.  Since then, of course, they have been mated with thoroughbred stock and are now better fitted to be in the stud book.  Some mares missed being put into the stud book. There is a stud book for such mares. One of these horses&mdash;Shotgun&mdash;was placed in the Derby and was only beaten about a length.  Irish Elegance won the Hunt Cup carrying 9 st. 7 lbs. All these horses would be excluded and the mares would be excluded from being served by horses in Wetherby's Stud Book.  They are recognised in Miss Prior's Stud Book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bennett and Deputy Desmond referred to horses not in the stud book that were distinguished horses.  The latest example is a horse called Prospector that died a year or two ago.  That horse produced some of the best sprinters sent out of this country&mdash;horses that were sold in England for very large sums of money.  They raced in England, India and in America.  Prospector was recognised in his day as one of the greatest sires of sprinters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That horse, Prospector, would not have been recognised.  He could not be mated under the Minister's Bill with a thoroughbred mare.  But he was recognised, when standing at the stud here, as one of the greatest sires of that time, and he was producing some of the best horses racing at sprint races not only in this country but in England, America and India. I think that the Minister ought try to draft an amendment to provide for cases of that kind.  There are horses which are absolutely thoroughbred, having the best blood in the world, but through the fact that the pedigree of the horse himself or of the dam has not been recorded at some time or other <Col N="593" /> in the stud book, they are at a disadvantage. That does not mean that the defaulting ancestor was not of pure blood, but is due to the fact that, at some time or other, the pedigree was not recorded in the stud book. Those horses which are not entitled to be described in the stud book as &ldquo;thoroughbred&rdquo; horses are technically described as &ldquo;half-bred.&rdquo;  The Minister should draft an amendment in the terms I suggest, having regard to the practical example I have given of a great sire like Prospector who produced great horses and brought into this country large sums in the way of stud fees.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his explanation, was about as lucid as he was when introducing the Bill. He dealt with the various clauses when introducing the Bill, but he made no statement as to his intentions on the subject of horse breeding. Having compared a particular portion of the section with what is contained in the 1918 Act, he confesses himself to be unable to see any difference between the two.  At this stage, will he say that he wants to exclude the various strains of blood referred to by the different Deputies?  Does he want to include the Mayday strain and the Prospector strain or any of the others mentioned?  If he does we shall know where we are.  If he wants to include them, it will not take a whole page of instructions to the draftsman to get a clause framed to effect his purpose.  Deputy Bennett's amendment brought them in.  What objection has the Minister to that amendment?  It was in the Act of 1918.  Is that the objection?  Having regard to the fact that, in the case of the Workmen's Compensation Bill, the sheet-anchor was a British Act, if he objects to the 1918 Act, his fastidious political stomach is not as strong as that of Deputy Lemass. Does the Minister intend to keep out certain strains of blood?  If he does, we shall know where we are.  If he does not, what is the objection to adopting the words in Deputy Bennett's amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made here to the fact that there are two books.  The <Col N="594" /> Minister does not deny that.  Why should not he say &ldquo;in any prescribed stud book&rdquo; as provided in the British Act?  Why does he insist on excluding those mares if, on consideration, he thinks they ought not to be excluded?  The Minister ought to remember that if he does not make up his case before coming in here we are prepared to help him.  The fact that he does not make up his case or knows nothing about the subject should not be an excuse for having an imperfect Bill passed through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Going through the measure, I find that various steps have to be taken by people who have horses and racing stables in order to get exemption. The Minister says that one extra form does not matter.  A lot he knows about the forms which people who are racing have to fill up?  The trainer of this year's Derby winner told me that he had to write twenty letters in order to get his horse across, owing to the Minister's economics and the nonsense that he and his Ministry are going on with.  He had to write twenty letters to get his horse over here to run in our principal classic.  This amendment of the Minister really covers three new sections.  I suppose we are taking them all together.  Is it intended to exempt a horse that is racing?  Surely, the House is entitled to know that.  The section says: &ldquo;if the Minister so thinks fit.&rdquo;  What is the meaning of sub-section (2) (b) of the third section, which states that the stallion to which the certificate relates shall continue to be an exempted stallion under the meaning of this Act until... &ldquo;the passing by sale, assent to a bequest or otherwise of such stallion from the possession of the personal representative of such person&rdquo;?  Is it really intended to make it more difficult for people to sell a horse in training?  What is the necessity for that provision?  Why could not a certificate pass from one person to another, with endorsement, without all this nonsense?  There is no great money in racing horses.  Even the very best advice that one can get in that connection, shows that there is not much money in it.  Why should the Government deliberately make it <Col N="595" /> more difficult for people so engaged to sell their horses?  The last sub-section I suppose is nonsense also.  It is scarcely intended to be operative. It states: &ldquo;The Minister may at any time at his absolute discretion revoke or suspend for any specified period any certificate of exemption issued under this Act.&rdquo;  What is the meaning of that?  The horse is to be exempted from being licensed.  What happens then?  Must he be licensed? Must he be castrated if not licensed? When all that is done, will he be restored to the exemption list?</P>

Evidently he does not know what was happening under his own Government in connection with that industry.  Yet he lectures the Dáil, the Government and my officials about the injustice done under this Bill.

      <P>This is an amendment under which we had considerable discussion on the last day, and I am not sure that although we withdrew the amendment the Minister did not make a promise that he would reconsider it.

      <P>This is another amendment on which we had considerable discussion on the last day.  It is an amendment which inflicts the maximum penalty on the owner of a sire who fails to put in his application within the prescribed time. Everything that could be said on this was said on the last day, but I want to recapitulate in a few words what I said then.  It seems to me that whatever necessity there was for the main portion of the section&mdash;inflicting a penalty on people who violate the law in certain respects&mdash;that penalty was altogether too great for a technical offence such as the failure to make application for a licence.  I hope the Minister, on reconsidering the matter, will accept the deletion of these words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we discussed this very fully on the Committee Stage.  I understand that this particular penalty of castration could not be inflicted without due notice, in fact, without many notices.  First of all, we have to give notice about the castration.  If that was not carried out, reasonable notice would have to be given&mdash;14 days after&mdash;to castrate the animal.  There is an appeal against that notice, and that appeal has to be heard.  There are various safeguards given before any such thing as castration can be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular clause deals with castration.  That penalty should be confined to animals unsuitable for licensing, not for any other reason.  The bringing in of <Col N="604" /> another purpose here is little short of vindictiveness against the person who has failed to apply for the licence.  No Deputy is standing for the registration of a stallion that is not up to standard. But the one qualification for getting that designation is suitability. For unsuitability there is one and only one method of dealing &mdash; and that is to order the animal to be castrated.  You are losing the whole situation if you make the Bill so that a man who did not apply for a licence through forgetfulness, or through any other cause, is to have his animal castrated.  The owner might be in the same position as the Minister for Agriculture was five or six years ago&mdash;that he would not recognise the court.  But that is no reason why a suitable animal should be castrated.  The animal should be examined only as to his suitability as a sire.  The other question does not arise.  It is nonsense to bring in that penalty here because a man has failed to apply for the licence in time.  When the Minister says there are various safeguards before a thing of that kind can be done, he is trifling with the House.  Let the man who disobeys the law suffer whatever penalty is inflicted in connection with the breach of the law, but the horse should not be cast simply for the reason that his owner did not apply for a licence to have him registered as a sire.  I certainly think Deputy Bennett is perfectly entitled to divide the House on this amendment.</P>

      <P>I knew that the Dr. Ryan who was transmogrified into the position of Minister for Agriculture always cherished in his bosom a profound veneration for Cumann na nGaedheal, but this is the first time that he has said it.  Quite apart from that, is it not perfectly obvious that if the stallion was an animal of very considerable value the Minister would <Col N="606" /> not do the manifest wrong of destroying it?  He would go some other way about it.  He would fine the owner, or take such steps as were necessary to prevent the destruction of the animal. In fact, in no case would the Minister use the sanction that he has in this section, because he knows himself it is a bad one.  The course that he would pursue would be to fine the man for every day that he kept the animal without making application.  That would be the sensible thing to do. Eventually, if the man proved stubborn and intractable, the Minister would levy for the fine and, if needs be, imprison him for it.  That would be the ordinary sensible thing to do.  It is the ordinary way of coercing a citizen into conformity with the law.  Surely it is had in principle to take powers in a Bill that the Minister himself knows no rational man could use or employ, and that is all Deputy Bennett asks the Minister to forgo.  To me the Deputy's suggestion seems a highly rational one.  Where there is a sanction proposed in a Bill that is manifestly unusable and that no rational Minister would think of using, then I say that no rational Minister should ask the House to give him that power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has summed up in a few words the true situation as regards the principle we are discussing.  The Minister can get all that he requires under the Bill&mdash; we on this side of the House will not object&mdash;by taking power to inflict a day to day fine for a breach of the statute in regard to the matter that he wants to have attended to.  That will be a complete remedy.  It will be a much better remedy than to have this bludgeon held over people's heads that their property may be destroyed.  Such a power as this might lead to the destruction of very valuable property in this country, but there will be no such danger to property if the Minister takes the remedy suggested by Deputy Dillon, namely, that after the lapse of a certain period during which a man should apply for a licence there will be a day to day fine for a breach of the regulations.  I think the Minister should accept that suggestion.  The <Col N="607" /> remedy in the Bill was truly referred to by Deputy The O'Mahony last week as a penalty that was going to be inflicted on the animal instead of on the owner.  I think the Minister ought to be satisfied with the power to inflict a day to day penalty for neglect or refusal to comply with the regulations after a prescribed period.  That, I think, will be a complete remedy.  What we object to in the section is the danger of destruction of valuable property.</P>

    <Title>In Committee On Finance&mdash;Money Resolution - Sea Fisheries Protection (No. 2) Bill, 1933&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is to obtain fuller powers than exist under the present laws to protect fully from external exploitation the fisheries in the waters along our coasts in which, according to the accepted principle of international law, the citizens of this State have the exclusive right of fishing.  It is also the object of these proposals to inflict heavy punishment for certain methods of fishing which, when carried on in inshore waters and bays, whether by externally owned or by Saorstát fishing vessels, have an injurious effect on the stock of fish in those waters upon which the small inshore fisheries depend.</P>
      <P>Powers are sought in the Bill to prevent foreign fishing vessels from not only fishing in these reserved waters but also from hovering there.  Under the generally accepted principles of international law the vessels of one nation are permitted to enter the territorial waters of another nation for certain purposes, such as to obtain shelter in stress of weather, to procure food supplies and to obtain assistance in cases of break-down or of illness among its passengers or crew.  For any of these purposes a fishing vessel which is neither registered nor owned in the Saorstát may enter our waters, but as soon as its lawful requirements are fulfilled that vessel must put to sea. The penalty which it is proposed to inflict in this Bill for not doing so is £50 for the first offence and £100 for subsequent offences, and the fishing gear found on board the boat is liable to forfeiture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same penalty is proposed in the case of a non-Saorstát sea fishing boat which enters the exclusive fishery area without valid reason.  When such a boat is found to be fishing in such waters, the same fine is to be exacted <Col N="609" /> with the additional penalty of confiscation of all fish found on board.</P>
    <P>The most serious injury to our inshore fisheries, and to the immature fish which frequent the shallow waters during their development from the fry stage, is done by the modern highpowered trawlers.  The existing laws for the protection of these inshore waters from such vessels have become inadequate, and further powers are required to meet the changed conditions. It will be observed that very heavy penalties are proposed for offences by such vessels, whether they be owned or registered in this country or outside it.  The penalties for infringements of the existing by-laws are at present limited to a fine of £100 with confiscation of the fishing gear. In this Bill I am asking for a penalty of £200 for a first offence against new by-laws which I now seek power to pass.  The maximum penalty for a second or subsequent offence by the same person is £500.  In the case of a third offence, in addition to this fine, the vessel itself may be confiscated if there has been continuity of ownership during the period from the time the first offence was committed.  In all cases power is to be given to confiscate all fishing gear found on board the vessel.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to detect and identify fishing vessels operating in prohibited waters, because at night the persons on board frequently carry on their operations without lights; and during the day, in order to avoid identification, they obliterate the name and official number of the vessel.  The Bill provides specially severe penalties for these offences, which are also contraventions of the Merchant Shipping Acts.  The master of any sea fishing boat found inside the exclusive fishery limits, without its proper lights and identification marks&mdash;even though not actually fishing at the time of detection &mdash;may be fined up to £100.  A similar penalty is proposed in the case of boats not regulated by the Merchant Shipping Acts which enter our waters without having on board the official papers.</P>
    <P>I now come to deal with the classes of officers who will be entrusted with <Col N="610" /> the duty of detecting these offences and of the special powers proposed to be given to them for carrying out that duty.  It is intended to make every member of the Gárda Síochána a sea fisheries protection officer.  In addition to the Gárdai, certain officers of the Department of Defence, of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and of the Customs and Excise service, as well as of my own Department will be given the special powers of sea fishery protection officers.</P>
    <P>The powers to be given to these officers are very wide.  They may stop and board any fishing vessel found in the exclusive fishery limits or even outside those limits in cases where the vessel has been pursued from within those limits.  They may search the boat and all persons on board, examine all the boat's official papers and log-book, and where they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that there has been an infringement of the law as laid down in this Bill, they can arrest the boat and all on board and bring them to the nearest convenient port for trial.  If the boat fails to stop when ordered, the sea fisheries protection officers have power to compel them by gun-fire to do so.  It is proposed to make the obstruction of a sea fisheries protection officer while exercising these powers a special offence, the maximum penalty for which is a fine of £50 or three months' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>When a vessel has been arrested and brought into port, it may be detained there in charge of sea fisheries protection officers pending the hearing of the charge by the district justice.  If as a result of the hearing fines and costs are imposed, the vessel may be detained until these are paid.  Should the convicted party desire to appeal against the decision of the district justice, the boat will be detained until security which is satisfactory in the opinion of the district justice has been given for the due payment of the penalty.  In the event of the penalties not being paid within the time allowed power is to be given to sell the boat and meet the fine and costs out of the proceeds.</P>
    <P>The aim of these proposals which I <Col N="611" /> have briefly explained being to preserve our inshore fishery for the small fishing boat owners and their crews dwelling along our coast, whose livelihood depends to a large extent upon the catching of fish in our own waters, I feel confident that this Bill will have the approval and support of every member of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that every member of the Dáil would have liked to hear from the Minister, in introducing a Bill of this kind, something more as to the intentions of the Government with regard to the enforcement of the provisions of the Bill. Looked at from that point of view, the Bill is scarcely worth the paper it is written on.  The Parliamentary Secretary will remember, probably, that on the debates on his Estimate this year I took it on myself to give him some friendly advice.  At any rate, I advised him that he should not bring in a Bill of this kind until he had got some guarantee from the Executive Council that there would be a sufficient addition to the coastal patrol to allow for the enforcement of the provisions of the Bill.  In the same speech, I pointed out to the Parliamentary Secretary that the great difficulty with which I was faced during my period of office was in getting sanction for the additional expenditure that was necessary for coastal patrol. The great argument always put up against me was that our sea fisheries were of such comparatively insignificant value, and were so spasmodic, that the expenditure would not be justified. That was an argument that was extremely difficult to meet until the advent of the Sea Fisheries Association. The Sea Fisheries Association was formed in November, 1930, I think. At least, it held its first general meeting in November, 1930, and, before the Association was launched, I had a guarantee that once the Association got under way, provision would be made for strengthening the coastal patrol.  The argument that was used against me no longer holds, because no one can say, with any great justice now, that our fisheries are spasmodic or unorganised.  The Association has <Col N="612" /> been working for three years and, whether there may be a difference of opinion as to its success, at any rate it has organised the fisheries and put them on something like a systematic basis.  If they are to be in any way effective, the guarantee I was then given should be given effect to now, and the coastal patrol should be strengthened.  Perhaps the Minister has some assurance in that direction, but, if he has, he should take the House into his confidence.</P>
      <P>The Bill itself contains nothing very revolutionary beyond increasing the maximum penalties for certain offences. There is no minimum penalty, and that is a point which, I think, the Minister might have considered&mdash;whether or not there should have been minimum as well as maximum penalties.  As I was saying, beyond the increase of these maximum penalties there is very little new in the Bill.  It leaves the question of our exclusive fishery limits exactly in the position in which they were found.  I find no fault with the Minister for that, because I appreciate his difficulty; but I am rather amused when I remember some of the speeches that used to be made from the Fianna Fáil Benches when we were in office. It was usual with them them to tell us what they would do in connection with these limits when they got into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And they will tell us again to-day, I am sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time they said that the three-mile limit was not adequate and that when they got into office they would certainly make it a six-mile limit and, possibly, a 12-mile limit.  Now when they have come into office it has been extremely salutary for them.  They are now beginning to understand the difficulties of the situation and to appreciate them. I have no fault to find with the Minister for the provisions actually in the Bill.  Section 2 says: &ldquo;In this Act the expression the exclusive fishery limits of Saorstát Eireann' means that portion of the seas within which citizens of Saorstát Eireann have by international law the exclusive right of fishing and, where such portion is defined by the terms of any convention,  <Col N="613" /> treaty or arrangement for the time being in force made between Saorstát Eireann and any other State, includes as regards sea fishing boats and subjects of such State the portion so defined.&rdquo;  That means that we are taking our stand presumably upon the three-mile limit.  That proposes the addition that the distance of the three-mile limit will be measured from a line drawn from headland to headland in the case of bays not more than ten miles in width.  That is the provision of the Anglo-French Treaty of 1889. Of course, in Section 4, sub-section (6), an attempt is made to obtain the advantage of extra territorial by-laws made under the Steam Trawling (Ireland) Act of 1899.  But personally I cannot see what the effectiveness of that sub-section will be.  These by-laws were made when this country was ruled from Westminster.  They were easily enforced against British steam trawlers because fines imposed could almost as easily be collected in England as here.  I fear these by-laws can now only be effective as against citizens of the Saorstát and against Saorstát boats, unless, of course, there is some arrangement or convention with the British by which they would agree to collect from the trawlers on the grounds covered by the by-laws.  That would not be a very easy matter.  It would not be an easy matter to get the British to agree to that in any circumstances, even if the most friendly relations existed between the two Governments, because the British steam trawling owners or companies have always complained very bitterly about these by-laws made under the Act of 1899 not only in the case of Ireland but in the case of Scotland.  They continue to complain about the operation of these by-laws in the case of Scotland.  To-day there is one particular by-law affecting the Moray Firth.  That would appear at first sight a legitimate grievance because Belgian and German and French trawlers can come into the Moray Firth whereas their boats cannot.  I feel, especially in view of the strained relationship that exists between the British and the Saorstát Governments, that there is <Col N="614" /> very little hope that the British Government would now make representations from the Saorstát to the steam trawling proprietors.  At any rate, Section 4 (6) attempts to retain these by-laws.  It is an attempt candidly to have it both ways.  I do not, in the least, say that in any disparaging way about the present Minister because, to be very candid, I, myself, tried, during my term of office, to have it both ways in so far as these by-laws were concerned. I did so for one reason that is exceedingly important because of the breeding grounds on the coast of Waterford and like places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to put down an amendment to delete that particular sub-section, but I am perfectly satisfied that it can only affect Saorstát fishermen and only them.  I come now to the section dealing with penalties.  Sub-section (4) of Section 3, I presume, has special reference to French lobster boats.  I know the provision is couched in general terms.  In that sub-section it is provided that the master of a boat found within the exclusive fishery limits of the Saorstát shall be liable to a maximum penalty of £100 and confiscation of any fishing gear found on that boat.  If the provisions in the Bill can be enforced they ought to be sufficiently deterrent, but I am not quite clear as to why the Minister differentiates in sub-section (4) in his attitude to paragraphs (a) and (b).  I should prefer to have imposed a severer penalty than may be imposed by the by-laws. I should prefer to have included in the Bill a severer penalty against any trawling by foreign boats in the three-mile limit.  Then, if necessary, to prevent our own boats trawling in any particular area, I would impose a by-law to deal with them.  The penalties set out in sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of Section 4 seem to be sufficiently severe for the purpose.  I am not quite clear about sub-section (3): &ldquo;where a person is convicted of an offence under this section the court shall, in addition to any other penalty, order any fishing gear used or attempted to be used in contravention of the by-law, the contravention of which constitutes such an offence, to be forfeited.&rdquo;  The words used in that <Col N="615" /> section will probably create difficulties by way of proofs when a case comes before the court.  I would insist upon something to the effect that any gear found on a boat offending against the Act should be liable to be forfeited. It may be extremely difficult to prove what particular portion of the gear was actually used in the offence.  The Minister would be on the safe side by making all gear found on board the vessel, that was infringing the fishery laws, liable to be forfeited.  I presume I can take it that the provision of penalties under Section 5, that is for covering up identification marks, and infringing the carrying of lights, in conformity with the Merchant Shipping Act, are in addition to any penalties that might be inflicted for infringement of other portions of the Act.</P>
    <P>To come to Section 6, that is the provision of sea fisheries officers, I have not much to say to that.  They are obviously the types of persons who should be appointed fishery officers, and nobody can find any fault with them.  Nor can anybody find any fault with the powers&mdash;which are very great &mdash;given under the Bill to those fishery officers.  Again, the question arises there as to how those powers are to be executed by the officers.  There is provision in Section 7 (a) for instance that such an officer may order a boat to be stopped for the purpose of identification or of allowing him to go on board it; under sub-section (b) he may board the boat, and so on down along the list.  One should like to hear from the Minister how the officers are going to carry out those powers that are conferred on them.  The same thing would relate to boats that are detained by order of the district justice pending payment of a fine.  How are the boats going to be detained in a particular harbour?  If you put a couple of Civic Guards, for instance, on board the boat there is nothing to prevent the skipper taking his courage in his hands and steaming off, Guards and all.  We should like to know what provision the Minister intends to make for ensuring that when a boat is ordered by the district justice to be detained, it is going to be detained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> Section 15 seems to me to be rather in conflict with the Minister's attitude in Section 4 (6).  Section 15 says &ldquo;References in the Trawling in Prohibited Areas Prevention Act, 1909, to the United Kingdom shall be construed as references to Saorstát Eireann and the said Act shall be construed and have effect accordingly.&rdquo;  The title of the Trawling in Prohibited Areas Act was &ldquo;An Act to prohibit the landing and selling in the United Kingdom of fish caught in prohibited areas of the sea adjoining Scotland and Ireland.&rdquo; Its reference was particularly to infringement of the two extra territorial by-laws, namely the one of the Moray Firth, to which I referred a minute ago, and the one off Waterford. It was an attempt made&mdash;the only attempt as far as I can learn&mdash;to prevent foreign trawlers from infringing those by-laws.  It provided that a foreign trawler which was reported for fishing within the limits of the by-laws at Moray Firth and off Waterford should be liable, if they landed any fish in either Great Britain or Ireland within a period of two months&mdash;I am not quite sure of the period&mdash;to have that fish confiscated. That was of some value because of the fact that many of those foreign trawlers&mdash;I mean &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; in those days; that is, non-Irish and nonBritish&mdash;depended on the British market for the sale of their catch. They were very often caught, within the two months, landing fish, and their fish was confiscated.  It was to some extent, therefore, a deterrent.  I think that the change which is suggested here&mdash;that is the substitution of &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for &ldquo;The United Kingdom&rdquo;, making the title now read &ldquo;An Act to prohibit the landing and selling in the Saorstát of fish caught in prohibited areas...&rdquo;&mdash;makes the Act, as far as we are concerned, absolutely useless.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that I thought it was in conflict with the Minister's attitude on Section 4 (6).  Section 4 (6) was an attempt to retain the extra territorial by-laws, while this section would appear to me to be an abandonment of any hope of getting some reciprocity from the British in connection <Col N="617" /> with those areas.  That may be just as well; if he feels that there would be no chance of getting that reciprocity it might be just as well to abandon it, but then he might as well have abandoned putting in Section 4 (6).  As far as the Bill is concerned it is, of course, in its terms quite all right.  I have nothing in particular to say against it, but there is just the big &ldquo;If&rdquo; about it all&mdash;the very big question of the expenditure that would be necessary to enforce its provisions.  If we have some assurance that in the forthcoming Estimates there will be provision made for greater fishery protection, then the Bill will undoubtedly have a very good effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not a very comprehensive Fishery Bill; otherwise, we might have a good deal of criticism to launch on the whole fishery control of the Government, and of the various Departments connected with it.  It is simply a Bill to afford some sort of adequate protection to whatever fisheries exist, or rather I should say to whatever fisheries have survived the treatment or want of treatment in the matter of their preservation which has been extended to them not alone by the present Government, but I should also say by the former Government and all other Governments that were in this country.  The fisheries of this country are in a very parlous condition.  That goes without saying.  This Bill is an attempt to protect what does not exist at the moment&mdash;sea fisheries.  I can speak for one of the biggest maritime counties and the biggest maritime constituency in Ireland&mdash;West Cork and South Cork&mdash;where some of the best spawning beds in Europe, particularly on the nymph bank, have been scraped out by foreign trawlers, and no attempt whatever is being made to protect those beds.  The result is that fishing is practically a lost art along the south coast of the County Cork to-day.  In some quarters, that is attributed to the fact that the Cork fishermen have not shown any great desire to cooperate with the Sea Fisheries Association: that they have shown no desire to cultivate that spirit of co-operation which is supposed to be the be-all and end-all of that association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> I am, perhaps, going a little beyond the limits of the present Bill, which is simply, as I say, a Bill for protection. When you speak of protection you must see what you are going to protect, the limits within which protection is possible, and the methods of protection.  We have, first of all the three-mile limit.  It is evident that the Government has made up its mind that it is not going to have any &ldquo;truck&rdquo; or co-operation with any authority outside this country which might lead to the betterment of fishing in general by a reciprocal arrangement for an extension of the three-mile limit.  From my knowledge of the fisheries of the coast of Ireland protection of anything within the three-mile limit is of no practical advantage. The limit should be six miles. I refer to a great trawling ground for English trawlers, extending from the Fastnet to the Blaskets well outside the three-mile limit, which has been scraped clean.  As an instance of the results of trawling I may mention that in 1918, when all the English trawlers were away mine sweeping, every fishing harbour on the south coast of Cork was supplied every morning with what are called white fish and every other sort of fish.  Reference to statistics will show that since then fishing has declined, and has gone back to the old level.  The three-mile limit is simply the three mile international limit.  As Deputy Lynch pointed out, there are in some places arrangements by which trawlers are permitted to come to certain places not more than 10 miles from head to head.  In my constituency trawlers can come into Bantry Bay, within a mile or two of the shore, but they are not fishing in our territorial waters.  That is an extraordinary anomaly.  On the Committee Stage I suggest that the Minister should reconsider defining &ldquo;the exclusive fishery limits of Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; and should make the three mile limit &ldquo;three miles from low water mark.&rdquo;  That would give much more adequate protection than the present regulations.</P>
    <P>With regard to trawlers, I believe it is not possible at present to exclude British trawlers from fishing in our <Col N="619" /> waters.  There is some sort of a Commonwealth arrangement to that effect, but it does not appeal to me. I believe that the English are as much foreigners as any other nationality, and that they are the greatest offenders on our own coasts.  British trawlers are certainly the greatest fishery pirates. About 90 per cent. of those who infringe on our fishing rights, and who prey upon the fishing around our coasts are English.  Why should we not have some power to deal with them? The only way at present is the limited law that we have.  That is a point to which the Minister might pay some regard.  Trawlers of every kind, including those belonging to Saorstát Eireann, should be forbidden to fish within the three-mile limit.  That limit should be clearly defined.  We hear a great deal about boats being captured. I never heard of a trawler being captured by the &ldquo;Muirchu.&rdquo;  The poor &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; could capture nothing.  We see reports in the newspapers about foreign boats being captured.  They turn out to be poor French lobster men, with small boats from 27 to 30 feet long.  Did anyone ever hear of the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; capturing an English trawler complete with wireless, and probably more than once and a half her tonnage?  That shows the inadequacy of the present protection. In the past prosecutions failed, to some extent, because technically the Civic Guards, who brought the prosecutions, were not sea fishery protection officers.  As to stopping boats and boarding them, who is going to do that?  What provision is there on the sea to stop trawlers steaming 15 or 16 knots an hour?  There is no such provision in this Bill.  Powers are being taken, but there are no means at our disposal to put those powers into effect.  They can snap their fingers at us.  I am calling the Minister's attention to what I consider to be the wrong definition of the three mile limit, and to the inadequacy of the protection indicated by the Bill.  Before the Bill passes I hope the Minister will give the House some idea of his contemplated power, so that there will be some adequate authority at sea to get <Col N="620" /> at poachers.  At the same time, I think this Bill is a step in the right direction and, as such, I am in favour of it.  It shows that some Department has at last awakened from its slumbers, and that some one has taken cognisance of the deplorable condition of our sea fisheries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Except for the bleating of Deputy Kelly from Dublin not a word, not a suggestion, from the Fianna Fáil Party for the improvement of this Bill, and God knows there is ample scope for improvement.  Deputy O'Neill stated that he believes that the time has come when somebody has wakened up, and that something is going to be done.  That reminds me very much of a peacock spreading its tail, but we have absolutely no certainty that when the sun of publicity goes down, the peacock will not close up his feathers.  It is all eye-wash.  We are taking grand powers to do the world and all, but we know perfectly well that there is not the slightest intention of doing anything. There is an effective way of doing something, and that is to place a statutory obligation on the Minister to maintain adequate patrols and to define in the body of the statute what this House considers to be adequate patrols.  That is the only way.  If that is not done we can pass Bills until the cows come home. The Minister knows that perfectly well. If reason prevailed in this country&mdash; which, of course, it does not since Fianna Fáil came into office&mdash;I could never see why some kind of reciprocal arrangement could not be made with Great Britain to have penalties imposed on British trawlers in the courts of this country, enforceable in Great Britain.  Under the Workmen's Compensation Act and under certain other Acts, where it is to the manifest advantage of both countries to see that <Col N="621" /> justice was enforced, there has never been any difficulty in making a reciprocal arrangement, not only with the British Government, but with Continental Governments for the enforcement of the decrees of Irish courts.</P>
      <P>There are two alternatives.  One is to put a statutory obligation on the Minister to maintain adequate patrols. That is an expensive business.  To my mind the argument that our fisheries are, comparatively speaking, a trifle, is no argument against maintaining efficient patrols in our territorial waters.  You might as well tell me that if a man goes to the street corner and steals goods worth 10/-, there is no necessity to send a Civic Guard after him, because it would cost more than 10/- to do so.  The law is the law and it should be maintained.  If anyone breaks the law, whether by shouting &ldquo;Up the Republic,&rdquo;&ldquo;Up Dev,&rdquo;&ldquo;Up France,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Up Great Britain,&rdquo; that person should be made amenable to the law, and that applies to members of the I.R.A.  just as it does to trawlers, wherever they come from.  There is no other way of effectively making everybody amenable to the law than by maintaining Irish patrol forces which will be very expensive, that is, to open negotiations forthwith with the Government of Great Britain and the Government of France to make decrees or judgments directed against French or British trawlers recoverable in France and Great Britain.  That may be possible and it may not.  It is worth trying and if it fails, there ought to be statutory obligation placed on the Minister to put effective controls on this coast and to give some sense and meaning to the high falutin' section here that says that if a boat refuses to heave-to when called upon to do so, a warning shot may be fired and then the patrol boat may fire into the boat, or take any such other steps as the captain may think fit.  Section 7, sub-section (1) (h) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>... he may after first causing a gun to be fired as a signal, fire at or into such boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sounds lovely, but what is the use of giving a man power to fire into a boat if he has not the power to <Col N="622" /> approach within 20 miles, and if everybody knows perfectly well that he has not got the power to approach within 20 miles?  You have a steam trawler with wireless apparatus and the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; comes lumbering up on the horizon and the captain of the trawler either gets a message from the mainland or the first trawler in the fleet sends the message down along the line to clear away, as the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; is on the rampage.  They behave themselves temporarily off the Cork coast, while they do anything they damned well please up on the Donegal coast.  When the old &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; struggles up there, as I must say she does with all the activity at her disposal&mdash;and I have never turned to the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; yet, and I have turned to her more than once, that she did not go cruising off&mdash;she usually got there 24 hours after the offending trawler had closed down and gone away.  She got there, but not before everybody had been warned she was coming.  So far as that aspect of it is concerned, there are two ways out. One is to make reciprocal arrangements and the other is to put up effective control.  Before this Bill leaves the Oireachtas, the Minister should give definite undertakings to do one thing or the other.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill speaks of the collapse of the Irish fishing industry, and in my opinion, one of the most potent causes for the collapse is the lack of demand. The complaint I have heard&mdash;and I have no doubt that Deputy Blaney is watching me for the purpose of detecting me in a stumble, and I am sure he will confirm me&mdash;is that most of the fishermen cannot sell their fish when they catch it.  I want to pay a tribute to the Sea Fisheries Association.  I think that since they were set up they have done splendid work and extremely valuable work and they undertook the tasks that were put before them with great vision and with great courage, and they had very great tasks to undertake. One enterprise which they put in hand was the distribution of white fish through the rural areas in modern packages and with up-to-date methods. My only regret is that they did not develop it more rapidly.  Perhaps they might not have been able to do it to <Col N="623" /> the high standard they set for themselves if they were to develop it rapidly, but so far as they were able to go, it was valuable work and useful work and if we could create a steady demand for all the white fish that the inshore fishermen could land, I think that we would do quite as valuable service as anything we could do by way of restricting the activities of trawlers, vital and important as the restriction of trawlers is.  Deputy O'Neill, when speaking inferred from the Bill that we have got no power to deal with British trawlers.  Am I mistaken when I draw the meaning from sub-section (2) of Section 3 that under this Bill, we can deal with British trawlers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That, in fact, is one of the improvements provided by this Bill. Heretofore, there was some difficulty about dealing with British trawlers, but this Bill puts it beyond doubt that we can deal with them as we would with French trawlers, or trawlers coming from any foreign port.  The sub-section sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If any sea-fishing boat which is not a Saorstát Eireann sea-fishing boat, enters within the exclusive fishing limits of Saorstát Eireann for any purpose mentioned in the foregoing sub-section the following provisions shall have effect...</P>
      <P>I think that should be cleared up.  As I understand that Section 3, it means that we can exclude a British trawler from fishing in the territorial waters of the Irish Free State.  Am I correct in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We can exclude them absolutely.  In so far as that is true, I believe it is a most desirable arrangement. We ought to have power to exclude all trawlers of extra-Saorstát origin and to regulate the activities of Saorstát trawlers.  I am all in favour of severe penalties, exemplary penalties, when you are dealing with offences such as are adverted to in this Bill, but I would draw the Minister's attention to sub-section (3) of Section 7 which says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> No action or other legal proceedings whatsoever whether civil or criminal shall be instituted in any court in Saorstát Eireann in respect of the doing of anything authorised to be done by a sea fisheries protection officer under this section where such thing is done personally by a sea fisheries protection officer or by a person acting under the orders of a sea fisheries protection officer.</P>
    <P>Surely that goes too far?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, but it is very difficult at first glance, to see what the eventual judicial interpretation of such a section as that will be.  If the Minister can refer me to some statutory precedent for that, with judicial decisions on it showing that if a man went outside the scope of his authority he was made liable immediately for a criminal act, I would have no difficulty in accepting that sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, I am quite satisfied with regard to that.  If the Minister would look at paragraph (b) (ii) of Section 10, he will see there that it will not be an offence for the master of a boat charged with having committed an offence, if he can prove that the acts alleged to constitute such offence were not done by him personally.  Does that mean that if his boat comes within the three-mile limit, he can make the case that the man who happened to be at the tiller at the time his boat crossed the line is responsible for the offence and that he is not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That covers that objecttion fully.  With reference to Section 17, are the regulations referred to therein by-laws and will a breach of the regulations made under Section 17 render a person liable to the new and heavier penalties prescribed by the Bill?  The Minister has already referred to the new and heavier penalties for the breach of by-laws. Will a person who may be guilty of a breach of the regulations made under Section 17 become liable to the new and heavier penalties prescribed under the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In that event I would suggest to the Minister, where there are very heavy penalties attached to the breach of condition, he should revert to the old affirmative form of making regulations.  That is to say that instead of providing that where the regulations lie on the Table of the House for 21 days without notice, they will become operative, he should provide that the regulations shall be confirmed by a resolution of the House. It is only a detail but as a matter of principle, where it is proposed to attach heavy penalties to regulations, I think it is very much better to have the regulations affirmatively adopted by the Oireachtas rather than by sending men to jail, perhaps, for a breach of a regulation which, in fact, is made by a member of the Civil Service, no matter how responsible that civil servant may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill has rejoiced that somebody has woken up.  I do not <Col N="626" /> believe that anybody has woken up. I believe somebody has stirred uneasily in his sleep and I want evidence of something more than a passing nightmare. The only effective evidence that can be provided for this House will be evidence of effective measures for punishing people who transgress the law.  That can be done in two ways.  The first is by providing sufficient patrol boats to sink any trawler that flagrantly defies the law.  The other way is to make reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain and France, the two principal trawling trespassers, that judgments and penalties imposed by Irish courts will be enforceable within their jurisdiction. Without that, this Fishery Bill is not worth the paper it is written on and nobody knows that better than the Minister.  I am not quite satisfied that the Minister does know very well because he has only recently taken over the Fishery Department, but to anybody who has been interested in fisheries for some years and who is aware of the cynical indifference of most people to Fishery Bills, just because they know they cannot be enforced, the production of another such as this is a joke.  The Minister is having a stormy time in the sphere of agriculture.  He has found himself checked and harassed heretofore.  His natural docility and personal charm make it difficult for him to vent his rage upon the position in this House. I suggest that the irritation which he must endure from day to day at the frustration of all his hopes and schemes in the Department of Agriculture might well be vented on the foreign trawlers.  I suggest that it would be quite poetic justice and I can further assure him that if he comes to this House for any necessary assistance to strengthen his arm or inflame his ardour we shall give him all he wants.  We shall give him every encouragement, every facility and he can go and work off his bad temper, his distress and his disappointment on the people who are making it difficult for the fishermen of this country to survive.</P>

There is an old saying that empty vessels make the most sound.  Deputy Dillon has talked here for some time and for a front bencher in Opposition he has made some very irresponsible statements.

      <P>I do accept it, but I thought he said that.  However, we shall see the official report.  He talked about making an agreement with Britain.  The Government that was in office before Fianna Fáil were there for ten years.  Deputy Lynch, in the first or second month of 1924 promised a Fishery Bill, but he went out of office eight years later, and the Fishery Bill had not been introduced.  Now we are attempting for the first time to afford some measure of protection for our fisheries.  I do not say that it is all <Col N="628" /> that might be necessary.  I do not say that it is even an adequate measure of protection, but it is certainly a step forward, and a vast improvement on anything that was ever attempted before.  For a number of years past we have had the farce of foreign trawlers being captured.  The &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; did capture some trawlers. They were brought to various ports even in Donegal.  The farce was gone through of having the skippers brought to court and fined, but there was no power to retain the vessels or seize the nets or gear.  The result was that all that energy and cost went for nothing. Power is taken in this Bill to detain such vessels.  I think that is a big step towards the protection of our fisheries. If the powers taken are carried out and the Minister sets up the necessary machinery, I believe that a great deal of protection will be afforded towards our fisheries, and that the Bill, so far as it goes, will be welcomed by the fishermen on the Donegal coast.</P>

      <P>With regard to the points raised, I am satisfied that there is a clause in the 1882 Act almost identical with the clause brought in here with regard to the indemnification of officers. With regard to the question raised by Deputy Dillon as to the regulations, I think we did not understand each other.  There would be no penalties in the regulations.  It is not intended to impose heavy penalties for a breach of the regulations themselves.  The regulations, of course, would be concerned with some of the sections in the Bill where heavy penalties are mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it under some other statute the Minister makes by-laws?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As to the three-mile limit, the present limit, as mentioned by Deputy Lynch and others, is three miles from the high water wark and a line drawn across a bay ten miles wide and three miles outside that.  In that way we get the territorial waters. I do not know if Deputy Lynch was right when he said that when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition they said that the three-mile limit should be extended. Perhaps that was said.  It would be desirable if it could be done, but it is <Col N="629" /> rather difficult.  It must be done either by force or by agreement with the other nations.  If we are not able to force them we shall have to get them to agree to do it, and either is rather difficult just at present.  The same thing applies to enforcing fines that Deputy Lynch spoke of.  He asked why we should not get fines enforced in Great Britain and France and so on.  We have not very much to offer as a reciprocal arrangement.  We have not trawlers going to the French and British coast and taking their fish, so that they are not very interested in making a reciprocal arrangement.  At present it is a one-sided thing and that is the difficulty about it.  We have not, however, as Deputy O'Neill suggests, lost hope altogether of reciprocal arrangements in this Bill.  He suggested that we had adopted a three-mile limit and that we had no hope of going any further or of making a reciprocal arrangement.  The Deputy will see that in Section 2 we provide for treaties and conventions.  If, at any time, we are able to make a friendly arrangement with any of the nations whose boats are fishing around our coasts we hope to be able to get more than the three-mile limit from them. But, as we stand, however, it would be very difficult, because we would want to send our trawlers to do a little poaching in their waters before we get an agreement from them.  Deputy O'Neill said the three-mile limit should be from low water and not high water. There, again, we would have the difficulty either of enforcing our law or getting an agreement upon it, and either might not be possible just now. Then as to another matter raised by Deputy O'Neill, we can under the Bill deal with British trawlers.  Up to this we could not, as the power was not there.  Under the Bill we shall have power to deal with British trawlers. The Deputy says that no British trawler was ever captured by the &ldquo;Muirchu.&rdquo; That is true, because our officers had no authority to interfere with British trawlers.  They never tested their strength against a British trawler.  We shall have to wait and see whether they will have to do it under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that the Bill is <Col N="630" /> all eye-wash.  I do not think it is.  I suppose we shall have to wait and see whether anything comes out of it or not.  We are bringing in the Bill because we think it is the right thing to start with.  It would be ridiculous to spend £50,000 or £100,000 on patrol boats and not have any authority behind them.  Surely the first thing to do is to get the authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There ought to be statutory obligation on you to provide patrol boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should get the authority first before we purchase patrol boats.  The penalties provided for are very severe, and we think that they will act as a deterrent, and that we should give some short time, at any rate, to the patrol services we have and the other ways we may have of getting after these people.  It is likely that we may have to come and ask for more patrol boats and a reinforcement of the coastal defences in that way. Deputy Lynch said that when he was Minister for Fisheries he had great difficulty in convincing the Minister for Finance at the time of the advisability of and justification for spending more money on fisheries defence, because the value of the fish caught at the time was so very small.  I believe that was true. In fact, I am sure it would be still rather difficult to convince the Minister for Finance.  His argument would probably be that money could be spent in better ways than that, because the receipts from fisheries are very small. We hope, however, that things will improve somewhat through the efforts of the Sea Fisheries Association, and also from a change of market.  Deputy Dillon said that the whole thing was the loss of the market.  That is true. I am not sure whether he said the foreign or home market, but there is something in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke of both.  I referred to the German market and foreign markets generally, and to the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a serious loss in the herring and mackerel market, and the Scottish fishermen are in much the same position as our own. <Col N="631" /> They have suffered very severely as a result of Russia, Germany and America, where there was a good market for herrings and mackerel, practically supplying their own demands.  The Irish and the Scotch fisherman have suffered as a result of that.  We are turning, however, to the development of the home market for white fish, and that development is likely to lead to an improved market for the type of fish that we use at home.  It is really the only dependable market at present for fishermen.  Deputy Lynch raised a matter also with regard to the minimum penalty.  He said that there was a maximum penalty, but no minimum.  I do not think that there is any necessity for it.  In some Acts, the penalty is actually named, and the judge has no option but to inflict that penalty.  In practically all Acts of this kind there is a maximum penalty, and the justice is given discretion to go below it.  In a case of this kind, where he will be dealing with foreign trawlers which are destroying the prospects of our own fishermen, the district justice is not likely to be too lenient.  Therefore, I think we need not mention a minimum penalty.  A boat may be taken up at times for a more or less technical offence and it would, perhaps, be unfair to inflict the maximum penalty in that case.  It would be better to give discretion to the justice to inflict a small penalty for a trivial offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch raised a question regarding the by-law areas.  He is quite right in saying that the difficulty is that, in these areas, the by-laws can only be enforced against Saorstát boats, that foreign boats are only bound by the territorial-water rule and can fish outside the three-mile limit. Sometimes, the by-laws extend beyond the three-mile limit, so that our own fishermen are prohibited from fishing in a certain area in which foreign fishermen can fish.  That is a grievance in England as well as here.  Deputy O'Neill referred to the development of the Nymph Bank.  That is outside our exclusive fishery rights and, if we were to develop that, we should have no <Col N="632" /> right to protect it.  We should be developing it so that foreign fishermen could come along and reap the harvest of any expenditure we might incur.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill. It is necessary in order to confirm Financial Resolutions Nos. 1 to 8, which were recently reported to the Dáil. Advantage has been taken of the opportunity afforded by the introduction of the Bill to make certain minor changes in the administration of the Customs laws which experience has shown to be desirable.  I presume that the main discussion on the Bill will take place on Committee Stage and that it will suffice now if I briefly indicate the purport of each section of the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 1, 2, 3 and 5 confirm Financial Resolutions 1, 2, 6 and 5 which, respectively, imposed duties on rose bushes, grass seeds, women's clothing and certain classes of bottles.  With regard to women's clothing and bottles, it should be emphasised that no additional tariffs are being imposed by this Bill.  The duties included in this measure were previously in operation under Emergency Orders.  The Emergency Orders in question were revoked, with effect as from 24th November, the date upon which the duties became chargeable by virtue of the resolution passed by the House.  Section 4 of the <Col N="633" /> Bill covers the First Schedule and confirms Financial Resolution No. 3, which imposed or altered duties on a variety of articles, such as bicycle hubs, under-axles, belts and belting, liquid driers and lamp shades.  Section 6 covers the Second Schedule, with the exception of Reference Nos. 3, 5, 6a and 6c, the provisions of which I shall explain later.  The Schedule, generally, is in confirmation of Financial Resolution No. 4.  This resolution related to duties on a variety of articles amongst which may be mentioned rubber boots, clothing and picture frames&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Reference No. 3 of the Second Schedule provides for the amendment of Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1932.  Under this section, there is general power to issue licences for free importation of dutiable goods where such goods are essential to a process of manufacture and are unobtainable and unlikely to be obtainable in Saorstát Eireann. Experience has shown that the expression &ldquo;process of manufacture&rdquo; is too rigid in its application and involves inequalities amongst industrial concerns. It is, therefore, proposed under this reference to provide power to construe the expression &ldquo;process of manufacture&rdquo; as including <Col N="634" /> any industrial process and also any industrial operation, whether of the nature of construction, assemblage, repairing or other similar nature.</P>
      <P>Reference No. 5 of the Second Schedule provides for the substitution of a wider licensing provision in regard to a number of dutiable articles in respect of which a restricted licensing power already exists.  It also provides for a licensing power for certain cast-iron articles for which no licence can at present be granted.  In these cases it has also been represented that experience has shown that the existing licensing power is too rigid, that its limited nature has caused hardship and has involved some manufacturers in outlay which it was not anticipated they would have to bear when the duties were first imposed.</P>
      <P>Reference 6 (a) of the Second Schedule, which relates to a duty on picture frames, in fact, makes no change in the existing position.  It is a verbal change which the Revenue Commissioners suggested for the sake of clarity and to remove any doubts. Reference 6 (c) provides for the insertion of a licensing clause in respect of certain articles made wholly or mainly of brass, bronze or gun-metal.  Sections 7 and 8 confirm Financial Resolutions, Section 7 in regard to taxation on motor vehicles and certain minor matters which were recently agreed to by the Dáil.  I may say in connection with Section 7 that there will be a minor amendment proposed on the Committee Stage to paragraph (f) where it will be proposed to omit the words &ldquo;and is not used as a public service vehicle within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act, 1933 (No. 11 of 1933).&rdquo;  No. 8 is the one which proposes to make it clear, where a mechanically-propelled vehicle is licensed on the ground that it would be used for one purpose, and is thereafter used for another purpose in respect of which a higher duty would be payable, that that vehicle will be properly chargeable with the higher duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 brings the law as regards drawbacks and reimportation, in the case of woven tissues, into the same state as it is in regard to other dutiable goods.  Section 10 clears up a point of <Col N="635" /> doubt which has arisen in regard to the computation of value.  Sections 11, 12 and 13 are self-explanatory and are characteristic of Finance Acts generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Bill more than one point arises.  I think now is the time to raise the general question as to whether it is consistent with good governmental practice that the Emergency Duties Act, which was got from the Oireachtas on the representation that it was necessary to meet day to day emergencies, should be habitually used as an ordinary instrument of change in fiscal duties.  It is now becoming the practice, whenever the Minister for Industry and Commerce imposes a duty, to impose it under the Emergency Duties Act and then to come to the Dáil and get some kind of confirmatory Act passed.  The Emergency Duties Act was to provide for such emergencies as might arise from day to day, and the House was clearly left under the impression that if the British Government put on some penal tariff the Saorstát Government must have a weapon in their hands with which to retaliate with a similar tariff, if the Oireachtas were not sitting when the penal tariff was put on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember from that bench opposite saying that this was a very grave incursion on the rights of Parliament and a very dangerous departure.  The President thumped the table and said it was a vote of confidence in Fianna Fáil, and that anyone who would suggest that a Government of which he was the head would attempt to infringe upon the prerogatives of Parliament, as a result of having got these powers in a peculiar emergency, deserved to perish with such words upon his lips. Of course, the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not take so rigid a view, and it has now become the regular practice, if you want a duty, to impose it under this Act, although it has no relation, good, bad or indifferent, to the international complications in which the Government are involved.  Nobody, of course, in the Fianna Fáil Party knows or cares how the tariffs are being put on.  Still, <Col N="636" /> while there are some vestiges of Parliamentary Government left undisturbed in this country, I think it is well to make a passing protest at the dictatorial powers the Minister for Industry and Commerce has taken to himself.</P>

I make that passing protest because I am perfectly satisfied the members of the Fianna Fáil Party do not know and do not care how these things are being done.  It is well to bring it before their attention so that later on they may be the judges of their own measure of responsibility for the situation they are helping to create.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently he is an energetic and enthusiastic young man and, under prudent guidance, he can do very useful work in this House.  I take it the measure of duty imposed on hosiery remains the same.  I think it right to point out here, as I did on another occasion to the members of the Labour Party, that the duties imposed here on hosiery are going to be borne exclusively by the poor.  They are going to result in a material increase in the price of essential commodities to the poor.  In my opinion, with a considerable experience of the hosiery trade, they are going to do Irish factories very little good; the people who will have to forego the cheap cotton hose and underwear for which this tariff is prohibitive will simply have to do without these things altogether, because they will not be able to afford what the Irish factories will be in a position to produce, albeit that the quality of the Irish product is admittedly superior.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection I think it right to say that this is a very useful instance of the effect that this unrestricted and improvident system of <Col N="638" /> imposing tariffs is having on the cost of living of the people of the country. Dr. Ryan, speaking a couple of weeks ago commiserated with the working farmers of the country and he said: &ldquo;On your behalf I have no hesitation in asking the people of the cities to pay a halfpenny or three farthings per lb. more for their sugar when you have to pay 100 per cent. more for everything than you had to pay before the war.&rdquo;  That is Dr. Ryan's opinion of the effect of his colleagues' policy and his colleagues will remember his speech.  Dr. Ryan's reaction to that is not to go to his colleagues and say: &ldquo;stop piling it up,&rdquo; his reaction to it is: &ldquo;I warn you that for every shilling your put on the farmers' backs I will plant 2/- on the backs of the townsmen&rdquo; and we go on piling up and spending the proceeds as if it were great fun.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in dealing with this matter referred to Sections 9 or 10 which increases the powers for licensing.  That is to say it increases the powers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to admit under licence duty free, certain commodities that would otherwise be dutiable.  Far from desiring to extend his powers in that matter I think these powers ought to be taken away from him altogether.  When I use the words &ldquo;Minister for Industry and Commerce,&rdquo; the Minister recognises that I speak of him as a body corporate. I do not think that he or any other Minister for Industry and Commerce should have such powers because inevitably political pressure will be brought to bear which he might be able to withstand but which some successor might not be able to withstand.</P>
    <P>In this connection I draw the attention of the House to a case I have already brought under their notice. That was the case of a flour importer in Donegal.  That gentleman under a provision very similar to the licensing provisions in this Bill got permission to import flour, nominally in order to make it possible for him to carry on a baking enterprise in which he was interested.  His permit, if my memory serves me right, was for 500 tons of bakers' flour.  But in fact he brought <Col N="639" /> in 250 tons of bakers' flour and 250 tons of household flour of a well-known brand.  The result of that operation was that he was in a position to go into competition with his competitors in trade and offer household flour at from 3/- to 4/- a sack less than the figure at which they were able to buy it.  Whenever he thought it expedient to do so he did that.  Not once but on three or four occasions I asked to have that case investigated and I inquired what penalties the Minister proposed to impose on a person who got a permit from him by fraud or misrepresentation.  I do not think I ever got satisfaction from the Minister in that matter.  The Minister is familiar with the case to which I refer.</P>
    <P>I consider that this system of empowering the Minister to waive duties imposed by the authority of the Oireachtas is wrong.  If a commodity cannot bear a duty without doing substantial injustice to a considerable number of people who use that commodity, then the duty should not be imposed.  If a greater good is served by imposing the duty then the duty should be imposed and everybody should have to pay.  If however the Minister is resolved to have powers of this kind, then these powers ought to be vested in some body analogous to the Revenue Commissioners, a body who would be autonomous and independent of pressure from this House or from politicians no matter to what Party they belonged.  Such powers ought not to be exercised by a Minister who is dealing in the rough and tumble of political Party life.  The remainder of the Bill deals principally with minor amendments of the existing duty which are apparently of no very vital importance.  This Bill I think purports to confirm the duty on grass seeds.  Does it not?</P>

      <P>In that connection I think it well to point out to the responsible Minister that there are firms in England who have made a speciality of putting up such combinations of grass seeds as are recommended by the Department of Agriculture <Col N="640" /> for laying down meadows or pasture lands.  Whether there are seedsmen in this country who will prepare an equally satisfactory combination of seed, I would not be quite prepared to say.  But I think that is a matter that is deserving of looking into.  The Minister might consider the desirability of exempting from the tariff rye-grass mixtures of seed which have only as a component part one variety or another of rye-grass. That could be done in the body of the Bill by specifically excluding rye-grass when it was combined say, with wild white clover, because nobody would combine so expensive a seed as wild white clover, except in such circumstances as I have indicated where the person would be buying under the recommendations of the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the principle raised by the last speaker I do not find so much fault as with the use of the principle.  As a protectionist I do believe that in the building up of industries in this country the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance or whoever he may be should be able to mobilise his forces according to circumstances. When the Government has a protectionist policy, when this House in broad principle supports that policy and when the country, broadly speaking, supports it, the Minister should be able to mobilise his forces.  Many industries could not wait, or circumstances might arise which would render it impossible for them to wait for the slow process of legislation to come to their aid.  I rather think, however, that the Minister has made, I would not say a reckless use of those powers, but I would say that he has used them as if they were the ordinary procedure of dealing with a protected industry rather than looking upon them as exceptional powers that he would be driven to use only in exceptional circumstances.  I think the Minister should come to the House for power to impose tariffs otherwise by a supplementary Budget; that he should come to the House as often or on every occasion that would be at all feasible lest some industry would <Col N="641" /> suffer by the delay.  That, however, is a matter of detail as regards the carrying out of the powers given to the Minister rather than a criticism of the principle conferring those powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry I did not hear the Minister's introductory remarks on Sections 1 and 2.  I would be interested to hear the reasons which actuated the Government to impose a tariff of 6d. a bush on rose bushes.  I am as strongly in favour of protecting our horticultural and agricultural industries as any member of the House. The Government may have exceptional reasons for doing this that are not known to ordinary Deputies.  I have been told that the Minister for Finance, in his introductory speech, did not deal with these two sections at all, so that when the Minister is replying I would be glad to hear some reasons advanced for this tariff.  I do not want to say that the horticultural industry is in a backward state in this country, because if I did such a statement might offend some people, but it certainly is not as advanced as in other countries.  It is an industry that may be improved by the importation of good specimens of horticultural products.  Therefore, I do not think that these bushes should be tariffed.  After all, those who want to have the best and the newest in rose trees should not be obliged to pay a tariff on them.  A tariff of 6d. a bush is very high.  By the time a bush reaches a purchaser, having gone through the various retail processes, it may cost him 9d. or 1/-.  I think the Minister ought to reconsider that tariff.  If he is able to advance good reasons for it I would not be opposed to it, but I am anxious to know the reasons.  Neither can I understand why a tariff of 2/- per cwt. is being put on all descriptions of imported grass seeds.  That is an extraordinary imposition.  I would like to know where first-class grass seed is produced in the Free State.  I hope the Government do not look on this as a new way of increasing tillage.  I hope, too, they do not think that if they deprive a man of getting good grass seed to lay down in broken ground <Col N="642" /> that he will continue tilling it rather than put in weedy stuff.  I can safely say without fear of contradiction that a first-class mixture cannot be produced for one, two or three years lea, or for permanent pasture from grass seeds and clovers produced here. I would be glad if the Minister would reconsider that section.  I have no comment to offer on the other sections, but speaking generally I think the Department of Industry and Commerce should regard the exercise of the powers given under these Emergency Acts for imposing tariffs as the exception rather than the rule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to see whether, even at the last moment, I can impress the Minister with the honesty of the demand that has been voiced in various quarters in this country in favour of a reconsideration of this proposal dealing with secondhand clothing.  The House will remember that, on the last occasion when the Financial Resolutions were under consideration, the Minister indicated that he had information that the people engaged in the pawnbroking business in this country could supply the whole of the demand for that trade here.  I have gone into the matter since.  I have got a good deal of information from people closely concerned in this trade, and as a result I am afraid that the information supplied to the Minister is not quite correct: that the supplies available would fall very far short of meeting the requirements of the trade.  I want to say again that there is in the country a very strong demand for fair play for the people for whom this type of clothing is a necessity as well as for the people who are endeavouring to live honestly out of the trade.  I appreciate fully the Minister's difficulties: that there has been a considerable number of cases of unfair evasion of the duties previously imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that on a previous occasion, when representations were made in this House on the same subject, the Minister showed a desire to meet the situation fully.  I would ask him not to be discouraged by the fact that certain people have not met him in the spirit that he was prepared himself <Col N="643" /> to meet the representations made previously, and, in fact, did meet them.  While I realise the difficulty of making a suggestion that would have the effect of bringing about an arrangement that would be fair to the State and to the people engaged in this industry, I do think the Minister might consider, having regard to the fact that there are a number of honest people in the trade, people whom the officers of his own Department and those in the Department of the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied are playing the game fairly and squarely in the matter of the duties imposed, whether it would not be possible to make an arrangement to centralise the whole of this trade with some representatives of the people engaged in the trade, so that the whole trade should pass through their hands. I do not know whether that suggestion is feasible or not: whether it would not be possible to pick out a few persons whose record in this connection is known to be unimpeachable, and whether the Minister could not arrange that the trade would pass through their hands on satisfying himself that there would be no attempt at evasion of the duties, and that the State would not suffer in consequence. I want the Minister to remember all the time that, apart from the people who are getting their living out of this industry, there is throughout the country, no matter what may be said to the contrary, a very strong demand for this type of clothing.  It is a fact, and it cannot be stressed too often, that there are a great many people in this country now as in the past who would find it impossible to clothe themselves with any semblance of decency were it not for the fact that they can get secondhand clothes at a price they can afford to pay.  My suggestion may present difficulties that the Minister may be unable to overcome.  If that is so, I realise that it cannot be pressed.  In that event I suggest to the Minister that he might endeavour to arrange for some substantial remission of the duties now contemplated.  It is, I think, clear that he will not be able to revert back to the old position, but <Col N="644" /> I do suggest that as between the duties previously agreed upon and the duties now suggested, he might fix some figure that will make it possible for this trade to be continued.  I may mention, in that connection, that I am informed that the duties now proposed to be put in force will put a good many people out of business. There are a good many people in that kind of business&mdash;women particularly&mdash;who have to support either an invalid husband or an unemployed husband, and other people who are using this kind of trade as a sort of auxiliary to some other small business, who want to live honestly and to pay every penny that the State deems right and proper that they should pay, who will be put out of business as a result of these duties.  While I cannot offer any alternative suggestion to the one I have offered to the Minister as to how these difficulties should be met, I would ask the Minister whether or not it is possible to see about the centralisation of the whole trade.  I would ask the Minister to consider the whole question and bring to the House proposals that would reduce substantially the duties now contemplated in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Well, grass seeds, as a local term, is only applied in our part of the country to rye grass seed. While I know that this House is committed very definitely to a course of protection, I should like the Minister for Agriculture to review this.  It is our experience that after sowing the home-grown seed for a couple of years running it does not give sufficient yield after that.  There is not so much saving of the rye grass seed in the Southern counties as we have in the Northern counties, and we find that if you continue sowing for a certain number of years you will not have the same yield.  I should like to know from the Minister whether or not there would be any way of keeping the seed renewed.  The practice with a <Col N="645" /> good many of us is that we buy for a certain portion of the year a small quantity of pure Scotch or Italian seed and from that seed we sow the land for a number of years.  We find that it is a better system and that if we follow on beyond that there is a loss of yield and not the same strength in the permanent pasture.  I can tell the Minister that from my own experience, and I should be glad if he would examine the position from that point of view and see if we could have a renewal of our stock.  On the present computation it would mean about 6d. a bushel and, I suppose, for retailing it would amount to 9d.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Dillon, having spoken, left the House, because I wanted to give him a few words of advice.  I think that somebody should tell him that if he wants to carry any weight in the political life of this country he should count ten before he rises to make a speech.  As Deputy Dillon is not here I can only advise his colleagues, in his and in their own interests, to count up to at least ten thousand before allowing him to make a speech, because every time he speaks he reveals enormous gaps in the policy of his Party.  The Party which the Deputy has joined recently set out their policy in a number of paragraphs.  In that statement they told us what they stood for and I thought that, at long last, we had been given a final declaration on their policy.  I had been advising them, in previous debates, to tell us what they stood for.  Up to the formation of the new Party we had one member announcing one policy and another announcing another policy, and we had all the members of the back benches of that Party advocating any policy that came into their minds.  Apparently, during the Recess, they came to an agreement as to some policy, but if Deputy Dillon's speech is an indication of the position it is an indication that disunity has arisen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon talked of general considerations and I think that I am properly in order in dealing with general considerations.  General considerations <Col N="646" /> are what we should deal with on the Second Reading of a Bill. I am only dealing with the general considerations raised in the course of the discussion.  Deputy Dillon, apparently, must not read the <i>United Irishman.</i>  It is quite clear that if he does read it he has not learned anything from it.  Week after week and month after month that paper has been preaching the futility of parliamentary institutions, the glory of the Fascist State and the great advantage it would be to this country if we copied the German or Italian Fascists.</P>

They did not state the nature of the reform, but the references to Fascism gave an indication.  Now we have Deputy Dillon saying that he is going to resist to the last any incursion on the rights of the Oireachtas, that anything that encroaches on the rights of this Parliament&mdash;and, of course, anything that might curtail his right to make speeches&mdash;is to be resisted with all the new-found enthusiasm and vigour of the Deputies opposite.  I should be very sorry to see Deputy Dillon expelled from his Party so soon after his entry into it, or to see the Deputy expelling the Party, but either must eventuate if the Deputy is going to repudiate in this manner everything that the Great White Chief has been saying.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon said that it is not consistent with the right of Parliament that the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act should be used <Col N="647" /> for the purpose of imposing duties unless they arise out of the economic dispute with great Britain.  He even used the word &ldquo;dictatorship&rdquo; as a term of abuse for the Government in that connection.  Again, I suggest that the Party opposite should make Deputy Dillon think before he gets up to make a speech, because the fact is that an Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act was in operation here before Fianna Fáil took office.  In 1929 Mr. Blythe, who now parades in a blue shirt, denouncing Parliament and asking for a dictatorship, was beginning to develop in that direction.  He introduced an Emergency Imposition of Duties Act long before there was any dispute with Britain.  It is necessary in a country of this size in order to secure power to act promptly in connection with the importation of articles where such importation is likely to have serious consequences. There are many articles of which one large sized ship could bring in enough to supply our needs for years. Irish firms making such an article, in such circumstances, would have to be shut down if such importations took place.  Because of that fact&mdash;the effect of importation upon our markets&mdash; because other countries were showing a tendency towards dumping goods at any price, the late Government took power to act by emergency order, and to act quickly, by stopping the importation of those goods when they heard they were coming here, such orders being subsequently confirmed here in the Dáil.  That Act was a temporary Act and expired last July.  It was not renewed.  It was not necessary because more powers were taken by this Government, but not greater powers than those under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act of last July.  That Act was passed to impose duties by order.</P>

      <P>In every case they were imposed because it would be unwise to wait for the assembly of the Dáil to impose them by resolution of the Dáil.  Deputies opposite speak as if every duty was imposed by emergency order.  That is not so.  Except in the case of two or three of the duties mentioned in this Bill they were all imposed by the ordinary procedure. A financial resolution was first introduced.  It was then confirmed on Report, and later enacted in legislation. That applies to the majority of the duties under this Bill.  That course was adopted because there was no necessity for speedy action, such as existed in the case of duties imposed by emergency order and afterwards confirmed by Act of the Oireachtas. We have this obvious answer to charges made by Deputies opposite. We had to take action quickly occasionally, in order to prevent industrial damage, and we would have neglected our duty if we acted otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that we have powers that no Ministers should have. He wants to take those powers from us, particularly the powers of licensing imports where a case for their importation has been made out.  The fact is that the powers possessed by this Government in regard to licensing of goods are much less than those possessed by the Government of any other country, except Great Britain, and Great Britain is catching up to the position of governments in other countries, and in some cases, they have gone further than we have in licensing the importation of goods. Outside Great Britain, in France, Germany and other countries of the world there are very wide powers in the Executive to deal with matters of this kind by order, and not by legislation. The whole tendency throughout the world is to increase these powers. As everybody knows international trade for some years is being conducted on the basis of international <Col N="649" /> barter by Governments; and to barter effectively, countries must have the power to direct trade into channels through which they want it to go.  The powers we possess are not adequate to enable us to secure a fair deal for ourselves in the world's markets, when we come up against Governments with wider powers, and who are in a position to make these orders either without reference to Parliament or only with reference to Parliament long after the events.</P>

      <P>At present we have no power to license goods except they are goods that are not produced in Saorstát Eireann, and that are required by manufacturers to carry on their process of manufacture.  There are one or two duties in respect to which we have wider powers, but speaking of the general range of duties in respect of which licence powers exist they are very definitely limited.  We have had urgent representations from all sorts of interests, including members of the Party opposite that these powers should be extended because they are so circumscribed at the moment that they are practically valueless.  In this Bill we are presenting an extended definition so as to make these powers more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 of the Finance Act of 1932 is the main section in that regard.  It gives general powers to the Minister for Finance on the recommendation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to permit the importation of any article subject to duty if it is not manufactured in the Saorstát, and if it is required by a manufacturer to carry on the process of his manufacture. For a time that section worked satisfactorily.  But recent cases that came up for decision necessitated the application to it of a much stricter <Col N="650" /> interpretation than the Revenue Commissioners were previously prepared to accept.  For example they decided that the construction of a building was not a process of manufacture, and that goods that might be required for the construction of a building could not be imported free of duty under licence under that section.  Similarly it was decided that if any article of the same kind was manufactured in the Saorstát, no matter how different in character, or price or quality, no licence could be issued.  The section is now extended so that the words &ldquo;process of manufacture&rdquo; shall be construed and have effect as including any industrial process and also including any industrial operation whether of the nature of construction, assemblage, repairing or other similar nature, and the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; shall be construed and have effect accordingly.  That will be found as Reference No. 3 in the Second Schedule.  I am quite certain that if a miracle ever does happen, and that the Party opposite are entrusted with the responsibility of Government, that whatever member of that Party is appointed Minister for Finance will resist, tooth and nail, any proposal of his colleagues to divest him of those powers which he will acquire when appointed to that office.</P>
    <P>It is alleged that these powers are sometimes used wrongly and that political pressure is exercised upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to make him grant concessions to one Party that he refuses to another.</P>
    <P>My answer to that is: &ldquo;I want a single example produced.&rdquo;  Deputy Dillon has spoken about a flour importer in Donegal.  There are Deputies opposite who know that they have frequently&mdash;if not frequently, on occasion, at any rate&mdash;written to me or sent wires to my office urging that special facilities for the importation of flour to Donegal should be given. At one period it was even stated that there was a shortage of flour there. Right from the beginning until we got matters straightened out we have always treated Donegal as a special area where the regulations would be applied much less rigidly than in any <Col N="651" /> other part of the country, because, of course, there is no flour mill there or no flour mill near which is able to supply them.  It took us some time to organise the rest of the flour millers in the Saorstát so as to ensure that a full and regular supply of flour to that county would be available, but we succeeded in doing that.  The flour millers have combined to manufacture flour for Donegal under a common brand, and arrangements have been made with transport organisations which secure for that flour a very low rate indeed, so that it can be sold in Donegal at a price commensurate with the price charged elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon stated that one baker in that county got a licence to import flour, and that the flour imported was not used in his bakery but sold as shop flour in competition with his competitors.  Let me say again that the implication there is that the competitors were at a disadvantage because they had to pay duty upon the flour which they were selling.  That is not so.  The flour which the competitors were selling, if it was not Irish-milled flour, was also flour that was imported free of duty.  At present there is no duty on flour.  There is complete prohibition of the importation of flour, and it cannot come in at all unless a licence is issued.  If a licence is issued the flour is free of duty.  Any competitors selling a corresponding brand of flour also had it free of duty.  It is possible, I will admit, that some person who got a licence to import bakers' flour imported shop flour instead.  In fact, in other parts of the Saorstát no such licence would have been issued. The practice we adopted was to issue those licences only to those who are regularly engaged in the importation of flour.  Subsequent to the changes that were made following the dispute with Great Britain licences were issued only to those who could finance the importation of that flour themselves, and who had been regularly engaged in that trade prior to the introduction of the Cereals Act.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there were any such persons in Donegal at all, but <Col N="652" /> in Donegal we had to vary that procedure by issuing licences to persons who had been engaged in the wholesaling of flour even though they had formerly imported that flour through agents in Dublin, Cork or Limerick. That was done following a conference of the interested parties held in the Department.  A list of those who were to get that facility was drawn up by agreement with everybody in the county interested in the flour trade. Those people would get licences to import flour without any condition as to the nature of the flour being imposed.  We have no power to impose such conditions.  If a baker in some part of Donegal got a licence to import 500 sacks of flour, as Deputy Dillon said, he may have got that licence on making representations to the Department that the flour was required for his bakery, but he was fully entitled under the licence to import flour for any purpose that he liked.  The sole consideration that comes into account when licences are being issued is as to the total quantity of flour that can be permitted.  Not merely has that quantity not been exceeded, but it has never been reached in any of the quota periods up to the present, with the exception of one period, when, in order to enable us to assess the position, a very low quota was fixed, and a second quota was issued before the period had ended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also talked about cotton hosiery, and the difficulties for the poor which the imposition of a minimum duty upon cotton hosiery was going to produce.  There are two answers to that.  One is that the cotton hosiery, which was causing serious dislocation in the market here, was coming mainly from Japan.  It was coming in here at a price which the manufacturers in this country could not possibly get down to, under any circumstances.  I think Deputies are aware that every industrial country in the world is at the present time gravely perturbed by the nature of the competition they are meeting from Japan.  In this morning's paper you will read an account of a discussion on that subject which took place in the British House of Commons yesterday. <Col N="653" /> In the papers of every country you will read of the special measures that are being adopted by Governments in order to protect their industries against the extraordinary competition arising from that country, where the standard of living is very low, where the rate of wages, calculated in our money, is frequently not more than a 1/- or 2/ per week, and where industry is so organised that prices can be achieved which are completely impossible in any other country.  We can, if Deputies wish, get the advantage of all those cheap goods, allow our own industries to disappear, and terminate the attempt to revive them.  I see no reason why we should adopt that policy in relation to cotton goods and not in relation to other classes of goods. There is not the slightest doubt that there is not a single product we produce, whether agricultural or industrial, that we cannot buy cheaper from some other country.  If our only policy is to get goods at the cheapest price at which they can be got anywhere we are going to have a position in which we would produce nothing.  We would all be living on outdoor relief, knowing that goods were cheap, if we had the money to buy them.</P>
    <P>That is not our policy.  We are trying to secure the development of industry here, to secure it with the utmost speed and at the same time to secure it with efficiency.  In fact, the production of cotton goods in this country costs no more than it costs in Great Britain.  We can produce those goods here as cheaply as they can be produced in Great Britain.  In respect of some hosiery goods, because of the very up-to-date equipment of the Irish factories at present, they can be produced here cheaper than they are being produced in Great Britain.  Deputy Dillon attempted to quote Dr. Ryan as saying that we had increased the price of the things the farmer had to buy by 100 per cent.  I do not believe Dr. Ryan said anything half so foolish, because we have not done it.  Deputy Dillon's argument was that because industrial costs were increased by 100 per cent. the Minister for Agriculture was increasing agricultural prices, and the cost of living goes <Col N="654" /> mounting up.  In fact, the cost of living has come down.  Deputies who read the papers will read of the protests made by Deputy Norton and other representatives of different branches of the Civil Service against the substantial cuts which have been made in their cost-of-living bonus because the cost of living was fallen so rapidly.  In fact, with the exception of one or two branches, since protection was afforded to Irish industry, prices have been reduced all round.  In respect of some of those goods the prices prevailing here are lower than in Great Britain.  You can buy a Dodge motor car in this country&mdash;completely assembled in this country, body and chassis&mdash;£50 cheaper than you can buy the same car in Great Britain. There are other classes of goods of which that is true.  One reason is that our industrial equipment is new, and being new, is most up-to-date.  We have been able to take full advantage of the technical experience of other countries to instal the most up-to-date machinery, to devise means to eliminate costs which have prevailed in other countries and which still operate there.  Another reason is that we are starting our industrial development at a time when capital equipment is remarkably cheap. At present you can erect and equip a factory for any class of production at one quarter the price at which a factory of the same size was erected and equipped in Great Britain only five or six years ago.  That very low capitalisation permits again of lower selling prices.  The fact is that not merely are we succeeding in getting industrial development with efficiency but, in many cases, we are beating our main competitors in respect of prices, designs and quality, as well as efficiency in production.</P>
    <P>Let us deal with the particular matters that were mentioned.  So far as grass seed is concerned, the section of the Bill imposes a duty on grass seed, but power is given to the Minister for Agriculture to permit the importation of such seed under any circumstances that he thinks justified. Consequently the suggestion made by Deputy Haslett has already been met. In so far as it is necessary to import <Col N="655" /> small quantities of seed it can be done. That is, in fact, what is contemplated by the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>I accept the Deputy's word on that quite definitely.  However, the point is that the duty was imposed on the recommendation of the Minister for Agriculture some considerable time ago.  It has been in force for a couple of months.  It was fully discussed in the Dáil when the resolution imposing it was passed, and this is merely a confirming Bill.  It was explained that the effect of the resolution was to give the Minister power to regulate imports, to keep out seed that was not required, and to permit it to come in, if required.  The <Col N="657" /> main effect is to secure that those engaged in the production of grass seed in the Northern Counties will be able to find a market, if possible, in the Saorstát, and we also hope for increased production.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not giving any such assurance.  Deputy Murphy raised a question about second-hand clothing.  Since the duty was first imposed the officers of my Department and myself have had opportunities of meeting everybody associated directly or indirectly with the second-hand clothing business here.  We got a variety of views.  I explained on another occasion why it was necessary to change the <i>ad valorem</i> duty into a flat rate duty, owing to the fact that the <i>ad valorem</i> duty was grossly evaded and that the ingenuity of the Revenue Commissioners in detecting the various methods of evasion had been exhausted.  They had in fact admitted themselves beaten on each occasion they devised some scheme to check or to catch those obviously evading them.  We found there was no effective way of dealing with the position so long as the <i>ad valorem</i> duty operated.  It was then decided to impose a flat rate duty.  The fixing of the amount of the flat rate duty was largely a matter of opinion.  One cannot say with certainty in respect to these goods what the duty should be.  In respect of industrial production you can take into account any situation which may make the cost of production here a trifle higher than the import price, or you can take into <Col N="658" /> account the extent of the reduction in the price or the discount which importers are prepared to allow, and fix a duty upon it which, nevertheless, will secure the home market.</P>
      <P>When dealing with second-class clothes you have no standard to go on. You can fix a figure which you think will be effective and stick to that.  The figure we chose was 50 per cent. of the flat rate of duty applied to these goods when new.  That has been in operation for some time, and we have been able to judge the effects.  The position is that there are two types of second-hand clothes imported.  There is a very superior class of clothing which is sold at quite respectable prices.  That clothing is not going to be stopped by this flat rate duty.  In some cases, the flat rate duty will not apply, because the <i>ad valorem</i> duty will be higher. No serious objection to the duty, so far as it applies to that type of clothing, has been forthcoming.  The other class is the very cheap second-hand clothing, in respect of which, while we can argue on general grounds that its entire exclusion would be a benefit to the country, nevertheless, it is a fact that in certain parts it is sold fairly extensively.  The position in that regard, however, is, would any reduction of the duty meet the case of the importers?  If we have to have a duty&mdash;and it is clear that we must, if we are to protect the position here&mdash;a duty of 5/- as is suggested here would be no more hardship, and would be no less effective, than a duty of 4/- or 3/-.  Consequently there is no case for changing the duty because of the effect on that class of clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a quantity of that clothing which originates in the country.  Some of it would be imported in any event. Some of it is brought in in a very dilapidated condition and renovated here and a certain amount of employment is given in that connection.  I do not know if it is very valuable employment or that we should exert ourselves to preserve it, but it is given, nevertheless. Having considered the matter very fully and having had an opportunity of meeting all the interested parties and hearing their representations, <Col N="659" /> I have come to the conclusion that there is no case for amending it at all.  I was rather struck by Deputy Murphy's suggestion that we might achieve the end we have in view in a different manner than by the imposition of the duty&mdash;by regulating the imports and having a system of approved importers with permission to import defined quantities.  I should like to examine that suggestion to see if it could be regarded as practicable, but the possibility of its adoption does not necessarily involve an alteration in the existing duty position.  I think that this Bill should go through in any event.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the imposition of the duty on these goods is going to affect this particular class of trade.  I am not really satisfied that it is going to affect it to anything like the substantial extent which has been represented.  It is, however, necessary that we should check and reduce the importation of this second-hand clothing into this country.  It is a trade peculiar to ourselves.  This second-hand clothing originates in Great Britain where there is no market for it and it is disposed of here.  If we were 100 miles further out in the Atlantic or if we were situated in some other part of Europe, the trade would never have arisen, and in fact these goods are frequently sold, by auction and otherwise, at prices which would have bought the purchaser a much better article turned out from an existing factory in the Saorstát.  The limitation of the trade may have a temporary effect on those who are engaged in it, but we have to take that consequence, knowing that the national effect is going to be, on the whole, beneficial.</P>
    <P>I do not think any other point was raised, and these are, in fact, mainly Committee points.  The Bill will be in Committee in the Dáil to-morrow, and if anybody wants to raise any further points, we can discuss them then.  The principle of the Bill, despite what Deputy Dillon said, is thoroughly sound, and I am quite sure has the approval, if not of Deputy Dillon himself, at least of a number of the members <Col N="660" /> of the Party of which he is now a member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he deems it expedient to acquaint the House with the general line of discussion that took place between himself and the merchant drapers who called on him with reference to the duties imposed by this Bill on hosiery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The merchant drapers represented that the Saorstát hosiery manufacturers could not supply their needs of cotton hosiery.  Their objection was not taken on the ground that the very cheap Japanese hosiery would be excluded, but that they feared a shortage of supply from the Saorstát mills.  I agree fully that when we imposed this duty we sailed close to the wind, in so far as the production actually taking place or in sight in respect of cotton hosiery by native hosiery manufacturers was less, or certainly not greater, than the requirements of the country.  Since the duty has been imposed, however, some rapid developments have taken place.  Almost within a week of the imposition of the duty, we had propositions from no fewer than four British firms who wished to establish factories for the production of these goods here, and in one case to establish a factory of very large size and involving very heavy capital commitment.  In no case have we yet issued a licence, because the examination to date does not show that there is, in fact, room having regard to the fact that three other firms have started or are starting into the production of these goods since the duty was imposed under the auspices of well-known firms in the retail side of the business.  They are either starting production now or installing machinery, and although there may be a temporary shortage, it is, nevertheless, quite clear that the deficiency in production, if it existed, will be made good in a very short time indeed.  I am not so sure that there will be a temporary shortage because the information at my disposal seems to indicate that the stocks available in the country are very large and that they will be quite sufficient to carry the country over the period during which any <Col N="661" /> deficiency in production may take place.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, as I mentioned before, two of the hosiery manufacturers installing machinery for the production of cotton socks particularly on a substantial scale, but the other three firms I have mentioned are proposing to do not merely cotton socks but all sorts of cotton hosiery goods.  They have been facilitated by my Department in getting into speedy production and if the rate of output which they contemplate is in fact achieved, we will have, I think, more than adequate production in the country.  Certain examination is going on at the moment which will determine our policy.  Behind that is a proposal from certain external firms to establish themselves in this business, and if it appears from the examination now taking place that the production of the Saorstát mills will be inadequate or will not be increased with sufficient rapidity, I will not hesitate to issue a licence to one or more of those firms&mdash;that one which appears to put forward the most attractive proposals from our point of view&mdash;to enable them to get into production.  It is, fortunately, an industry which appears for some reason, to be capable of rapid establishment and development.  I was surprised myself at the speed with which new concerns were able to get equipment and get into production, so that if it becomes necessary to issue a licence to any one of these applicants, there is no reason to anticipate any prolonged delay on their part in getting into production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the licensing system, might I suggest to the Minister that it would obviate a lot of trouble if local authorities were asked to warn contractors who undertake contracts for them that the goods required in respect of those contracts may be subject to emergency duties? I think he has had the experience that contractors have undertaken contracts for such things as water pipes and have then found that they reckoned without the very big duties which they were required to pay on certain machinery necessary to fulfil the contract. <Col N="662" /> They have then come to him with the plea that the payment of duty would mean that they would lose on the contract.  Certainly I know of my own experience, that there have been three or four cases where a lot of trouble and disappointment has been caused because such contractors were not able to get over these duties.  I think it would be well if some more efficient method were adopted of warning contractors that these duties exist in connection with the contracts they undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be true that some of these contractors made mistakes in submitting their tenders, but in the majority of cases I am quite satisfied that the mistakes were intentional, and that the intention was to present the Department with a position in which we would appear to have no other course but to issue a licence to import the goods free of duty.  When the same contractor makes the same mistake twice, one can be quite certain that it is intentional&mdash;at least, on the second occasion.  I am quite certain that most of them have learned by this what facilities the Department is likely to afford and what facilities are likely to be refused.  It is, however, not an unusual experience that people think they can force us into a position in which we will have no choice, by tendering for certain goods without advertence to the duties that are likely to be charged on them, and then saying that if we do not give them a licence they will be subject to loss, or that they had actually imported the goods and had them safely transferred from the ship on to the quay before they applied for a licence.  We have to harden our hearts and refuse applications of that kind in order to establish respect for the regulations we have made.  I cannot see that there is any alternative.  There is, however, something in Deputy Moore's point though.  I do not know if it has still the same validity that it might have had some time ago.  Contractors are not likely to make mistakes, and those who are engaged on public works ought to know the position.  I think contractors of that kind before submitting tenders ought to ascertain, as they can by <Col N="663" /> telephoning to the Department, what duties are likely to be leviable on any plant or goods they wish to import.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that there are always new contractors coming in.  He also knows that the idea prevails that anything done for a local body is done for the Government.  The idea consequently prevails that these duties exist for the ordinary person only and that it may be possible to get a licence on such contracts because they are contracts for local bodies.</P>

Well, it did not come off but there is a chance of its coming off now. Get that into your skulls.  There is a chance of its coming off now.  At the last meeting my mind was a bit knocked out by the fact that at about ten minutes to ten a Cork Deputy got up to speak.  He was followed by another Cork man and the two of them kept the debate going until a little after 20 minutes past ten.  That left me eight minutes.  I got in a good deal of what I had to say in that eight minutes but I was unable to say half of what I intended to say as the time did not give me the opportunity.  I know that these Cork Deputies were speaking about a want of public morality by members of the Fianna Fáil Government.  They were demanding public morality.  One or the other of these Deputies referred to the fact that he had met an individual in Cork named &ldquo;Honest Tim.&rdquo;  I did not think there were two &ldquo;Honest Tims.&rdquo; He said that &ldquo;Honest Tim&rdquo; sold a bull for 1/3 in the market.  There was another &ldquo;Honest Tim&rdquo; who sold a bull for £3 and he said that John Bull would have to get £6.  He was even worse off than the man who only got 1/3.  It struck me that their time would be much better occupied in catching birds and sending them up to the bird market in Dublin because they would certainly get 1/3 for the birds and that was the price given for the bull.  I have listened now for months to statements in regard to all the extraordinary events that have happened in this country.  I have listened to the economists speaking here, to the men of finance, to the men of affairs and I wondered if it would be something new to them for me to say that there was a doctrine preached by a master mind in economics in this country, a man who, certainly I do not believe, has been equalled in that domain, Jonathan Swift, and he stated that the real riches of a country are its people.  That seems to be forgotten altogether now by the economists that we have here and elsewhere.</P>

It is the people and the present Government are trying to provide work for the people.  The case made here is that owing to the economic war the trade with our best customer has dwindled.  Some friend of mine some months ago, when I was a Parliamentary candidate, happened to slip into my hand one evening, preparatory to a meeting, an extract from the leading article in the <i>Evening Mail</i> of Thursday, May 20th, 1926.  It is headed: &ldquo;Our declining trade,&rdquo; and goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A return of the trade between the Free State and Great Britain and Northern Ireland during the financial year ending 31st March, last, issued by the British Board of Trade, confirms the seriousness of the decline in our trade with our best customer indicated in the monthly returns of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In the year ended March, 1925, the value of the Free State's exports to the United Kingdom was £49,961,000. During the following 12 months our exports to the United Kingdom were worth £42,494,000.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am not interested in what they are now.  At present I am only interested in reading this leading article, which proceeds:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The decline, therefore, was equal to 15 per cent.  Our imports from the United Kingdom were also less during the year ending 31st March last than they were in the 12 months preceding April, 1925, but the decline in our imports was not so great as the fall in our exports.  The figures were: In 1925, £53,077,000; and in 1926, £49,468,000.  Thus the value of our imports from the United Kingdom last year fell 8 per cent. It will be seen from the figures we have quoted that for every pound by which we reduced our purchases from the United Kingdom, Great Britain and Northern Ireland reduced their purchases from us by two pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> That will show us that the present position brought about by the war, as it is called, between our Government and the Government of Great Britain is not responsible for the decline in trade.  The cattle trade, I believe, declined from 1926 onwards.  These figures show that this decline in trade has been going on for years and that our Government are not responsible for it.  There is nothing further that I can say in connection with this matter, as I was always a very bad man at economics and high finance.  There is nothing that I can add to the information which has been given by members here from time to time.  I will only say that I do not think this motion was put down as a genuine effort to get a pronouncement from the House. It has gone on for so long that I think it ought to end.  I should like Deputy Belton to tell us when it is going to finish.  I do not think it is right to keep it going on from month to month. I hope he is going to bring it to an end to-night.  If he is going to speak to-night, I am afraid it will not be brought to an end&mdash;it will have to go beyond Christmas.</P>

      <P>The amazing modesty which distinguishes the Opposition is about the only good quality they seem to possess.  They are at least good and kind in the sense that they have waited until a late hour to-night to get rid of to-night's instalment of the serial story of depression which we have been having for so long and which I have no doubt they intend to continue.  When I listen to those &ldquo;bright young things&rdquo; I wonder what it would feel to spend a wet week-end with them and see them crying down each others' backs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I have been in the Dáil, and I have been here some little time now, I have never heard such a consistent series of melancholy speeches and <i>go brónach</i> utterances, such deep, brokenhearted, sorrow-stricken self-expression as we have had from those benches. Can they not, for Heaven's sake, cheer up some time.  A sort of melancholy bug seems to have got loose upon the <Col N="668" /> Rotary Club, which is now the Opposition Front Bench.  &ldquo;Melancholy Unlimited&rdquo;&mdash;they might float themselves as a company, a sort of serial sob-story to be continued after the next election, only it will be even more melancholy and the Greek chorus will be fewer.  Their leaders remind me of Macbeth's Three Witches: &ldquo;When shall we meet again in the thunder and the lightning and the rain&rdquo;; or if only it would rain ink.  They remind me of a book written by a less-distinguished man of my own name, Victor Hugo, called <i>Les Miserables.</i>  When you remember that they go home and that they live with one another in that mood, I wonder what their families look like.  The next generation will all be born with the corners of their mouths so far down that they will trip their feet over them if that is the kind of enthusiasm and the kind of atmosphere in which they are to continue. They remind me of an undertaker's funeral.  I do not know if you know what an undertaker's funeral is.  It is one in which they are mourning for lack of a corpse.  That is what they are really sorry about.  They are really mourning because they have not got a corpse to mourn over.  Somebody told me that they were like a collection of cantankerous, backbiting, sourvisaged, long-toothed old maids, but I would not say that.  They are a sort of incarnate bad luck wished upon this House.  Is it 47 or 46 melancholy humbugs: &ldquo;Pale wraiths of the past, they flit bewildered in a world that laughs?&rdquo; They have reversed that cheerful song &ldquo;The More we are Together the Happier we Will be&rdquo;; the more we are together, oh! the more miserable we will be able to persuade each other into being.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot wanted a new National Anthem.  I shall give him one: &ldquo;Oh dry those tears&rdquo;; get that lump out of your throat; swallow it. &ldquo;Weep no More, my Lady.&rdquo;  They have as much animation, as much &ldquo;jump,&rdquo; as much virility as the ghost of a ten-years-dead dead dog.  There is no life in them.  I have to try and stimulate them now.  I am trying to act as a tonic.  It is no business of mine, but we have to keep some sort of Opposition <Col N="669" /> in existence until we get a decent Opposition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave went on one occasion to the other side of the Channel and brought back a big nought.  He left it on the Front Opposition Bench.  Deputy Kelly did try to cheer them up the other night. I read his speech and it cheered even me up.  What I am asking is, when they come to discuss this question again, just to lift up the corners of their mouths, stick out their chests and try to be a bit cheerful about it.  Even we shall get melancholy if we have to listen to them any longer and I am quite sure that we do not want to be. Their lachrymal glands have been so highly developed that they look like a biceps.  There was one common property amongst all the speeches.  I suggest that they go back and read them.  I got held up in a fog the other night and I had to stay at a hotel on the way.  I could not sleep, so I read Opposition Deputies' speeches.  Every one of them started by saying &ldquo;This discussion has now lasted a long time. It has covered a great many subjects and I did not want to intervene.&rdquo;  Who told them to intervene I do not know. Nor do I know what they intervened for.  Nothing in their speeches shows, either.  Most of them did say: &ldquo;We have diverged a little from the subject under discussion.&rdquo;  That was after each of them had read out the motion in order to remind themselves not to diverge.</P>
    <P>I shall just take one or two of the speeches.  Deputy Anthony&mdash;what he has to do with the job I do not know &mdash;says our motto ought to be &ldquo;pay no one.&rdquo;  That he regards as an entirely dishonest condition&mdash;to pay no one. What we ought to do is to stand up to the accepted standard in the highest imperial circles.  We should become ten per cent. token-payment honest men.  The difference between the man who pays nothing of the thing he owes and the man who says: &ldquo;I will make a ten per cent. token payment of it,&rdquo; is only ten per cent.  When that man goes on to say: &ldquo;I do not intend to continue to pay the ten per cent,&rdquo; then the difference between that ten per cent. token-payment honest man <Col N="670" /> and a thoroughly dishonest man is nothing at all.  That is, apparently, the standard of imperial honesty up to which we, little people, are to try to aspire.  He spoke of the payment of bounties.  Then Deputy MacDermot came in and said that if Deputy O'Higgins was represented as suggesting that he did not believe in bounties it must be a misrepresentation. Deputy Anthony says he does not believe in bounties.  He says that they depress both those who give them and those who receive them.  Are we going to get rid of the whole lot?  When Deputies opposite come in, somewhere about 20,000 years after Tibb's Eve, when they become a Government again, are they going to get rid of the bounties?</P>
    <P>All these men came forward and told us what honest men they were. Deputy O'Higgins told us that we had to stand up straight to the facts and get rid of all this twiddling and twirling.  Let them tell us what they are going to do.  Are they standing for the dishonest men who say they will not pay what they do not owe until they are sued for it in an impartial court, or do they stand with the thoroughly honest men who say that in this year they will pay only 10 per cent. of what they acknowledge they do owe and in the next year they will not pay any of it.  Let these bright people who want us to be straightforward and honest say on which side they are&mdash;the honest 10 per cent. men or the dishonest men who say: &ldquo;If you have a claim against me in relation to a matter, sue me for it in a court that is impartial and I shall pay.&rdquo;  I know which I regard as the straighter of the two and which I regard as &ldquo;skrimshanking.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary said we had been returned on false pretences&mdash;he was alluding to the last general election&mdash; that we had stampeded the country into a position in which they returned us on false pretences.  But what had the country been doing for the whole ten years previously?  At every single election and in practically every single constituency since the Free State came into being, year after year, election after election, these intelligent <Col N="671" /> people had increased the vote of Fianna Fáil.  Had they always done it on false pretences?  Had we fooled them for ten successive years?  What do you say to the people who are electing you?  What sort of story is this you are letting out to the world in relation to the electorate of this whole State&mdash;that at half-a-dozen general elections, one after another, they have allowed themselves to be stampeded and fooled by Fianna Fáil into the gradual increase of their vote until, at the last general election, they allowed themselves to be stampeded into a position in which they elected Fianna Fáil with the largest vote that ever has been given for any Government in this country and elected them to the position of being a Government with a majority of its own in this Dáil. Deputy O'Leary says that we have been returned on false pretences.  If that be so, what sort of electorate is it?  I should not mind if there had been some sudden, sporadic changeover of the people.  I should not mind if it were suggested that some new issue had been put to them.  I should not mind if it were suggested that there were some peculiar circumstances favourable to us when we went to election.  But that was not so.  We went after ten months of being told by the bright boys opposite that we would not dare go; we went after we were told that we did not dare fight a by-election; we went after we were told that we had kept by-elections open for six months because we were afraid of them; we went after we were told we could not face four by-elections together; we went after the people had experience of all the ills that we were told were going to follow from our policy; and yet this mad, foolish, Irish people whom you say, when you are on the hustings, have a right to govern themselves, with a perfectly clear recognition of the actual circumstances of our Government, with a full knowledge of what we had done and intended to continue to do were, according to Deputy O'Leary, stampeded and fooled by false promises into returning us.</P>
    <P>At the last general election but one, <Col N="672" /> the then President during the interregnum, before we changed over, was asked to explain what had happened to him when the electors threw him out.  He said the bidding was too high. Who bid highest at the last election? Who tried to cover our bid?  Who came back from Naas up here in a hurry and sent us out in the early morning the statement that he would never again charge the people half of the annuities? Who did the overbidding then?  Who tried to make a false promise?  Whose writ did not run, whose cheque was not received by the people, whose word was not believed?  The word of one of the hydra-headed organisation which we now have to face, Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>
    <P>I notice that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney also said that the heads of the Party were reaping the benefits of their false promises; the people who are sitting on the Front Bench here were reaping, he said, a personal profit from the results of their false promises. Why did you not lick us at the election?  Why, with all the evidence of our folly to put before the people, did you not beat us then?  Because it was not in you.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that no man of their Party advocated the non-payment of rates.  I will read you the little passage if I can find it.  It pays sometimes to spend a sleepless night.  Listen to this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is the view which is the official view and the view held by every single member of this Party. Putting any view to the contrary and stating that any member of this Party holds any other view is to make a statement which is false in fact.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the view, that it is the duty of every man to pay his rates.  What are the names to this Motion?  One of them is Minch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely giving the names.  In case there should be any <Col N="673" /> misunderstanding, I may say I was going to mention that Minch was the name of a Deputy&mdash;Deputy Minch of this House.  Yet these honest men, these men who want to tell us the truth, say that putting any view to the contrary and stating that any member of their Party holds any other view is to make a statement which is false in fact.  This House knows that the speech of Deputy Minch, directly contrary to that, was read out to him here and was left undenied and unchallenged by the Deputy.  I am putting that statement deliberately to Deputies on the benches opposite who have any shred of decency or any remnant of honesty and I ask them if every other statement they have made is as true as that.  I think it is.  I am going directly to the credit of the witness. Here is a statement made by a Front Bench man of Cumann na nGaedheal, U.I.P., or whatever name it now has, which he must know is false.  What amount of respect are we to pay to any other statement of any kind received either from that Deputy or from any member of his Front Bench?  There is a blatant falsehood which nothing but the grossest, privative ignorance could excuse from being labelled a lie. These are the honest men, these are the men who want us to face up to facts, to get away from puerilities and subterfuges and come down to facts. The fact is that we have here a blatant lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next extraordinary thing that has happened, and it has gone right through the whole debate, has been an amazing inversion of the theory of tariffs.  I have heard Cumann na nGaedheal, from these benches, contend many a time and oft that the price of a tariff is added to the price of the goods.  We have sometimes contended against that proposition, but we have been told by high priests like Deputy Hogan of Galway that that is ridiculous.  Now we are finding right through this story the amazing thing that on all goods we import into England we pay the tariff and on all goods that England imports into this country we pay the tariff also.  I think the House knows I have no very strong and violent beliefs one way or the <Col N="674" /> other in the matter of tariffs.  I regard them purely and simply as an expedient and, therefore, tariffs not being my child and in no sense a thing for which I have any close affection, I have been able to examine and judge them as a student.  But of all the mad stories I have ever heard in economics tied up to tariffs I have never heard a doctrine so extraordinary as that.  And yet such a doctrine might conceivably be true.</P>
    <P>It can only conceivably be true in one condition, and that is that one of the countries is owned absolutely and controlled absolutely by the other.  I can defend that contention, if it is contended that England economically and politically is in absolute and complete control of this country.  You can then say that up to the point of actually starving people to death they can do what they like with this country.  If that is the contention let us have it&mdash; that they are so completely in control of us that they can add what tariff they like to our goods without raising the price in their own market.  In other words, in relation to the goods we sell them they can take out of it by a Governmental act any proportion they like.  Is that the contention?  That is the contention you have got to meet. Say they raise the tariff 80 per cent. more are you still contending that they have the power to make us pay the whole of it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it to you now.  First I tried to stimulate the human faculties.  I tried to raise you from the level of people who have been dead for six months and who do not mind if they remain dead for ever.  I tried to raise you from that pitch into a state in which you were capable of understanding an argument.  I tried to stimulate your mind.  They may have brains but they keep them well hidden, but if they have the intelligence there I try to drag it out.  I am simply asking the Opposition to understand their own arguments.  I am coming to the two states.  Your contention is that the British can put a tariff on our goods and can by that tariff extract from the total value coming to us whatever they like&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="675" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">

      <P>Not if you find an alternative market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the interruption I was trying to get from the Deputy.  Now you see the intelligence developing.  It is gradually coming forward.  The Deputy is developing. He now knows that if a country is in the position of being our only possible market for a perishable commodity that country can, according to him if they so desire&mdash;and I call him as witness&mdash; extract from the value of our goods, whatever their quantity and whatever their quality, any amount down to the bare cost of continuing production. That is the argument the Deputy himself has seen.  First let us get to the facts.  Is that the contention of the United Ireland Party?  Is it their contention that the present economic system is of such a character that whatever the amount of the production and whatever the quality of the production, and in whatever state it is sent to the market, you have a market which can pay you for those goods nothing more than the bare cost of continuing production? That is the subconscious argument that is behind this, because control will creep in.  That is the sort of argument that is behind all the muddled speeches and muddled reasoning which has been brought into this debate from the other side.</P>
      <P>Again I am putting it to the Deputy who is honest enough.  The Deputy let his mind come to it.  He saw the reaction to the argument and he made a better speech on my side in one single word than I could have done in an hour.  Is not that so?  Now I am to give you the other side of the argument. Your Rotary leaders are telling you, all the Rotary leaders are telling the back benchers not to interrupt. &ldquo;Do not interrupt.  He is asking for it.&rdquo;  Even Deputy Belton to-night has learned to hold his tongue.  I can point to whole pages of the debates which took place here.  The debates were simply dialogues between Deputy Belton and any unfortunate Deputy who happens to be addressing the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now as to the other side of the argument it has been put in plain <Col N="676" /> English here by one of their Deputies. The Deputy says we are paying both tariffs.  The other argument is that England is in a position to add to the price of any article she sends in here, any amount she likes.  If the economists of the United Ireland Party are prepared to hold those doctrines I want them to state them specifically.  I do not want to ride away on the specific statement of one fool or on the implicit statement of 20. I want the expert economists of the Front Bench to come out and openly stand for that proposition.  That is the proposition that we are in such relation to England at the present moment that as a result of the whole of our economic history, including the last ten years, we are in the position in relation to all the goods we sell, that she can take out of them any amount that she chooses and in relation to all the goods she buys she can add to them any price she chooses.</P>
    <P>That is economic slavery.  If that is the condition in which England controls you body and soul I do not know any better definition of slavery.  There used to be an old saying, &ldquo;Give me the making of the Nation's songs and I do not care who makes her laws.&rdquo; Give me economic control of any nation to the extent that I can control the lives, the livelihood, and the condition of life of every man, woman and child in it, and I do not care who makes either her songs or her laws. That is what you are contending.  But it is because we are not going to stand for that sort of thing permanently that we are doing fairly drastic things and may have to do more drastic things in the future to get out of the stranglehold in which that Deputy told the House we were.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said: &ldquo;I think he must be wilfully blind because I cannot understand any man being blind without being wilfully blind.&rdquo; One of those subjects upon which I am prepared to bow to him.  He also told us and he expressed his knowledge of agriculture, local and international, by telling us that penguins bred in the wilderness.  That is the total contribution of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, <Col N="677" /> but he tore passion into shreds.  He performed all those tricks by which juries are supposed to be very much influenced.  He did nothing outside telling us that we paid both tariffs and that the economic condition of this country vis-a-vis its opponents was of such a character that we could do nothing else.  In so doing he did no service to his own cause.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon comes along and gives us an extraordinary story about the virtue of people, of the courage, the uprightness, the national spirit and the patriotism of people who do not strike rates.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney gave us a column of it.  His actual words take some beating:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the Minister gets up here&rdquo;</P>
    <P>of course, I cannot put the emphasis and the atmosphere into it&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and says in effect that it is a wrong thing for any citizen of this State to litigate a matter with the Government when that citizen thinks the Government has acted tyrannously and wrongly, then I say that that Minister has surely mistaken the powers and the duties of the Executive Council to the citizens of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is another half column in front of that in which he tells us about the duty of all these people to get this matter of whether or not they ought to strike the rates litigated.  It is the duty, apparently, of the ordinary citizen, his right and his duty, to go into court and have it ascertained whether or not he owes certain money, and he is falling down on his job, he is turning his back upon his legitimate and proper obligations, according to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, if he does not do this, if he does not go into court and insist on having the court decide whether or not he owes money.  That, amazingly enough, comes from a Front Bench that says we are a lot of embezzlers and thieves because we insist on going into an international court to have it litigated whether or not, in fact, we do owe or do not owe England £3,000,000 a year.  Now which way are they going to have it, these honest men?  Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;I am rather grateful to him in this respect&mdash;<Col N="678" /> introduced a new simile, at any rate to me and I think to the House.  He said that you cannot get a centipede standing on the wrong leg; he has got 99 other legs.  Now, I want to know which leg they are standing on. Is it an obligation upon Deputy Belton, to take a specific case, to get mandamused and driven into court to litigate the question of whether or not they should strike a rate?  Is that his duty?  And is the nation doing wrong when it says, we do not owe money and we will not pay that money until our right to hold it is challenged in an open and international court?  Now which leg are they going to stand on? I do not care which, but I want to know which one it is.  I do not know if Deputies ever heard this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&nbsp;A centipede was happy quite,</P>
    <P>  Until one day for fun,</P>
    <P>A toad said which leg comes after which?</P>
    <P>Which worked his soul to such a pitch, pitch,</P>
    <P>He lay distracted in a ditch,</P>
    <P>Considering how to run.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want the U.I.P. to tell us&mdash;possibly they are lying in a ditch&mdash;how are they going to run?  Are they saying that the people have the right to litigate and that it is their duty to litigate, or are they saying that the people are embezzlers and thieves because they do litigate?  Which is it?  I think I shall wait a long time for an answer.  According to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney no member of the Party had ever advocated the non-payment of rates, but for some strange and peculiar reason, I suppose a sort of spontaneous generation, a whole lot of county councils and a whole lot of county councillors, whichever way you like to take it, decided they would not pay rates until they were mandamused. Deputy MacDermot says that there could not have been a conspiracy against this as it would have spread throughout the country, but it was spreading throughout the country until it was stopped, and a whole lot of other things will spread throughout the country unless they are stopped and they will be stopped.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot was another of the people who did not intend to intervene, <Col N="679" /> but he did intervene.  He intervened to give a simple answer to a simple question.  He was asked what he would do to end the economic war. He talked a lot about details and the constitutional position in relation to the economic war.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What is our plan for getting back the English market, for bringing the so-called economic war to an end? Have we not stated our plan hundreds of times?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He stated it hundreds of times, but we do not know it even now.  He tells us:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our plan for getting back the British market is the very simple one of acting like business men and taking the necessary steps for getting it back.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the mystery that was dark as death is completely exposed.  When asked what his plan is, he says the very simple one of taking the necessary steps for getting it back and then he goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now these are questions that can be settled perfectly well and perfectly honourably, and to the great advantage of the people of this country, by making up our own minds as to what we want and by going and entering into negotiations in a business-like manner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the first portion of the problem is to act like business men and the next is to act in a business-like manner.  That is all that he tells us. Now I have been in some business deals.  I doubt if Deputy MacDermot has ever been in one, except the one in which he sold the independence of the Farmers' Party for two seats on a rotary Front Bench.  I do know that a dinner lubricates business.  I know that the spirit of getting together&mdash;I mean the fact that you are introduced as a jolly good fellow, that everyone realises that and all that kind of thing &mdash;is very helpful.</P>
    <P>I have seen many&mdash;as, I have no doubt, Deputy Dockrell has seen many &mdash;a good business deal begun with a lunch, and best begun with a good lunch among good fellows who knew how to lunch.  That is very much the atmosphere that would do&mdash;where <Col N="680" /> we are to be all honourable men, like Brutus, and all friendly and with full belief in each other's good faith, and to sit down and have dinner or lunch and talk it over, and all the rest of it. My experience of these dinners is this &mdash;and I have had some and so has Deputy O'Neill&mdash;that there comes a very cold moment in those dinners, when a sort of cold breeze blows over the coffee and the liqueurs.  There comes a moment when some gentleman says: &ldquo;Well, what about it?  Let us get down to brass tacks&rdquo;; and the first question is: &ldquo;Who are you, and what are your credentials to carry through this affair?&rdquo;  That is where the being businesslike and, above all, having the business manner, does not carry you an inch.

    <P>The suggestion is that somebody shall negotiate something in an honourable way with the British.  Who is going to do the negotiating?  There are three possibilities on the Opposite Benches.  One of them is Deputy Cosgrave.  The second is his cuckoo, Deputy MacDermot.  The third is Ringmaster MacDuffy&mdash;or O'Duffy&mdash;I am speaking of the MacDuffy Circus, in which General O'Duffy gave good service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The man does become a pure, unadulterated nuisance.  Deputy Cosgrave has loyally accepted membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  He has upheld the Treaty as a sacred and holy instrument to the extent of sending to their deaths as many men as there are Deputies on this side of the House.  He has proclaimed himself as having a sincere belief in the sincerity of the people with whom he is negotiating.  Put a better case than that!  Can anybody state his qualifications to negotiate with the British higher than I have put them?  Moreover, I believe it is all true.  But, when did Deputy Cosgrave get those qualifications?  He <Col N="683" /> earned them in ten years.  He had them at the moment in which, professing all that fealty to the Commonwealth of Nations, all that respect for the sanctity of the Treaty, all that intention to keep fully his agreement, all that belief in the essential value to Ireland of the British connection&mdash;he had all these qualifications when he went over in 1931&mdash;not ancient history &mdash;to ask, not for £3,000,000 a year, which we say we do not owe them, nor for £5,200,000 a year, which they were getting from him for ten years, but for a moratorium for three months of £250,000; and he did not get it.  He had all these qualifications when he went over in 1931, and that was how he was treated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony was foolish enough to say that I was disrespectful to Deputy Cosgrave.  I believe in knowing the value of my opponents.  I do not mind fooling somebody else, but I do not fool myself, and if there is any party on the benches opposite that I know it is he.  I have been five or six years gaining experience and I know the qualification of all the Deputies on the Front Bench opposite.  If Deputy Cosgrave, with ten years of service behind him, with ten years of faithful observance of the Treaty, with ten years working in the interests of the British connection, with that mutual feeling of good faith and common belief as between the two Parties here and in Britain, was not able in 1931 to get a moratorium for three months, on £250,000, who is going to say that the British are going to give to him any concession as a negotiator? I shall tell the House why Deputy Cosgrave is no good as a negotiator.  Because the British know he cannot deliver the goods.  For ten years he was offering them the Free State as a gift.  He said: &ldquo;The love of my heart and the faith of my soul and the love and fealty of the Irish people, the elected Government here lays humbly at your feet.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British would give a lot&mdash;a lot more than the value of some of the great coaling stations that they value so much&mdash;to any man who could say <Col N="684" /> that with the authority of the Irish people.  Why were they not prepared to buy the goods?  Because the seller could not deliver them.  They will not be prepared to buy the goods now because they know that if the seller be Deputy Cosgrave he cannot deliver them.  If Deputy Cosgrave cannot do that what chance has Deputy MacDermot?  If Deputy Cosgrave is asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;  he can say: &ldquo;I have been ten years President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State.  I have had three or four separate majorities, got from the electorate of the Irish Free State.  I am a man in whom a lot of people in the Irish Free State do believe, and are prepared to follow.&rdquo;  But when he is put in discard what answer will Deputy MacDermot make?  Ask Deputy McGilligan, ask Deputy Cosgrave's little pet wasp what he thinks of Deputy MacDermot.  They are sitting on the same Front Bench.  I have not got the speech here, but if anybody told me that the U.I.P. regarded Deputy MacDermot as one who could answer the first question that would be asked of him: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I say go back and read the buzzing of the wings of the little yellow wasp.  Deputy McGilligan, not two or three years ago&mdash;we had not known much of him then&mdash;but two or three months ago, said Deputy MacDermot had no anchors to take up here, that he had no claim whatever to speak on behalf of the Irish people.  Do not imagine for one moment that the people you are to negotiate with are such people as not to know what your Front Bench Deputies opposite think of each other when you send them over as negotiators.</P>
    <P>Let us see what Deputy MacDermot is going to do when he goes over, having got a businesslike manner and acting like a businesslike man.  How is he going about it when asked to come down to brass tacks?  He was asked: &ldquo;What actually are you going to do about it?&rdquo;  and he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first obstacle that confronts the Fianna Fáil Party, as regards making any sort of agreement with the English, is that they have not made up their minds which they <Col N="685" /> want the more&mdash;a united Ireland, or a republic.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He also said that one of the great and most difficult things in the way of the Fianna Fáil people was that they had shown they were unable to keep agreements, in other words, there was no atmosphere of <i>uberrima fides</i>, so necessary for transactions of this kind and which, undoubtedly, would be present if Deputy Cosgrave was there.  We could not keep a contract; we could not stand over our obligations.</P>
    <P>What happened the other day?  Mr. James Thomas&mdash;I understand it is regarded as disrespectful to call him &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; Thomas&mdash;actually made a statement in the British House of Commons in which he said there had been another flagrant and blatant repudiation of our obligations, another flagrant and blatant example of bad faith.  And what was that flagrant and blatant example of that faith?  It was the passing through the Dáil of three Bills, and the passing through the Seanad of three Bills, and the making of these three Bills, three Acts of Parliament, one of which abolished the Privy Council so far as we were concerned, and the second of which took away the necessity of the King, through the Governor-General, writing his signature on Bills and so on.  These were the three Acts which Mr. Thomas described as blatant and flagrant violations of good faith and of the Treaty with the British.  Now who passed those Acts?  Who voted against them?  Deputy Thrift and Deputy Good voted against one of them and against the other two no single man in this House voted or recorded his protest. Three gross and blatant violations of the Treaty; three gross acts of bad faith according to Mr. Thomas!</P>

Deputy MacDermot, and one other Deputy, devoted practically his whole speech to showing why we could not negotiate.

      <P>I think we must have got it from Pimlico.  His difficulty, and the primary difficulty in any negotiation with the British, was the lack of the acceptance of good faith on our part. <Col N="687" /> I am putting to you that any negotiator that is sent here from the Dáil, whether he is sent by Fianna Fáil, whether he is sent by Labour, whether he is sent by the U.I.P., whether he is sent by anybody except Deputy Good and Deputy Thrift, will be faced by the fact that in the opinion of Mr. Thomas, stated to the British House of Commons, every one of them is a man who has broken his faith, every one of them is a man who has broken the Treaty, every one of them is a man who is dishonest.  Do you accept that? Do you accept it that you are dishonest men, that you have broken your faith, that you have proved yourselves people who cannot be trusted, and who are incapable of being trusted as negotiators because you did, in fact, unanimously pass through this House three Bills which, according to the interpretation of Mr. Thomas, were a breach of the Treaty.  Are you accepting Mr. Thomas as an authentic interpreter of the Treaty?  If you are not, by what authority do you label us as men who have broken faith because we also have disagreed with Mr. Thomas?</P>

There is a respectable Assembly. There is the Seanad.  Could we find a negotiator from the Seanad?  There are some men there whom I think Mr. Thomas would regard as of the highest possible good faith.  They actually insisted on getting some of them in there.

      <P>I have a series of eight interruptions written down here which I intend to get from Deputy Belton when he once gets going.  They are all in order, and the answers are all written down.  When I am finished I will hand it to the Chair to prove that he did it.  The fact remains that neither in the Dáil nor in the Seanad, with the exception of Sir John Keane, not even in the sacred Seanad, was there one single man to lift his voice in protest against what Mr. Thomas says labels this united Irish people as a lot of scallywags who break their word and cannot keep their bond.  A unanimous Dáil, a unanimous Seanad, has been labelled by Mr. Thomas, with whom Deputy MacDermot is going to negotiate, as being unfit to negotiate. Yet Deputy MacDermot says that one of the real difficulties in this matter, one of those things which cause unnecessary trouble in the development of negotiations, and which I have no doubt cause a real pain to the soul of Deputy MacDermot, is the fact that unless we can get a negotiator whom Mr. Thomas thinks is a man of good faith it is no use negotiating.  However, let us assume that we have got this bright boy and we send him over. Here is what Deputy MacDermot has got to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If they made up their minds, as we have made up our minds, that what we want is the unity of Ireland and the effective freedom of Ireland as a whole; that we are quite prepared to stay as equal partners in the British Commonwealth on that <Col N="689" /> basis, well then it would be easy for them, as it would be easy for us if we were in power, to go to the British and say just that&mdash;to make perfectly plain what our ideal was, and to say at the same time that in view of constitutional development in the last few years, in view of the Statute of Westminster, and in view of the general feeling throughout the Commonwealth, the time had come to remove, by mutual consent, any contractual obligation that might be thought to exist on this country to stay within the Commonwealth. In other words, to make it perfectly plain that we are absolutely free to go out of the partnership that constitutes the Commonwealth at any time the Irish people wish to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What does it amount to?  We are first to go into the Commonwealth, then we are to unite with the North, and having explained to the British our ideals, we are going to be perfectly free, by the vote of the people of Ireland, to come out with the North. If it means anything, that is what it means.  Who told Deputy MacDermot that the British were going to negotiate on these terms?  First we are to go into the Commonwealth, then we are to unite, and then we are to make it perfectly plain that we are absolutely free to go out of the partnership that constitutes the Commonwealth, at any time the Irish people wish to do so. Are we to go out bringing our family with us?  By what authority does Deputy MacDermot say that any such negotiation is possible, or is likely to be carried to a successful issue?  The man is simply dreaming.  There are visions about.  And who is the third negotiator?  It has been objected that I should not refer to General O'Duffy as Ringmaster O'Duffy.  Was there ever an objection by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party when, at the General Election, they issued a poster with &ldquo;Dev's Circus&rdquo; on it, and the names of the Cabinet as performing animals? When did we become so squeamish? That was much the sort of thing no decent man would say.  Ringmaster MacDuffy.</P>

      <P>We will see.  We will have one of those magnificent meetings in Cork, reports of which appear in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, where 30,000 people are gathered together in the name of MacDuffy's circus.  Then we will have this statement in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> in relation to it.  &ldquo;As he went through the principal streets of the city, the streets were crowded with an acclaiming people.&rdquo;  Then you will find photographs, actually produced and published in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, showing him going through the same streets as empty as if there was a plague going through them.  That actually occurred.  These two statements appeared in the same paper; the photograph of the truth and the written lie.  Oh no, we are not the slightest bit disturbed about meeting General MacDuffy.  What is his negotiating capacity?  His eloquence; trust by the British&mdash;though I do not think he would claim that himself? Perhaps it is his winning way.  At the present moment I believe there is competition between the three leaders on the other side&mdash;General O'Duffy, Deputy Cosgrave, and Deputy MacDermot&mdash;to see who has the least and the fewest followers in Ireland. General O'Duffy addressed a meeting at which, I think, Deputy Desmond and Deputy O'Neill were present. For one and a quarter hours he used all the devices of eloquence, persuasion and argument which are going to make him so powerful a negotiator.  All the arts of the orator were used, but down in the lobby of the hotel afterwards one of the most prominent and hitherto one of the most faithful followers of the U.I.P. was heard to say: &ldquo;That is a great man we have got as leader, if only he was dumb.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy McGovern's contribution to this discussion was that he wanted a National Government.  There was a National Government in England.  Is that the kind he wants?</P>

      <P>I wonder sir, if you think I am interrupting the Deputy too much.  The National Government in England consisted of a Government of backwoodsmen Tories.  They called that a National Government.  Is the National Government here to be a Government of the U.I.P?  A sort of wet week-end doleful one, dead for 20 years, that does not care how long it remains a dead Government.  Is that what they call a National Government? You must remember that one of the leaders of that Government, before he left the Party of Deputy Kent, stated that he was going to form a National Government, that he was going to compel the formation of a National Government, and that when, if ever, he was in a position to hold the balance of power, he would produce not wheat, not beet, not factories but a constitutional crisis to compel Cumann na nGaedheal and Fianna Fáil to come together and to form a National Government, no doubt under his tutelage and control.  What is going to happen if there is a general election?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice to-day that on the adjournment I would raise the matters dealt with in <Col N="692" /> Questions 22 and 23, in order to draw attention to the complete refusal of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give any information as to where the new factories referred to in these questions are, and to whom they belong.  Apparently we have come to the point when the Minister has made up his mind that under no circumstances and in regard to no type of factory will he tell this House where the factories are, who the owners are, or in fact anything about them.  The Minister published a statement in the Dublin evening papers of January 13th which stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have prepared a list giving the number of new factories opened since March, 1932, under various headings. In addition to these factories there have been also opened over 150 workshops not mentioned in this list, bringing the total of new industrial concerns, large and small, to over 300.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put some questions to the Minister in October with regard to the location of certain factories that were then mentioned.  The information was too elaborate, the Minister said, but nevertheless he did not at that time consider it unreasonable that he should be asked in the House who it was had started the factories mentioned by him or where they were, and he told the House that he would consider laying on the Table of the Dáil, at a later date, a report of the kind indicated in the question.  Subsequently, in March, and following the statement I have already referred to, I asked him for general particulars with regard to the various types of factories mentioned in the statement, and the Minister, in putting up objections to giving information, said that he was having a Directory of Irish industries prepared which would be available shortly.  He made that statement on the 1st March. I was somewhat sceptical as to the time when we would get that Directory of Irish industries, and I think that my scepticism in the matter has been borne out, the Minister telling us to-day that he does not know yet when the Directory, promised in March last, is going to be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> On the 8th March I asked him if he would tell me who the owners were and what the location was of the four boot factories referred to in his statement. He told me who they were and where they were, and in the following week I asked where the seven furniture factories were located and who the owners were and where the four upholstery factories were and who their owners were.  The seven furniture factories were located in Dublin, but as he had to examine them in the light of the Control of Manufactures Act, he would not give any more information then with regard to them.  He told me that three of the upholstery factories were in Dublin and one, I think, in Navan.  To-day I asked him whether, having examined them in the light of the Control of Manufactures Act, he was now in a position to state who the owners of these seven furniture factories were and who the owners of the three upholstery factories were and where they were located, and I am informed that of the three upholstery factories, two did not come under the Control of Manufactures Bill and that the other had now gone out of existence, and that of the seven furniture factories, five did not come under the Control of Manufactures Bill and two of them have gone out of existence.</P>
    <P>There is a general complaint by the Federation of Irish Industry that the Control of Manufactures Act is not having any effect, good, bad or indifferent, on the safeguarding of industry here, and that undesirable aliens are getting into Irish manufacture to the detriment of Irish manufacturers generally.  In asking the Minister for information as to where these factories are and who the owners are, the House is not asking the Minister for any information not at his disposal. Further, the Minister has said, with reference to the factories referred to in his statement of the 13th January, that he had the names and addresses of those factories and, in criticising my efforts to get information on this matter on the 6th April last, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy is trying to create the idea that the statement made by me that, between May of last year <Col N="694" /> and last January, 149 new factories were established, was not correct.  It is correct.  Every factory and workshop opened in this country must be registered in my Department.  There were 303 new workshops registered, of which 149 were registered as factories.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that all these are registered, but the Minister in addition subsequently asked the House to pass the Control of Manufactures Bill, which provides that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person who carries on business by way of trade or for the purposes of gain to do any of the following things... that is to say, to make, alter, repair, ornament, finish, or to adapt for sale any article, material, or substance or any part of any article, material or substance, unless....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>he has certain qualifications.  So that the Minister contemplates a review of the situation in order that no person would engage in any of these activities without coming under his review and information being at his disposal with regard to them.  In asking the Minister, therefore, to let the House have this information, we are not asking for anything he has not got.  I submit, in the first place, that common sense would dictate to us that when we are developing or endeavouring to develop to a certain type of self-sufficiency or, at any rate, when we are striving to reach a considerable development of Irish industry here, this House should be put in the position of being able to watch that development as closely as possible.  In the second place, it has been charged in the past against Irish manufacturers that they were a kind of dark brotherhood, and if there is a tendency on the part of the Irish manufacturers at the moment to keep in the dark, I think that in so far as Deputies of this House are concerned, they should be able to know where they are.</P>
    <P>The main things that drive me to pursue this question and to ask the Minister finally whether he is going to make for the future, arrangements that will enable Deputies of the House to <Col N="695" /> know who are the owners of factories developing and where they are, are the facts that, with great patience and persistence, we have been able to accumulate with regard to the matters on which he based his statement of January last.  The Minister's statement to-day discloses that two of the seven furniture factories which he put into his list of January last had gone out of existence and that one of the upholstery factories&mdash;speaking now of the upholstery factories in Dublin&mdash; has already gone out of existence. All the factories that the Minister boasted of in his January statement were factories of that particular kind and, so far as the Minister's credit goes in declaring that Irish factories have been set up, it would almost have been much better for him as Minister if the rest had gone out of existence, too.  When one comes to discuss a situation like this, one has, on the one hand, to face the picture of a few men in a stable in a lane in Dublin trying to eke out an existence by the work of their hands&mdash;and one can have nothing but the greatest sympathy and admiration for such men, whether they are working themselves with their families or employing others, even juveniles, and trying to eke out an existence in these difficult times&mdash;but, on the other hand, when in the circumstances industrially and agriculturally and economically in which we are at present, we have a Minister withholding information from this House and when the impression is being given that Irish industry is being developed here on big lines and when that is based on a few workers working in stables in some of the back lanes of Dublin, we have to be concerned about another matter.</P>
    <P>We have to be concerned about the future of Irish industry and the future of workers in Dublin and elsewhere at the present time and their children, when they grow up.  We want to see whether Irish industry is developing in any other way than in some of the stables in the lanes in the City of the City of Dublin and it is this consideration, as I say, that makes me raise this question again to-night.  The <Col N="696" /> Minister declared, in answer to a question of mine last week, that out of a certain number of names only four persons of those surnames had set up industries which were included in the list he published in January last. The Minister, in fact, when replying to me and telling me where the boot industries were located mentioned another one of them, so that, on the face even of his own statement, the answer he gave me last week was incorrect.</P>
    <P>I just want to say in addition that I have not the slightest respect for the Minister's statement in so far as truth is concerned, in his answer to me here last week.  Many of the factories, that the Minister claims to have been set up, were set up by persons of the names mentioned in that list.  At the present moment I can deal simply with furniture and upholstery.  It has been very difficult to find out where these factories are and by whom they are owned.  I want to tell the Minister that the three upholstery factories which he claimed in his list were set up, one by a man named Levy, another by a man named Crammer, and another by a man named Minister.  The Minister declares one of these has gone out of existence.  He declares that one of the furniture firms has also gone out of existence.  An industry set up by a man named Yaffe in furniture making has gone out of existence, but a Mr. Levy, who ran a factory in the North Lotts, now occupies the place previously occupied by Mr. Yaffe, so that the industrial situation is not such as was indicated by the Minister's reply.  Three factories were set up in these names, and at the present moment two are employed in one factory, a man and three juveniles in another, and two men and four boys in a third.  One is in a place in Little Denmark Street and another is in stables in the North Lotts.  In this factory the name of the owner has been changed from Minister to Norstrom.  The factory vacated by Mr. Levy is also in the hands of Mr. Norstrom.  The two upholstery factories employ between them three men and seven boys.  I submit to the Minister that neither the Workshops <Col N="697" /> and Factories Act, the sanitary authorities, nor even trade union control, touches in any way these places, that in the January list were called factories.  I submit also that shame alone on the Minister's part no doubt prevented him answering the question I put in March last.</P>
    <P>When I turn to the furniture side, one of the Minister's factories which is in Dominick Lane is run by a father and son, in a stable at the back of Dominick Street.  Another is in Henrietta Place.  It had been taken by Yaffe and is now occupied by a man named Levy.  It is run by one man and a boy.  Another is in Grantham Place and the place is run by one adult, the person himself, and three juveniles.  These are the names and these are the factories about which the Minister will not give us any information. I can understand the position of the Minister in not giving information about factories in these particular places.  As regards the furniture factories, the Minister to-day declared &ldquo;that in five of the seven cases referred to in the question it has been ascertained that the businesses are either in the beneficial ownership of Saorstát nationals or were established prior to the 1st June, 1932.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In five of the seven cases referred to in the question, it has been ascertained that the businesses are either in the beneficial ownership of Saorstát nationals within the meaning of the Control of Manufactures Act, 1932, or were established prior to the 1st June, 1932.  Consequently no new manufacture licence was granted to any of the firms.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any such disclosures would be merely injurious to their interests.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the Minister's point is that the first part of the question refers to factories of this particular kind set up under Irish names, I would say &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  I have traced these factories in Irish names.  One is in Stafford Street in a basement kitchen.  Another is in a place called Loftus Lane, where four young men are trying to carry on the business.  One can have nothing but admiration for young Irishmen who are trying to earn a living in such circumstances, but that the Minister should pretend that these are factories for the manufacture of furniture, and that they are an addition to the general furniture manufacturing business of the country is an astounding thing. With regard to the position of the furniture making business generally the Minister stated in the Dáil on the 6th April:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In these factories many thousands of people are employed who would have been idle if the industrial policy of the Government had not been operated and if the <i>laissez faire</i> policy of the previous Government were allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to the furniture making industry generally was that in April, 1925, before we first imposed a tariff, the employment given in furniture making represented the full-time equivalent of 300 employees. On the 1st September, 1931, the last date for which figures are available prior to the advent of the Fianna Fáil Government, there were 1,545 employed.  That was the full-time equivalent of the employment given. In these six years, 1,245 had been added to those employed in the industry.  The employment had increased by 400 per cent.  In January last, after the seven new furniture factories had been set up, the new situation is shown by the fact that there were 145 persons less employed in the furniture making industry than were employed on the last date for which figures are available under the regime of the previous Ministry for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> We are concerned with the development of our furniture industry.  We are concerned with the development of other industries but if our people in present circumstances are to have their eyes blinded as to what is going on in the industrial situation by the Minister hiding facts or withholding information and by pretending that a situation exists which does not exist, then our people are only drifting along into a policy which will bring great economic misery.  Only in this evening's papers it is shown that there has been a very great increase in the numbers in receipt of home assistance in the City of Dublin.  The Minister's own figures for the month of October record an unprecendented increase in unemployment in the City of Dublin.  It is time that the Minister should face fairly and squarely what is happening as a result of the policy which he is pursuing.  He should at any rate, I suggest, let members of the House know exactly what is happening.  The Minister declares that we are injuring people who are engaged in industrial enterprise or that we are endeavouring to injure certain foreigners of a particular class.  If there are foreigners in this country who are able to establish Irish industry on sound lines then they should be honoured for it and we should know who they are but we ought not to have it pretended to us that there has been a big advance in the industrial situation when the industry is in the hands of such firms as I have indicated here.  Neither should it be pretended that to criticise them is to attack either individuals or classes.  We stand for what the Minister says he stands for, the development of Irish industry and the creation of a situation here in which Irish hands and brains can work with Irish capital, the building up of an economic fabric which will secure employment for our people here.  The Minister would make some contribution towards enabling us to pursue a right policy in these matters if he would put before the House the information which he must have in his possession.  The Minister has made statements which he ought to forget and allow to rest in the past.  He ought <Col N="700" /> to start on a fresh basis of letting us have information as to what the developments are and not have us drifting into a situation in which Irish industry is growing with roots in stables and basements in the City of Dublin without any control by the Factories and Workshops Act, without any touch with trades unions, without any touch with, perhaps, the sanitary authorities or the laws that deal with unemployment insurance.  I think the Minister has treated the House in a scandalous way when he refused information as to where Irish industry is developing, and where people can see it is developing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy and his colleagues frequently give lip service to the cause of industrial development, but they never lose an opportunity to impede it.  The Deputy comes along and takes out of a list of 150 new factories established in nine months a comparatively small number of concerns which were started under undesirable auspices or in undesirable conditions and tries to represent that all the concerns are of that nature.  He took care to avoid reading the first part of my answer to-day which emphasised the fact that these people to whom he has referred, who have started factories under undesirable conditions, people who themselves, in some cases, may be undesirable, are doing so in accordance with the law; that there is no power in the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Government to prevent them doing so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the Deputy and Deputy Dillon of this fact, that when we came into office there was no power to prevent anybody starting any kind of industry here.  We brought in the Control of Manufactures Act, which was designed to give us the minimum of control.  You voted against it.  Not merely did Deputies opposite vote against it, but they obstructed it in every way.  When it went to the Seanad their colleagues there insisted on inserting amendments designed to make the Act ineffective. Because we would not accept these <Col N="701" /> amendments we were faced with the alternative of having that Act held up for 18 months.  That is the policy of the Party opposite.  Deputy Mulcahy now talks about the Federation of Irish Industries complaining that the Control of Manufactures Act is not effective.  It is not effective because they would not let it be effective. Ineffective and all as it is, they opposed it.  They tried to prevent us getting even the barest minimum of power to regulate development.  We are going to introduce another Bill to amend that Act and I am anxious to see if Deputy Mulcahy has, in 12 months, changed his policy on that matter, as he has changed it on others.</P>
      <P>Let us get to the position.  There have been a small number of concerns started in the general industrial development which, I think, we would be better without.  We are going to introduce legislation to put them out. I want to know if the Deputies opposite are going to support it.  When Deputy Mulcahy tries to paint a picture in the minds of Deputies that all the development which has taken place is of the kind he has been talking about, he knows well that he is trying to implant an untruth in their minds.  I ask him to go to his own constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Saturday I went down to the Dublin Dockyard Works.  I was there two years ago.  Two years ago there was a derelict factory there; rusty machines, empty yards, nobody employed in the place except one or two workmen going around sweeping up dust.  Go down and see it now.  It is in your constituency and you should be interested in what is taking place. There are 200 employed there now. The whole place is a hive of activity. That is a direct consequence of this development.  Deputy Mulcahy did not talk of that.  That is going on all over his constituency.  Take a walk from the dockyard right up and you will see new factories there employing a large number of men.  You will see old factories that are extending.  Go up to the Hammond Lane foundry and see what is taking place there.  Go over to my constituency on the other side of the city.  You will see the bottle works <Col N="702" /> at Ringsend that also was derelict 18 months ago.  There are 250 employed there.  Deputy Mulcahy did not mention that.  Go up to the Inchicore Railway Works.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy went a lot further than furniture and upholstery.  I want to say in relation to that position that I refused to give Deputy Mulcahy the names of certain firms to-day, not because we are anxious to withhold the names of those engaged in industrial development here, but because of the circumstances in which he asked for them.  He asked me if we had carried out investigations into particular firms with a view to discovering whether they were or were not breaking the law.  I answered him that we had and that we found they were not.  I was not prepared to mention the names of those firms in relation to that question because it was bound to damage them, and Deputy Mulcahy asked the question with the intention of damaging them.  Now what is the position.  Development has taken place, but not enough.  More development is taking place.  I should like to hear Deputy Mulcahy and his colleagues talk about things that really matter: about the industries we are proud of; the development that has taken place that, in many respects, is much greater than we ever hoped to achieve in the short time we have been working.  I gave Deputy Mulcahy last week a reply to a question about the number of unemployment insurance books current on 1st October this year. He did not talk about that because that number showed an increase of 45.000 in the number of people in insurable employment in this country over 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are both an index. Neither of them is an entirely reliable index, but they both show the same thing, that there are more people in industrial employment now than ever before in the history of this country. The trouble is that Deputy Mulcahy is allowing his politics to get the better of him.  He regards every new factory as an offence.  He regards everybody who attempts to participate in the industrial revival as an enemy of his Party to be downed at all costs.  He can find out from members of his own Party the nature of the development that is taking place.  I am glad to say that all the members of his Party have not his outlook.  Some of them are not merely assisting by their personal support the campaign of industrial development, but a number of them have had the courage to risk their money behind it.  I have been asked why we have not published the list of the new factories established.  My answer is that I have not published the list because I have not got it.  We are attempting to prepare a directory of Irish manufactures.  It has been delayed because, despite the fact that the number of officers in my Department has been doubled, we cannot keep up with the work coming on us.  It was only about a month ago that we were able to make an organised start upon the preparation of the directory.  The reason why a start could not be made earlier was because these officers were too busily engaged with matters arising out of industrial development to be able to sit down and reckon up what had been achieved.  At the present time inquiries in relation to industrial possibilities and the examination of definite industrial proposals in my Department are involving more work than at any time since we took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have only started the job.  We are going to make an examination. There is going to be undesirable <Col N="704" /> development that we will have to undo. It is not going to help us in our efforts, if Deputies want to help us, to have every mistake brought up and made the subject of an adjournment debate; to have every undesirable development paraded so that a false idea of the type of development taking place will be created.  The whole purpose of the Deputy's speech was to slander Irish industrialists, to create the impression that they were all working in basement kitchens and backrooms; that they had Jewish or foreign names; that they were all paying sweated wages or employing juvenile labour.  Some of them are.  Those who are will come under the law.  They are outside it now.  They would not be doing it if we could get at them under the Factories and Workshops Act or the Control of Manufactures Act.  We got at two of these furniture people that we do not want and they are gone. We got at one of the upholstery men and he is gone.  We could not get at others who are operating under undesirable conditions, but the legislation to be introduced next Session will enable us to do it.  I want to know is it going to get the support of those who talk about those conditions and who took very good care that the Government in office had not the power to rectify them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy said that he has the greatest admiration for those engaged in industrial development.  We have had examples of the type of admiration that the Party opposite hold for those doing that part of the nation's work in the speeches made by Deputy Mulcahy and his colleagues, particularly by Deputy McGilligan, from time to time, where particular industries were singled out for attack by name and false statements made about them.  I am glad to say that every one of those industries has survived despite that. The development is going on.  Whether they are with us or against us.  I can tell Deputy Mulcahy, as I once concluded a speech before, to back his blue shirt on that.</P>
