      <NameTxt>Peadar S. Ua Dubhghaill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether notices of dismissal have been served on painters employed by the Board of Works, if he is aware that these tradesmen have long service, in one case close on 20 years; if any alteration has been made in the terms of contract by which it is proposed to replace these tradesmen by others, and whether it is proposed to make permanent reduction in the number of painters employed by the Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The painting works required by the Board of Works are almost entirely carried out under contract. There is only one regular painter in the Board's direct employment and no notice of dismissal has been served.  The painters referred to in the question are the employees of the contractor who holds a contract with the Board of Works for painting and glazing works, labour, and supplies.  It is understood that some of them have been employed for long periods on the Board's work by the contractors.  No alteration has been made in the terms of contract with these contractors, but it is contemplated to introduce a system of rotation by which a larger number of painters would share in the Board's work.  It is not intended at present to reduce the number of painters engaged under the contract but the number required at any time depends upon the extent of the painting works required at the various public buildings, etc.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister's Department have actually intimated to Messrs.  Dockrell and Co. that they desire that a certain number of painters, who have been in the regular employment of that firm, should be paid off and an entirely new <Col N="1225" /> staff of painters taken on for a period of six months?  Is the Minister aware that many of these painters who are to receive notice as a result of the Minister's arbitrary edict, have 20 years' service and that, in one case to my own knowledge, a man has over 30 years' service?  Does the Minister propose to suggest to a private firm that a person with 30 years' service should be turned out and should spend six months in idleness?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not issued any arbitrary edict in this matter, but, with the concurrence of his Parliamentary Secretary, he is of opinion that where there is Government employment to be given that Government employment should be shared, as far as possible, amongst the greatest number of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recognise that persons who have given good service for 15 or 20 years and who are now thrown out on the road without any charge of misconduct against them stand little chance of getting work elsewhere?  Does he know that these men have been in that employment for years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the Commissioners of Public Works submitted proposals to the Mayo County Council for the drainage of the River Robe and its tributaries in April, 1928; that the Commissioners were notified of the Council's concurrence in September, 1928, when the necessary statutory resolutions and guarantees required by the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, were passed by the Council and submitted to the Commissioners; that a detailed engineering survey of the whole district, a valuation of the affected lands, and an assessment of the estimated increase in value for each individual holding was made and a report submitted to the Commissioners by their engineers in February, 1930, and if he will now state what steps have been taken by the Commissioners since 1930 to have the drainage of that river and its tributaries carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out to the Deputy in reply to previous questions, subsequent to the receipt of their engineer's report in February, 1930, the Commissioners of Public Works had further necessary extensive inspections made by their engineers and valuers in order to obtain sufficient information to enable them to devise the most suitable scheme for <Col N="1227" /> the improvement of the drainage conditions in the River Robe district.</P>
      <P>A draft scheme has now been decided on and particulars of it with maps and descriptive schedules will, it is hoped, be submitted in about a month's time to the Mayo County Council with an inquiry as to whether that body is willing to make a contribution of 30 per cent. of the cost of the scheme to complement the 50 per cent. to be provided by the Minister for Finance so as to make the scheme an economic undertaking for the occupiers of affected lands.</P>

If the Minister looks at the records he will find that this scheme has been going on for years.

At the present moment proposals are under consideration by the Department of Local <Col N="1241" /> Government and Public Health dealing with schemes of this sort for 49 different localities and involving a total sum of £94,000.  In addition, proposals have been received, or are to be made later, for schemes in Dublin for various public works involving about £50,000. There are also under consideration at the present moment proposals from the Department of Agriculture for additional forestry operations, for subsidies in aid of schemes to be administered by the County Committees of Agriculture, and for the extension of land reclamation schemes previously carried out in the Gaeltacht. In general, the administration of the schemes will be under the control of the Parliamentary Secretary, and the type of work which will be financed out of the sub-head covering public health and miscellaneous schemes will be mainly works of public utility.</P>

Accordingly, I would not bind myself to a condition that it would be carried out mainly in the summer.  It would be carried out this winter so as to be available for next summer.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £500 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1934, for expenditure in respect of Public Buildings; for the maintenance of certain Parks and Public Works; and for the execution and maintenance of Drainage Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for this supplementary estimate arises out of an agreement which has recently been reached with the Gaelic League for their immediate evacuation of 25, Parnell Square, in consideration of an ex gratia payment of £500.  By an agreement with our predecessors, the Christian Brothers had decided to establish an all-Irish secondary school in Dublin.  For this purpose the premises 23, 24, 25 and 26 Parnell Square, which were Government property, were to be handed over to them, upon certain terms and conditions which it is not necessary for the purpose of this Vote to recapitulate. <Col N="1244" /> When notice to quit was served on the Gaelic League they objected to the termination of their tenancy of 25, Parnell Square, without compensation, their principal grievance being that the loss of the hall at the rere of No. 25 would seriously cripple their activities, and that they had not the funds which would enable them to build another suitable hall elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As a result of investigation of the legal position the Government came to the conclusion that the Gaelic League might be able to establish some claim to a new tenancy.  The Gaelic League, on the other hand, felt confident that they would so establish a claim, but at the same time it must be said that they were not anxious to impede in any way the fulfilment of the Government's intention to establish an all-Irish secondary school here in Dublin.  Accordingly the Attorney-General and the Minister for Finance met a deputation from the Gaelic League, and came to an amicable arrangement that the premises would be evacuated on payment to the Gaelic League of the sum of £500.  In that connection I should like to make it clear to the Dáil that when this matter was under consideration between the representatives of the Gaelic League and myself I had not in mind the fact that certain obligations of the League in respect of rates on the hall for the current year had not been discharged. I do not think the representatives of the Gaelic League had that in mind either, so it may be necessary for me to meet them in regard to that matter also.  However, a difficulty which might have led to a good deal of protracted litigation, affording little satisfaction to either party, because the assertion of the claims of the one party as against the other was going to impede the establishment of an all-Irish school which both parties were anxious to see set on foot here at the earliest possible moment, has been very satisfactorily settled by this agreement to pay the League £500, and I confidently recommend it to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £20,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1934, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, including Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, Grants to Local Authorities and sundry Grants-in-Aid, and certain charges connected with Hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Vote is to provide a sum of £25,000 in order to enable grants to be made to local authorities for the purpose of providing, under approved schemes, supplies of native fuel to necessitous people, where such fuel is not usually available. The total amount to be provided <Col N="1247" /> is £25,000, but it is anticipated that there will be savings on other subheads of the main Local Government and Public Health Vote, amounting to at least £5,000.  The total sum which will be required, in addition to the £794,991 already voted, will be £20,000.</P>
    <P>This Vote is submitted in fulfilment of the Budget announcement that it is proposed to set aside, in addition to the £100,000 provided in last year's Budget, and which has been again provided in this year's Budget, for the provision of milk for necessitous children, a sum of £25,000 to provide fuel for necessitous homes in districts where such fuel is not usually available. The schemes have not been worked out in detail yet but, in general, it is hoped to distribute the grants on lines similar to those upon which the grants for milk are at present being distributed.  We are anxious the Dáil should formally approve the principle and vote the money, so that we can get ahead with the schemes at once and have them in operation during the coming winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>All the Minister has told us about the scheme is that it is proposed to distribute the turf along lines similar to the distribution of milk.  So far as I know, the milk distribution is carried out through the medium of boards of health and boards of public assistance in the country.  We would like to know whether it is the intention that the same bodies will deal with the distribution of fuel, whether the fuel distribution will be as widespread as the distribution of milk or whether there will be any concentration in urban areas.  We would also like to know whether the Government are aware of the difficulties and the abuses that arose in connection with the milk distribution scheme last year, when persons were supplied with milk only when found to be in receipt of home assistance.  Must a person be in receipt of home assistance from one of the local bodies administering the scheme before he can get turf as well as milk? I suggest to the Minister that we ought to have a little more detailed information.  If a necessity exists for <Col N="1248" /> the distribution of fuel and if the necessity is as great as to warrant the expenditure of £25,000, surely the Minister must have some more details than he has favoured us with as to how the scheme will actually work out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point that I raised on another occasion when the turf scheme was being discussed. This Estimate is for the purpose of supplying free fuel to necessitous persons.  As I see it, the primary consideration in such an enterprise should be the requirements of the poorer persons, and not the expediency of compelling somebody to burn turf in order to consume the supplies that will be brought to the city under the special scheme of the Minister for Defence.  I have already put it to members of the Government, and persons familiar with the conditions in the city, that turf is not a suitable fuel for necessitous people living in tenement houses.  I protest most strongly, because of the circumstances that are envisaged in this Estimate, against trying it on the dog.  If there is any desire to try out the suitability of turf as a fuel under urban conditions, then it ought to be tried on people who can afford to buy an alternative fuel if turf does not serve.  What we are going to do, apparently, is to announce that we are going to distribute free fuel to the poor people, and then we will sail in with one of these splendid bags of turf at 10/6 a cwt. free on rail, Moyvalley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be 10/6 a ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, 10/6 a ton, free on rail, Moyvalley.  In my opinion 10/6 a cwt. would make it more attractive to the people in the country. Anyway, whatever they are going to get per ton, the unfortunate people in the tenement houses are going to have it tried out on them.  I pointed that out when the Minister for Education was occupying the seat now held by the Minister for Finance, and I asked him if he considered this was a suitable fuel for city people.  I asked him did he think the poor people in Dublin could burn this fuel in the grates they have, and he replied: &ldquo;Well, the poor people are going to burn it this year.&rdquo;<Col N="1249" /> I protest against that.  That attitude is entirely wrong.  I do not think there should be any resolve in the minds of the Government other than to supply necessitous people with the best fuel that can be got for the purposes for which they require it.</P>
      <P>It occurred to me, when I heard the Minister for Education saying that the people are going to use this fuel, that that was a sign and token of the kind of liberty that the Irish Labour Party is looking for in this country.  I saw to-day in the papers that the Leader of the Labour Party claims the same measure of freedom for Ireland as the Germans and Russians enjoy in their respective countries.  It occurs to me that this is a Russian form of freedom&mdash;&ldquo;If you do not like turf, we will make you burn it.&rdquo;  I hope Deputy Norton will relish that attitude towards the poor of the city.  Doubtless it is the attitude he looked forward to with such eager anticipation when he was speaking at the Five Lamps, on the North Strand, and praying for the advent of Soviet and Nazi freedom in the Irish Free State.  Apparently, so far as this scheme is concerned, the poor of Dublin are going to get a touch of Soviet and Nazi freedom.  So far as I am concerned, I protest against all this, and I feel sure that the poor will protest against it also.</P>

That is why I raised the issue now.  I agree with Deputy Moore that where turf is suitable there is no objection that it should apply.  But the test should be what is the most suitable fuel for people in need to burn.  That is what <Col N="1250" /> should apply.  The test should not be: how are we going to make a success of the turf scheme.  If the Minister for Finance says that the test Deputy Moore proposes is the test that is to apply, then I have no objection, but I should like to have an undertaking given on the subject, and I invite Deputy Moore to join me in pressing for such undertaking.</P>

The Minister will understand that there is always a section of people anxious to take advantage of every scheme.  There are other people who do not parade their poverty but whose circumstances are as bad, if not even worse, than those in receipt of home assistance, and who, if this scheme is to be put into operation, would not be entitled to receive free fuel.  I should like the Minister to see if the scheme could not be so extended as to include that class of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it better to deal with Deputy Dillon's point first as to what is the most satisfactory fuel for those poor people.  From the point of view of the Government's general policy, and of the particular purpose of this Estimate, the most satisfactory fuel is that fuel which, in this country, will afford the greatest relief of prevalent distress.  That relief may be afforded in two ways.  First of all by providing those who have no fuel with fuel of some sort, and, secondly, by affording those who have no means the opportunity of earning something by providing this fuel.  These are the two purposes underlying this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, having said that, also to clear away the misapprehension which possibly the general tenor of Deputy Dillon's remarks may have engendered.  The beneficiaries under this scheme will not have to pay anything for the fuel they secure.  It will be given to them as a free gift.  I am perfectly certain that in any house which was fireless last winter this gift, whatever the form of the fuel, whether it be coal or timber or turf, will be equally welcome.  Speaking candidly, I assume that in Dublin turf will be the most convenient form in which that fuel can be provided.  I know as one who has had experience the acute distress which want of fuel in cold weather may occasion.  I assure Deputy Dillon many homes would be very glad last winter to have had such fuel and will be glad to have turf to <Col N="1252" /> put into any sort of grate for the coming winter.  We have seen people going around delving in winter through all sorts of places trying to get coal or cinders to provide a fire. While it is not a standard that we are setting up, I can assure the Deputy that whatever inconvenience or disadvantage turf may labour under as compared with imported coal, that disadvantage will be gladly overlooked by those whose necessity compels them to look for fuel.  In that connection I would say also it is not the intention of the Government to limit the recipients of fuel under this scheme to those in receipt of home assistance. We all can realise that there is a number of deserving people in the country who, for one reason or another, do not look for home assistance and who simply because they are not in a state of absolute destitution may not get home assistance, but who would be in a condition of such distress as would warrant some relief being given to them.</P>
    <P>The intention is to administer this by existing agencies, both official in the shape of boards of health and child welfare bodies, and, unofficially, in the shape of charitable organisations. The details of the scheme, as I stated, require to be worked out.  It is our desire, if possible, to get away from the idea of pauperism.  We feel that £25,000 can be properly spent in providing fuel, in the first instance, and that the fuel they provide can equally well serve to relieve a considerable amount of distress which arises entirely through the fact that people who are unemployed and are in poor circumstances have, in winter, to forgo the comfort of a fire.</P>
    <P>That is the main purpose underlying the Vote.  It is introduced this year as an experiment.  The amount is strictly limited.  We propose to use that experiment this year in order to see if some practical scheme cannot, next winter, be hammered out, and put into operation.  We have felt in considering this matter that there is no use wasting a lot of time working out a scheme which would be universally satisfactory. We decided that the best <Col N="1253" /> thing would be to take a comparatively small amount of money and to try and see how far the scheme could be made a practicable one, and if any imperfections or difficulties arise in the administration of this experimental sum during this year, if it is decided to go further with the matter, if the matter is worth further development, next year a much more definite proposal will be put before the House.</P>
    <P>I may say quite frankly that we have learned from the experience of last year in connection with the distribution of the £100,000 Vote for the supply of milk to necessitous children.  There were abuses.  The decision to confine that to those in receipt of home assistance did lead in some cases to abuse. People who were not properly entitled to home assistance received a nominal amount of home assistance in order to entitle them to receive a supply of milk. In a similar way, because limitations were not imposed certain households received more than their due and proper supply.  As I say, we have learned in that connection from experience of that grant and new regulations have been issued dealing with the question of the distribution of milk to necessitous people.  We have initiated this as an experimental scheme, hoping to learn by experience, and with the feeling that it will fill a want in our social service, particularly in so far as distress in cities and urban areas is concerned, and next year we shall have much more definite proposals, possibly involving a greater amount of money, to submit to the Dáil.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £15,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1934, as an advance for the <Col N="1254" /> extension of the Beet Sugar Industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Estimate is required in order to provide funds for the inter-Departmental Committee which is being set up, pursuant to a decision of the Executive Council, for the promotion of a public company for the erection, acquisition and operation of sugar factories in the Saorstát.  As set out in the footnote to the Estimate, legislation will be introduced at an early date to give effect to the Government's proposals for the extension of this industry.  These proposals would provide among other things for the formation and registration of a new company; the advance from voted moneys of the preliminary expenses herein provided; the acquisition by the Minister for Finance of portion of the share capital; and for the taking of such other powers as are considered necessary for the successful expansion of the beet sugar industry in this country.  Pending the introduction and passing of such legislation the promoters of the company will incur certain expenditure properly chargeable against the share capital of the company when it has been subscribed. It is the intention, however, of the Government to have, if possible, the new factories erected and ready to commence operations in the sugar-making season of 1934.  Owing to the urgency of this matter, the officials who are promoting the company cannot afford to await the subscription of the capital, nor, since they are civil servants, is it considered proper that they should have to resort to borrowing.  While it might be possible for them to obtain the requisite funds as an overdraft from a bank on a written guarantee from the Minister for Finance that the amount of the overdraft would be duly repaid, I have thought that the giving of such a guarantee would be improper as it would anticipate the sanction of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Estimate itself for the initial outlay on stamp duty amounting to about £5,000, and registration fees, printing and establishment charges, and for such <Col N="1255" /> expenditure of the committee and its advisers as may be required.  As I have already stated, the fact that the company will be in a position to deal with the beet crop in 1934 on a greatly extended scale will lead to expenditure being incurred in anticipation of the subscription of the share capital.  We are anxious that arrangements should be pressed forward so far as possible to the point where constructional work on the new factories can be put in hands immediately after the necessary legislative authority to enable the company to start operations has been secured.  The total amount involved in the Estimate is £15,000.  It is possible that when the necessary estimates have been definitely made and the legislative proposals are put before the Dáil a very much larger sum will be required.  The £15,000 is in the nature of preliminary and promoting expenses to enable the Government to go ahead and. have everything ready to put before the Dáil in the form of definite proposals when the Dáil reassembles after the Recess.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement, if you take what it has in it, and what it has not in it, is a most extraordinary one.  It leads me to ask him either to amplify the statement he has made, if he has anything to add to it, or to ask the Minister for Agriculture to amplify that statement, and then to allow us to consider whether we might not report progress on the Estimate, with a view to allowing the House time to think over and consider the statement already made by the Minister and any other statement which may be made because, as I am sure both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture will understand, this is an Estimate which has been in our hands only for a day or two.  It implies, from what we have heard now, a very radical change in policy, or a radical addition to policy with regard to the development of the sugar beet industry in the country and, in connection with that, an immediate launching on a very large expenditure of money and the taking of very definite action that might commit the House in a number of ways.  I am sure that the Minister will appreciate the difficulty in which the House is in having this proposal flung at its head <Col N="1257" /> with the little information it has.  I would ask either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture to add to the information given to us and to have a little mercy on us and allow progress to be reported on the matter so that it might be considered and so that we might come, with more fairness to the proposal itself, to further discussion upon it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in rising is to join with Deputy Mulcahy in the representation he has made. This is really no more than a token Vote committing the House to a certain policy, and I think it is only right that the House should have some idea of the nature of the commitments it is entering into in connection with this Estimate.  When the question of the beet sugar factories arose at the Public Accounts Committee, last year, I drew the attention of the Committee to the expenditure in which this State was being involved and I asked for a memorandum, which, I have no doubt, every member of the Fianna Fáil Party has carefully read in the report of the Committee on Public Accounts.  I drew the attention of the Committee to the fact that the Government, under the existing scheme, was purchasing the beet for the Lippens' factory and making them a present of it.  They were purchasing all the beet that the Lippens' factory used and making them a present of it and, in order to induce Messrs. Lippens to accept the present, they went on to give them a further present of £29,000 per annum over and above the price of beet and then Mr. Lippens had the courtesy to produce beet sugar for the people of the Irish Free State.  Now, we are going to start three more factories.  That is what this means, and I think that the Minister for Agriculture, when he comes before the Dáil with an estimate of this kind, should give us a general review of what he thinks are the prospects of the beet sugar industry as a whole in this country and tell us what the total expenditure will be to which he proposes to commit the State in respect of beet sugar factories in the future and what he believes is <Col N="1258" /> the eventual future of the whole beet sugar industry.  When I mention these amazing figures, it is only right to add that our Government, in making these grants to the Lippens' group, went no further than, if they went as far as, the British Government when they were trying to promote a similar industry in England.  The subsidies paid in Great Britain during the same period as that in which the Carlow factory has been in existence, amounted to £27,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how many factories were operating in England but, as a matter of fact, they got presents of the beet, too, and it seems from the experience that we have here in the Free State, taken with the experience in Great Britain, as though it is very doubtful whether beet sugar can be produced at all except on those hopelessly uneconomic lines.  If the Government make up their mind in face of that to go on with the beet sugar industry, I want to submit to the Ministers that these are not industrial enterprises at all.  They are gigantic relief schemes and, accordingly, the Minister for Finance himself should take into consideration the future location of these factories. They should be put in areas which stand in need of relief, and the small farmers in the congested areas should be given the advantage of having a factory which will take an unremunerative crop at an artificially economic price.  That is the real purpose of these beet sugar factories.  If they are going to go on as at present we must try to lighten the burden of their expenses, and the best way in which we can do that is to finance them out of relief grants.  We will find that, if we put one factory, say, in Donegal, one in Mayo and one in West Kerry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Then they will be serving some useful purpose, but, to my mind, it is absolute folly to be pouring huge subsidies into the best sugar industry if the only function they serve is to divert tillage from some other crop into beet in the wealthier counties of this country.  I quite see that the thing is arguable and undoubtedly the matter deserves protracted consideration and requires elaboration by the Minister for Agriculture. I think the Government would do well to accept the suggestion of Deputy Mulcahy to allow progress to be reported on this Estimate to-day and to have a comprehensive statement from the Minister, allow the House to take that into consideration and deal with the Estimate at an early and convenient date.</P>

I suppose that, when the question is gone into from the locality point of view, the Minister for Agriculture will get more information, but I hope that the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company in Carlow will not be the precedent on which the new sugar industry will be floated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect of the matter which has not been touched upon, and which rather interests me.  What is going to be the result of all this on the price of sugar, and on what the poor of this country, particularly, will have to pay for their sugar.  As I understand it, the ambition at the bottom of the whole scheme is that we should produce here in the Irish Free State all the sugar that is required for consumption here.  I think that has been stated to be what we are aiming at: to make this country self-sufficient in the matter of sugar.  If that is what we are aiming at, I think we ought to be quite clear about it, and have some idea as to what the results are going to be with regard to the price of sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I know it is said that there is nothing which cannot be produced more cheaply somewhere than it can in Ireland, and that if cheapness of production was to be the sole test of what to produce we would produce nothing at all.  It is true that it is desirable to produce a certain number of things in this country&mdash;perhaps a great many things in this country&mdash;that can be produced more cheaply somewhere else.  But there are limits, and I wonder whether sugar is not a case in point.  There are certain things that can be produced so very much more cheaply elsewhere, and under such ideal conditions elsewhere, <Col N="1261" /> that it hardly seems an economic proposition to produce them on any great scale here.  I should have thought that wheat was one and sugar another. In this country, we can never hope to have such ideal conditions for sugar growing as, say, Cuba or Jamaica.  We can never hope, I think, to grow it with such extraordinary cheapness as it can be grown in those countries.  We have not got the climate or the kind of labour required to do anything of the kind.  I think that on those general grounds, and also because we have seen both in England and here the terribly expensive experiment this has been hitherto that we should go into the matter very thoroughly indeed before deciding to embark on this enterprise of producing all our sugar requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the capital required for the new company which it is proposed to set up, it will probably be somewhere between one and a half and two million pounds.  That will depend on the number of factories.  The number of factories which we think it is possible to erect for the 1934 crop will be three additional.  It may be necessary, afterwards, to erect another.  So far as we can make out, the maximum consumption of sugar in this country in any one year is about 100,000 tons. I think that figure of 100,000 tons was for an exceptional year, but the average would be something under that.  The Carlow factory is capable of producing about 20,000 tons a year, so that if we erected three more factories of the same capacity as the Carlow factory we would have almost sufficient to produce our full requirements.  With regard to the subsidy that would be necessary, Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Dillon are unanimously against this proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsidy, so far, paid to the Carlow factory, direct and indirect, would probably be somewhere about £400,000 a year.  That represents the subsidy paid in cash and the benefit they get by way of customs duty on sugar.  If the new factories are to be run on the same lines as the Carlow one, then Deputies may take it that the cost of the subsidy for each of them will be in or about £400,000 a year. That means that we would have to find, by way of subsidy, between one and a half and two million pounds a year if we were to proceed on the same lines as those adopted in the case of the Carlow factory.  We feel that we could not find that sum out of public funds. In order to make the thing a bit easier on the State, there are three ways to meet the situation to enable us to fill the gap.  The first is to cut down expenses.  That can be done, and we believe that a considerable saving can be effected under that head.  The second way is to increase the price of sugar, and thirdly, to reduce the price of beet.  When this new company starts business, they will in all probability have recourse to all three methods.  They will not depend on one alone to bridge this gap.  It may be possible, by having resort to these three methods&mdash;by increasing the price of sugar very slightly, by reducing the price of beet very slightly and by making as big a saving as possible on the running of the factory&mdash;to cut out the subsidy altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the present retail price of sugar is from 2½d. to 2¾d. per lb.  There may, naturally, be some protests against reducing the price paid to the farmers for beet, but there will be a certain set off to meet that. For instance, if we have a larger <Col N="1263" /> number of factories, people, who at present have to travel a considerable distance to the Carlow factory, will be very much nearer to one of the proposed new factories and, therefore, the amount they pay in freight will be less.  That is one advantage that the producer will reap from the setting up of the new factories.  It is also proposed to return free to the growers of beet the offals&mdash;the molasses and pulp. If we take the full feeding value of molasses and pulp as proved not only by the Department of Agriculture in this country, but by experiments in other countries, it will be found, I think, that under what is proposed the price to the beet growers will be perhaps more than what they are getting at present, and that even by not making allowance for the value of the offals, the price will work out at much the same as it is at present.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies said that it was rather unfair to ask that the Dáil should be committed to a sugar beet scheme without knowing fully what the scheme is.  We have no intention of doing that.  As the Minister for Finance explained in his opening statement, we are anxious to get the authority of the Dáil to make this advance to the company which is about to launch the scheme in order to enable them to go ahead.  If it were three or four outside people who were acting as the promoters in a scheme like this, they could very well go to the banks and get a loan to meet the preliminary expenses by giving a guarantee that the bank would be repaid by the company when formed, <Col N="1264" /> but seeing that it is civil servants who are involved in this we thought it fairer to consult the Dáil before giving them authority to get an overdraft, or before making them an advance for the preliminary expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as the company is formed, of course, this amount will be repayable. It may be said that we are not committing the Dáil to the scheme at this stage.  A Bill will be introduced which will give the Minister for Finance authority to take shares in the new company.  At that stage, of course, the Minister will, I take it, be in a position to give more details than we have at present, because as time goes on naturally we shall be in a position to give fuller details of what is to be proposed in the prospectus.  When the prospectus is issued, of course, it will be for the public as well as for members of the Dáil to come to their own conclusions whether the State will be justified in investing money in the new company or not.  If we did not get authority from the Dáil to proceed in this way, we would be compelled, more or less, to enter into negotiations with some group of financiers, whether native or foreign, to put this thing through for us.  We are very anxious to avoid the necessity of going to foreign capitalists at any rate.  We are anxious, of course, to get, after the prospectus is issued, as much native capital as possible, but in case the native capital is not sufficient we shall come to the House again with a Bill to enable the Minister for Finance to make up whatever deficiency there may be in the capital. I do not know if any other question has been raised.  I think that, as far as we are concerned, the only information that can be given at this stage is with regard to how the committee which is investigating this matter means to proceed with the business. I do not know if we can give any more precise details.  We certainly cannot with regard to the exact amount of capital required or the exact price that can be paid for beet.  As soon as the committee has examined the matter further, and have power to get in touch with suppliers of equipment and so on, they will then be in a position to draw up the prospectus and <Col N="1265" /> have the shares issued for public subscription.</P>

Another way of looking at the matter is this, that there is a certain number of people appointed to inquire into this matter.  They are going to get £15,000 and are going then to operate somewhat in the following manner.  They will scratch their heads and say: &ldquo;Let us look around and see how we are going to set up a beet industry, how we are going to get capital for it in the country, how we are going to get machinery and generally, after we have got machinery, how we are going to get a general scheme of management which will be located in the country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Having got that far they are to enter into negotiations with the Government to see what kind of treatment they can get in the matter of a subsidy or assistance to bring the company into operation with a view to its being a complement to the present beet factory, and to its making the remainder of the quantity of sugar required in the country.  As far as I could understand from the Minister that is the proposal.  I should like to know if I have covered the matter properly, if, the Committee having gone through all that work, made their proposals and even sketched out an agreement with the Government here that would induce them to set up a business here, it can still be said we are uncommitted to anything except that we may have to say good-bye to the £15,000 that will have gone in expenses.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was as far as possible from being correct. The position of the three gentlemen is this: that they know that the circumstances in this State are such that the sugar beet industry can be established on a successful basis.  They represent other parties with considerable <Col N="1267" /> resources who are prepared to sink these resources in the establishment of the industry provided a sound business-like proposition is put up to them.  The three gentlemen are provided with £15,000 to enable them to put up a sound business proposition to their principal.  They enter into these investigations charged with nothing else than this&mdash;to put up a scheme on sound economic lines, the soundest that can be devised.  In order to do that they are also told that they must take steps to provide as far as possible the finances of the scheme otherwise than through their principal, confining the financing of it, however, within the area in which the factories are to operate.  The formation of the company will necessarily involve them in certain expenditure which will be in the nature of transferring from one pocket of their principal into another pocket of their principal say, £5,000.  It will also involve them, not so much in negotiations but in investigations into plants abroad, into the examination of various classes of technical machinery and equipment and the negotiation possibly of provisional agreements with certain people of technical qualifications, and a general examination as to the position in which the factories should be placed and factors which would determine the location of the factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of this work has been provided for in any estimate which has been submitted to, and adopted by the House.  Accordingly, in order to enable that work to be carried out by the three gentlemen&mdash;who happen to be public servants&mdash;who are undertaking the task on behalf of the Government, it is necessary that definite authority should be given for the expenditure of money upon these matters.  That expenditure, upon preliminary investigation, does not commit the Dáil, or the Government to any proposals which may be, shall I say <i>in petitio</i>, at the moment.  It may be in being, but it enables the Government to make up their mind on these proposals and to submit them to the House, and will involve the Government coming to the <Col N="1268" /> House at a later date and saying: &ldquo;We have spent £15,000.  We find it is not practicable to proceed with the scheme, and we do not intend to do so,&rdquo; or it may say: &ldquo;We have made more detailed investigations which, we are satisfied, were necessary, and we have made preliminary arrangements to launch the company, because time is pressing.&rdquo;  If we want to have the scheme in operation in 1934, it is essential that preliminary arrangements for financing the scheme should be made at this autumn at the very latest.  Our representatives have commissioned people to prepare plans and specifications for the factory.  They are ready now to issue the specifications and to secure tenders, being satisfied, after due investigation, that the plans and the equipment will be delivered in time to enable the factory to open in the autumn of 1934.  Accordingly we propose that the Minister for Finance should be given authority to subscribe the necessary capital for the company, and that the Government should be given authority to impose, in certain circumstances, an additional duty on imported sugar, and that, generally, the scheme should be put into operation.</P>

We are going to reduce expenditure in the administration of the factory, although we are credibly informed otherwise by one of the greatest authorities in the manufacture of beet sugar, one of the heads controlling the Carlow factory, still we in Dáil Eireann are going to give Messrs.  Lippens a demonstration of how it is to be done.  We are going to reduce expenditure on the manufacture of sugar and our next performance is that we are going to reduce the cost of beet.  The Minister for Agriculture will remember that when he was on the opposite benches he became ecstatic when the price was reduced from 42/- to 39/-.</P>

The Carlow growers went on strike when <Col N="1270" /> 3/- was taken off.  If the crop was not economic when 3/- was taken off, what will be the position by the time that we have made another slight reduction?  Deputies will remember that when the Minister for Finance first took office one of his first actions was to reduce the duty on sugar.  He stated that he did so in the name of humanity.  He transferred that duty to tea, because sugar, he said, was such a vital necessity to the growing children of poor people.  Now we are informed by the Minister for Agriculture that he is going to increase the price of sugar, and that the Minister for Finance is going to increase the duty on sugar.  That is going to take the fat out of this proposal. The Minister for Finance did not tell us what the increased duty is going to be.  How much duty did the Minister take off sugar?</P>

The blessing we are to get from the scheme is that we are going to reduce the price of beet, but to increase the price of sugar, and we are going to show Messrs.  Lippens how it ought to be done.  Is not that a very attractive programme?  That is what we are facing now.  The Minister says that the £15,000 commits us to <Col N="1271" /> nothing.  Surely it commits us to an expression of opinion.  I certainly think he ought not proceed without further investigation, and without clearly informing the House what the liabilities are going to be.  The Minister says that as yet he does not know what they will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture stated, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out, that there were three methods in which it was proposed to meet portion of the expenses in connection with the extension of the sugar beet industry.  One of them was concerned with the elimination of costs. This was, to some extent, dealt with by Deputy Dillon.  The Minister may, perhaps, say that it is proposed to pay a lesser dividend in the future.  The capital of the sugar beet factory is, approximately, £400,000.  I am speaking from recollection as to the figure. The site of the factory was admirably suited to the purpose.  It was, strangely enough, selected by the people concerned without representations from any source save, perhaps, from the people of Carlow.  It was not selected owing to representations made, at any time, by me during the time I represented that constituency. (<i>Interruption</i>).  If the Minister would speak up we would hear him.  He ought not to be ashamed of anything he has to say.  The site was selected by people who knew their business. It had many things to recommend it. In the first place, it was in an area in which beet could be satisfactorily grown.  In the second place, it was in a district in which lime, which is essential for the manufacture of the sugar beet, was easily available.  In the third place, it was beside a river, which is essential to the working of the factory.  If one had time to waste in reading the speeches of Ministers to deputations, it would appear that political influence may be exerted in respect of the establishment of these factories.  If that be so and if the sites of the factories lack those things available in the case of the Carlow site, then there will be no money saved in administration costs or in the running of the factories.  The running <Col N="1272" /> of the factories will be much more expensive. The suggestion that money is to be put into the undertaking by the State lends some colour to the suggestion that Ministerial influence may be exercised in the selection of sites.</P>
      <P>What is the sum proposed to be saved in the administrative or running costs of these factories?  There is no factory in the whole world better run than the factory in Carlow.  Are we to run the three new factories better than that factory is run?  If so, are we learning from those people as to how we should run these factories? Is there anybody in this country who knows how to run a beet factory? Is there anybody in this country who knows how to lay out the plans or to fix up the machinery?  If there is, I have never heard of him and I should be glad to hear of him.  We may discount any possible saving in that connection, with this exception&mdash; that the cost of the machinery may have decreased since the inauguration of the factory at Carlow.  We may save money in that way.  There may be also the possibility of a cheaper site but, even there, the promoters of the Carlow factory were singularly fortunate in discovering a site with much more sand than was required for the construction of the factory. We may dismiss any possible saving as regards capital, having regard to the standing of the persons associated with the running of the Carlow factory. Deputy Dillon has mentioned the name of the chairman, Sir Maurice Lippens.  He had associated with him several other persons, each of whom had experience of sugar manufacture.  All of them were anxious, having regard to the special circumstances on the Continent at the time, to get the last penny of value for their money.  So far as I recollect, British currency, at the time the factory was established, was against the Continentals.  That is in favour of the present proposal.  Continental money has a better value now and only in that direction can there be an advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The costs in connection with the establishment of the factory are not <Col N="1273" /> the main costs.  After all, if the new factory were to be satisfied with 7½ per cent. Per annum, and the cost of putting up the factory were £100,000 less, that represents a saving of £7,500. Let us double it in order to give more colour to the suggestion thrown out by the Minister for Finance, and we have £15,000.  The next question that arises is the price of the beet.  I suppose we may take it that there is an average of ten tons of beet to the acre.  About 17,000 acres were planted.  That gives us 170,000 tons of beet.  What is the reduction that is to take place in the price of beet to meet the economy of the new proposal?  There was a very considerable objection on the part of beet growers to a reduction in the price during the last few years.  There was a natural reluctance to accept a lower price.  From the figures I have had presented to me, the average profit for the last five years is much the same, although the costs incidental to the production of the beet increased very considerably.  They increased from £15 16s. 10d. in the first year&mdash;1927&mdash;to £19 9s. 0d. for 1932, although the profits were practically the same.  Let us, for the sake of argument, assume that the Ministry will not allow too large a reduction in the price&mdash;that they take off 2/- per ton of beet.  We get from the 170,000 tons £17,000.  Add that to the £15,000 I have already mentioned, and we have £32,000 saved.  Now, assistance is to come from a third source&mdash;an increase in the price of sugar.  The Minister committed himself to a figure of 15 per cent. Fifteen per cent. would be sufficient to provide money for the factory right away.  It is almost equivalent to ½d. in the lb.  That would produce £400,000. My recollection is that the whole cost of the Carlow factory over ten years was £2,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>£1,941,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>So that, from the 15 per cent. we have a sum far in excess of what is required.  If there is going to be an increase in the price of sugar, 7½ per cent. would probably give the figure required.  So far, we have 32,000 mythical pounds saved and, deducting that from the sum required, <Col N="1274" /> we find that there is still required, approximately £160,000.  That does not necessitate a 15 per cent. tax on sugar. Then we get back to the position that we are saving £32,000, if so much, on the whole transaction.  That is on a factory of the same size as Carlow, assuming a site close by a river, with limestone and sand in the immediate district.</P>
      <P>The present scheme was a good, sound scheme but, like practically all sugar beet experiments both in England and on the Continent, these schemes are expensive.  If we are to have three more factories, we have to make up our minds whether we are going to put up for this purpose approximately three times the sum involved in this case, allowing for a saving of £32,000 or £33,000 in the case of each factory.  It would be a very good thing if we had established in this country the manufacture of a sufficient quantity of sugar to suit our people.  It can be secured for the country if we are prepared to pay for it.</P>

      <P>There is no short cut to get a sugar factory under any other conditions.  It must be remembered that in addition to paying for it we are also invited to consider the lowering of the prices for beet as announced by the Minister.  It may be that in the new districts which the Minister has in mind the soil will not be so suitable or that it will not be more suitable than the site of the Carlow factory.  I think we would be entitled to see set out in black and white, in the form of a tabular statement, some information as to what the ultimate costs would be on being asked to provide this £15,000.  The Minister will, I am sure, admit that it is due to the Dáil that information of that sort should be furnished to it before we are asked to spend so much money in what the Minister calls these difficult and anxious times for the farmers, labourers and shopkeepers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about this before the Vote is <Col N="1275" /> put.  I am sure that the scheme got very careful consideration from the Executive Council before it was brought forward here.  If we are to have it on the same lines as the Carlow factory I do not think it is going to be a very paying proposition.  We want at any rate to see that the farmer gets his cost of production in the first place.  We want to secure that.  We do not want firms coming in here and guaranteed subsidies for a number of years while the farmer himself is guaranteed the price for only a short period as was the case in the Carlow factory.  Deputy Cosgrave told us very kindly about the Carlow site.  I hope that these sites are not to be used like the Carlow site to sweeten any particular constituency for any President or Minister.  When the proposition of starting a beet factory in the Free State was on before, it was decided, and Deputy Cosgrave knows it, that the factory was to be in East Cork in my constituency at Buttevant.  Deputy Cosgrave knows that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the merits of the place will be taken into first consideration this time.  That, unfortunately, was not the case last time.  Considering it from every standpoint, if we are to have £400,000 subsidy, as in the case of the Carlow factory, and if we are to consider that the amount of sugar imported into this country last <Col N="1276" /> year amounted only to £1,000,000, we want to know, from these facts, where we are to get the subsidy and where it is to come from in order to make £1,000,000 worth of sugar?  That is a matter that requires very careful consideration.  I would like to say that the first thing that has to be taken into consideration is that the farmer will get at least the cost of production for his article.  He did not get his cost of production in the case of the Carlow Sugar Factory.  The farmer is entitled in whatever bargain is made here with foreign firms to the first consideration.  The first consideration is for our own people. When bargains are made and subsidies made to foreigners, the first thing to be taken into consideration must be that the farmers producing beet will get their cost of production.</P>

      <P>With regard to the selection of the sites, this committee will recommend, I take it, the sites to be examined by the technical advisers who may come along from the management of these factories. The Department of Agriculture will be there to advise on what are potential beet-growing areas.  The Department of Industry and Commerce will be there to give its views, but in the long run it is the technical advisers at the disposal of the company who will select the sites.  There is no Minister or President or anybody else in this Government anyway who will have any control over the selection of the sites.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Cosgrave as to the savings that can be made, I do not deny at all that the Carlow factory is run on very efficient lines.  I do not know that the technical advisers that the new people will have will be able to improve on it.  But at any rate machinery is cheaper now and there will be savings in that direction.  There may be savings also in the amount to be paid in dividends and in the difference in the reserve.</P>

      <P>No, I have not, but the committee who are examining this <Col N="1277" /> gave us their opinion on what will be required.  That is certainly a saving in the running of the factories.  With a small increase in the price of sugar and a small decrease in the price of beet the thing can be done without any subsidy at all.  If we were to give subsidies on the Carlow lines they would amount to about £2,000,000, so that the £2,000,000 must be made up somewhere else, and where Deputy Cosgrave admits&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister said there would be a small increase in the price of the sugar.  That means that there will be a tariff excluding foreign sugar?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And I presume also that the Minister means that the imported article will be paying a higher duty to the State than the sugar manufactured at home.  A higher duty will be paid on the imported sugar. That means that instead of paying money out of the Exchequer it was a matter of the Carlow factory being exempted from the paying of duty. The fact is, as in Carlow, the sugar will be subsidised by the Irish people and it is immaterial whether the Government pay a subsidy to the factory or charge a lesser duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be the same thing. Deputy Cosgrave said that ½d. per lb. would amount to between £400,000 and £600,000.  That would be as much as was paid under the old system to one factory.  But then we propose to run four factories on this system of increasing the price by ½d. per lb.  So <Col N="1278" /> that it is certainly doing the thing in a cheaper way.  We could, if we like, leave the sugar as it is and pay a subsidy of £460,000, pay it as a direct subsidy, and it would have the same effect.  That is going to be the total cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister puts ½d. per lb. on sugar, and that amounts to £460,000 in the case of the Carlow factory.  That is what it produces. Now, if one factory produces that amount, what would be the cost in the case of the three factories?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>You have three factories producing each what the Carlow factory produces.  It is a matter of ½d. per lb. in the sugar, and it does not matter whether it is on one factory or spread over the three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes.  I was reminded also by Deputy Dillon that some years ago I complained of the price of beet to the farmers.  I did complain about it, but the complaint I made, and in which I was joined by the beet growers themselves, was not that the price was too low for them to grow beet, but that they were not getting their fair share out of the factory in view of what the factory was getting in the way of subsidies.</P>

      <P>That is not my recollection, but the Minister may be right. However, assuming that the Minister is right, 15 per cent. would be £60,000. The subsidy was £200,000, so somebody must have got £140,000.  The subsidy was approximately £200,000.</P>

The Minister made a case here in the Dáil a couple of years ago that there was a big subsidy being given by the Dáil, and that the beet growers did not get it, but that the factory got it.  According to his own statement, 15 per cent. is the amount of the dividend.  The dividends then would amount to £60,000.  Somebody got £140,000.  Who got it?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister move to report progress and let us take up this Estimate next week. The proposal is an entirely unprecedented one and has been put before us in a way that is also unprecedented. It was only as the discussion went on that we got any idea of how deeply the matter had been gone into, and in view <Col N="1281" /> of the fact that it has been gone into so deeply I think we might have a more systematic and detailed presentation of the case to the House than we have had.  I ask the Minister to move to report progress and allow himself and ourselves more time to discuss this matter before the Estimate is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained to the House already that the House would have the fullest opportunity of discussing our definitive proposals in the form of a Bill, and I would suggest to the Deputy that there is not much to be gained by holding up this Estimate for further discussion. The matter is urgent.  If the extension is to take place and the new factories are to be put in operation in the autumn of next year a good deal of preliminary work will have to be done &mdash;preliminary work which is of a provisional character and which has not been actually and finally delimited and defined.  If we are to be held up at this stage it means that we lose a year inevitably.  I do not think that it is the feeling of the House that we should abandon the idea of going ahead with the development of the beet sugar industry in this country in the next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, asking the Minister to postpone, until next week, the discussion of a matter that was only put before us within the last day or two, does not suggest that it is an attempt in any way to postpone any development of the beet sugar industry that ought to take place in this country in the next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a note to the Estimate which says: &ldquo;Legislation will be introduced at an early date to give effect to the Government's proposals for the extension of the beet sugar industry.&rdquo;  I am quite prepared to admit that this sum of £15,000 is experimental but the note is far from being experimental.  According to the note we are committed to the acceptance of the Government's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That note only means that if there are definite proposals for the extension of the beet sugar factory, they must be submitted to the House. It means that the Government will be <Col N="1282" /> bound to announce its intentions as to whether it is going ahead with these proposals and, if so, to produce them in the form of a Bill, or else to announce that it is going to abandon the proposals.  I suggest that that is the true reading of the note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister states definitely that a week's delay is going to force him to abandon the whole thing for 12 months, then I think we ought to give him the Estimate, but I find it difficult to see how that would happen.  An opportunity should be taken at a very early date to discuss this whole question fully, and with a full and comprehensive statement from the Minister for Agriculture.  If we give him this Supplementary Estimate to-day, let it be in no sense taken that we think the Government should go on with the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that I am trying to help him in this matter.  From the development of this discussion here, and the flow of information in dribs and drabs, disclosing very full examination and consideration, and to my mind a very full determination already crystallised on the part of the Executive Council to proceed with the development of the beet industry, I am afraid the Minister may find himself in the autumn coming before us with very definite commitments already entered into, and in this way putting himself in the position of being charged with bad faith in his handling of the case here.  Certainly I cannot conceive in any way how a postponement of the debate for another week could have any ill effects.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that when I asked what the sum was in connection with this industry last week, or whenever it was before the House, I was told it was £15,000.  At the time in all good faith I came to the conclusion that that £15,000 was required this year for the Carlow sugar factory. I got at that time no information whatever as to the new proposal.  I have <Col N="1283" /> read out already one note.  What is the other?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Advance to meet the preliminary expenses of floating a Public Company, under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1924, for the erection, acquisition and operation of sugar factories, and to meet all necessary expenses incurred by the promoters in connection with the extension of the beet sugar industry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the erection, acquisition and operation of sugar factories&rdquo;&mdash;there is very much more in that Estimate as it stands than the mere experimental expenses of £15,000.  There is very much more involved in that actual wording of the Estimate.  Surely the House is entitled before it spends £15,000&mdash;although £5,000 of that may simply mean a transfer&mdash;to get in black and white the Government's present proposals in regard to it.  This is what the Government's estimate of the cost of this industry is going to be.  I am sure there are Deputies in the House who must have been astonished this afternoon when they heard that, in addition to all that is there, the Minister proposes to invest a considerable amount of capital in this industry. There are certain industries in which I would recommend and strongly advocate the sinking of Irish capital, but they are confined to those in which our citizens know something about the business.  I would much prefer, personally speaking, to see a considerable amount of foreign capital in a business of that sort in which you are dependent upon foreign advice, technical and otherwise.  We do not know that business; we have no technical experts here, and are not likely to have them for a good many years.  In consequence, if people are going to invest in that business here, I should like to see a considerable amount of foreign capital invested in it.  It is not the same as a boot factory, a brewery or a railroad.  It is a business on which we have no technical advice here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that no good purpose would be served by postponing this Estimate for any period.  If we were to postpone it the only implication <Col N="1284" /> would be that the matter having been fully considered, all Parties in the House would be very much more committed to the Government's proposal than they are by the acceptance of this Estimate in the form in which I have submitted it to the House to-day, merely as being the essential which would confer upon us the authority to go forward with the further investigation and examination of our ideas in this matter.  I think Deputy Cosgrave intimated that when the first beet sugar factory was established here this was the line his Government took. They negotiated, and then came to the House with their proposals.  We do not want to approach anybody and be under an obligation to any person&mdash; an obligation which would possibly involve us in honourable commitments, as apart altogether from legal commitments. We do not want to be under any obligation to any interest in this country or outside this country. We feel that we can do just as well without having any entanglements of any sort, until we are definitely in a position to formulate our proposals and put them to the Dáil.</P>

We propose to pay for any information we may get in the form of technical assistance or technical advice.  I think that that was possibly the plan which was followed on the previous occasion, but at any rate it is the plan we propose to adopt now.  Whatever advice we get we will pay for it in cash, and have done with it.

If we postpone it we will have another day taken up with it.  It simply means that, as the Government programme has to go through, the anticipations of an early adjournment will not be fulfilled and&mdash;which is much more important&mdash;very valuable time will meanwhile have been lost.  For that reason I think there is no anxiety on the part of any section in the House to hold up this project unduly.  The House will be able, when definitive proposals come before it, to form its own judgment, and it will be perfectly free to vote either way.

      <P>The market for molasses during the last 18 months has practically collapsed.  Two years ago it must have been a valuable asset.  If the market ever rises again it will, of course, be again a very valuable asset. I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that it is manifest we do not know enough in relation to what this business is going to involve us in.  The Minister for Finance said that to withhold this Estimate would mean holding him up for the whole year.  I think, in the circumstances, we ought to give it to him, but that is the only reason why we should give him the Estimate now.</P>

      <P>With regard to Section 2, I think the Minister undertook to consider the question I raised about the possibility of there being an abstentionist party.  He said that the Minister for Finance was considering that matter.  As this section now <Col N="1287" /> stands, there is nothing to ensure that seats will be taken in the House.  The Minister may recollect the phrase &ldquo;as soon as practicable after the result of such election is declared.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I remember the Deputy raised the point on Second Reading.  It is possible, as he said, that an abstentionist party could arise.  There will be no payment, however, to a Deputy who does not take his seat.  The deposit, of course, would be returned when a Deputy is declared elected.  We are anxious not to have any political test, or any reason given to anybody, to fancy that there is anything in the nature of a test that would prevent him taking his seat.  There is no penal clause suggested against anybody who does not take his seat.</P>

      <P>The Minister and his leader have often suggested that there is no conscience test and there is now no reason why anybody should not take his seat.  After all, the dignity of Parliament demands that members should assemble here in the House.  Of course, the Minister can realise the value of being outside this House for four or five years, the various promises that can be made regarding the improvements that could be brought about from the point of view of taxation, public expenditure, and so on, and how easily it could be said at an election &ldquo;a vote for an abstentionist member will not upset the balance of Parties in the House.&rdquo;  Is there not, in practically every Parliament in the world, some arrangement whereby Deputies should take their seats?  The provision here was that a deposit would be returned as soon as the person elected took his seat.  It may be the likelihood of the loss of the deposit was an inducement.  We all have had experience, of course, of even that inducement being resisted for a number of years.  It is a loophole which, I understood on the last day, the Minister was going to look into. I think it is inadvisable to allow any such possibility to arise and I think it might easily be safeguarded against.</P>

In view of the current statements made on public platforms and elsewhere about the non-legitimate position of this House, I think that if the Executive Council have considered this matter and if what is in the Bill is a complete statement of their policy on it, then one must despair of the political wisdom on the benches opposite.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that any Deputy who is elected, but who does not take his seat, will not draw a salary.  Will the Minister explain that?  If it is an unjust and inequitable thing that a man who, because he does not want to come into the House, should forfeit his £100, why should there be any difference between that and a man forfeiting £360 a year? Apparently, these heroes outside who stand so rigidly on principle must not suffer any financial loss.  They proceed to go up for election and the Minister is horrified at the thought that these noble people should lose £100.  If a person who is elected comes in he will get £360 a year.  If he does not come in he will not get that money.  Will the Minister explain what is there to prevent him getting the £360 under this law if it goes through as it stands at present.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a Bill which has been introduced in order to set right a certain anomaly which has arisen in connection with the membership of the Board of Trustees at present administering the affairs of the Clare Castle Pier.  Under the Shannon Act of 1885 trustees were appointed to administer the affairs of this pier in accordance with the law. In 1931 it was discovered that the trustees who at present occupy the position were not appointed in a valid manner, because under the Act of 1885, five members must be present in order to form a quorum when a vacancy is being filled, whereas three members of the Board are quite sufficient to carry out the ordinary business.  It appears that members were co-opted from time to time by a quorum consisting of only three members, while they were not rightfully entitled under the Act of 1885 to co-opt unless they had a quorum of five.  It was found that of five trustees who occupied the position only one was apparently validly appointed. The purpose of the Bill is to validate such acts as the trustees may have carried out up to the passage of the Bill; to validate their position, to remove the existing trustees and to reappoint a full board of nine, consisting of the five who are at present on the Board, but four of whom, as I say, were invalidly appointed under the existing law, and the Minister proposes to nominate four others.  The names of the nine trustees are given in the Schedule.</P>

It is merely to set right a position which has arisen and which was not in accordance with the law.

The function of the trustees has, I think, nothing to do with the Bill under consideration.</P>

      <P>There is evidently at the present moment a way in which these trustees can be appointed.

I should like to know from the Minister what is the reason for departing from the present statutory method of appointing trustees and, secondly, I should like to put again to the Minister what Deputy Minch has put, what particular functions these persons that the House is now asked by legislation to ratify the appointment of have to carry out.</P>

      <P>The Order which is now being made with reference to the pier is similar to the Order which was originally made under the 1885 Act. The purpose of that Act was to empower the Commissioners of Public Works to commit, with the consent of the Treasury, any of the seven piers in the estuary of the River Shannon specified in the First Schedule to that enactment to a body of trustees or to a local authority.  I take it that the trustees are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the piers and the carrying out of whatever statutory duties attach to their position under that Act.  In reply to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, I am not aware that there has been any departure from the usual procedure in this matter.  The trustees have always been appointed by order and I am not aware that there is any departure from the usual procedure in the proposal that the Minister should appoint nine persons. It happens that five of those <Col N="1294" /> persons have already been acting as trustees.  I am not aware that there is, in fact, any departure from the usual method of appointing trustees in this case.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister that the practice always has been that the Minister appointed because, if that is so, I find it very difficult to reconcile that with the Minister's opening statement that the normal method of appointment was by co-option and that that method had broken down because what purported to be valid co-options had turned out to be invalid owing to an insufficient quorum for the purpose being present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The order appointing the trustees was, hitherto made, I understand, by the Commissioners of Public Works.

I have not got the Act by me at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can see, this Bill falls under two heads (1) to validate what was done by persons who acted as trustees when their appointment as trustees was invalid and (2) their appointment was invalid because they had been elected to the board by a business quorum where the statute required an election quorum, the business quorum being three and the election quorum five.  That seems to me to be perfectly all right.  It is purely an indemnity Bill.  The Minister then goes on, by statute, to dismiss the one genuine trustee, to declare the four invalid trustees are not trustees and to appoint these five gentlemen as statutory trustees and, to that number, to add four new trustees by statute. Apparently, when the Shannon Act of 1885 was passed, the Commissioners of Public Works had power to name <i>de noro</i> the statutory number of <Col N="1295" /> trustees.  The Minister has not told us how many trustees were provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to state who is to blame as I do not know the exact period over which the events took place.  All I know is that, in 1931, through the Department of Local Government and Public Health, we were advised that six persons claimed to be trustees and on investigation it was found that, apparently, only one person out of the six had been validly appointed although the order, when it was made in 1886, specifically mentioned nine persons and laid down that when a vacancy occurred the vacancy should be filled by a meeting at which a quorum of not less than five trustees should be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty at the moment is that the original order vested in the Commissioners of Public Works the power to nominate nine persons but the board was to be kept full by co-options.  This Bill names nine persons and the question is whether these persons are to be re-elected at regular intervals or whether they are trustees for life and whether the board will be kept full in future, under the supervision of the Department of Industry and Commerce, by co-option. Does this statutory appointment differ in any particular from the appointments under the Act of 1885?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I understand from the Minister, the position was this: That the Commissioners of Public Works appointed, to begin with, nine persons; as they fell out others were to be co-opted, while now there are as a matter of fact five <Col N="1296" /> persons, one of whom is correctly a trustee, the other four having been improperly co-opted.  Would not the ordinary course for the Minister to adopt be to validate the co-option of those four, who together with the one who is correctly there would make up a valid quorum and could co-opt, if they liked, another four?  That would be the ordinary course.  It would be an ordinary Bill of indemnity which we would expect, I think, to see adopted. Why has the Minister departed from that?  Why is he now, under this statute, taking for the time being the power to nominate four himself instead of validating the improper co-option of those gentlemen who were improperly co-opted and enabling them for the future to act legally and to co-opt fellow trustees?</P>

      <P>Even though the Minister's advisers may have recommended the adoption of this course, we are faced with the problem that, as soon as the number of trustees goes below nine again we will be in the same position.  Bills such as this ought not to be brought continually before Parliament.  Either the Minister ought to have power to make nominations in certain cases, or to validate certain Acts in other cases. No adviser, I think, would question the wisdom of having some such clause as would cover that in a measure of this kind. We have nine recommendations.  I presume they are all right.  I do not know that I know any of them, but they are placed in very extraordinary order.  They are not alphabetical and some of the additions are not where they would be in the ordinary course. The whole Bill seems to me to be rather hastily considered and I would suggest to the Minister the advisability of amending it on Report Stage so as to provide power to deal with a situation of this sort if it should arise again, without having to come to Parliament to validate certain Acts or, alternatively, leaving people in a position to question these Acts outside. All this machinery of Government ought to be so arranged that it should not be necessary to bring Indemnity Acts into Parliament and that it should not be necessary, for the purpose of appointing nine trustees to a Board for a small place such as this, to take up the time of Parliament. That could be obviated by the inclusion of such a clause as I suggest.</P>

      <P>What I want to know is this: Is the Minister in a position to give the House any explanation of this departure in naming by statute certain gentlemen to be members of this Board under an Indemnity Act? All the Minister had to do was to indemnify before the pseudo-trustees, and then validate the appointment of these gentlemen, whereupon those four gentlemen, acting as valid trustees, could have filled the Board in accordance with the original statute. If that had been done the necessity for this schedule would have disappeared. That would seem to me to have been the more regular way to have gone about this business.  The Minister does not seem to know why that was not done.  All that he does know is that his advisers, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, told him to do something, but that is not a satisfactory case to make to the House. There ought to be some explanation, I think, given to the House as to why there is this departure.  Deputy Minch asked what the trustees do.  Apparently the trustees, as defined in Section 1, are required to maintain Clare Castle Pier, in the County Clare, but whether they are entitled to levy tolls on that pier, or to impose charges, we do not know.  What I object to is the naming of these nine gentlemen by statute, when it is quite unnecessary, and of trying to get from the Dáil an expression of approval&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Minister for Finance to honour an obligation which was first assumed by the Dáil in 1924 under Sections 6 of the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Act, the acceptance of which was subsequently repeated by our predecessors during their term in office, and has since been accepted by us.  This Bill authorises the Minister for Finance to repay to each subscriber to the Dáil Eireann External Loans 1919-1920 the sum of one dollar twenty-five cents for each dollar subscribed and to take into account in doing so any payments made by the receivers appointed by the Supreme Court of New York.  It has been calculated that in order to repay the balance of the subscribers' claims on this basis, and to repay all other subscribers in full, it will require, at the present rate of exchange, the sum of £1,200,000.  The Bill, however, authorises the issue of a sum not exceeding £1,500,000, the balance being required, mainly, to cover contingencies, such as a possible disimprovement of the sterling dollar exchange rate, and, as to a small part of it, such other incidental expenses as may be incurred in the repayment.  It is proposed under the Bill to make payments due on ten dollar and 25 dollar bills wholly in cash and, in the case of bonds of a higher denomination, to empower the Minister either to make the payment in cash or in stock, or partly in stock and partly in cash, at the option of the Minister for Finance. It is not possible at the present date to indicate how the higher denomination bonds will, in fact, be paid.  The decision will depend largely on the exchange situation and the Exchequer <Col N="1300" /> position when we come to begin payment.</P>
      <P>So far as the external loans are concerned, Section 4 provides that application for redemption may be made at any time before, but not after, the 31st day of March, 1934, and must be made in writing.  Section 6 proposes to apply similar limitations to the Dáil Eireann Internal Loan, a small portion of which may possibly remain to be repaid, but in connection with which it is not proposed to limit the date on which claims may be entered in the Register also to the 31st day of March, 1934.  The Bill is a simple one.  As I have already stated, it is to give the Minister for Finance power to honour what are the obligations that have already been accepted by the Dáil, by our predecessors in office and by the present Government.  I trust it will meet with the acceptance of the House.</P>

      <P>I heard of a man once who prayed that he might be spared the inconvenience of having any shame.  In so far as some people are concerned, I think that prayer has been answered.  The question arises: why is this Bill brought in?  The American Courts decided that we were not responsible for this money, and the way they came to decide it was this: when this State came into existence we accepted all the liabilities of the previous Dála and we naturally claimed also all assets.

      <P>These moneys were raised in America during the years 1919 to 1921.  A fair amount of them were expended here during that period and a fair amount remained at the end of that time.  Everybody who subscribed money in America during that time subscribed them really as a gift and not as a loan.  On behalf of the President that statement was made only a short time ago&mdash;in February, 1930.  A document was sent out for the President signed by a lawyer who <Col N="1304" /> cost this State very dearly, named Frank P. Walsh.  The statement was headed: &ldquo;Irish Press, Limited, American Office (Room 3907), Transportation Building, 225 Broadway, New York City.  American Committee: Frank P. Walsh, Chairman; M. J.

      <P>The money which you gave in the years 1919 to 1921 to help the cause of Ireland is about to be given back to you.

      <P>I am replying to the Minister.  These moneys were raised as a loan in 1920 and 1921 and when the Free State came into existence a large amount of the money was spent. A very large sum actually remained in America.  This State claiming that it was going to be responsible for the liabilities should also have received the assets.  A case was brought in the American Courts, the name of the case being, I think, the Free State and others v. S. O'Mara and others. A man named Finnerty came here and interviewed Mr. de Valera, as he then was, in Arbour Hill.  Mr. de Valera and others made affidavits, the purport of which was that the residue of the funds did not belong to this State, because this State had no claim either to the assets or to the liabilities.  I am interested to know if the President will deny, as the Minister for Finance has attempted to deny, that he did swear these affidavits.</P>

      <P>The Minister suggested that my word for this should not be taken.  These affidavits were sworn and, as a result of the sworn affidavits, on the part of the President and others, this State was put to considerable expense in running this legal action in the United States of America.  The case went on for a long time and came to a point when the President&mdash;Mr. de Valera as he was at the time&mdash;realised that his side had not a dog's chance of winning.  Then his friends, with his assent, arranged for a commitee of bondholders to lodge a claim in the courts, that the residue of the money should be returned to them.  Ultimately the money was returned to them pro rata; that is to say, the expenses were taken from the residue.  The proposal now is that we shall pay back these moneys and, in doing so, we shall have to pay <Col N="1306" /> the whole cost of the legal case.  The President swore affidavits that they were not due.  A White Paper was published by this House called Documents A and B in 1930.  If Deputies care to look at the documents they will see that at a meeting of a peculiar body, that sometimes called itself the Second Dáil and sometimes called itself the Cumann na dTachtaí, this matter was discussed.  Turning to page 37 we find that a man who calls himself President said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;About the summer of 1925 it was realised by those who had charge of the case that the possibility of us being able to get the injunction dissolved or to get a decision of the American Courts that the Republic was entitled to the funds, was not likely to happen, and they felt that it would be a good thing to have a second line of defence to fall back upon, so the bondholders formed a committee and they have been striving to get the courts to declare that the money should be returned to the subscribers.  The important point now is the nature of pleas in law are sometimes rather big and sometimes dishonest, but we have got to recollect that pleas in law are things that have grown up in the course of ages.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At a given point&mdash;I think I had better not say it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated that it is a White Paper which was published in 1930, Documents A and B.  In bringing that case in the American Courts these bondholders declared that this State was not responsible for the repayment of the money.  They claimed that the purpose for which the money had been supplied had not been fulfilled, and that the residue should be returned to the subscribers.  These bondholders or members of the committee went to the courts and affirmed that we were not responsible.  The President swore affidavits that we were not responsible. Now the President who swore the affidavits comes here and asks us to return this money.  Personally, I do not think the money should be <Col N="1307" /> returned.  The American Courts have absolved us from responsibility in the matter.  They did that after this State had incurred enormous expense in pursuing the case to which the President was a party on the other side. I pointed that out in a letter which was sent out under the auspices of the President, and signed by a man who was known in this country as Frank P. Walsh, it is stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You are probably one of those who gave your money at that time as a free gift, expecting no other return for it than the satisfaction of participating in a just cause and aiding the people of Ireland in a time of need.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Supposing the Government insists on returning the money, I would say that this is not the proper time to do it.  I have not looked at the quotations in to-day's newspapers, but I think, at the present moment, we would have to repay £1 for every 17/3.  This is no time to do so, even if we were to admit that what the President swore in the affidavits was not false.  There was no time less auspicious for returning the money.  Most people will admit that the country at the present moment is less able to pay than for many years past.  Yet we chose this moment to return money which we do not owe.  We are choosing to do so when the Exchange is against us, when every 17/3 would cost us 20/-. I do not know why this proposal was put before the House.  Even if the Government, without any regard for the President's sworn word, insists on going on with this, the question arises as to whom this money should be returned.  As I read it, the people who subscribed it gave it as a gift and did not expect to have it returned. The people in the Bondholders' Association went into Court asserting that we were not responsible.  Consequently, whatever might be said of other people, surely it will be admitted that we are not called upon to pay these people back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, many of these bonds have been transferred.  I will go into that question later.  People subscribed these moneys as a gift, and <Col N="1308" /> never expected them to be given back. They did not assess them at their real value.  Consequently, to our knowledge a great many of the bonds have been transferred without people getting any adequate payment.  That occurred because they did not attach any value to them; because they did not think they were due to be repaid. I shall quote the document that thousands of people signed, handing away their rights in this matter.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Assignment and Power of Attorney&mdash;In consideration of one dollar, lawful money of the United States of America&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>We know that in these cases even the dollar is not paid.  I know personally of cases where this procedure took place and where the dollar was not paid.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In consideration of one dollar, lawful money of the United States of America, and other valuable consideration, to me in hand paid, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, I, the undersigned, hereby sell, assign, transfer and set over unto Eamon de Valera, his executors, administrators and assigns, all my right, title and interest in and to the Bond Certificate (or Bond Certificates) of the Republic of Ireland Loans, which was (were) heretofore filed by me with the Receivers for the benefit of the Bond Certificate holders of said Loans, and all sums of money, both principal and interest, now due on or hereafter to become due on, or because of the obligations set forth and/or referred to in said Bond Certificate (or Bond Certificates); and I do hereby constitute the said Eamon de Valera my attorney, in my name or otherwise but at his own cost, to take all legal measures which may be proper and necessary for the complete recovery on, and enjoyment of, the assigned Bond Certificate (or Certificates).</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And I do, by these presents, make, constitute and appoint the said Eamon de Valera my true and lawful attorney, in my name, place and stead, to receive from the Receivers for the benefit of the Bond Certificate holders of Republic of <Col N="1309" /> Ireland Loans the payment or payments which is (are), or shall be, due and payable to me on said Bond Certificate (or Certificates) of said Republic of Ireland Loans, which Certificate (or Certificates) was (were) heretofore filed by me with, and which is (are) now standing in my name on the books of the said Receivers and give receipt therefor; and to open any/all mail or envelopes addressed to me care of Mr. Eamon de Valera, 3907 Transportation Building, 225 Broadway, New York City, N.Y., and to endorse my name upon any check, or checks, made payable to me on account of said Bond Certificate (or Certificates) and to deposit such check or checks to his own account and use in such bank or banks as he may see fit; giving my said attorney full power to do everything whatsoever requisite and necessary to be done in the premises as fully as I could do if personally present, with the full power of substitution and revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that my said Attorney, or his substitute, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  What we are called upon to do here at one of the worst moments in our history, when there is poverty and economic stress in the country is to return money to people who themselves have gone into court and said we did not owe them anything.  We are asked to do this by the head of a Government who, himself, swore affidavits saying we were not due to do it.  We are asked to do this at a moment when the exchange is against us, so that we pay £1 for every 17/3 due to be paid.  We are asked to hand the money over not merely, so far as I can make out, to the people who honestly subscribed it, but to other people who, with the very dubious honesty of this document, got money from these people, giving them nothing in return for it.  There was a <Col N="1310" /> suggestion that something should be given in return for it.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This work can be proceeded with now provided that the Directors of the &lsquo;Irish Press,&rsquo; Limited, have the assurance, by the legal assignment of a sufficient number of Bond Certificates to Mr. de Valera, that the balance of the sum they require will become available when the Republican Loans are repaid. The funds the company has already to its account are sufficient to meet all the expenses up to the issue of the first numbers of the paper.  It is the working capital&mdash;the sum estimated as necessary to meet outgoings from the day of the first issue until a steady revenue is reached&mdash;that now requires to be assured.  Whilst these funds are being solicited by way of donations, Mr. de Valera will, of course, not derive personally any monetary benefit from them.  He intends to make the necessary and proper arrangements to ensure that if any profits accrue from the enterprise or if there should be any distribution of assets, such profits and the amount of any such distribution will be made available for the donors, according to their respective donations. For that purpose, a register of those on whose assigned Bond Certificates a payment of ten dollars and over is made, will be carefully kept.  Payments of amounts of less than ten dollars and the fractional parts of one dollar in payments amounting to more than ten dollars, will be credited to the assignors as advance subscriptions for which they will receive an equivalent number of copies of the weekly edition of the proposed newspaper when issued.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I am not aware that the proposed weekly edition has been issued.  It does seem to me a scandalous thing, if I may say so, to propose that we pay back money we do not owe.  It does seem to me an appalling thing&mdash;if we were in a particularly flourishing state, we might feel that a million pounds was nothing and that we were making a nice gesture&mdash;that we should hand out this money without <Col N="1311" /> reference to whether or not it is going to people who have come into possession of the bonds by a legal trick which, I think, would not be permitted in this country, but which is, apparently, permitted by American law.  It seems to me that the Dáil should not sanction this payment.  It was stated here that this handing over of bonds in America amounted to £80,000 worth, that £80,000 being made up of the payment of 58 cents. or 59 cents. to the dollar.  Now we propose to pay 125 cents. to the dollar, which means that for every 58 cents., making up that £80,000, we shall now have to pay 67 cents.  That means that we are going to pay more than £80,000 to this one person, as 67 is greater than 58.  On top of that, we are going to pay as many £'s as there were 17/3's in the amount.  Consequently, it seems to me that if we do this the country will be acting in a perfectly mad way.  We are going to pay money we do not owe.  The President, proposing this, swore we did not owe the money.  We are going to pay it to people who went into court to say we did not owe it.  We are going to do it after the court of the State to which these people belong solemnly decided that we did not owe the money.  Why are we being asked to repay the money at this moment, above all?  Remember, the other parties to this case were not even completely content with the courts.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear if the President means in bringing in this Bill to assert that this Dáil is the ordinary successor to the first Dáil, because repeatedly in this White Document, published by order of this House, Mr. de Valera, who is now President, asserted that the Second Dáil was still in existence, and if the Second Dáil is still in existence they and nobody else should pay this money back.  Deputy MacEntee put it this way:&mdash;&ldquo;We have a right to utilise the funds, distributed in the way we feel best, and it would ensure the case of the bondholders in America; it will be the only way to ensure that the funds will not get into <Col N="1312" /> the hands of the Free State.&rdquo;  If these funds were to be kept out of the hands of the Free State, the least they could do would be to say that they would not pay back the money on the ready basis which was denied by them and by the President. Therefore this Bill should not be persisted in.  If this Bill is persisted in, this is not the time in which to persist in it.  The President should not persist in it at this moment when ordinary justice to the original bondholders would demand that the money should only be paid back to the actual subscribers to the bonds.  Assuming that the President has the ordinary feelings of shame that we associate with ordinary human beings, and surely with extraordinary human beings whose sole motive in life is to create a proper Christian spirit in the world, I think he should be the first to move an amendment to say that no money should go to the repayment of the transferred bonds, but to the original subscribers.</P>

Why are they going to pay back money to people in the United States of America who subscribed that money at a time when this country wanted it? Why are they going to pay back that money to them?</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows full well that that statement was made <Col N="1314" /> and that the previous Executive Council undertook to pay that money. Why did the Executive Council undertake to pay that money?  For the selfsame reason that we have undertaken to pay it, I expect, and that is because there was no other body that had the resources of the country at its disposal and that was in a position to discharge the obligation.  That is why and that is the reason why we propose to do it. The previous Executive Council did commit itself definitely to the American Government to pay that money. In a letter addressed to their representative in Dublin they committed themselves to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fact and the date will be given in due course. Why is all this wonder expressed by the Deputy that we are going to do something which they said they would do in any case?  They either meant what they said when they said that they were prepared to redeem this obligation or they did not.  Did they mean what they said when they said that they were going to do it or did they in any way press that it should be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having pressed other people from those benches opposite that it should be done we did it at the moment we got into power.  We propose then to do it ourselves without any further delay.  The obligation undertaken by us in 1920 and 1921 when we got that money will be discharged.  This money was subscribed as a loan to the Irish Republic and our obligations were to repay that money or to turn it into gold bonds which would make it repayable when a certain thing happened.  Deputies on the opposite side of the House did everything in their power to prevent that thing from ever happening.  They made it impossible for us who gave these pledges in the name of the people, to meet the obligations as they were there.  But there is one thing fundamental in the whole of it and that <Col N="1315" /> is that the money was subscribed by private individuals in the United States to help this people in their struggle and now when this people, through its representatives here, are in a position to redeem that obligation we mean to do so and to see that it is fulfilled.  The members on the opposite benches do not deny that obligation. When they were on these benches at least they did not deny that they were to do it.  They might have said that they were paying it although literally it was not due from them and legally it was not due from them; in contract terms it was not due from them.  And that was the position they took up in the courts in America.  That was the position&mdash;that they were not obliged to pay this money and that they gave no definite promise that they were bound to pay it.  But afterwards when questioned about it here they said they would pay it and they committed themselves to the Government of the United States to pay it.  Again, I ask what is the reason that the Deputy who, as a member of the Executive Council, was a party to that promise and pledge, pretends now to be surprised that we are paying the money?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The American courts decided that we did not owe it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>This promise was given to me long after the American courts decided that we did not owe it. This House decided that we did owe it.  I do not think I was a member of the House when the American courts decided that we did not owe it, but it was when I was on the other side of the House that the promise was given.  Again I ask why is the Deputy so surprised that we are proposing to do something that he, as a member of the Executive Council, assented to when he was on these benches here?  I hope that any Deputies who are listening here will understand that we are doing what the previous Executive Council said they had intended to do.  The only thing is that we are still in doubt whether they meant it or not.  Our attitude is that these moneys were subscribed for the <Col N="1316" /> benefit of the Irish people, to aid them in the struggle&mdash;the life and death struggle as it was at the time&mdash;and that the individuals who subscribed that money are entitled to get their money back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now comes the question as to whether or not it was a gift.  What are the conditions under which the money was given?  Did the subscribers expect anything back?  Was it a gift?  I cannot tell what they expected.  What I do know is what we promised.  We said to them that we could not, of course, guarantee&mdash;nobody can guarantee&mdash;the complete success of a struggle such as we were engaged in. We did not pretend to be able to guarantee it.  Therefore, those who subscribed that money, naturally, did not get the guarantee and did not have the certainty that the person subscribing to a State, which was established and recognised, would have in subscribing to a loan floated by an established and recognised State.  They did not have that certainty.  I could not have guaranteed what they would get, when they asked what they would get back.  This I did guarantee, however, that if the Republic were established and the Irish people achieved the freedom which would enable them to honour debts which were floated in the name of the community as a whole&mdash;if they won out to that extent&mdash;the subscribers to the loan would be repaid, and repaid not merely with regard to the principal but the interest.  I was more conservative on that question of interest than was the Minister for Finance here at home in the internal loan, because I safeguarded the community to this extent, that we would not have a large amount of interest accumulating, perhaps for a considerable period of time, and the interest was to begin to run from a certain date, namely, the date when the British occupation of this country was got rid of.  The people then in America gave their money because they wanted primarily.  I would say, to help a cause.  But we asked it from them and said: &ldquo;We are not a recognised State; we are floating this loan in order to win our freedom and, if it is won, then we will do certain <Col N="1317" /> things.&rdquo;  What are we concerned with?  Is it whether the people wished or expected to get their money back or not?  I say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The expectation of getting their money back varied, probably, from individual to individual.  Nobody can tell.  No doubt, a large number of them would have given it as a free gift if we had asked it on these conditions only; but we did not ask it on these conditions. We went out to get it as a Governmental loan and as a Governmental loan it was floated, and, as a Governmental loan, we are the only people here who have the resources of the community at our disposal to meet these obligations.  It is because we recognise that, that we say in the name of the community, or of a large portion of it, the Twenty-Six Counties, that we propose to fulfil their obligations.  I am glad, for one, that it should have fallen to my lot, as the person, primarily, who asked for that money in America and who knows best under what conditions it was obtained, to say that again in the name of the Irish people we are able to redeem our promise.  It is one of the greatest pleasures of my life to be able to meet all the misrepresentation that was made at that time and to be able, in the name of the community, to pay back that money.</P>
    <P>What are the terms upon which we propose to pay it back?  A certain portion of the money that was not spent was disputed.  I, as trustee, disputed it and, to-day, I have no reason to think that I acted otherwise than rightly in disputing it.  We disputed &mdash;I, as trustee, disputed&mdash;the right of the Free State to get the balance; and the court decided that the balance should be given back, pro rata, to the original subscribers.  In this Bill we propose to take credit for the portion that has been given back.  In other words, the subscribers have got a certain portion of the money owing to them, and we propose to give the difference between the sum they received from the court and the sum representing the principal and five years' interest at the rate of interest that was specified in this bond.  We think that is fair under all the circumstances, and the <Col N="1318" /> representatives of the bondholders were prepared to accept it.  They considered it would be fair and the proposal in this Bill is to give, for every dollar subscribed, the original dollar back plus 25 cents. as interest, which only covers one-half the period in question.  Therefore, I say with regard to two points first, as regards the readiness of this Government to pay it back, I have pointed out that we are only doing what in any case our predecessors said they were prepared to do; and, secondly, in regard to our obligations, I have shown that the money subscribed was given under pledges&mdash; whatever may have been the hopes of the individual subscribers that they would get back much or little&mdash;that it was given and accepted by us under definite promises, and we are attempting to see that these promises are carried out.</P>
    <P>The next suggestion is that it is not a convenient time to pay this money. I do not know what was said before I came into the House.  I am only taking up the points raised since I came into the House.  One of these points is that it is not a convenient time to pay this money.  I do not know, but I think that some people, if they wanted an excuse, could say that it was never a convenient time to pay. I think, as there is an obligation of this sort, which, relatively, is not a huge sum, and which is of tremendous importance to our credit, that it should be paid.  A good many of the people who subscribed at that time would be very glad to have it now, because they are not as affluent&mdash;a number of them&mdash;as they were at that time.  Once we have decided that it is to be paid, however, and once the previous Executive had made it clear that they wanted it to be paid, the question for us was that it should be paid as soon as may be.  We are merely choosing the present time because the Receivers have finished up their work of returning the balance. There is available in the United States at the present time, I know, an office in which are the full records of the people to whom a certain portion of the money has been paid.  With the records that are there available we <Col N="1319" /> can start immediately, with the least possible delay, and the least possible inconvenience, and, I would say, with the least possible cost, paying this money.  On our assuring the court that we are going to pay this money, we can get possession of these records and be able to discharge the balance of our obligations.  We propose to do this once the Receivers are discharged and the records made available for us. As a matter of fact, the Receivers are being discharged now.  The records will be available and we propose to distribute this money with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>The exchange value of the dollar varies from day to day.  A few months ago it would have been more against us than it is to-day.  In all probability, in a few months time, when the moneys are actually being paid, the balance of the exchange will not be as severe against us as it is to-day.  We cannot settle those things.  We are paying off our obligations in the coin in which we received them.  The third point, therefore, as to why we are choosing this particular time, must be obvious to Deputies.  The giving away was completed; the Receivers were being discharged; the document and records which will enable us to pay the balance of the money are available at this moment, and were not available heretofore. The previous Executive, if they had the mind, could have given the balance to the Receivers, and made some arrangement by which the whole sum could have been paid at once. They did not want to do that.  Those gentlemen who suggest now that I have some personal reason for it are simply reading their own hearts and minds, and had a personal reason for not paying before.  They are trying to attribute to us the same mean motive as they had themselves.</P>

      <P>The whole tenor of that speech was a suggestion that I personally was going to profit by these moneys.  If any committee of this House wants proof, I can give them absolute proof that I cannot personally profit one penny piece by the money that is being distributed.  I challenge any committee of the House to examine and see whether I can profit to the extent of one penny piece of this money.  I went over to America at a later period, on the same sort of mission that took me to America on previous occasions, namely, to do my best to organise the support of the American people for the struggle of our people for complete independence.  I never went to America on any other mission. One of the means by which the movement for Irish independence could best be organised and supported, in my opinion, was through an Irish newspaper, a newspaper that would really represent the Irish people, and I went to America to get subscriptions for the capital of that newspaper.  Whilst I was there, and in fact before I was there, suggestions were made that <Col N="1322" /> people who had already contributed to the movement for Irish independence here from 1921, and who helped the Irish people, might assign their interest in those subscriptions for another Irish enterprise; that their subscriptions might go to the capital of an Irish newspaper.  They did what they had a perfect right to do with their own property; a number of them did assign their interest in those bonds for that purpose.  Why not?</P>

      <P>Why could they not? Why did the previous Minister for Finance, sitting in this seat, try to exclude the possibility?  Because he wanted to deprive those people of the right of using their own money as they chose.  They wanted to deprive them of that right because they thought they would choose to use that money for the support of an Irish newspaper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear to me at any rate what the reason is, and I repeat that it is because they see themselves now deprived of the power they had then, the power of dictating to people who had subscribed their money in America, first to the Republic, and then assigned their interest to an Irish enterprise, and telling them &ldquo;If you do that, you are going to lose your money.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course not!  Those gentlemen are very innocent when they are making charges, and are very innocent when those charges are being refuted, and their real purpose is being exposed.  What is the position with regard to those people who have assigned the bonds?  As trustee I invested in their name in the &ldquo;Irish Press.&rdquo;  They were formed into an American corporation.  Each one of them has got a bond from that American corporation.  They have got bonds from that American corporation giving them an interest&mdash; a part share interest; a pro rata interest according to their subscription&mdash;in the total sum that has been invested in the &ldquo;Irish Press.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As regards the &ldquo;Irish Press,&rdquo; every cent of dividend and every cent of division of capital, if such were ever to be made, goes completely to the American corporation, to be distributed to the individuals who have shares in that corporation.  What is the contention of the people on the other side?  Is it their contention that the people who owned this money and had the right to it were not entitled legally to assign it?  If they did assign it to me, so they contributed the millions of dollars which they did contribute in America in 1919 to me.  It was in my name in every account and it has never been suggested by anybody&mdash;it waited for the Deputy to suggest it&mdash;that a single penny of money that I ever had to handle was not fully accounted for.</P>

      <P>The suggestion was that I was personally going to profit. I am told by one of the Ministers here that the actual words used were &ldquo;going into my pocket.&rdquo;  If that is not a definite enough suggestion, I do not know what is.  Is it the contention of the people on the opposite side that an American subscriber is not entitled to do what he pleases with his own money?  If American subscribers cared to give it to me personally, and I cared to receive it, had they not the right to do so if they wanted to?  I would not have accepted it from them and did not at any time accept it. What I did do was: I invested that money in the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; on conditions which meant that every single cent. of dividend on it would go to the American corporation to be distributed, and any beneficiary interest that I have in the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; will similarly go for distribution.  But suppose it were otherwise, and suppose the American subscribers chose to give it for some other set of circumstances, had they not the right to do what they pleased with their own?  Does any Deputy on the opposite side deny them the right to do what they please with their own money?  I do not see that anybody is prepared to do that.  These American subscribers deliberately reinvested that money in an Irish enterprise, in the &ldquo;Irish Press.&rdquo;  If, as a result of that assignment, their interest in the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; is to be increased, why should they not, if they chose, have it so?</P>

      <P>Of course not&mdash;they were all simple fools; they did not know when they were assigning their interest in a bond for a certain purpose that commitments were going to be made on that purpose and that they could not get it back again.  What they are getting instead, and what they have got, is their full share of interest in that Irish enterprise.  But long before the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; was in question I raised this matter.  It had been stated definitely here that this money would be repaid.  Suppose it were otherwise, who here has the right to deny that the subscribers in America to an Irish enterprise should get the full value of their money? Who is going to say they must be denied this money?  I would like to hear.  The end of it, therefore, is that every single one of the suggestions made by the Deputy is a false suggestion.</P>

      <P>We are not interested, as the Deputy would be, in preventing the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; getting that money.  That is the difficulty with the Deputy.  I can quite well imagine him trying to make a case for denying the Americans the right to use their money as they please and trying to make a case in order to prevent the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; from getting what was its own capital and the American subscribers from getting what they are entitled to, their pro-rata interest.  This file does contain the necessary matter which will be given at a later stage.  But what is <Col N="1326" /> the relevance of the dates?  I think the Deputy suggested, &ldquo;Oh, quite a different state of affairs came into being after the American courts had given their award.&rdquo;  So far as I can see there has been no change whatever. Unless I am completely mistaken, it was long after the award in the American court that I, from these benches, heard the then Minister for Finance giving a pledge that he was going to redeem these bonds.</P>
      <P>In bringing in this Bill we are simply doing what I always felt it was our duty to do, and that is that we should pay to the American subscribers, when we are able, out of the resources of the community, the money they gave us when we were very glad to get it and when we were not too concerned as to whether we would be paying back the dollar at a higher exchange value than it was at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to a very long and, in parts, somewhat hysterical speech from the President.  It would be well to analyse a little of the speech which the President has made.  To begin with, the President has not in the slightest way traversed the suggestion that this Bill is a most extraordinary <i>volte face</i> on his part.  He has not challenged the statement, because obviously it cannot be challenged, that at the time this matter was in dispute, in litigation, before the American court, he took up the attitude, and that, furthermore, he placed on affidavit made on oath his then view, that the Irish Free State was not entitled to this money or any part of this money.  On those grounds the matter was litigated in the American courts and the American courts distinctly held that the Irish Free State was not entitled to these moneys.  They did so because President de Valera had litigated and put forward that point of view.  He comes here now and says that though the Irish Free State was not entitled to that money, as they were strangers to the transaction and were not heirs to the borrowers of that money, yet the liability to pay was the liability of the Irish Free State.  That, of course, is a complete abandonment of his earlier position.  His position now <Col N="1327" /> is an admission that the right to receive such moneys was in the Free State because the right to receive and the liability to repay are so correlated they cannot be divorced.</P>
      <P>I am always interested in the various changes of mind and attitude and the various changes of belief through which the President passes from time to time in the particularly varying and changing state of his mind.  It is interesting to watch, from day to day, and to see how gradually he is abandoning and how scrupulously he is slipping steadily and steadily away from the attitude he took up in 1922 and subsequent years.  It is all very interesting to see these changes.  The Bill now before the House is one of the most remarkable examples of the changes he made, and through which he is passing and, I certainly hope, through which he will continue to pass until he gets a better outlook on Ireland and Irish affairs, than he seems to have at the present moment.  But it is strange that the Government now in office should bring in this Bill for a return of this money when they tried so hard and so strongly to prevent the Government then in office from receiving the moneys which were lying in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were certain statements that the President made&mdash;of course he made them in a great state of excitement, and when one makes statements when labouring under great excitement, it is rather unfair to pursue them too narrowly.  He said that members of the former Executive Council stated that if people invested money in the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; they would lose their money and would not be recouped.  I should like to know where, and by whom, any such statements were made. It would be very interesting to know that.  I would like to know the authority upon which that statement of the President is now made.  I, for one, made no such statement.  There were other things that the President said that were very strange.  For instance, he said that the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; represented the Irish people and that the establishment of this newspaper was a national enterprise. Surely not even the President, in the greatest moments of his enthusiasm, <Col N="1328" /> will urge that the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; is a national newspaper.  Surely to goodness, if you were to search the face of the earth you could never find any daily paper so completely a piece of Party propaganda as the &ldquo;Irish Press.&rdquo; No; you could not get it anywhere. The &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; is merely a political pamphlet, three-quarters of which, of course, is taken up with sporting.  Leaving out the sporting news, and the racing news and all that type of news, and leaving out the very small quantity of advertisements it receives, the rest of it is a political pamphlet pure and simple.  To call the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; a paper representing the Irish people is a flight of rhetoric which requires a very considerable amount of courage to embark upon.</P>
    <P>The President asks why have not people a right to invest money in any way they like.  At the same time, rather contradictory to that, he says that people who subscribed this money in America for the loan now want their money back.  I am quite certain they do.  That money was subscribed, for the most part, by persons of meagre means, and now they would like to have their cash.  But will they get it?  Is not a very considerable portion of this money going to be invested in shares in the &ldquo;Irish Press,&rdquo; and is it not a fact that these people will not get the hard cash at all?  No matter how hard up they may be, out of work and starving, walking the streets, they will not get the cash. They must wait for the dividends and to have a number of cents posted to them to America.  I think that is rather a curious position.  I thought that some money was subscribed for the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; in this country, and that the people who subscribed in this country would require to get their dividends. However, we are told to-day that the dividends are to be sent to America.&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, pro rata, the dividend will go to America. These people have not got the cash in their hands.  They are in America and they do not know what will happen here.  They have not the ready money in their pockets.  They have been asked to invest this money in an Irish newspaper about which they know nothing.  A great many of them say to themselves &ldquo;In all probability we will not get any money,&rdquo; and in that frame of mind they agree to pass on the money for the use for which it is asked.  I will not say that that is a dishonest course&mdash;I do not say that at all&mdash;but it savours very much of sharp practice.  If the President waited and held his hand, and I do not know why he did not, if he had waited until those persons got the cash into their pockets, and then circularised them inviting them to subscribe to the &ldquo;Irish Press,&rdquo; that would be all right.  They could then invest their money any way they liked.  But that was not done.  It seems to me, and I venture to say it is certain, from my knowledge of human nature, that the President has got ten, 15, 20 times, and possibly more than that, the amount of money by the method which he adopted, than he would have got if he waited in the ordinary course until those people had received their money back into their own hands.  If they had a bird in the hand they would not have parted with it at all as willingly as they have under the seductive influence of President de Valera when he pointed out to them that if it was not a bird in the hand it was a bird singing in the bush.  I do not know how much of this particular money is going into the coffers of the &ldquo;Irish Press,&rdquo; but it does seem to me that undoubtedly a very large sum is going to the financing of the &ldquo;Irish Press.&rdquo;  I do not think that the speech which the President made was a very satisfactory explanation of going to persons beforehand and getting them to undertake to invest money which they had not already received.  This money, according to the President at an earlier time, was in theory not ours, and, according to the President's then view, this state was not entitled to it. This late argument which he put forward a few moments ago, that we <Col N="1330" /> should discharge it because there is no other body in the country which can discharge it, seems to me still, for a certain time, to stick on to that old view, that the money did not belong to, and that the liability is not attached to the Free State.  But, if the money does not belong to, and if the liability is not attached to the Free State, then most unquestionably the Free State should not pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My interest in this matter is purely from the point of view of what the real liability of this State is.  I do not see that the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; enters very much into it one way or the other.  If we owe this money we ought to pay it; if we do not owe it we ought not to pay it to the people in America, the shareholders of the &ldquo;Irish Press,&rdquo; or anybody else.  I must say, with respect to the President, that I have noticed since I came into this House that the President speaks in two strains.  When he has a good case he speaks calmly and at length; when he is not quite so sure that he has such a good case, he has a lock of hair which is in the habit of shaking down into his eye and he speaks passionately and with, I must say, compelling eloquence. I notice that the lock of hair has come into his eye this afternoon.  The difficulty that I find is this, and it arises from the President's affidavit: if this balance of money that was part of this loan was not the property of Saorstát Eireann, I do not see how anyone can say that the liability to repay any part of the loan is the liability of Saorstát Eireann.  I could well understand the President saying in public now: &ldquo;I am marching towards the Republic, and I pledge my faith that when we declare a Republic in Ireland I shall redeem these bonds, or such part of them as has not been redeemed, to the people who lent the money.&rdquo; I cannot, however, follow the logic which says: &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann is not entitled to this money, and, before it is given to it, it should be handed back to the people who subscribed it,&rdquo; and in the next breath to say: &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann must repay this money.&rdquo;  And why? Because there is nobody else to repay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not concerned with the circumstances under which this <Col N="1331" /> money was raised.  As I had not hand, act or part in the movement which sought this money in America, the only thing that remains for me to decide is whether the State, of which we are all citizens, is liable for the money.  It does not matter who raised it or in what circumstances it was raised.  If they effectively pledged the credit of this State, to which we all now belong, this State should pay the debt.  If they never meant to pledge the credit of this State, if they did not actually pledge it, and if the courts of the United States of America have held that this State is not entitled to the benefits of the loan, I cannot imagine why we should assume liability for the debt.</P>
    <P>The President also stated that he thinks, whether the time is propitious or not, that we ought to repay now.  I cannot agree with him there, because, after all, if it is an obligation at all, it is a moral obligation to repay, and it would be quite legitimate, in the very exceptional circumstances prevailing in the world at present, to postpone this repayment until settled conditions exist in the exchange markets of the world.  There does not seem to be any valid reason why we should elect to make this payment just at the moment when it is exceedingly inconvenient from our point of view.  I do not know whether the President will consider that point later on, but what I have yet to hear with particular interest is, how the Government makes out the case that, though Saorstát Eireann is not entitled to the benefit of the balance of the loan, yet Saorstát Eireann is liable to repay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Dillon, I do not know anything about the initiation of this loan, but when the President was speaking he referred to the definite promise given to the American Government.  I should like to hear explained how the American Government come into this, how the American Government could be responsible for what we have listened to during the last hour.  There seems to me to be nothing but confusion. Are the American Government, responsible for seeing that an American citizen is paid back?  I should <Col N="1332" /> like to have that cleared up.  The President also referred to repayment at present, whether it was propitious or not.  Everybody who was in America after the war knows that there was a tremendous boom there and that money was pouring into every household in enormous quantities. The whole world was paying America.  We have to repay this now under a currency condition which, in the actual comparison of the two dates, seems unfair.  It is quite probable that there will be a stabilisation of currency as a result of the International Conference in London and it might be, therefore, to our advantage to wait.  I am not dealing with this from a Party or biassed spirit.  If the money has to be paid it should be paid.  I should, however, like to hear a little more about the American Government officially recognising a fund that was given for the Irish Republic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all sides of the House will agree that we should pay all sums which we are even morally bound to pay&mdash;for which we have a moral obligation.  I, for one, would support any proposal to pay to meet our moral obligation if it is our moral obligation, outside our valid legal obligation.  Perhaps this is an inopportune time and I might say an inadvisable time for the President to make this proposition to the House. He is asking us to pay money, the payment of which is founded upon an agreement operating in circumstances which have not yet even arisen&mdash;the payment of sums to people, many of whom, the President himself admitted, may never have expected to receive these sums.  Contrast that with our attitude on another agreement which was founded on at least as solid, if not a much more solid, basis than our attitude on this.  We are at present fighting a war to escape payment and I say it is injudicious at the moment to ask people who are bearing the burden and expense of meeting a war because of our failure to meet one agreement to bear the cost of fulfilling this moral obligation&mdash;and it is a moral obligation.  I suggest that, having waited so long, we might have <Col N="1333" /> waited a little further for two reasons. I have already suggested one and the second is that the money market is against us.  The sum we will have to pay now, as even the President admitted, will possibly be greater than it would be a few months hence and perhaps, a good deal greater than it would be a year hence.  There is a third reason why we should not make this payment, that the original subscribers to this relatively small sum, as the President put it&mdash;I doubt if the taxpayers will consider it just now as a relatively small sum&mdash;were perfectly justified in re-investing the money in anything else.  They were, when they got it, but we are asked to help them to reinvest what they have not got.  They have not got it yet and we are asked now to help people, as the President said, to put money into Irish enterprise but to put money into an Irish enterprise which is operating in competition with other Irish enterprises of the same class which must bear the burden of this payment.  That is an argument that we should not lose sight of.  This particular newspaper, which it is admitted is going to gain a good deal if this Vote is passed, is in competition with other newspapers in this country who must contribute largely to the finding of this sum.  For these reasons, I think there is justification in opposing this at this particular time.  We all agree, I think, that any moral agreements that were made in our name should be met at some time but we are, at the moment, engaged in a controversy about the keeping of another agreement and it is not the time to ask the people who are suffering from the financial point of view very drastically to meet this big bill now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House has seldom listened to a speech which did so little credit to the maker than the speech we had to-day from Deputy Fitzgerald.  I do not propose to try to resuscitate the dead.  I think the suggestions which the Deputy made have been dealt with so fully by the President that no person is likely again to have the hardihood to repeat them, but, at the same time, there <Col N="1334" /> should be given clearly to this House an account of the transactions which have led up to the introduction of this Bill.  The President has already dealt with the circumstances under which the money was raised, the purposes for which it was raised and the obligations which were assumed by those who represented the Irish people at the time and most of whom represent the Irish people to-day, but, apart, altogether, from any responsibility which they may have assumed in their representative capacity as members of the Dáil, they have a personal responsibility in this matter&mdash; a personal responsibility which they ought to have discharged before this. The first definite official acknowledgment that the Free State had any moral obligation in this matter is to be found in Section 6 of the Dáil Eireann (Loans and Funds) Act, 1924, in which it is stated:</P>
      <P>It shall be lawful for the Minister to take such steps as he shall think proper to ascertain the names and other particulars of all subscribers to the external loans or either of them and the amounts subscribed by them respectively.</P>
      <P>It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The Minister may at any time issue to every subscriber to the external loans or either of them a stock certificate for a sum equal to the amount so subscribed by him.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Minister may at any time redeem all or any of the stock certificates issued under this section either</P>
      <P>(a)  by paying to the holder thereof a sum equal to the nominal amount of the certificate together with interest on that amount at the rate of five per cent.  per annum from the date on which the amount aforesaid was fully subscribed to the loan to the date of redemption or....</P>
      <P>The next sub-section sets out:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There shall be charged on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof such sum as shall be required to redeem in manner hereinbefore provided all stock certificates issued under this section and <Col N="1335" /> to meet the expenses in connection with the issue or redemption of such stock certificates.</P>
    <P>In case there may be any doubt in the mind of any Deputy as to what the Oireachtas meant when it passed this Act on 18th February, 1924, it is advisable to refer to the definition section wherein the expression &ldquo;external loans&rdquo; is defined as meaning and including:</P>
    <P>The loan floated on and after the 21st day of January, 1920, under the authority of the first Dáil Eireann by public subscription in the United States of America and the loan floated on and after the 15th day of November, 1921, under the authority of the Second Dáil Eireann by public subscription in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the two loans which it is proposed to repay almost ten years afterwards by this Bill.  A reference has been made here to certain legal proceedings in America to which the President was a party.  It may be not entirely without significance to note that these proceedings had been initiated in 1923 and this Act was passed in February of 1924.  In view of the suggestion which has been made by Deputy Fitzgerald and the attitude which was taken up by President de Valera at that time, it may not be entirely without significance that the Dáil, as hurriedly as possible, assumed full and complete responsibility for honouring and discharging these loans.  The proceedings in America were somewhat protracted but, apparently, it was thought that, at one time, at any rate, the case which the then Government of the Irish Free State was making in regard to the loans might, in some way, be sustained or assisted if some definite steps were taken to honour the obligation which was assumed in February, 1924.  I have here on the file this minute&mdash;the document is dated 15th October, 1926:</P>

      <P>Yes.  On the 18th October, 1926, we had this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To the Secretary, Department of Finance: I am directed by the Minister for External Affairs to acknowledge receipt of your minute of the 16th inst.  regarding the repayment of the Republican Loans in the U.S.A. and to state that the necessary instructions have been issued to the Minister Plenipotentiary at Washington.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And on 20th November, 1926, we have the draft of the agreement which was to be concluded between the Irish Free State and its fiscal agent in New York for the immediate repayment of the Dáil Eireann Loan.  The relevant section is this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whereas by Act (No. 3 of 1924) known as the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Act, 1924, hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Loans Act, the Oireachtas of the State has authorised the Minister for Finance to issue to subscribers to each of the external loans referred to in the said Act (being the loan floated on and after January 21, 1920, under authority of the First Dáil Eireann by public subscription in the United States of America and the loan floated on and after November 15, 1921, under authority of the Second Dáil Eireann by public subscription in the United States of America) stock certificates of the State for sums equal to the amounts subscribed by them, respectively, and thereupon to redeem such stock certificates by paying to the respective holders thereof sums equal to the nominal amounts of the certificates together with interest on such amounts at the rate of 5 per cent. <Col N="1338" /> per annum from the respective dates on which the said amounts were fully subscribed to the loans to the date of redemption&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and so on.</P>
    <P>I think it must be clear to any person who has listened to these quotations that there was no doubt in the minds of the then Government as to the moral obligation of those who represented the greater part of the Irish people to honour these loans at the earliest possible opportunity.  It is true that at that period there were legal proceedings in America which possibly impeded the Government in carrying out its original intention.  I am sure that, at any rate, is the excuse which they would have made at that time for the delay, but they never at any time suggested to those who represented any section of the bondholders, to those who represented the American Government in this country, or those who were the opponents of the then Government here, that their acknowledgment of that obligation was in any sense a conditional one.  They accepted the responsibility fully and without equivocation.</P>
    <P>The litigation which was then proceeding in America resulted in the rejection of the point of view advanced by the then Government of the Free State, by the Supreme Court of New York.  In that connection it is interesting to recall that Deputy Fitzgerald, in the course of his speech, advanced this argument.  Personally, he said, I do not think that these moneys should be returned, for the American courts have absolved us of any responsibility in the matter.  The decision of the American courts was given in May, 1927, and the judgment in the matter was filed on the 17th June, 1927.  The American Government asked the Government of the Irish Free State on the 1st May, 1928, to state the attitude of the State towards these obligations.  On the 25th July, 1928, this letter, written to the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America in this country, was communicated by him to his Government and by his Government communicated to the then committees of the bondholders <Col N="1339" /> in America.  The letter, written from the Department of External Affairs, was as follows:</P>
    <P>Excellency: I have the honour to refer to your Excellency's Note, No. 63, of the 1st May, 1928, inquiring as to the attitude of my Government towards the American subscribers to the Dáil Eireann External Loan, 1921.  The Government of the Irish Free State has repeatedly acknowledged its obligation to repay the bondholders of the External Loan, and this view has not been modified as a result of the decision given by the New York Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that Deputy Fitzgerald told us that in his opinion that decision had absolved the Government of the Free State of any obligation in the matter.</P>
    <P>The question at issue is, accordingly, only one of the proper time and machinery to be adopted for the repayment of the loan.  My Government is satisfied that no action can be taken until the receivers in New York have distributed the assets they hold.  As you are aware, after examining the claims lodged with them, the receivers must report to the court giving a list of the claims they allow, and the amount of the assets available to meet them when an order for the distribution will be made.  It would then be known what proportion of the bondholders are seeking repayment and to what extent their claims are being met by the receivers.  As regards the machinery to be adopted, a difficulty arises from the method prescribed in the Dáil Loans and Funds Act for the calculation of interest as the incomplete data in existence will not, in the opinion of the Minister for Finance, allow him to ascertain the individual dates of subscription in many cases.  The Minister for Finance contemplates that a short Bill will be necessary to amend the Dáil Loans and Funds Act to enable the procedure adopted in the case of the internal loan to be followed in redeeming the external loan.  Consideration will also have to be given to the question of altering the procedure <Col N="1340" /> prescribed by the Act in regard to the intermediate issue of stock to be given to bondholders in exchange for their bonds.</P>
    <P>Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurance of my highest consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained that this is in no sense a confidential document.  I have received it as an enclosure with a request from bondholders asking whether it was our intention to honour the undertaking given by our predecessors. I thought it would be necessary for me to read these documents to let Deputy Dillon know how these obligations came to be assumed by us and how it is that our credit and our honour are effectively pledged in this matter. I think I have made that clear beyond dispute, that there is upon us an obligation to repay at the earliest available opportunity, but in any event on the basis of the letter sent on behalf of the then Government by the then Minister for External Affairs&mdash;to repay these obligations as soon as the Receivers received their discharge from the Supreme Court in New York. We have been advised by our legal representatives in the United States that the Receivers may be expected to secure their discharge at any moment. We desire that the Dáil should put us in a position immediately to honour the obligations assumed by our predecessors and subsequently assumed by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the merits of the settlement of this matter which we have secured, the President has pointed out to the House that instead of the bondholders exacting- their pound of flesh, they have had regard to the financial circumstances not merely of this State, but of States in general.  In 1924 whether merely for propaganda purposes or otherwise I do not know, our predecessors fixed the rate of interest on those bonds at five per cent. and we should be liable to repay at that rate for possibly a longer period of time than five years.  There were, however, as Deputy McGilligan, the then Minister for External Affairs, stated, difficulties in arriving at the exact figure which might have been paid.  Accordingly, it was decided that the best way and the most equitable, <Col N="1342" /> from our point of view, at any rate, and a way which those who represented the American bondholders thought would be acceptable to their people&mdash; who were anxious only to help the people of this country, and the Government of this State, in the circumstances in which they found themselves&mdash;would be that whatever liabilities and whatever obligations there were might be rounded off and compounded for if we repaid them for every dollar originally subscribed one dollar and twenty-five cents.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear to any person who considers the terms of the bonds and the terms of the Act of 1924 that this was, from our point of view, a very good settlement.  I do not want to stress it in pounds, shillings and pence, but undoubtedly it does mean a very substantial saving.  If we were not immediately to discharge our commitments in this regard, I am perfectly satisfied those who were prepared to negotiate on behalf of the bondholders would expect the matter to be reopened and settled on the basis of conditions which might not be so favourable to this country as they are at the present moment.  Apart altogether from that, even if this correspondence had not passed between the two Governments, even if there had not been these explicit negotiations for the repayment of the loan in 1926, and even if there had not been inspired announcements in the Press of America in 1926 and 1927 that the Government of the Irish Free State proposed to pay the loan it would still be necessary, in our own interests, to repay this loan at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>We have been accused by another State of repudiating our honourable obligations.  Here is an obligation whose first basis, at any rate, is that of honour.  People lent us money when no other people in the world would be prepared to advance a penny piece, in order that we might sustain the cause of the Irish people.  It was advanced, as Deputy Minch has stated, in days when those who gave it had plenty of money but, owing to the change in world circumstances, their position is not now so good as it was then.  Most of those who gave that money did not make any assignment of rights regarding <Col N="1343" /> repayment; they are people who are in dire need of it to-day.  As we can afford it, and I think we can afford it, even from the humanitarian point of view if from no other point of view, we should immediately take steps to repay this money to those who want it for their own personal use.  You cannot repay part of it without repaying the whole.  But apart from that, it has been alleged against us that we are a people who repudiate our just obligations. This is an obligation which we assumed in circumstances when our prospects of repaying it might not have been very great.  At any rate, when those who prevented us from fulfilling the full letter of the obligation were in power in this country, they assumed the moral obligation that the Irish people accepted in 1919, 1920 and 1921. The legal obligation they assumed definitely in 1924.  They published the fact and confirmed that assumption in many negotiations, and in official negotiations, with another Government.</P>

      <P>The agreements were not secret.  The Deputy is so seldom in the House that he cannot follow a debate.  The Deputy had better not talk about secret agreements or secret negotiations.  I remember that, at a time when the Deputy was a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, he was going around negotiating with other people, negotiating secretly to see how he could break up the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  The less talk we have about secret negotiations from the Deputy the better.  Of course that was before he became a high flier in politics.  These agreements were not secret; these negotiations were not secret.  They were carried out openly, and were made the subject matter of comment in the American Press, and were accepted by the American Government as having been given in good faith, with all the sanction that would attach to the giving of official pronouncements.  Having committed ourselves in that way, committed ourselves beyond recall, are we going to delay fulfilling these obligations, particularly <Col N="1344" /> when we have already been charged with repudiating payments which we say do not bind us, and which were never entered into by the people of this State?  It seems to me, on that ground alone, that it would be desirable that the Dáil should honour its bond in this matter, at the earliest possible moment, that this Bill should get a Second Reading, and be passed speedily into law.</P>

That is not the primary purpose of the Bill.  The primary purpose is to amend the Act, in the manner which Deputy McGilligan implied at the end of his letter it would be necessary to amend it, and instead of compelling the Minister for Finance to pay interest at the rate of five per cent. per annum from the date on which the amount was fully subscribed to the loans to the date of redemption, to enable him to repay at the rate of one dollar 25 cents for every dollar subscribed.  That makes the repayment terms much more favourable to the State.</P>

      <P>The powers proposed to be taken in this Bill are such as will enable a Department to deal with musk rats, which have been found in the Nenagh district.  A preliminary investigation has been made, and it shows that musk rats are well established in the district. A systematic campaign will have to be devised to secure their extermination. This may take some time.  As Deputies are aware this menace has arisen in England where considerable difficulty has been found in getting rid of the rats.  Special efforts in that direction are being made there, particularly in the Severn district, where an expert from the Continent has been secured. Even so, it is found very difficult to get rid of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We propose to send an officer of the Department over to see what measures they are taking there.  As soon as we have his expert advice, we expect to be able to get after the pest here. There is provision in the Bill for licences for the keeping of musk rats. That, however, will be applied only in very few cases&mdash;probably such places as the Zoological Gardens and centres of research such as might be attached to universities.  It would probably be advisable to have these rats in such places as the Zoological Gardens so that people would know what they are like.  It might be necessary to do some research in some of our laboratories to see if we could find an effective way of getting rid of these rats otherwise than by trapping.  Provision is also being made for the licensing of those who may wish to purchase the pelts. That is necessary to keep a check on the destruction and also to prevent <Col N="1346" /> what might become a profitable business if a certain reward were offered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is necessary to prevent what might become a profitable business&mdash;the breeding of the rats for the sake of getting the reward.  Provision is also made for compensation for the destruction of musk rats which were under control on the 21st February, 1933.  Prior to that time, permits were given for the importation of musk rats under the ordinary Diseases of Animals Regulations. There may be people who imported these rats in good faith.  We feel that they should be compensated if we ask them now to destroy those rats.  I do not think that there are many of them in the country.  In the Department of Agriculture, we only know of seven such rats in the country.  Power is also taken to enter upon lands for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Bill.  At present, we have no power to send the police or authorised officers or anybody else in on lands unless the owners give their permission. We are taking power to enter lands, where necessary, for the purpose of destroying those rats.  Under the last clause of the Bill, if there is a menace of this kind in the future caused by some animal that we do not contemplate at present, it will be possible for us to apply, by order, the provisions of this Bill to such a menace without coming to the Dáil.  It will not be necessary to bring in another Bill of this kind to deal with such a menace. We have not any such menace in mind at present but we want to have the necessary powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be seen that there is a substantial reduction in the amount of the Vote for the present year.  The Estimates alone will not, however, show the full financial position of the Post Office Department. <Col N="1348" /> In order to ascertain the actual position in that respect, the Department prepares accounts on a commercial basis and these are available in November of each year.  The latest commercial accounts are for the year 1931-32, and they show that the postal section of the services turned a profit of £116,735; the telephone section a profit of £39,289; while there was a loss on the telegraphs of £89,077.  There was, therefore, a net profit in the services for that year of £66,947&mdash;the first year in which the Departmental accounts showed a profit.</P>
      <P>Commercial accounts for the last financial year 1932-33 will not be available for some months but, so far as can be judged from the figures to hand, we believe that the final accounts will again show the Department to be self-supporting, although the great snowstorm in February last dislocated much of our revenue-earning plant and put us to considerable extra cost in repairing the extensive damage done.</P>
      <P>It is satisfactory that two of our branches are now on a paying basis. While the telegraphs are being continued at a loss, that loss is more than covered by the profit from the other services.  So that the Department does not, as formerly, seek help from the Exchequer to make good a deficit on the working of the services.  Telegraph traffic is still declining&mdash;it is in practically every country in the world&mdash;but the service remains an essential one and must be maintained efficiently.  It was always non-paying, and the least unprofitable part of its business was the short-distance traffic, most of which has been attracted to the telephones.  The loss on the telegraph branch of the services has been considerably reduced, and the figure of loss given in the latest commercial accounts is the lowest on record.  So much for the financial side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has mapped out a fairly extensive building programme for the year.  Dublin has been carrying on with only a temporary sorting office for a number of years.  A new building to be used as a central letter and parcel office will be erected on the Pearse Street site.  Works in connection with this large scheme will be <Col N="1349" /> commenced as early as possible, probably in the course of the next few months.  A telephone exchange and district postmen's office is to be erected in Rathmines.  Excavations of the site are being carried out and it is expected that the building will be completed in about a year's time.  Other building schemes are in hand for improving post office accommodation at several other centres.</P>
    <P>It has been decided to issue postage stamps of special design to commemorate the Holy Year.  The stamps which will be of two denominations, 2d. and 3d., will be available in August.</P>
    <P>With a view of accelerating road mail services the use of motor transport is being gradually extended.  At the present time 74 per cent. of our road services are performed by motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>Last year as an experiment we fitted, with the consent of the companies concerned, letter boxes to tramears on the Howth route in Dublin, and on buses plying between Dublin and the provinces.  The posting in the tramcar boxes was negligible and in the buses the results up to the present are very disappointing.</P>
    <P>The telephonic express letter service which formerly was available only on weekdays has been extended to provide for delivery of messages on Sundays and bank holidays from all head offices during the period for which the offices are opened for telegraph delivery.</P>
    <P>The telephone service continues to expand.  There has been an increase in the number of automatic exchange lines in Dublin and in the number of exchanges and call offices in the provinces.</P>
    <P>An arrangement whereby Dublin automatic subscribers can be dialled direct by operators in provincial exchanges has been largely extended and has resulted in a more rapid service.  Telephone kiosks are being used more extensively and it is proposed to provide further accommodation and to erect an additional 30 in Dublin and the provinces in the course of the year.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to one other matter.  Requests are occasionally made for a reduced rate of postage. <Col N="1350" /> As the Post Office has turned the financial corner it may be contended that something in that direction is now possible.  I wish to make it clear that the surplus in the Post Office is comparatively small, while the loss entailed to revenue by the reduction of the letter rate of postage from 2d. to 1½d. would be about £240,000 per annum. Any increased postings as a result of a lower rate would not in the view of the Department offset the loss to any appreciable extent.  The Post Office cannot afford to face such a loss of revenue and it would not be justified at the present time and in present circumstances in considering such a proposal.  Our rates of postage are just able to cover our costs taken as a whole and they do not compare unfavourably with the rates obtaining in several other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to ask one word with regard to the telephone services.  For some reason or other, the people in this country have not yet become telephone-minded. The number of telephones in use is astoundingly small compared with what one might expect.  If you look at the little telephone book it comprises all the telephones in the Free State and it is really amazing that we have gone so short a way in popularising the telephone.  I want to suggest to the Minister that a good deal might be accomplished or at least attempted in the way of advertising and publicity to popularise the telephone and get it more widely used. Of course, the value of the telephone to people already subscribing to it is enormously increased if other people are induced to subscribe to it&mdash;if more and more people are induced to subscribe to it.  At present, except for business people in the City of Dublin talking to each other, one of the great drawbacks about it are the high rates one has to pay for telephoning in the country.  There are so few people who have got telephones that the telephone is less valuable to those who have it.  Telephoning at present is extraordinarily expensive in country parts.  Not only are the calls expensive but the rates for telephoning to places quite a short distance away are very <Col N="1351" /> high.  Both for the sake of making the telephone service less expensive and one hundred times more useful than it is I think we should do what is being done in every other country. We should initiate a publicity campaign to popularise it.  I am quite confident if such a campaign were carried out extensively it would give very satisfactory financial results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy MacDermot that a good deal more could be done by the Post Office administration to popularise the post office services.  Such a campaign has been undertaken in Great Britain with good results not only from the point of view of extending the services but from the point of view of additional employment.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs might well consider the possibility of advertising the Post Office telephone services and many other services which the Post Office possesses but which are not used extensively because of the fact that the public are not sufficiently aware that these facilities exist.  These facilities are not used as the best means of harnessing the service to the convenience of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make another suggestion to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  While advertising the telephone service would undoubtedly help to extend the use of the telephones, I suggest to the Minister if he wants to be really up-to-date and advanced in the matter of extending the telephone services he might take an example from the Dublin Gas Company. The Dublin Gas Company put in gas meters in various houses at a very low cost.  As a matter of fact I understand that even to-day they instal gas meters and gas ranges free of charge in houses.  If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would try to work new ground in that respect, I think he would find that quite a considerable number of people would instal telephones and put their penny in the boxes when they want to use them in the same way as people, where gas meters are installed, put their pennies into the slot when they want to use gas.  This would be especially <Col N="1352" /> useful in the case of large buildings used by a number of families.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs would break new ground and get away from the traditions which characterise the outside of the administration in this respect if there were an installation of telephones in certain kinds of apartment houses.  I think such an advance and such a breaking of new ground would yield increased revenue to the Department and would help to popularise the telephone.  It would make people cultivate the mentality in which the question would be not whether they could afford the telephone but rather whether they could afford to do without the telephone.</P>
    <P>On turning to page 271 of the Estimates there is one item that I find some difficulty in following.  Perhaps the Minister would give the House some information on the matter.  I see that the number of Class I skilled workmen has been reduced from 60 in 1932-3 to 44 in the present year.  I do not understand the reduction.  I find considerable difficulty in understanding it in view of the fact that a considerable number of people who are in &ldquo;Class II skilled workmen&rdquo; are acting in Class I at the moment.  That is a reduction that I cannot possibly follow.  Similarly in the case of skilled workmen, Class II, I find that the number has been reduced from 290 in 1932-3 to 256 this year.  I should like to know from the Minister why the staff has shrunken in the course of the year.  Is that in consequence of any special economies being carried out?  But a more significant feature of this whole Estimate seems to me to reside in the fact that the Post Office employ a very large number of people and pay them very little.  The Post Office Department is the biggest single Department in the State for employing a whole variety of groups apparently self-contained, one separate from the other.  There seems to be very little case for the separation of the staff into groups except the excuse to pay one group less than the other.  I have gone through this Estimate.  I have obtained information in various ways and I have come to the conclusion that from the point of view of cunning and fiendish cunning <Col N="1353" /> this Department can squeeze more work out of persons for less money than any other single Department in the State.  I have here some information that I have compiled from official sources.  I find that there are in the Post Office to-day over 4,000 officers, part-time and full-time, at less than 30/- a week.  I find that there are close on 7,000 officers in the Post Office with less than £3 per week, and I find that out of a total manipulative personnel of 8,411 officers employed in the biggest Department of the State only 358 of them receive more than £4 per week. When this House considers that position I think it will have no hesitation in saying that, so far as the Post Office staff is concerned, there is very little generosity in the matter of wages.  Over 8,400 officers in part-time and full-time employment and of these only 358 are in receipt of more than £4 per week.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister, during his short term of office, has had time to examine matters of that kind, but I think it is not a healthy position from a wage point of view and that it is evidence, from the figures I have quoted, of gross underpayment and that it is a reflection on the administration of the Post Office because, as a public department, it has no right to employ persons at sweated rates of wages or to find consolation in the fact that the service is paying without any subsidy from the general Exchequer. If it is able to carry on without any subsidy from the general Exchequer, it is because of the fact that the Post Office administration are employing persons at sweated rates of wages and I suggest that they ought not to stand over these rates of wages with any sense of pride in this House.  Some time ago I asked for enlightenment in order to ascertain the information as to the problem of part-time labour in the Post Office.  I found from an official reply that there are 3,059 persons employed in the Post Office at wages which do not exceed 25/- per week.  I say that an enlightened Administration cannot console itself, nor can the Minister be very happy, on the fact that he is in charge of a Department <Col N="1354" /> which employs over 3,000 at less than 25/- per week.  These are the persons who are carrying on the Post Office service.  Those people are delivering letters and parcels and registered letters.  Many of these items contain articles of negotiable securities.  Many of these people are responsible for collecting customs charges on parcels and handling correspondence which contains cash many times in excess of their weekly wages.  Whilst carrying on important services for the whole community and carrying important correspondence for the public, they are wondering at the same time how they are going to pay the grocer's bill on the following Saturday, how they are to pay the milkman, and where the money is going to come from for rent.</P>
    <P>I hope I will not be told that this is a problem confined to rural areas.  It is not.  The Post Office in Dublin employs 50 persons and pays them, approximately, 15/- a week for part-time labour and all efforts to try to absorb them into full-time employment have proved unsuccessful so far, not that I believe it is an insuperable problem but because the Post Office approaches this whole question of underpayment and part-time labour with the mentality that has been going on for years and, consequently, this objectionable thing is right.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Post Office was now asking for no subsidy from the State.  Around about 1922, the Post Office Department was losing over £1,000,000 per annum.  To-day, the Minister tells us, the Post Office requires no subsidy from the State. I wonder if the Minister has probed that matter to find out in what way economies totalling over £1,000,000 have been effected.  If he has probed it, well and good.  I suppose we will hear from him in respect of the particular headings under which these economies have been effected.  I want to tell him very candidly that the economies in respect of this sum of £1,000,000 have been effected in a large measure by disemploying 500 persons in 1923.  If the Minister would look up the first Post Office Estimates presented to this House and look up the Post Office Estimates to-day, he <Col N="1355" /> will find that the extent to which wages have shrunk in the interval represents a very considerable portion of the saving which has been effected in the Post Office.  I would say, having had an intimate experience on the matter, that the Post Office staff have paid more than anybody else or more than any other service in helping the Minister to balance his Post Office budget.</P>
    <P>I want to pass on to this question of part-time labour in the Post Office.  I find, on page 279, that there are 2,478 auxiliary postmen in the Post Office. That means 2,478 persons employed on an average, I suppose, for twenty-three hours per week or less.  I find that there are 956 officers described as allowance deliverers.  That means 956 officers employed for not more than 18 hours per week.  As a matter of fact, I came across a case some time ago where an officer was employed by the Post Office and his weekly wages were 2/9 per week.  It is much less now with the reduction in the cost-of-living bonus.  On the Post Office side we will hear it said that they could not possibly manage to organise their service except on the basis of employing this person for twenty minutes per day.  This whole question of part-time labour in the Post Office is synonymous with low wages and exploitation in the Post Office.  They receive miserably low wages for performing responsible duties on behalf of the community.  I will tell the Minister now that if he and his Department are genuinely desirous of tackling the problem of part-time labour they can end it in ten years, at the outside, by the absorption of the part-time officers into full-time employment.</P>
    <P>That claim has been made here repeatedly to the Post Office Department on behalf of the officers affected. The Minister and his Department trot out costs and money as an answer to the claim that has been submitted. It has been suggested times out of number that the occurrence of vacancies in full-time posts ought to be utilised by amalgamating the part-time posts with the existing posts and thus create a method by which the survivor <Col N="1356" /> could be employed.  If that were adopted it would result in the complete elimination of the part-time employment in a comparatively short period. Each year it would mean that a certain number of part-time officers would be rescued from the mire of poverty and misery which they are compelled to endure on low wages to-day.  The only answer we can get is that it costs too much.  I give the Minister credit for progressive views personally on social and economic matters.  Does the Minister consider costs an answer to the human and the moral claims of these people who are looking for a decent wage for the responsible duties they perform for the public?  Post Office administration acts, in relation to these people, as if they were simply robots and had no human feelings, as if they were not supposed to get married and have children and, if they did get married and have children, to explain to them that they could not be fed properly because they were part-time officers in the Post Office. I should like to ask the Minister to say definitely where he stands in regard to that matter.  It is a human problem.  Those people are entitled to expect that a Government Department will make some effort to rescue them from the deplorable position in which they find themselves to-day.  No Minister for Posts and Telegraphs can divest himself of moral responsibility for the plight of those people merely by saying that it costs too much money to rescue them from that appalling position.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister referred to the fact that it is hoped to start the reconstruction work on the Pearse Street premises.  If it is, the staff in Pearse Street, who have been compelled for the past eleven years to work in a disused distillery, will be very glad to hear that information. This promise and this carrot have been held out before the staff for many years.  We have been told repeatedly that it is hoped to reconstruct the Pearse Street premises.  This is probably the sixth or seventh year in which that hope was expressed.  I should like if the Minister would tell <Col N="1357" /> us very definitely that there is no doubt whatever about the reconstruction of the Pearse Street premises this year. The staff are &ldquo;fed up&rdquo; listening to promises about the reconstruction of the premises.  If the Minister has had an opportunity of visiting it I think he will have no hesitation in saying that it is the kind of premises which is no ornament to the Post Office service of the country, and is certainly a disgraceful building from the point of view of being the main sorting and delivering office in the capital of the country, in what is the main artery in distributing mail traffic in the country.</P>
    <P>I was hoping that the Minister in the course of his speech might have expressed some views on the question of endeavouring to maintain for the Post Office the monopoly which it has enjoyed, and which I think it is legally entitled to enjoy, in respect of the delivery of letters, and to some extent in respect of the delivery of parcels. There has been a considerable decline in parcel traffic during the past few years, and the decline has coincided with the development of road transport in the country.  At the present time buses are conveying small parcels which were formerly dealt with by the Post Office.  Those small parcels are being conveyed by the bus companies from town to town along the main streams of traffic.  There have been left for the Post Office the parcels which have to be carried over the mountain sides, which have to be carried down the glens, which have to be carried at uneconomic prices into the hamlets all over the country.  As a matter of fact, it has been brought to my notice that one big firm in town hands over its small parcels to a bus company to deliver because they deliver them at a lesser rate than the Post Office charge.  The bus company selects the parcels for the main streams of traffic, and hands over to the Post Office such parcels as it is necessary to deliver in some backward districts in Connemara, or Kerry, or Donegal.  The result is that the Post Office is getting that portion of the parcel traffic which is hopelessly uneconomic.  I should like to know from the Minister whether he proposes <Col N="1358" /> to do anything in that respect.  The Post Office, acting as the agency of distribution for the whole community, is entitled to protect its services against that particular method of attack.  I hope the Minister is alive to the serious hardship which is being imposed on the Post Office by reason of the cream of the traffic being taken from it by bus companies, while the uneconomic portion of the traffic is being left with the Post Office to deliver at a rate which is not commensurate with the charge made.</P>
    <P>Similarly, you have had here in recent years the development of a service known as Messenger Services Limited.  I should like the Minister to examine especially what his monopoly rights are in respect of Messenger Services Limited.  I know perfectly well that this organisation which has been established in the City of Dublin is taking circular matter for delivery, is evading monopoly by its method of addressing those envelopes, but it is doing work to-day which was formerly done by the Post Office, and it is in my opinion a clear invasion of the monopoly which the Post Office have always had in the past.  It is perhaps that they are evading the Post Office monopoly on technical grounds, but they ought not to be allowed to invade the clear monopoly which the State arrogated to itself on behalf of the whole community when the State claimed the monopoly of the delivery and collection of letters of that kind. That institution is eating into the traffic of the Post Office.  In respect of local services it may yet cause just as much damage to the letter-delivering service of the Post Office as the buses are causing to the parcel traffic.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to call the attention of the Minister, and that is the question of the restoration of daily deliveries.  At the present time in many portions of the country there are services of only three days per week.  The result is that in those areas persons can have their letters delivered on only three days per week, while people in cities, towns and large sized villages can have their letters delivered to them every day. That restriction of services was one of <Col N="1359" /> the ways in which the Minister secured his economy of a million pounds.  I want to put it to the Minister that the principle of a three-day delivery in one area and a six-day delivery in another area is a vicious principle so far as the activities of State services are concerned. After all, the citizens in an isolated rural area are entitled to expect the same facilities as persons in towns get.  They are taxed in the same way.  When a Budget is introduced here imposing taxation there is no stipulation that it will not apply in isolated rural areas where people get their letters on only three days a week.  They are taxed no matter where they live, and if it is right and proper to tax the whole community for the purpose of State services it is only right and proper that the community should get in every area the same services as they at present get in certain selected areas.</P>
    <P>That scheme of restricting services was introduced many years ago, when in a state of panic and in a clamour for cheap public popularity a certain Minister for Posts and Telegraphs adopted that form of economy.  A halt ought to be called to that policy. I put it to the present Minister that he ought to end that short-sighted economy which was then introduced, and restore the daily deliveries in all those areas.  Not only is it inconvenient from the point of view of the public affected, but it means that persons employed in delivering letters in those areas are not even getting six days part-time work, but are getting only three days part-time work in many instances.  From both points of view there is a strong case for abolishing this hopelessly short-sighted economy, which was first introduced in 1923.</P>
    <P>Looking at page 276 I find that it is stated in a footnote that 34 posts for grade A postmen are being blocked by redundant Post Office assistants. That means that in the Post Office establishment at Dublin there are 34 redundant Post Office officials.  In case Deputy MacDermot should feel tempted to say: &ldquo;Oh, I told you so; here is portion of the hordes I have <Col N="1360" /> been thoughtlessly referring to in some of my other speeches,&rdquo; I want to assure him that the fact that they are redundant does not mean they are doing no work.  What it simply means is, that the Post Office Department introduced a reorganisation scheme in 1924. Work was re-graded under the scheme, but in such a clumsy and inefficient manner that it left a large number of officers in the service for whom there was no work of the class to which they were formerly assigned, with the result that they had to be down-graded and required to perform the work of a lower grade.  It is true their old rate of pay was continued, but the work they were asked to perform was very much less congenial than the work they formerly carried out.  They are now required to perform duties which are worse than the duties formerly performed by reason of the character of the work, the hours of attendance and the irksome nature of the duties in general.</P>
    <P>This matter has gone on since 1924. While I know I will be told the problem was greater then than now, there are no thanks due to the Post Office for having reduced the extent of the redundancy.  The redundancy was reduced in a number of ways, firstly, because some people died, secondly, because people got old and were retired and, thirdly, because a certain number retired under Article X.  The positive action of the Post Office in the matter of reducing the redundancy was negligible. How long does the Minister expect 34 persons to remain in that position?  What are the proposals for remedying the matter?  I suggest a redundancy which has continued for nine years is something that ought to be tackled in a more effective way than merely waiting for people to die, or be pensioned off when they are 65 years of age.  If ever there was a Micawber-like policy adopted on the part of any Department, surely this here is a glaring example. I do not mind having a small bet with the Minister that when he is nine years older, if he is still Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, he will see a number of those redundant <Col N="1361" /> officials occupying the same positions, unless, in the meantime, the Department can be induced to wake up and solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I know this matter is not solely in the hands of the Post Office Department, but at least they might be a little more energetic.  The Minister ought to take the whole problem into immediate consideration and he might, as a result of representations to the Minister for Finance, have special steps taken to absorb these officers into the clerical officer grade. Examinations are held a few times every year for clerical officers in other Civil Service departments. Here are 34 officers in a grade and the work they are doing is not the work they originally contracted to do.  The sensible course would be to put them into the clerical officer grade.  Instead of that, the Minister for Finance prefers to recruit young boys from school.  The commonsense arrangement is to transfer people redundant in one position into other grades where vacancies are available.  I hope the Minister will assure us that this matter is going to be attended to with more energy than in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that it is hoped to develop the Post Office motor service.  Presumably the Department regard that as a good investment.  I would like to call attention to the way in which the people engaged in the Post Office motor service are treated.  I am sure the Minister, if he were left alone, would express astonishment at what I am going to tell him.  What I am going to say is the absolute truth. In many country areas where Post Office motor services are in existence an officer leaves the office at six o'clock in the morning to do a motor run of 60 or 70 miles.  He arrives at his destination about nine or ten o'clock and then waits until two o'clock in a hut.  Sometimes even a hut is not provided and he is fixed up in some kind of accommodation.  He returns at four o'clock and he gets back to the office at about six o'clock in the evening. That man is out from six o'clock in the morning until six o'clock in the evening, travelling perhaps 140 or 160 <Col N="1362" /> miles, and he is not paid a farthing in respect of his period of absence from his head office.  He gets a driving allowance and an allowance for minor repairs to the car, but he is given no allowance for subsistence.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had a motor driver travelling in that fashion, and being absent for such a long period, I think he would consider it mean, on his own part, if he were to say to that driver: &ldquo;I do not think you need anything in respect of the meals you may have during the day.&rdquo;  This Post Office official's colleagues in the town or city can have their meals at home, but he is not in a position to do that.  He should at least be paid some subsistence allowance so that he might have a decent meal instead of being compelled, by reason of low wages, to endeavour to exist on a flask of tea and a few slices of bread and butter.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer is the Minister's responsibility in respect of the employment of clerks in sub-offices.  Recently I asked him for some information in connection with the number of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses in the country.  He told me there were 2,041 such officers in existence.  Of that number I find 1,308 have less than £60 per annum, approximately 25/- a week.  In a considerable number of these cases the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses employ assistants.  If the sub-postmaster is getting 25/- a week for the dignity of being a sub-postmaster, and he has to provide premises, light, stationery, etc., I wonder what salary does that man pay his assistant?  The Post Office Department knows perfectly well that many of these sub-offices are dens of sweat.  Young girls are employed at frightfully low rates of wages.  In some cases fees are demanded for receiving training in order that the assistants may ultimately be qualified to receive sweated rates in some other office where the sub-postmaster is likewise badly paid.</P>
    <P>Under the fair wages clause the Minister is bound to see, in respect of services carried on by, or on behalf of his Department, that a reasonably decent wage is paid.  It must be remembered that out of 2,000 sub-postmasters <Col N="1363" /> and sub-postmistresses only 198 have over £3 a week.  I am sure the Minister will find it difficult to convince himself that in respect of the employees of these sub-postmasters a decent rate of wages may not be in all cases the fault of the sub-postmaster. No matter whose fault it is, the Minister is morally responsible for ensuring that the fair wages clause is complied with and that those persons are employed at a decent rate of wages, a rate which, according to the fair wages resolution, compares favourably with those rates paid by good employers in comparable employment in the district concerned.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Post Office Department do not exercise proper supervision in that particular matter. I put it to the Minister that the Post Office cannot ride away on the plea that they have no responsibility.  They cannot shelter themselves by putting forward the defence that these people are not employees of the Post Office, but are employees of the sub-postmasters and postmistresses concerned. If the Minister will look into the other matters he will find that there is something that calls for investigation.  I hope, when replying, that he will say definitely that even if it is necessary to increase the wages of those people in order to enable them to pay decent wages to their assistants that alternative will be resorted to in order to enable the Post Office to get off its conscience the heavy load that must rest upon it owing to the low rates paid to these persons.  That is all I have to say at the moment.  Such matters as I have raised are of tremendous importance to the staff and the public in what is one of the biggest Departments of State.  I hope the Minister in reply will give some indication that he will go the whole way to meet the points raised in the course of my remarks.</P>

      <P>Last year I referred to the question of telephones. Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Norton also referred to the matter.  I was in hopes that, with a view to popularising the telephone service, the Post Office would take some initiative itself.  Under the existing system, in districts where the telephone main is not laid, a person desirous of having a telephone must bear the entire cost not only of having the telephone installed in his house, but for conveying the main to his house.  If that policy is pursued there is not the slightest hope of the telephone service being popularised and bringing it within the reach of the people.  It follows, I think, that people who instal telephones and pay the rent on them should have the advantage and should be able to connect up with the maximum number of people with whom they wish to communicate. The policy of hindering the acquiring of telephones by people in the way I have indicated is preventing the extension of the telephone system, and preventing people getting the full advantages they otherwise would get.</P>
      <P>With regard to other matters that Deputy Norton has spoken of&mdash;wages and part-time men and the terms given to drivers of motor services&mdash;there is a good deal of truth in what he stated. There seems to be no hope absolutely for the telegraph system.  It is dying, if it is not dead, and, also, there is no hope apparently in getting a reduction in the cost of stamps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point in regard to the purchase of houses where already a telephone has been installed and where the contract has not yet run out.  In other words, there are cases where an individual buys a house, finds there is a telephone installed there, and that six months of the rental have yet to run.  The new tenant is not allowed to use that telephone unless he pays what has already been paid, namely, the six months period for which the old tenant had the use of the telephone and had paid for.  He has to pay that six months <Col N="1365" /> before he gets a new telephone, or before he gets a licence to run the existing telephone.  I know several cases where that has occurred and I should like if the Minister would deal with that particular point.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear some expression from the Minister as to whether it is a general part of his policy in the future to bring up men from areas like Cork and elsewhere to the City of Dublin and its neighbourhood to carry out work there under the Engineering Department of the Post Office.  Quite recently a number of men who got temporary employment periodically were deprived of that employment by reason of the fact that a number of men from Cork, and other districts in the south of Ireland, have been brought up to Dublin and its neighbourhood to do that work.  The result is that a certain number of men, depending for their general existence on periodic work in the Engineering Department of the Post Office, have been deprived of that work.  I should like the Minister to say if this is part of his general policy and if it is to be continued.  I submit it is very unfair to the employment situation in Dublin that that should be so.  I am sure the Minister must appreciate the position that exists in the city and I am sure he will be able to find some means of preventing an occurrence like that which interferes with employment in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what his policy is with regard to employees in the Post Office who have been engaged temporarily for some years past.  I should like to hear whether it was by reason of the political changes that the services of some of these men were dispensed with and some others taken on in their stead, or what was the reason of the change.  There is the case of a man employed in a temporary capacity delivering letters round about my district that I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  His remuneration was less than £1 a week. During the General Election last year, and the year before, he was employed <Col N="1366" /> and paid by a local political organisation, and he was informed that that would not be allowed.  I quite understand it was not allowed, but then that man was not in a position to live on the 15/- or 18/- a week that he got from the Post Office.  He was subsequently dismissed.  I do not complain that employees of the State should not engage in political work, but I say that when the employee of the State gets only 15/- or 18/- a week his position is quite different from that of an ordinary employee who gets a living wage taking on political work.  The remuneration he gets from the State is quite insufficient to enable him to earn his livelihood, and he ought not to suffer the loss of that if he takes on another occupation for a couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>In the case of this man the wages paid to him, for some considerable time before, were reduced.  The Deputy particularly interested in this case is engaged elsewhere to-night, and the facts were represented to me, and it does look like as if this particular man was the victim of a rather severe judgment. I am assuming the Minister was informed that the man was employed by a political organisation; that is quite within our knowledge.  But other persons were employed by Ministers in political organisations and it was not considered that they were cases in which action should be taken.  In one case a person was on the platform in his uniform when, I think, the Minister for Finance and, possibly, the President were addressing a meeting in Rathmines.  In these cases there ought to be the same treatment for all classes.  Either put the thing in force and deal with them impartially or overlook them.  I certainly would be inclined to overlook them where a man was not getting anything like a living wage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot raised the question of extending the use of the telephone.  He believes that if we undertook a publicity campaign the use of the telephone would be extended.  There may be something in that.  I should like, however, to draw his attention to the fact that in this <Col N="1367" /> country, unlike England and other countries, there are very few big centres of population and we cannot hope to have the telephone used to the same extent all over the country as in other countries.  The Department is at present considering starting an advertising campaign and we have canvassers going around at present. I am not quite sure how long the Department has had these canvassers at work, but there is at present a special staff canvassing for orders.  As I say, it is intended to undertake a publicity campaign for some time to see what the result will be.  I do not think, however, that for some time, until the population increases and the country gets more prosperous and we have bigger centres of population that the telephone will be so extensively used as it is in other countries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton raised a great number of points.  I should like to say at the beginning that I would much prefer to be in charge of a benevolent institution than of a commercial concern. Unfortunately for me, I suppose, the Post Office is a commercial institution and has to be run as such within limits.  It would be much nicer for me to be able to give full pay to everybody.  I would very much like to do it, but unfortunately I cannot. The reduction in the skilled workers, as the Deputy knows, took place when the special work in the engineering department was finished.  When the £1,000,000 capital was expended the people employed then had, unfortunately, to be got rid of.  That accounts for the big drop in the number of workers employed in the engineering section.  These cases cannot be helped.  If circumstances warrant it, I hope they will be taken on again.  Until they do, there is not very much chance of our absorbing the people taken on when the extra money was voted for capital development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the pay of workers, I have already dealt with that.  I am unable to act in the benevolent way I should like to act and that Deputy Norton would like to act.  The Post Office has to be run on a commercial basis.  I have no power to do it, and I do not <Col N="1368" /> think I would be able to get the money. If I came to get the money necessary to run it in that way I am afraid there would be much more trouble than there is at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some of them are badly paid.  The Deputy mentioned a rate of pay of 25/- per week for 3,000.  We are not able to remedy that.  As to the whole question of basic pay, there is a Commission sitting to inquire into the question of civil servants' remuneration and they may bring in a favourable report from Deputy Norton's point of view.  I hope they will report soon, but we cannot anticipate what the report will be.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right in saying that a lot of the saving was due to the reduction of wages.  Coming to the question of part-time postmen and amalgamation of posts, the Department does not consider that that can be done in all cases.  There may be some cases where it can be done.  Even if the pay that these postmen get is very small, in times like these it is something anyhow, and it would be a great hardship if some of these part-time postmen were removed.  There is another consideration, that the same service would not be given.  People would not get their letters as early as they get them at present.  Everyone knows that if one man had to do what three men are doing now the time of delivery would be very much interfered with and people would not catch certain posts.  Some people would get their post late in the evening, and others very early in the morning. There would be great inconvenience to the public and, after all, they have to be considered as well as the people who deliver the letters.  I think that is all I can say on the question of wages.  A Commission is at present sitting on that question and whatever the report will be I hope the Government will act upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we can now definitely say that the reconstruction of the Pearse Street premises will be undertaken in September.  I quite admit that it is not <Col N="1369" /> a very nice place to have people working and that it is not suitable.  We will, however, get the work taken in hands as quickly as possible and we should definitely make a start about September.  As to the question of a monopoly, the Post Office has no monopoly of parcel carrying.  I do not agree with Deputy Norton that the buses have affected the delivery of parcels so much as he seems to think, that they have taken the whole cream of the business.  That is not the position. It is a fact that they have affected the carrying of parcels to a certain extent, but not to the great extent the Deputy seems to think.  I do not think that we should look for monopoly rights in carrying parcels, at the present time anyhow.  As to the messenger service, that development is being carefully watched.  So far the monopoly rights of the Post Office have not been interfered with but, if they are, action will be taken in the matter. At the present time we are satisfied that the monopoly rights that the Post Office has in carrying letters have not been infringed.</P>
    <P>Then we have the vexed question of daily deliveries.  It is estimated that if we returned to daily deliveries in country districts it would cost £57,000 extra per year.  We are not so flush in cash that we can undertake that at present.  The previous Government undertook a retrenchment scheme when they were in office.  I do not know whether the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at the time did it.  I do not think it was at his instance.  I am sure somebody else had a say in the matter.  The people who supplied the money probably insisted that these economies should be made.  I know that there is a demand from all parts of the country for a daily delivery. Most of these deliveries in the country districts are at present being maintained at a loss.  In practically every case that has come under my notice where a demand for better facilities was made, it has been shown that at present there is a loss and, as I say, if we were to revert to the old position, where there was a daily delivery, it would cost £57,000 per year extra. We do not consider that at present we can undertake that extra cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> As to the redundant Post Office assistants, they are, at any rate, getting the same pay as they got before. It is not considered advisable to put these people into the higher grades. At least, however, they are getting the pay they got while in the assistant class.  Anything we can do to get rid of these redundant assistants and to put them into a proper position we will do, but it is not easy to do it.  We are doing the best we can.  As their pay has not been interfered with, I do not think their grievance is quite as bad as Deputy Norton suggests.</P>
    <P>As to the payment of assistants in sub-offices, if the attention of the Department is drawn to under-payment, where under-payment takes the form of payment at lesser rates than in similar employment in the district, the Post Office Department makes representations to the sub-postmasters. It has to be borne in mind that these sub-postmasters are not whole-time officials.  They are part-time officials; in fact they can scarcely be considered officials at all.  These assistants do general work as well as Post Office work and it is only where the attention of the Department is drawn to unfair conditions of employment that action is taken.  There have really been very few complaints but, if any come in, they will be attended to.  I am quite sure that I have not satisfied Deputy Norton, but I think I have dealt with most of the points he raised.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McMenamin's query as to people installing new telephones, it is the practice to make the people pay. When an individual is getting a special service at a distance, it is not considered right that the State should stand the expense.  If a person wants to be facilitated he must pay the cost, but if a number of people in a district want telephones installed, the cost can be apportioned between them. If one man lives three or four miles from a telephone exchange, I do not think it would be fair to ask the State to put up poles and wires for his convenience alone.  I do not think, therefore, that there is a very big grievance there at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> With regard to Deputy Minch's point, the position is that, if a new tenant is desirous of taking over a telephone already installed and is prepared to continue the terms of the existing contract, arrangements can be come to whereby there need be no break in the service.  Otherwise, the Department must safeguard itself.</P>

If I buy a motor car on which six months' tax has been paid I get the advantage of that tax having been paid.

      <P>I cannot go into details, but I understand that there are arrangements which can be entered into with the Post Office if an incoming tenant is prepared to continue the old contract.  I can give the Deputy any further information he wants on the subject.  Deputy Mulcahy raised the question as to whether it was the policy of the Department to bring workmen from the city to outside places.  It is not and it was only done in cases where specially skilled people were required to do skilled work and people who were on the permanent staff of the Department.  When they are required in a district they are sent there, but the general practice is to employ the local people.  I quite appreciate that there would be great discontent and great hardship if people were brought in in numbers, but it is only in the case of skilled workmen that this is done.</P>
      <P>I should like Deputy Cosgrave to give me particulars of the case he mentioned.  I agree with him that, if people who belong to one organisation are to be dealt with in a particular manner, those who belong to another organisation should be dealt with similarly.  I have not particulars of that case he mentioned.  If the Deputy says a man was dismissed for that reason, I shall have to accept it, but I will look into the matter.</P>

Would the Minister give sympathetic consideration to the cases of those men if and when employment offers in the Post Office engineering branch?  A number of cases have been brought to my notice where men have been dismissed and have got no chance at all of employment in that service after having given anything from 20 to 30 years' service in that branch of the Post Office.  The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware of many of those cases. So far as his statement relates to the employment of local persons, surely <Col N="1374" /> men who have given long service in the engineering department should get preference when employment offers in that branch.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give sympathetic consideration to the cases I have mentioned, some of which I have brought under his own personal notice.</P>

      <P>The point made by Deputy Anthony, to some extent, and the figures given of the large number of temporary employees in the Post Office as well as the large number of what would be called unestablished employees of the Post Office induce me to raise this point with the Parliamentary Secretary to see if he has anything to say about it so far as it applies to his Department.  This afternoon the Minister for Finance told us that from the Office of Public Works representations had been made to employers carrying out Government work in the City of Dublin under which it was planned that numbers of men who had been in continuous employment for a fairly long time&mdash;it was stated that in some cases the period ran into 15 years&mdash;were being dispensed with in order to make way for persons out of employment for a long time.  I would like to know from the Minister whether a plan on similar lines is going to operate in the Post Office so far as Government work is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to correct what I think is a misapprehension on the part of the Minister.  I suggested that a means of dealing with the part-time labour problem would be to utilise the occurrence of a vacancy so that that vacant duty might be amalgamated with a particular existing duty, the two part-time posts to be merged into a full-time post, with the surviving officer filling the post.  My scheme did not involve in any way the dismissal of any part-time employees, but that merely the occurrence of a vacancy should be utilised to build up duties and make a full-time post with a shrinkage of part-time labour classed only as such. If the problem were tackled in that way then the end of it might be seen in about ten years' time, with a <Col N="1375" /> progressive diminution in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the point made by Deputy Mulcahy I do not know anything about what he has suggested: that there was a plan of the kind mentioned.  I have no knowledge of what is happening in the Board of Works, but so far as the Post Office is concerned there is no intention of doing such a thing as he mentioned. As to the point made by Deputy Norton, where part-time posts can be amalgamated that is being done.  We must have some regard to the convenience of people in country districts. If the amalgamation of some of these posts means that people who get their letters in the morning and send replies out the same evening cannot do so, then it will not be done because we have got to think of their convenience, but where it can be done it is being done.  That is as far as we can go. Deputy Anthony raised a point about redundant people in the engineering department.  Undoubtedly, people are being retired at 60 years of age now. The reason for that is, as I said before, that there are large numbers redundant, due to the fact that the £1,000,000 advanced for capital development for telephone reconstruction has been spent, and it was thought that there might be less hardship in retiring people at the age of 60 than younger people with families. I am sure that cases of exceptional hardship will arise under that, but in the main it was thought that people who had reached the age of 60 would have grown up families: in other words, that they would not have so many dependents whereas if younger people in the service had to be dispensed with far greater hardship might be occasioned.  On the whole, it was thought that people of 60 years of age would suffer less hardship than the others.  It is regretted that these people cannot be kept on, but if circumstances permit their claims will be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to another phase of activity in the engineering <Col N="1376" /> branch of the Post Office.  The Minister must be aware that when the telephone system was taken over from the National Telephone Company, a number of persons then in the employment of the telephone company and taken into the employment of the State were not taken over as established civil servants by the Post Office authorities.  The result is that a great many of these men are the victims of very peculiar circumstances.  They are unestablished, with the result that after 30 or 40 years' service they will not get any pension.  The most they can look forward to is a very small gratuity.  If they had been taken over a little earlier by the Post Office authorities they would have been entitled to a pension so that I think great hardship arises in these cases, and I would ask the Minister to give them sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>As regards the Minister's remarks on the question of spreading the use of the telephone, I was sorry to see that he took what seemed to me to be a rather defeatist attitude on that point in saying that we could expect nothing else in a country such as ours where we had not big centres of population.  I want again to represent to him that a great deal more than is being done could be done to point out to the people in the country districts, and in the country towns particularly, the advantages of the telephone.  I suggest that there should be a campaign of advertising in the local newspapers in addition to whatever is being done by canvassers&mdash;a campaign of advertising in local newspapers which have a good circulation pointing out to the people the very great advantages that do result from the possession of the telephone.  I think, too, that some little risk should be taken in the matter of reducing charges and making the service less expensive than it is at present.  A little risk might also be taken in making the service more complete than it is at present.  In many parts of the country you cannot telephone at all on a Sunday, or during the night on week-days.  That certainly abridges <Col N="1377" /> the utility of the telephone service enormously.  One great thing that makes many people desire to have the telephone is the feeling that use can be made of it in an emergency at any time during the day or night on week-days or Sundays.  I think that altogether there has been a lack of imagination in the matter of spreading the use of the telephone in this country.  I think that is a matter that ought to be attended to by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had already replied to the point raised by Deputy MacDermot.  I am not going to admit that I am a defeatist.  I am a realist, but the facts are as I have stated.  I hope that in a few years' time, when we get things going, we will have not only big centres of population but prosperous centres as well.  I have already promised that the Department will undertake a publicity campaign.  I do not know if, as a result of that, the people for whom Deputy MacDermot and the Centre Party tell us they speak&mdash; they are the only people who seem to have any wealth&mdash;will be induced to avail of any extension that takes place.  I do not know whether the farmers will avail of it or not.  At present we cannot afford to take very many risks, but we will probably take some.  We will have to be very careful as regards any risks that we do take. We will have to see to it that in any risks we do take we are not putting too big a burden on the State.  The people taken over from the National Telephone Company, to whom Deputy Anthony referred, do not unfortunately come within the scope of the Superannuation Acts.  The Government have no power to give them pensions. That may be very hard on these people but that is really the position; that they do not come within the scope of the Superannuation Acts.</P>

      <P>The amount of the Estimate for the Broadcasting Service for the year 1933-34 is £43,530 as compared with £60,310 for 1932-33, that is a decrease of £16,780 due to the cost of the high power station having been almost cleared last year.  The original estimate of cost of erection of the high power station including buildings was £70,000 and the actual cost will probably be slightly less.  The revenue from wireless receiving licences last year amounted to approximately £17,296; from customs tax on wireless apparatus to about £64,682 (including about £12,000 for customs duty on plant for high power station).  The revenue from advertisements and miscellaneous receipts amounted to about £220, making gross revenue of £82,918.  The revenue for the current year is estimated at £20,000 from licences, £50,000 from customs duty and £18,000 from advertising programmes, making an estimated total of £88,000.  The number of wireless receiving licences issued last year was 33,083 representing an increase of 4,438 over the previous year.  The probable increase of licences as a result of the opening of the high power station in February last cannot yet be estimated with any degree of accuracy but in any case the growth of licences up to probable saturation point is likely to continue for several years.  The expenditure on the broadcasting service out of all Votes last year amounted to about £87,945, including £46,100 for the high power <Col N="1379" /> station.  This leaves an estimated deficit on the year's working of about £5,747 due entirely to the expenditure on the high power station.  The expenditure on the broadcasting service out of all Votes in the current year is estimated at £55,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outstanding events of the programmes last year were the broadcast of the Eucharistic Congress which included a world-wide transmission of the closing ceremony in the Phoenix Park and the broadcasting of an address by His Holiness the Pope. Other events of particular importance included President de Valera's address at the official opening of the High Power Station on 7th February last and also the President's address at the opening of the League of Nations Assembly.  The evening programme hours have been extended to run from 6.0 p.m. to 11.0 p.m. on week-days, one hour, 9.45 p.m. 10.45 p.m., being reserved for advertising programmes. One hour's afternoon programme on Sundays has also been introduced and proposals are under consideration to extend this to two hours and also to extend the mid-day programme on week-days to an hour.  The orchestra of the Dublin Station was recently increased from 6 to 19 players, which has considerably strengthened the programme generally.  The all-round standard of programmes has been well maintained.  Six concerts were given by the Symphony Orchestra of the Dublin Station and five concerts of the Dublin Philharmonic Society were broadcast.  The station opera company performed a number of operas and there were also relays of concerts from Waterford, Galway, Sligo and other provincial centres.  The &ldquo;Talks&rdquo; programmes have been considerably developed and included during the year series of talks on Irish history, Irish music, art, natural history, domestic economy and a special series of talks for farmers arranged by the Department of Agriculture.  Special attention is being given to the Irish part of the programme with a view to the extension of the use of the Irish language in the programmes generally. In addition to the Irish lessons talks <Col N="1380" /> in Irish on general subjects are given regularly and Irish traditional music is given a prominent place on the programme.</P>

In the morning paper we very often read that Mr. So-and-So has arrived in this country.  That night, in the late broadcast, when we are supposed to get the latest news, we have a repetition of the very same thing.  Surely it is not necessary to give us an item such as that.  We need not, of course, listen to the programme if we do not wish, but I think there is room for considerable improvement.  Without wishing to be too critical, and at the risk of being told that I am trying to play England's game if I suggest that Daventry is a better station to listen to, I think I can truthfully say that there is great room for improvement in the fare provided for Irish listeners in the Dublin programme.</P>

I remember, for example, listening to a most interesting debate that had been specially arranged between Mr. Maxton and Sir Ernest Benn.  It seems to me that the interest of the programmes for Irish listeners would be greatly increased if such discussions were introduced here&mdash;supposing one evening there was a debate over the wireless between Deputy Corry and Deputy Belton, and another evening between Deputy Norton and Deputy Hugo Flinn.  I feel that the number of wireless sets that would be installed in this country would be greatly increased if there was a prospect of <Col N="1381" /> such entertainment as that.

      <P>On the question of news services, it has to be remembered that we have not got the same news services as newspapers.  It would be a very costly business to get an up-to-date news service.  The amount paid for the news by the broadcasting department is very small indeed, and to get the most up-to-date news would not be practicable at all.  Undoubtedly, most of the news that is broadcasted in the evening is contained in the evening papers, but everybody in the country does not get an evening paper.  I should like Deputy Minch to remember that.</P>

      <P>There are some people in the country who do not even get the morning paper every day and they might possibly have a wireless set.  I quite confess that there is not what one might call an up-to-date news service attached to the broadcasting station, but we would require a very considerable addition to the staff to provide that, an addition which is not considered to be warranted.  That is the only explanation I have to offer in regard to that item.  In regard to the general programme, each person has his own taste in regard to the programme that he would like broadcast. I am not a judge in these matters myself.  What would please me might turn poor Deputy Minch sick.  I have heard all sorts of <Col N="1382" /> complaints.  I have heard some people on the other side say that the Dublin Station is very good.  Others say it is very bad.  The only way to test public feeling would be to take a census of the listeners.  I do think myself there is room for improvement, but, as I say, I am not an authority on music.  We have an Advisory Board on which there are a number of experts to advise us as to what they consider to be the best programmes.  It may possibly be that we could improve the personnel of that Advisory Board, but the whole question boils down in the end to one's individual taste, whether a person prefers one type of entertainment to another.  I think we shall have to leave it at that.  If Deputy Minch definitely prefers Rome or Paris he will have to tune in and cut out Dublin.  We cannot get a common level.</P>

Deputy Anthony pertinently stated that while we hear a lot about Irish music we hear very few competent exponents of it.  I ask the Minister to consult the Director of the Broadcasting Station to see if further time could not be given to good traditional singing. One or two hardy annuals turn up regularly.  I may be taken as praising that or otherwise, but whatever the method the hardy annuals are always there.  There are numbers of beautiful traditional singers in the country who ought to be given an opportunity of broadcasting Irish music.  The Minister might with advantage consult the Director of the Broadcasting Station in regard to that matter.  As far as I am concerned, the best programmes now are the sponsored <Col N="1384" /> programmes, where you really get something worth listening to.  It is a great pity that the programmes for which the Station is responsible are so manifestly inferior to the sponsored programmes.  I suggest to the Minister that if the Director cannot improve the programmes himself he should consult the persons responsible for the sponsored programmes, and let them run the whole programmes.  I do not know if economy is the reason why the programmes are of such a low standard. That may be the cause.  If Philco and Beecham's Pills can afford to spend money, the Station ought to be able to do a little more than it has been doing. I direct the Minister's attention to the question of traditional singing.</P>

      <P>I will certainly see that that matter is looked into.  I agree that there is room for improvement there. I was interested in hearing Deputy Dillon say that the sponsored programmes were more interesting than the others.  Most of the people I heard speaking on that matter said the reverse.  It shows&mdash;Ní lia duine ná baramhail.</P>
