    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night when this debate was adjourned I was dealing with the brave efforts which were being made by the Minister for Justice completely to neutralise the effect of the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; which the Minister for Finance was imposing upon the Guards.  I pointed out that as far as these efforts of the Minister were confined to raising the salaries of <Col N="2160" /> various officers and thereby neutralising the cut to them, I was entirely in favour of the attitude he was taking up.  But so far as the expenditure which he had decided to embark upon consists of the wanton and unreasonable changing of officers from post to post at the public expense, although he may succeed in neutralising the cuts that the Minister for Finance was introducing, still he is doing so at very great inconvenience to the members of the Gárdaí, and, at the same time at considerable loss of efficiency to the Force.  On that question of cuts, I should like to hear something from the Minister as to how he, a member of the Executive Council, can now justify the action of the Executive in deliberately swindling, not merely the members of the Guards, but other services out of the moneys they have earned.</P>
      <P>The Guards are entitled to be paid at a certain rate, and civil servants and others who serve under the Minister for Justice have a right to be paid at a certain rate.  Take, for example, the case of the Guards. There are certain regulations which must be complied with before a single penny could be taken off the pay of the Guards, but we find without any cause or justification, or without any excuse in law, and in the very teeth of the doctrines of simple morality, pay is now being deducted from the Guards and from other officials&mdash;money which is theirs; money which they have earned, and money which even to this day they are earning and to which in law they are entitled and to which, in morality, they have got an unanswerable case, money is being deducted day by day, week by week, from their pay and from their salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point of order.  The Deputy has described the policy of the Executive Council as a swindle.  That is a political, not a personal, charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I say&mdash;and I say it very deliberately&mdash;that the taking away of money from persons who have earned that money is a swindle.  I should like to know how the Minister for Justice is going to justify in this House this entirely illegal stoppage of pay from the Guards.  It is done in the teeth of the existing law and the excuse which the Minister gave the other day, for this illegal&mdash;and I again characterise it as immoral&mdash;conduct, was that an Act of Indemnity will be passed; but an Act of Indemnity simply takes away the remedy which persons, who have been wronged, have.  No Act of Indemnity, nor any Act passed by this House, can turn black into white or turn injustice into justice.  No Act passed by this House can justify the defrauding of labourers of the wages they have earned.  That is the attitude which I should like to have explained, and that is the course of conduct for which I should like an excuse to be put before this House by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much on this question of &ldquo;cuts.&rdquo; Apart from that, I should like, looking at this Gárda estimate, to point out some very curious things in it.  I find, for example, that in the year 1931-32 the number of Guards was 5,443.  I find that in this year's estimate&mdash;1933&mdash; the number of Guards is 5,643.  In other words, the House is estimating this year for 200 more Guards than we estimated for in the year 1931-32.  Now, I am very glad that, in some respects, since the Minister for Justice has got into office, he has improved and that he has learned a little and got a little bit more in touch with the realities of government in this country.  I remember, when the now Minister for Justice sat on these benches, how he used to talk about the very excessive number of the Guards we have in this country and how he used to say that the country could be policed by 2,000 less Guards than there were at the time and that it still could be policed effectively.  We heard all that nonsense poured out by the present Minister for Justice and poured out by various other members of his Party in this Dáil.  We heard it year after year and we heard it <i>ad nausea.</i>  But now I <Col N="2162" /> notice that, after learning the circumstances and after seeing how the country can be policed this year, the Minister for Justice is estimating for the same number of sergeants and for 200 more Guards than there were in the country two years ago.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another question. The Minister for Finance stated in the House the other day that there had been no recruiting for the last fifteen months.  I wonder if that is so.  I wonder if the Minister has been correctly informed.  I would be very anxious to hear from the Minister for Justice as to whether recruiting has been going on or, if it has not been going on, when he intends to recruit the very large number he will require to keep up the number of Guards to the number which he has estimated for here.  There is always wastage in the Guards.  There must be always a certain falling off in numbers in each year.  Men die; men resign for some reason or other; men are dismissed; and we know that, during the last fifteen months, at any rate, some Guards were dismissed, because we have not forgotten the scandalous finding of the Kilrush Tribunal and the unjust way in which three men were dismissed from the Gárda force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate that on this year's estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to debate it this year and only mentioned it to show that there were, at any rate, three dismissals from the Guards during the current year.  Then again, as I say, we know that there were deaths, and I am perfectly certain that there must have been some resignations.  The normal wastage in the Guards in a normal year used to be at the rate of something like 200 a year.  In consequence, unless recruiting has been going on, as the Minister for Finance says it has not been going on, or unless it is the intention to bring in a very large draft of recruits immediately&mdash;because this is an estimate for the whole year and we are now in the month of June &mdash;unless it is the intention to bring in a very large number of recruits, then, this is obviously a completely misleading <Col N="2163" /> estimate which is being put before the House by the Minister. Exactly the same number of Guards is estimated for that was estimated for last year and 200 more than the year before last.  There must have been wastage and, if there is to be the same number in the Guards, then it is perfectly obvious that the Minister either has been recruiting or intends to recruit and that the policy of his predecessor in title, that the Guards were to be reduced in numbers, has been completely and entirely abandoned.</P>
      <P>But when a policy is mentioned by a member of the Executive Council in this House and that policy is abandoned, as obviously and plainly it has been abandoned unless this estimate is a document deliberately put forward to deceive&mdash;which, of course, I do not suggest for one moment&mdash;but when it has been abandoned, then, we ought to have been told and the country ought to have been told in a matter of such vital importance to the country&mdash;and everything connected with the administration of the Gárda Síochána is a matter of vital importance to the country&mdash;then, as I say, the country certainly should have been told of this change of policy on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside for a moment the question of recruiting, I would like to turn to another sphere in which the Minister for Justice has very recently shown activity.  I would like to have from him some explanation of the extraordinary performance we had in appointing a Committee of Reference for the Sweepstakes after a Bill had been brought into the House to abolish the Committee of Reference.  The law was that a Committee of Reference had to be appointed forthwith whenever a scheme was sanctioned.  The Minister's predecessor and the Minister himself did not sanction a committee forthwith; they did not discharge their statutory duty.  They sanctioned schemes and they did not carry out their statutory duty of appointing a Committee of Reference.  Since the Bill was introduced to sweep away the Committee of Reference the Minister for Justice proceeded to appoint three <Col N="2164" /> gentlemen to a Committee of Reference. The Minister is the person who is entirely reponsible.  The Minister for Finance in consultation with the Minister proceeded to appoint three gentlemen to do absolutely no work and they are to get a nice present for their services, one of them £1,000 and the other two £800 each.  Why did that take place?  It was not to carry out a statutory obligation.  The Minister suddenly discovers that the Minister for Local Government is introducing a Bill to do away with the Committee of Reference and he then proceeds to appoint three gentlemen who are to draw good pay and do no work because, long before they could get to work, the Bill abolishing their office will become law.  He gives these men a free gift of these big sums of money and, in my opinion, that is a matter on which the House and the country are anxious to have an explanation.</P>
    <P>I now turn to what is really the most serious matter which can be discussed upon this Vote, and that is the way in which the Minister for Justice is discharging the duty imposed upon him of seeing that the law is obeyed in this State, that it is openly flouted by nobody, that it is obeyed by all. That is a duty which the Minister for Justice is shirking at the present moment.  We know that there are illegal associations in this country, the I.R.A. principally, whose activities call for attention.  The I.R.A. is an association which has for its aim the overthrow, not by constitutional agitation, but by force of arms, of the Constitution of the existing State here. That body has been put by the Minister above the law.  The law says they shall not drill, they shall not be armed; but they drill, they arm, and they recruit as much as ever they like and there is no check or hindrance. We had a very significant thing some time ago.  A firing party of these gentlemen fired over the grave at a funeral in Tipperary.  I put some queries to the Minister here and I was told that the Guards were not there. I pressed the matter.  I had to put down the same question three or four times until I finally wrung an answer from the Minister to the effect that <Col N="2165" /> the Guards could not ascertain who did the firing.  That is a very strange state of affairs.  Either the Guards have suddenly lost their efficiency&mdash; which I hesitate to believe&mdash;or else directly, or indirectly, whether by open order or by covert hint, it must have been conveyed to the Guards that they are to make no effort to bring I.R.A. men who break the law in that fashion to justice.</P>
    <P>That body is recruiting all over the country.  We see examples again and again of how much the heads of the Catholic Church are alarmed by the spread of this body.  Repeatedly you see the bishops, who are the responsible heads here of the Catholic Church, denouncing the I.R.A. and urging young men not to become members of the association.  They have been explaining to them how that association is condemned by the Church, and yet you find all over the country recruiting for that organisation, which is not only condemned by the Church, but was rendered illegal by the law of this land.  You find all over the State recruiting posters put up, saying: &ldquo;Join the I.R.A.&rdquo; tarred up. a sort of answer to the bishops to have on a convent wall in County Mayo the These gentlemen are entitled to do precisely what they like, to drill as much as they like, and the Minister for Justice will not face them.  It may be that the fault does not lie completely and entirely in the Minister.  It may be that the Minister might be able, if left to himself, to screw his courage to the sticking point and face them.  It may be, on the other hand, that the Fianna Fáil Party is so impregnated with I.R.A. doctrines&mdash;that there are so many members of the Party either members of the I.R.A. or else closely in association with the I.R.A.&mdash;that the Minister for Justice cannot trust in the support of his own Party if he discharges the duty which is upon him and sees that that body observes the law.  For all I know, that body may have got a footing in the Executive Council itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have difficulties, but I say that whatever difficulties he has, he has also got a duty to the <Col N="2166" /> people of this country and a duty to the State.  He holds a high office, and, holding a high office, he has a very heavy responsibility placed upon his shoulders.  No matter what the difficulties may be, whether they come from inside his own Party or from inside the Executive Council itself, or whomever else they may come from, no difficulty will justify the Minister for Justice in allowing the law to be openly flouted as it is when an illegal and highly dangerous organisation recruits just as much as ever it wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Vote, sir, I wish to say a few words.  I have never, since my entry into this House, shirked my duty to the people whom I represent, and because I feel that this is one of the most important Votes debated in the Dáil, I feel that it is up to me to declare the faith that is in me in relation to this Vote.  We are supposed to have, we are alleged to have, or we have, a Minister for Justice in this State.  The very title suggests that we have some person, some institution, in this State which stands between the plain, ordinary, common people of this country&mdash;Seán Citizen or John Citizen whichever you wish to call him&mdash;and the bully, the gunman, the robber or the thief.  In the Ministry of Justice we have that institution.  Let us examine for one or two moments how that Ministry is performing its duty even within the last twelve months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must first of all assume that the duty of a government is to govern. The late administration over which Deputy Cosgrave presided made itself most unpopular because of the fact that it did govern&mdash;at least it must be admitted that they attempted to govern.  The ex-Minister for Justice carried out the mandate of his Government and attempted to govern.  In many ways he succeeded.  He succeeded in any case along a certain positive line of policy and he prevented, or was the means of preventing through the agency of those under him, a certain type of crime that I feel and every good citizen in this country feels would have been committed in this country were it not for the determination <Col N="2167" /> of that Government of which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was then a Minister.  That Government made an attempt, at any rate, to put an end to the class of crime that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney now mentions.</P>
    <P>Let us start off with this that it is the duty of a government to govern. I am to assume that the present Minister for Justice subscribes to that policy.  I am also to assume that the Minister for Justice subscribes to that policy that in the Irish Free State, we must have only one army and one police force.  I repeat only one army, and only one police force.  I feel that the Minister must of necessity subcribe to that.  But how has he carried it out?  If he subscribes to that policy he must be aware&mdash;if he has received the usual police reports and we must assume that he has received them&mdash; that there is an amount of illegal drilling and organising of young people into bodies which have been condemned not alone by the ordinary plain John Citizen but have been condemned by the Church authorities.</P>
    <P>I do not care to be introducing the names of bishops or clergymen of any denomination into the business at all. I deprecate the introduction into this question of the names of famous men and women who have suffered in the cause of Irish freedom.  I do not like at any time to invoke the names of those people.  But the Minister must recollect that amongst the first persons to suffer in the country at any time of revolution were the ordinary, plain people of the country.  It is for the plain people of the country I speak at the moment.  The Minister must be aware that these things to which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney alluded, and to which I allude now, are going on in the country.  We must take it also, the Minister is aware of these facts and circumstances, and is either acquiescing in this practice, or that in the alternative, he is condoning this practice. He cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister when he is replying to give us some information as to the reports he has in his office. We would also like to know the value he attaches to those reports.  Does he, <Col N="2168" /> on the other hand, receive police reports and does he, on the other hand, receive reports from the local Fianna Fáil organisation?  To which report does he attach the most importance? These are the things which are agitating the minds of the ordinary, plain people.  The Minister must be aware of this fact&mdash;that there is an amount of uneasiness in the country at the moment, because the Minister, in my view, and in the view of the ordinary, plain citizen, is not acting as he should and shouldering his full responsibilities as Minister of the Dáil.  I look upon the office of the Minister for Justice as one of the most important, if not most important, office in the Administration.</P>
    <P>As an ordinary, plain citizen it matters not to me whether the Minister has invoked the aid of this House to pass the most drastic kind of legislation. That does not matter to me or to the honest, plain citizen of the country.  But it does matter to the footpad, it does matter to the garrotter and it does matter to the man who goes out with a gun to shoot somebody else. I want to have from the Minister some explanation.  I should like to know from him: has he got from those persons who were openly drilling and arming with Lewis guns, machine guns, rifles and revolvers, what their purpose is?  I should like to ask if he has got from them the names of those whom they are going to fight?  These are the things I should like the Minister to answer.  The people I represent are honest, plain citizens&mdash;the people of the City of Cork.  We do not want another army in this country, we are satisfied with one army, which is controlled by the Ministers on the Government Benches.  We are satisfied with that army because we are law-abiding and honest citizens.  We are quite satisfied with it.  One army satisfies us.</P>
    <P>You have a Minister for Defence.  I am in Opposition and I recognise him as Minister for Defence.  Though in Opposition to this Government, I am independent, I repeat that I am independent, for whenever I find that the Government are passing legislation in accordance with my convictions I <Col N="2169" /> vote for them.  That cannot be denied. But I want a clear, definite policy from the Minister.  Does he stand for one army only and for one police force only?  Will he introduce legislation into this House, if he believes in only one army, to put down all other armies and to put down all those who have lethal weapons in their hands and to take them from them?  That is what the country is waiting for.  If the Minister introduce a Public Safety Act on the lines of the Public Safety Act that was introduced here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not going to pursue that matter further than again to ask the Minister, does he stand for one army and one police force, and is he prepared to use the machinery at his disposal to disband armies other than the National Army, the army recognised in this country?  Is he prepared to use the machinery at his command, and if he has not sufficient machinery at his command, is he prepared to introduce new legislation to deal with the menace to the citizens of the country?</P>

      <P>I should just like to ask one question of the Minister.  Having regard to the urgent necessity for economy which has been proven by the regrettable cut in the pay of the Civic Guards, does the Minister still think it essential to continue the occupancy <Col N="2170" /> of the premises at Kilmainham, with the necessary heavy outlay it entails? As recruiting to any large extent has now ceased for the Civic Guards, and as a position of stability has been reached, does he not consider it would be possible to revert back to the old conditions obtaining when a larger force was capable of being accommodated at the headquarters in Phoenix Park?  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider the advisability with the necessary reorganisation it would entail of cutting the costs entailed by the maintenance of this building and, perhaps, leave that money available as an offset against the cut in the pay of the Civic Guards.</P>

      <P>I feel it is impossible to allow this Estimate to pass without saying a word to indicate the disapproval that I feel of the state of things in the country that has been alluded to by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and Deputy Anthony.  At the same time, I feel that the question is one which goes far beyond the scope of any discussion of the administration of the Department of Justice.  The task of the Minister in dealing with the phenomena, to which allusion has been made, is an impossible one until Government policy is changed.  The existence of semi-military bodies in this country, one of which, at any rate, seeks to impose its will, and does in fact sometimes impose its will, by force on the private citizen, is something that must be abominable to any lover of individual liberty as I claim to be. But that situation will necessarily continue so long as Government policy remains as it is.  There is no use shirking the fact that a large proportion of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;I have heard it myself from some of their representatives both in the Dáil and in the Seanad&mdash;are glad of the existence of the I.R.A. and wish to see it going on. It would be out of order to pursue that topic at length, but so long as a substantial portion of a constitutional Party wishes to have a sort of mastiff on a chain, that is to be kept reasonably quiet during their own régime, that is to be kept reasonably fierce, too, so that in case of any change of régime it could be let loose again&mdash;so <Col N="2171" /> long as that is their attitude, I feel that it is a hopeless thing to expect the Minister for Justice to take the course with regard to illegal organisations that he might otherwise take.  I propose to take another opportunity of discussing this whole question on the Estimate for the President's Department, or some other more suitable occasion.  I do not feel that it can be dealt with adequately on the Estimate for the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>It is interesting and use ful for Deputies to get an opportunity, at this opportune time, to put to the Minister for Justice whether he will see in future, as apparently has not occurred in the past, that even-handed justice will be handed out to citizens, that if a loyal citizen of this State goes into court, or is taken into court, and is prepared to abide by the decision of that court, that other citizens will be obliged either to go into that court to answer charges, or if any other citizen wants to bring them in that they must go in and abide loyally by the decision of that court.  There have been some very strange and inexplicable cases of justice, or alleged justice, within the last year.  A man is caught with a gun; he goes into court and does not recognise the court.  But citizens who are keeping up this State find themselves robbed by the Ministry, and &ldquo;mandamused&rdquo; by the men who destroyed their property a few years ago and made them pay in the rates for the destruction of the property, and this year are going to compensate, out of public funds, the men who destroyed that property.  I wonder if I as a special defendant in the case that we answered in the courts during the last three days stated that I did not recognise the court would I be here or in Mountjoy now?  Am I not a good citizen?  Are my people not as long in this country as the Gilmores? I make no apology for being a defendant in that case.</P>

      <P>Having made that reference I will pass on.  I would have no objection if Deputies, who are perhaps more intimately concerned than the Ministers, came into the arena from behind the barrier.  On the discussion that has taken place about armies, I am not going to express an opinion one way or the other as to which army we should have, but let us have only one.  If I stood behind the I.R.A. of the present day, as some of the Ministers do, I would have the courage to get up here and say: &ldquo;We have one army, and that is the I.R.A.,&rdquo; so that we should know where we are.  I know many of the officers of the present I.R.A., and I know that they would welcome a declaration of that kind.  There are many officers of the I.R.A. whom I know personally, and do business with, and who are as straight men as there are in this country.  They have their <Col N="2173" /> convictions.  Our convictions are different, but we would be doing a service to this country if we were honest in our convictions, and courageous enough to express them.  The Minister is not.  The Minister for Justice &mdash;I have not the exact figures of what his Department costs&mdash;has the whole machinery of the Department of Justice at his disposal.  We have the police; we have an army.  We have seen certain travesties of justice during the last year.  Is he going to continue to tax the people of this country for those travesties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney a few months ago about men firing over a grave in Tipperary. I do not say they should not have fired over it, but if I believed they should and were in the Minister's place I would say in reply to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenny &ldquo;Yes, they did, and what about it?&rdquo;  He did not say that.  He made a pretence that they should not, and that he was enquiring into it.  The final shot in the shape of an answer that he made in this House was that the Guards were not there and they could not trace anybody.  The Minister or his Government sacked a good officer for no reason but that he had been ten years an officer under the previous Government.  Has he sacked a single officer in Tipperary because he was not able to trace those culprits? That is how I would look after a job if I were in charge of it.  It is nothing to laugh at, unless you want to fool the people, unless you want to get votes and get money under false pretences. If any Deputy or Minister who laughed at that remark of mine were a manager of a limited company, and, when brought before the board of directors in connection with some pilfering which had been going on in the business, laughed on being asked &ldquo;Have you traced the culprits?  What have you done to the men under you?&rdquo; how long would he be in the service of the limited company?  He would be instantly dismissed.  If the country knew precisely the conduct of Ministers here, and how much it is at variance with their promises and their sanctimonious hypocrisy on public platforms, they would get as quick a <Col N="2174" /> dismissal as the manager who was disloyal to his limited company.  It is for the Minister to face up to this.  If he goes round the city of Dublin, except his eyes are shut and he is wilfully blind, he will see every dead wall at this moment pasted with recruiting posters.  I am not saying they should not be there.</P>

I was doubly glad to find Deputy MacDermot getting up to speak on this question, though I do not know exactly what he said, if he said anything.  Let Deputy MacDermot weigh in his mind that when he gets on a platform again he should not tell the unfortunate people down in the County Kildare that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party must never come back to power because they could only rule through coercion.  Let Deputy MacDermot be man enough now to take his stand with <Col N="2175" /> the Ministry and say: &ldquo;We will not have coercion, but we will turn a blind eye to the breaking of the law.&rdquo;  Then, of course, we will not want coercion.</P>

      <P>On this Estimate there is one incident that I wish to refer to, but, unfortunately, it is an incident I am precluded from commenting upon.  Some time ago a young man named O'Connor&mdash;I am almost certain that is his name&mdash; admitted that he was a member of the I.R.A. when he was charged with having a lethal weapon, a revolver.  He refused to recognise the court and got a certain term of imprisonment for the offence.  Shortly afterwards the judge was reported in the papers as having stated that he understood that this young man was on hunger strike; also that he believed he was a man of very high principles; and he asked the Government to release him.  The Government promptly did so.  That is the bald story as reported in the papers.  I am not going to comment on it, except to say, that it was one of the most disgraceful incidents that occurred, in this sense, for a long time, and did more to shock the sense of law and justice in the people than any <Col N="2176" /> incident that occurred for a long time in this country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney last night, and again to-day, made considerable reference to transfers and promotions that have taken place in the Force.  As regards transfers, I looked up the period from February to May, 1931, to see the number of transfers effected by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney amongst the officers of the Gárda.  I compared that with the period from the time I took office, down to the present day.  I found that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, after all he said last night upon the squandering of money and so on, just beat me by three in the matter of transfers in the same period.  He succeeded in transferring in that period &mdash;and we will take for the moment his own words that neither he nor I are actually responsible for transfers&mdash; but the Commissioner, who was acting under him succeeded in making 29 transfers.  I do not say whether the Commissioner was instructed or otherwise consulted about these transfers. The Commissioner, in the same period this year, since I took office, transferred 32.  That it was much more cheaply done, because when Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was Minister for Justice his 29 transfers took place, not in Dublin, but outside Dublin.  Ten of the transfers out of the 32 that took place in my time were in Dublin, and resulted from certain changes, promotions, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would imagine from the speech made last night by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, that there was a plot to defeat the efforts of the Minister for Finance in securing economy.  The House was led into the belief that since I took up office I was continually changing and shifting and continually transferring guards and superintendents all over the country.  The House now has the facts, that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney while he was in office added much more to the cost of transfers in that period than I have done.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney knows perfectly well that the Minister for Justice is not responsible, good, bad or indifferent for these transfers.  It is <Col N="2177" /> a matter entirely for the Commissioner. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred to promotions, increments and so on.  Now those superintendents, some second-grade, some third-grade, who have been promoted a grade, were superintendents due for promotion.  I may have been consulted about it.  If I see nothing against a superintendent, and the Commissioner says he is entitled to promotion, why should I interfere? Would anybody in this House stand for such a thing.  If a superintendent is due for promotion, and is entitled to promotion, does anybody in this House contend that he should not get it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy charged me with squandering money and with defeating the efforts of the Minister for Finance to effect economies.  To prevent people getting promotion is not the way to effect economies if that was what was in the Deputy's mind. Referring to economies and to what was alluded to last night by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, certainly, as far as I know, every Minister is concerned about his own particular Department. When representations were made to me by the Gárda with regard to cuts, I examined these cuts and met the Representative Body.  The case they made was submitted to the Executive Council.  I think the Guards are lucky, and the Force as a whole is very lucky that there was a change of Government at the particular time it took place.  As already indicated to the House, if the decision of the previous Executive Council was permitted to be carried out, and if that Executive Council had been again returned to office, the cut on the Gárdaí would have resulted in two and a half times the cut carried out by the present Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I definitely stated in the House when the Minister for Finance made a similar statement that he was misinformed.  I stated that if he had consulted the public papers <Col N="2178" /> he would see not only was that proposal for a cut in the pay of the Guards' then put forward as tentative proposals to receive the views of the Guards upon them, but, also, that after these proposals appeared in the papers they were completely set aside.  The Minister should be able to get this information from the files in the Department of Justice.  If he is not able to get it, he might, at any rate, go and see the public papers.</P>

I am, also, aware that the Department of Justice sent that, practically word for word, on to the Gárda Headquarters.  But that does not alter the fact that the Executive Council had come to no definite conclusion, and does not alter the fact that the Executive Council could not have come to a definite conclusion, because that was an Executive Council that was law-abiding, while this Executive Council breaks right through all laws and robs the Guards.</P>

I say definitely there was no decision, and could not have been a decision by the Executive Council. Other schemes of economy were under consideration of which that was one. The scheme put forward in that letter, tentatively, was completely abandoned and the fact that it had been abandoned appeared in the Dublin papers, <Col N="2179" /> at least it certainly appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Independent.&rdquo;</P>

This Estimate was prepared last November, and if Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney had read the Estimate he would find that he was misled, or was trying to mislead, because if he turns to page 109 he will find there the sum of £24,000 being saved in respect of non-recruiting and in respect of vacancies not being filled. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney spoke at considerable length about recruiting and about what it was going to cost and so on.  If the Deputy turns his eyes to the bottom of page 109 he will find there the sum of £24,000 to be saved in the current year through non-recruiting. What is the point of all this?  Did the Deputy not read the Estimate, or did he think that nobody else would?</P>

Efforts are being made and the situation is being examined with a view to seeing how that can be worked out without impairing the efficiency of the Guards and without impairing the work they have to perform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made also by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney to this Committee of Reference.  That Committee of Reference was appointed by me when the work of the other Committee of Reference had been completed, and not until then.  When they reported to me that they had completed these sweeps and asked whether they were going to continue with the other sweeps or not, it was for me to secure a decision from the Executive Council on the matter.  It is no use Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney trying to mislead anybody by saying it is an attempt to give money away for nothing.  These people have been working since their appointment, and, I am quite satisfied, performing very useful work, and they will only be paid for the period over which their <Col N="2181" /> work has extended.  They are not going to be paid on the extravagant scale that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney selected when he was appointing people.  There will not be anybody with £2,300 for a part-time job.  The House will see the basis and the proportion on which they have been paid. When I was satisfied that the work of the other Committee had ended I felt it my duty&mdash;and, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney well knows, I was bound under the Act to do so&mdash;to appoint a Committee of Reference.  I do not need to anticipate what would have been the result of the Bill, which the Local Government Department had before the Dáil, when it had finally gone through both Houses.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the I.R.A. firing over graves and so on. I am satisfied, with regard to that particular incident, that every effort was made by the Guards to ascertain who those people were.  A similar incident happened the other day in Tipperary and investigations are proceeding to try to secure the names of those people.  There was a funeral of a member of the Army Comrades' Association there and members of the Army Comrades lined up alongside the grave and fired shots over it.  It was in a part of the country where there is only a small station of only three Guards and they did not anticipate that there would be any trouble.  They heard the shots and they tried to secure the names.  These men marched in uniform and so on and that incident occurred. But I am satisfied that in both these incidents everything that was possible to be done to secure the names is being done by the Guards.  I do not stand, nor does the Executive Council stand, over any body of people in this country parading publicly in arms and, so far as I am concerned, and so far as the policy of the Executive Council is concerned, everything will be done to try to prevent that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan has referred to the O'Connor case.  From time to time I have had petitions&mdash;not in that particular case&mdash;but from time to time petitions have come before me for the remission of sentences and so on, which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney well knows, <Col N="2182" /> and in every one of those cases the petitions are sent back to the judge concerned for his views on them.  So far, I have never interfered with the recommendation of the judge whatever that recommendation was.  In reference to the particular case of O'Connor, the statement of the judge was quite clear.  He was the judge who tried this man and who was administering the law, and I think the Executive Council acted in a perfectly proper manner in acting on the recommendation of the judge on that occasion.  In any case, I do not think it is right or proper that the action of any judge should be criticised in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to deal in any further detail with any of the matters that have been raised. I recognise the duty of this Department to maintain law and preserve peace and I can assure the House that so far as its in our power and with the resources we have we are going to carry out those duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words with reference to the Gárda Síochána.  I should like to pay a very special tribute to the work of the Gárda in preserving the right of free speech in this country.  There have been carefully organised attempts recently to break up meetings, attempts of the most menacing character, when the deliberate purpose of the interrupters was to intimidate the Gárda, if that were possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>And they will attempt it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Those attempts will, doubtless, be made again.  However, I would like to say that so far the Gárda, under exceedingly difficult circumstances, have resisted that intimidation and have maintained the right of free speech.  I think it only proper to give this word of warning in the presence of the Minister for Justice.  The Gárda are being asked to do frightfully difficult work in maintaining free speech under present conditions.  I have no reason to apprehend that their splendid morale will break under the strain.  I will say that, but for their interference during the last few months, no man could <Col N="2185" /> speak his mind in this country if he was not prepared to bow down before the doctrines of the I.R.A. or the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>We all quite agree with you there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise it is the work of certain bodies of men.  I believe that the vast majority of the people who support the Fianna Fáil Party do not subscribe to activities of that kind. I believe some persons who support Fianna Fáil do encourage that, and I believe the vast majority of the people who support the I.R.A. and the Communist Party in this country also indulge in activities of that kind.</P>
      <P>I suggested on a previous occasion here that economies, while in themselves excellent, should be approached with judicious purpose.  It may not be the wisest thing rigorously to cut down the numbers of the Gárda without first examining whether we could not give the Gárda additional work to do and save expense under other heads.  This could be credited as an economy in the Gárda Estimate.  I have always felt that it was a great mistake to emphasise that side of the duty of the Gárda which is connected with enforcing the law and bringing criminals to justice.  Of course that is a very necessary part of their duty, and they do it very well, but there ought to be an atmosphere created in which the ordinary people would look to the Gárda for assistance whenever they are in trouble.  It has occurred to me that if the Gárda were given such duties as are at present discharged by the local poor law relieving officers and by the local subsanitary officers, very substantial savings could be made in those departments and allowances might be made to the Gárda for undertaking the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that every police station has to have a certain minimum number of men in attendance all day. There must be at least one Gárda on duty in a station all day.  I cannot see why he could not, in a small country town, be ready to be of service to country people who might want <Col N="2186" /> forms filled up in regard to housing loans, old age pensions, or applications of that kind.  Where you have four or five Gárda in a country station, I cannot see why one of them should not be charged with the duties that ordinarily attach to the office of a subsanitary officer, who is there for the purpose of protecting breaches of the public health law.  I cannot see, either, why a Gárda could not quite efficiently act as a poor law relieving officer in a country town.  The result of that would be to bring people who are in distress and difficulty into contact with the Guards and to make them look towards the Gárda barracks rather as a place of consolation than as a place of punishment.  There is a lot in that. If you could get the people to regard the Gárda in that way, if you could make the people beholden to the Gárda for one kindness or another, there is many a time when a Guard may be in a tight corner that he might find at his elbow two or three men to whom he did a kindness in the past and who would recognise their social services.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Now I did not say that, and I did not simply it.  Two years ago, or at any rate 12 months ago, I invited the attention of Deputy Geoghegan, who was then Minister for Justice, to the state of arrears in the hearing of appeals that were going forward from the Circuit Court to the High Court.  I suggested to the Minister then that there were considerable arrears of work, and that appeals were not getting disposed of with that <Col N="2187" /> rapidity with which they should get disposed of.  I remember on that occasion he said that that was not his information.  I invite the present Minister for Justice to examine that question, and I think he will find that there are solid grounds for the complaints I make.  I should like to go a little further and to say that up to quite recently the work in the Circuit Court was certainly much behindhand. I know that owing to the general condition of the country there has been a considerable falling off in litigation during the past four or five months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have repeatedly drawn the attention of the Minister to the fact that in the town of Wexford there are two Gárda barracks that are in a wretchedly bad state of repair. In addition to being in a bad state of repair they are insanitary.  One can hardly understand how people having any respect for the Gárda Síochána would allow them to remain in the state that they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to draw the attention of the Minister, and that is the difficulty Gárdaí in the country experience in <Col N="2188" /> the different stations to which they are attached in getting suitable housing accommodation for themselves. Anybody familiar with the situation knows that in a great many cases, when a married Guard comes to a strange town, he has to live in rooms for which he is charged a ridiculously high rent.  I suggest that the Minister ought to take advantage of the Housing Acts and build in the larger towns a number of houses which could be kept specially for occupation by the Gárda.  That would be a most desirable thing to do.  As the money is available now there is very little reason why, through the medium of the Housing Act, this could not be done.  I suggest to the Minister to do something on those lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame the poor Minister.  I would not envy him his job to discuss agriculture generally on this estimate at the present time.  I take it that it is not the purpose of the Minister to give any general survey of the agricultural situation at present; that he forbears to do so because he is afraid to reveal the facts.  I do not blame him; but I think it might be very well, before the Minister comes to the House for the purpose of securing a very considerable sum of money&mdash;£415,450&mdash;to protect his patient during the next 12 months, to tell us, as an introduction, <Col N="2193" /> what the present condition of the patient is.  I do not think £415,450 will save agriculture in this year.  If you multiply that sum by ten and then multiply it again I doubt that it would even be enough to save agriculture during the next 12 months, if the economic war continues.  However, I suppose, another opportunity will arise to discuss the question more generally and I want to deal with a few details that arise on the Vote. I spoke here before with reference to the agricultural instructors who are stationed here and there through the country.  I suggest to the Minister that if he wants to disseminate amongst ordinary farmers the discoveries that are made in the research done under his Department he must change the system under which the instructors are working.  There are a number of persons scattered up and down the country who are supposed to be there for the purpose of advising farmers.  My experience is that the average small farmer looks on the advice of these men with suspicion. He looks upon it with suspicion because he doubts whether these men are practical farmers.  In some cases, I think, there are very good grounds for that doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I always ambitioned was that we should effect an economy and, at the same time, make those men more effective.  No lesson is so effective to a farmer as a demonstration.  You may tell a man to put a certain proportion of superphosphate of lime, sulphate of ammonia, and muriate of potash on his grass and, if he is a civil man, he will listen and go away and put on the superphosphate alone, because his neighbours do it, and he is not going to be out of the ordinary. But, if you can induce one man in a village to improve the mixture of manures he is putting on his meadows, or any other crop, you will find in the following year three or four men coming in from that village and asking to get the mixture that their neighbour got.  You might have been talking to these three or four men for months and you would have made no impression on them; but they quietly watch the result of their neighbour's <Col N="2194" /> experiment and when they have visual proof of its effectiveness they follow in his footsteps.  In passing, I think it would be a source of edification to the farming community if they saw the condition of the Fianna Fáil Benches during the discussion of the Agricultural Estimate&mdash;the intelligent countenances, the eager interest, the zealous industry we observe.  One wonders that the Minister is able to find a place on the benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All farmers.  I suggest to the Minister with reference to these agricultural instructors that if they were provided with a small holding in the area where they live, and where it was possible for the Minister to acquire one by negotiation, these men could put into operation on the holding the advice that they are giving to the small farmers of the area.  If the advice is good advice these men ought to be able to make, in normal times, when Cathleen Ní Houlihán is not on the rampage, a modest income from that small holding, as good an income as any other tenant farmer can make. A Deputy remarks that it would take an expert to make it now.  I think it would take a miracle.  I stipulate, however, that my proposals only apply to the time when Cathleen Ní Houlihán is not on the rampage.  By that means, I think, we could achieve results which would mean that a part at least of these men's salaries would be paid by the revenue from the farm on which <Col N="2195" /> they live and, in every area where they live and they gave advice to a farmer and he questioned it, or showed his reluctance to take it, they could ask him to come and look at the effects of putting the advice into operation. That, to my mind, is the most conclusive and effective argument they could put forward.  The answer has been made that demonstration work should be reserved for the Model Farm at Glasnevin and the research colleges. That is all wrong, because Glasnevin has not demonstration plots.  Glasnevin is a research place, and the very nature of an experiment is that it may fail.  You want to have a place where you can make experiments, some of which will fail, some of which will succeed; but, after that, you want a place where you can take out successful experiments and demonstrate them to the public.  That is what I want these inspectors to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall be interested to hear from the Minister if he has had any report recently, and if that report is available to Deputies and the public, on the activities taking place in the Botanic Gardens.  I think a very great deal of useful work might be done there in the examination of plant diseases, etc.  I do not know whether it is being done. I think a great deal of useful work might be done there in conjunction with the schools in the city here. I do not know whether it is being done. I imagine that we have there in the director at least one man of distinction in botanical matters.  I have no doubt that there are other men there of considerable distinction.  I should, however, be interested to hear what they are doing for the purpose of disseminating the special knowledge that they have at their disposal.  I would also be interested to hear whether the gardens in general are being kept at a sufficiently high standard.  I think that these gardens ought to be a horticultural example for everybody who goes there, and I must say that although parts of them are very attractive, other parts have struck me as being capable of considerable improvement. I think it is a very desirable thing that a garden of that kind, which <Col N="2196" /> is, after all, our horticultural showpiece, should be an example of what we can do in that kind of business.  I must say that as a showpiece I do not think the botanical gardens at the present moment are a very striking achievement.</P>
    <P>Under the Department of Agriculture there is a scheme whereby people with cattle which they suspect of being tubercular can notify an officer, whom I think is in the employment of the local authority, and have that animal destroyed.  I think that is principally set on foot for the purpose of limiting the spread of tuberculosis amongst children, because what frequently happened was that when cows which were particularly good milkers developed menacing symptoms the people were trying to cover them up, and milk the cow as long as she would last rather than destroy her, as they ought to do. What I suggest to the Minister is that the veterinary officer ought to be given power to give a more generous compensation the sooner he is summoned to see the cow.  There ought to be some inducement offered to the people to bring the veterinary officer the moment there is reasonable ground for suspecting that the cow is affected.  At present the compensation for the destruction of animals under this tuberculosis scheme is very low, and is apparently based on the assumption that nothing is destroyed but a cow in the last stage of emaciation.  It is very difficult to get a small farmer to invite the destruction of a good-looking cow, and then get only £2 or £3 compensation. It would be very much better if we could afford to give a more generous compensation where the farmer brought the veterinary officer to inspect the cow in the very early stages of the disease, or when he first suspected it.</P>
    <P>The Minister will correct me if I am wrong when I say that under this Vote I think there comes the operations of the Agricultural and Technical Instruction Committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the old days they used to be together, and could be discussed on this Vote.  Certainly my feeling when I was a member of a Technical and Agricultural Committee was that a great deal of money that was made available for those committees was being wasted on all sorts of hairbrained schemes.  I must say that I imagine that the most pernicious of those schemes are now being administered under the Educational Committee.  We were providing a comparatively small amount of money, but small sums of money in great abundance, for every kind of cranky concern.  I think the Department should give scope for a closer survey of all schemes that are set on foot under these local committees for education, whether it be agricultural education or vocational education.  I believe that there is a considerable leakage of money, and that it is being frittered away and wasted on useless enterprises.  If that money could all be mobilised, something really useful could be done.  I think the Minister ought to insist on a very careful survey being made of the work that these committees are doing, and that they should be regulated and reformed if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to touch on something that presents a constant difficulty here, and that is the question of the old drainage boards.  Those extraordinary bodies are apparently under the jurisdiction of no Department of State.  Though they have a kind of bowing acquaintance with the Board of Works, the Board of Works angrily disclaims any responsibility for them.  I propose, under the general heading of agriculture, to suggest to the Minister that there is a considerable sum of money being wasted every year by those old drainage boards, that some Department of State which is interested in agriculture ought to get hold of and use usefully. Drainage is a very necessary undertaking in the country, and it is essentially <Col N="2198" /> one which is in the interests of agriculture.  I do strongly urge the Minister to take some steps, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to get control of the old drainage boards and the cess that they are entitled to levy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is we cannot bring them under any Vote directly, but there is power for the Board of Works to secure them, recondition them, and hand them over to the county council.  I am not satisfied that it was ever a good plan, because drainage did not seem to be in the line of the local bodies, and the tendency was to ignore them in certain parts of the country after they had got them over.  What I would rather see is those drainage schemes, all of which were useful in their own way in their particular district, put in good condition, taken under the charge either of the Department of Agriculture, the Land Commission or the Board of Works, maintained regularly, and some value consequently given to the people <Col N="2199" /> who are paying the annual cess with which their land is charged.  I mention the subject to-day because the trouble is that nobody wants them, and yet it would be a real benefit to the small farmers in the country if the Minister would make it his concern to deal with them.</P>

      <P>Now I come to refer briefly to the Agricultural Produce Eggs Act and the way it operates.  I would like, first of all, to pay a tribute to Deputy Hogan, I do not often do that, but there is no doubt that the work he did in connection with the egg industry in this country saved that industry from destruction.  But like many another thing he put his hand to he was not content with going a certain distance.  When he got his hand on the egg industry he could not resist putting his hand upon the throat of the egg industry and proceeding to strangle it slowly with regulations.  A great many of the regulations were good and helped greatly to save the industry.  But this difficulty has arisen, and it is one that makes the proper conduct of this trade practically impossible, and that is the departmental definition of a &ldquo;trade egg.&rdquo;  Any man shipping eggs in this country is faced with this difficulty, that there is an indeterminate definition of what is a &ldquo;trade egg.&rdquo;  One man takes one view, and another man takes another view. There is no conclusive test.  I should explain that &ldquo;trade egg&rdquo; is a technical term for stale egg.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise the Deputy to keep out of this.  A situation has arisen that presses very heavily upon the exporter.  He buys eggs of a selected grade for commercial purposes. They are fresh eggs of the requisite weight, and they are packed and shipped from the country.  They arrive in Dublin on the morning after the packing, and they are conveyed to the quays probably next morning; a case is drawn from the consignment by the Department's expert; the eggs are examined, from 48 to 72 hours after their despatch from the store of the consignor.  Now it is quite possible that an egg which was perfectly sound <Col N="2201" /> when shipped from the consignor's store, would have become what some Department's inspector would call a trade egg 72 hours later.  There is no ingenuity in the wit of man that will protect it against that; nothing he can do can protect him against that possibility. Now if that happened the Department's inspector can confiscate the case of eggs.  If it happened more than once the Department's inspector can proceed to deprive that man of his licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no complaint whatever to make about imposing rigorous penalty upon anybody who consciously and deliberately breaks the regulations, because one should never injure the reputation of our egg industry.  I sympathised with the Minister when prescribing rigorous regulations, but what is not fair is that a man should be punished by deprivation of his means of livelihood for something which he cannot possibly avoid.  I challenge any inspector, or Deputy Hogan, to say how any man could avoid that dilemma.  I know he could not.  That is one aspect of the situation.  The other aspect of the situation is this: What is the Department trying to do to eliminate the &ldquo;trade egg&rdquo; from the egg trade of this country?  That is one of the most difficult problems to any man engaged in the egg shipping trade.  I remember one time there was some kind of official enquiry started, and I think the West of Ireland Egg Distributors Association made some suggestions.  But nothing was done.  I ask this: that the Department should furnish the Minister with an estimate of the annual loss occasioned to the industry by the incidence of &ldquo;trade eggs.&rdquo;  I think if that loss were estimated it would astonish everyone to discover the size of the sum so lost every year as a result of the incidence of &ldquo;trade eggs.&rdquo; With that information in his possession, I believe the Minister would be prepared to take more rigorous measures to explain to the people how the &ldquo;trade egg&rdquo; arises, and what should be done to avoid it.  It is a highly technical question, and one not suitable for discussion here.  Indeed it could not be properly discussed here. But I draw the Minister's attention to <Col N="2202" /> the fact that it is an enormous source of annual loss, and would mean a great advantage to country women's incomes if the trade egg could be got rid of.</P>
    <P>The shipper has to buy eggs from the people.  He knows that he will lose certain portions as trade eggs, and he has to scale down the price or eggs all round in order to make allowance for the loss that he will make on &ldquo;trade eggs.&rdquo;  It has been suggested that one way out of the difficulty would be to compel every shipper to buy according to grade.  I do not believe that could be done.  You would have one man who wanted to do that, and some other fellow who wanted to do a kind of shebeen trade when he knew the inspector was not in town, and unless you had the Civic Guard stationed at every shop door you could not secure that eggs would be bought according to grade.  I do not want to delay the House with a long discussion upon the technical aspect in that particular. But I assure Deputies that my practical experience of the trade convinces me that it is absolutely impossible to enforce regulations that would compel shippers to buy by grade.  The only effect would be that the shipper who wanted to conform to the regulation would be squeezed out by the fellow who wanted to break the law.  As I said before, the question is a very highly technical one.</P>

      <P>With all due respect to the Deputy, sir, I do not think that it is consistent with the prudent conduct of this House for Deputy Hogan and myself to conduct a little private debate here as to what regulations he and I might make.  The Minister for Agriculture is the person to discuss the point with.  I remember that, when Deputy Hogan was Minister for Agriculture, he was not so anxious to get independent views as he seems to be to get them now.</P>

If we are to discuss every little technical point that arises, it is not three or four days of the week that Dáil Eireann will have to sit but every day and night for the 12 months of the year.  Plenty of information was placed at the disposal of Deputy Hogan when he was Minister for Agriculture and he did nothing.  I think he was going to do something, possibly.  Perhaps he was hatching over it.</P>

      <P>I will remind the Deputy of them outside, and perhaps I will refresh his memory.  Representations were made&mdash;and I think the present Minister will probably find them in his files&mdash;and they were made by the West of Ireland Egg Shippers Federation at the request of the then Minister.  I also made representations frequently to the Minister's officers in charge of that division, and I discussed it with them frequently. <Col N="2204" /> The Deputy may now forget that.  At that time he was an exalted Minister of State and I was a humble egg-packer, and the natural diffidence, which is my characteristic, forbade me bombarding the Minister with questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that there is a very fertile field here for useful work in his Department, and if we ever recover our markets I believe a substantial added sum would be put into the pockets of the people by certain reforms that ought to be carried out under these Egg Acts.  At present the egg business is shattered by the economic war.  The price of eggs has never been so low since the famine.  However, I know that the Minister is sick of hearing that with regard to every part of his Department. I think he ought to improve the gloomy outlook by putting in some hard work in an examination of the entire egg trade, and in a consideration of its importance and, instead of setting up a committee to examine the pig industry, if he set up a committee to examine the egg industry, it would be much better.</P>

Every Deputy&mdash;and there is a number of Deputies now at the back of the Minister, I think there are five in the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; in the Fianna Fáil Party realises, and as fully as we do on this side of the House, what the conditions of agriculture are at the moment and what they have been for the last six months.  We did expect from the Minister some explanation of the course he proposes to adopt to make those conditions better.  I do not suppose the Minister is to be blamed, personally, for the economic war, but he is one of the Ministry who are, in fact, responsible for it.  I do not intend to go into the effects of the <Col N="2205" /> economic war on the agricultural situation.  Everybody knows what these effects are.  What I do intend to refer to is what the Minister proposes to do, if not to end the war, at least to help the farmer to exist until it is ended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister never did appear to be enamoured of the policy of live stock.  His ideas of agriculture are altogether on opposite lines&mdash;the development of cereals as against live stock.  One would like to know what prospect the Minister has, within a reasonable time, of so changing our agricultural experience that we will arrive at the time when we will have very few cattle and a great amount of tillage.  I should like to suggest to the Minister, anyhow, that until we do come to such a situation where we will not need a very big market for our live stock, he should help us to carry on with what we have and that, as we find it very difficult to sell our cattle at any price, the Minister, in conjunction with his advisers, should consider&mdash;I know that Deputy Dillon gave the Minister many things to consider but I would ask him to consider this&mdash;what alternative type or breed of animal we might successfully exploit in lieu of cattle. The Minister might make some possible explanations along that line. We were promised alternative markets, but they have not come so far. Perhaps it is that the live animals we produce at present are not suitable.  It should be part of the policy of the Government, if that is so, to help us to produce the type of animal of some breed that would be necessary to keep these markets.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke of experiments on the mixing of the different manures for suitable lands.  I think the Minister should put in some provision to use manure of any kind.  If the Minister looks up the statistics for the last six or seven months he will find that the use of any sort of manure has decreased tremendously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Minister to set on foot experiments with regard to manures.  The Department has done excellent work on that, and the information is available for anybody that wants it.  The difficulty is that the people are not asking for the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy asks the Department for it he will get information in abundance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the fact remains that in certain districts, because of the policy of the Government, farmers are unable to dispose of their produce and thus obtain money to purchase manures and, as a result, the lands are not being manured.  It is the duty of the Minister to come to the assistance of those farmers because otherwise the lands will be allowed to deteriorate and in future years they will be quite useless for any purpose. Deputy Dillon spoke a good deal about drainage.  Drainage is one of the most important subjects we could speak of here.  I think in this matter, too, the Minister should come to the assistance of the farmers.  I am not now talking about main drainage.  I have in mind ordinary farm drainage.  During the last six or seven months practically no drainage work was undertaken by the small farmers.  They were unable to do it.  As a matter of fact, they had not the money to procure labourers to do the work.  As a result, moderately good lands are being covered with rushes and they will eventually be of no use.  If the present conditions last for two or three years the Minister's policy in regard to developing large wheat areas will be simply futile because there will be no suitable land on which to grow wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should give serious attention to these matters.  We cannot export our live stock except at a tremendous loss.  Some of us export them even at a loss in order to get rid of them.  The Minister, in conjunction with his colleagues in the Government, might arrange some form of tax which would be of assistance to the farming community.  I am not keen <Col N="2207" /> on taxes, but in this instance it is a case of needs must when the devil drives.  Let us take wool for example. Last year it was sold at 3d. to 5d. a lb.  We will soon reach the wool season.  I suggest some little tax might be imposed in the case of wool with the object of benefiting the farmer.  It is impossible to sell sheep, but there is a chance that the farmer will be able to sell his wool.  The Government might insist on the use of Irish wool in the making of cloth and the price paid to the farmer for the wool could be increased by, say, 100 per cent.  With their great reputation for imposing taxes and tariffs, that should not be altogether outside the bounds of possibility for the present Ministry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about the need that exists for the proper treatment of tuberculosis in cattle.  A lot might be done in normal times to stamp out this disease.  I suggest to the Minister that at the moment, in regard to tubercular cows, there is really no need for making advances for special treatment.  What he should do is to pay the unfortunate farmer some fee in order to get rid of the beast.  It would be the cheapest way out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what I advocated, that the more generous the allowance that would be made the sooner would the destruction of the beast be invited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would do away with the need for the veterinary surgeon and I would give the farmer some small amount to get rid of the beast.  Incidentally, the farmer could get rid of a few beasts apart from the tubercular beast, because at the moment there are many animals for which a farmer will get only a few shillings.  This would also give an opportunity for employing labour.  If I had tubercular cattle I would employ someone to kill them.  In that way a little help would be given to others.  I do not know how the veterinary surgeon would live in the meanwhile, but the Minister will have to consider that, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think greater sums should be expended in relation to the prevention of abortion.  Farmers suffer their <Col N="2208" /> greatest losses through abortion.  I will pay the Minister the compliment that he has made a great effort to sustain the dairying industry, but notwithstanding all his effort, abortion is counteracting a lot of the good that is being done.  The farmers' losses through abortion are so great that no matter what price he gets for milk it will not pay him.  Much greater sums should be spent in relation to this particular matter.  Any money expended would be very wisely expended.</P>
    <P>In connection with this Vote I might suggest possible reductions, and I might make many other suggestions. One must have special regard, however, for the failure of the Minister to give some adequate explanation of his policy during the last 12 months.  We are living through a period of utter hopelessness from the point of view of the ordinary farmer.  It is to be hoped that as a result of the remarks made here in connection with this Vote the Minister will be induced to make some allusions to his agricultural policy.  It may be that some adventurous Fianna Fáil farmer Deputy will venture to give his views on the matter.  I hope we shall hear something from Fianna Fáil Deputies about existing agricultural conditions.  The Minister should, at least, give some idea of how the farmer is expected to carry on until such time as the policy of reducing the carrying of stock and having a universal growing of grain is carried into effect.  The Minister should make some attempt to defend his policy.  Surely he knows the condition of agriculture at the moment and the hopeless position of the farmer.  It is his duty so to arrange matters so that the farmers' difficulties will be relieved to the very utmost.  We believe no effort is being made in that direction.  We hold that the economic war is the main source of the farmers' difficulties.</P>

      <P>The Minister may not be able to end the economic war. There were rumours that he had intentions <Col N="2209" /> in that direction, but whether they were true or not I do not know. He may not be able to do it himself, but he has influence with his colleagues, and possibly his influence would have some effect on them even at the eleventh hour, knowing, as he does, that the effects of this war must be disastrous to those who have to carry on the agricultural industry in this country.  Unless the work of the country must come to an end, and unless agriculture is to be ruined, the Minister should take some such steps.  But if he does not see his way to end this or help to end it, then it is his duty to take some steps more effective than he has done in the last 12 months to sustain the farmer. I think it is disrespectful towards this House that a Vote of this kind should be introduced, and that the responsible Minister should fail to get up and make a statement such as Ministers usually make when introducing an Estimate.</P>

      <P>With regard to some of the details pointed out I do not think this question of trade eggs is such a technical question as Deputy Dillon seems to think.  What is that question?

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to know what I said I will tell him.  I said the regulations have made it possible for an inspector of the Department to confiscate a man's property for having done something which it was impossible for that man not to have done&mdash;things which it was impossible for him to avoid doing.  I said that such regulations should be dropped.  That is putting power in the hands of an inspector to inflict a great hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that beside the point?  What is the regulation?  That trade eggs shall not be exported except as trade eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the place to have a wrangle over the details.  If the Deputy wants to know, my point is this: Until the Department is in a position to warn a man as to the specific standard this regulation should not be enforced.  If the eggs are not found by the inspector to be up to the standard then the eggs should be returned to the person who sent them.  As it is, these eggs are confiscated and the Department can deprive a man of his licence.  The fact is that the Department's inspectors themselves are unable to ship eggs in conformity with the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the point is that the regulations should be left as they are, but administered in another way, that instead of confiscating the eggs they should be returned&mdash;is not that the case?  That is the real trouble. The point is not so obscure at all.  The point is simplicity itself.  There is no doubt that trade eggs should not be exported as specially selected eggs. That would be bad for the reputation of the Irish egg industry.  The trouble is how to prevent exporting trade eggs as specially selected eggs?  The Department said that trade eggs are only to be exported as such.  The <Col N="2211" /> Deputy pointed out that there is a difficulty.  He said an egg may be fresh to-day and to-morrow it may be a trade egg, and he wants to get over that.  Surely there must be some regulation with regard to trade eggs. You cannot allow them to be exported indiscriminately.  You cannot allow a man simply to say: &ldquo;This is a trade egg.&rdquo;  That would not constitute it a trade egg or a specially selected egg. There must be some regulations.  The solution of the problem may be extremely delicate, but the problem itself is simple.  The point is that the housewives keep the eggs in when the market is rising.  The fact is that an egg sometimes gets stale in 72 hours. Generally what happens is that eggs are held at home by the housewife. When the price is low they hold them perhaps four, five or seven days even, expecting a rise.  That happens all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No housewife in Ireland ever kept an egg when the price is falling.  That is point No. 1, and point No 2 is that 60 or 70 per cent. of the trade eggs at present classified as such are only a week old.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in taking the line that this is such a highly technical subject that we cannot discuss it. Even the farmers such as they are on the Fianna Fáil Benches know that housewives hold the eggs back in hopes of a rise in the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just the question.  I see no solution of the problem except to educate all and sundry to ship their eggs fresh. Anyway there are only two alternatives, first, the regulations and, second, education.  Take your choice.  Come down on one side or the other.  Until people are educated to sell and ship their eggs quite fresh there will be no solution of the problem.  There is quite an efficient Civil Service in the North of Ireland, and there is also an efficient Civil Service in England.  This point arose in both places and they found they could not solve it any other way except by these regulations.  This is not something that has been thoughtlessly done by the Department.  It has been done with a considerable amount of thought.  They had the advantage of all the knowledge of the people in the trade and the experience in other countries.  I can see no other way out of it.  However, that is only a detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to these Estimates.  In looking through the Estimates I notice all the old sub-heads are kept on.  I know all these sub-heads backwards. They are all old reliables.  I have gone down that list and looked at these sub-heads 50 times.  I see here a sub-head for Technical and Advisory Work in Agriculture, just the same as it has been for years.  I see the next sub-head for Research Work. That is just the same as in the past. There is a sub-head for Subscriptions, etc. to International and other <Col N="2213" /> Research Organisations.  That is just the same as it has been for the past ten years.  There is a sub-head for special Investigation, Inquiries and Reports.  That is just the same as in the past.  I remember that two years ago Deputy Ryan was then very facetious at my expense about these sub-heads.  I think he talked about one pamphlet issued by the Department, and the comment he made was: &ldquo;Was there ever anything so trifling or futile?&rdquo;  He asked was the tax-payer's money to be wasted in telling people what kind of weather we had last month, and telling people what were the prices at fairs.  Yet, every month I get the same information now from the Department.  Every item down along is just the same.  They are either the services that were always in the Department of Agriculture, which was always a magnificent Department, or services that, with great diffidence I have to say, I added to the Department.  Here, they are, all from Fianna Fáil, who, for ten years have been telling the country that my policy was wrong. There is this great difference.  What are decreases?  The decreases are in G.  2&mdash;Improvement of Milk Production. That is a heavy decrease&mdash; £1,269.  G.2&mdash;Improvement of Live Stock, decrease, £1,885.  H.&mdash;Grants to County Committees of Agriculture; there is not a big decrease in that. M. 4&mdash;Loans for Agricultural Purposes; at a time, by the way, when everybody wants increased tillage, the loans for agricultural purposes are there, and all the schemes are there, but just a little bit attentuated.  Then there is I.&mdash;Special Agricultural, etc., Schemes in Congested Districts, in which there is a decrease of £1,294.  These are really important schemes and valuable schemes to the country, which have been just a little attentuated.  That is what Fianna Fáil policy in agriculture comes to.  They maintain the existing schemes and attentuate the most important of them.  That is what their policy comes to.  I knew that, because there is no inspiration either agricultural or industrial on the opposite Benches.  They are purely imitative.  When they took office they <Col N="2214" /> simply imitated us, but did not do it as efficiently as we did.</P>
    <P>They have a few new schemes, such as the wheat scheme.  I believe Deputy Norton is very fond of that wheat scheme.  I am certain that Deputy Kelly thinks of this as drivel.  He is a Dublin man, and his line of country is patriotism.  He thinks that it is waste of time to talk about eggs or any of the humdrum things such as that.  He has almost told us that. Deputy Donnelly complained that we are wasting too much time on the farmers.  He says that you would think there were not any other people but farmers, and there were only two members of the Fianna Fáil Party with himself present in the House. He thinks it is a waste of time to spend any time discussing the problems of the country.</P>

Fianna Fáil have a few new schemes. They have the wheat scheme.  I hope that will be in operation for a couple of years, as I want to see it tried out. We have pricked a good many bubbles in the last year.  The agricultural tariffs were one.  Not a word now about agricultural tariffs.  Not a single word about German oats, when the best white oats are being sold at 8/- and 9/- a barrel.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is not willing to give an opinion on that, <Col N="2215" /> let him just wait and see and not interrupt any more.  I know what they will go for.  They will go less than 8/- per barrel.  I hope the wheat scheme will be put into operation for two or three years, so that that particular foolishness will be finished with once and for all, just as a lot of other particular brands of foolishness have been dispelled for the last year or two.  We do not hear a word now about agricultural tariffs.  There is no longer any virtue in them.  Nobody tells us now about the price of bacon and pigs, although the Danish and Polish bacon has been stopped from coming in.  There are no imports of bacon from these countries, yet look at the price of bacon to-day.  Then we have the tobacco scheme and people have been writing to the farmers to grow tobacco.  These are the only two substantial additions which have been made by the Minister to the schemes we used to carry out. The country should know that.  Of course turf has been promised. Leaving out politics, leaving out what Deputy Dillon called Caitlin Ni Houlihan in the cold for the moment, what does the Fianna Fáil agricultural policy come to?  A rather poor imitation of mine, with tobacco and wheat actually added and turf promised.  Deputy Dillon also said that he was surprised and amazed, and so did Deputy Bennett, that the Minister did not think it worth while to make some comment on his Estimate; give us some idea of what he hoped for in the future and show that he has some realisation that the farmers are in a shocking condition and that agriculture is in an appalling state, and if he had any plan that would give any germ of hope for the future to let us hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also said that he was not going to rub it in about the price of live stock, and the price at which the farmer was selling everything.  I think it ought to be rubbed in.  It is a most extraordinary thing that, in present circumstances, and with present prices, a Minister could come forward and introduce an agricultural Estimate without saying a single word <Col N="2216" /> in explanation, making no contribution whatever, and promising no contribution to the terrible problems confronting the unfortunate man who expects to live out of agriculture.  I think he certainly ought to be reminded of the position.  What is the position.  What is the position because we have lost the market which we had. We need not go into the reasons. Cattle are now 23/- and 24/- per cwt. The Germans are able to buy cattle to-day in the Dublin market.  I saw them buying them.  There is a Fianna Fáil victory!  You will get soft-headed people to tell you that we have alternative markets, because the Germans bought 120 head of cattle in Dublin to-day.  They did.  Who made them think of buying them?  The Minister for Agriculture.  His Government brought the price of cattle down to such a price that the Germans could come in and buy them.  If he brings them down much lower, the Chinese can come in and buy them, and we shall have any amount of alternative markets.  Any one could buy cattle if they were down to £1 per cwt.  They are down to 24/-.  What were the same cattle two years ago?  44/- per cwt.  You could not get Hereford cattle less than 48/- The best 9 cwt. Hereford cattle at present sell for 28/- and 26/- per cwt.  What are lambs at present?  I come from a constituency where small farmers always look forward to the lamb trade to pay their bills.  First class fat lambs are fetching £1 in the country, or 23/- or 24/- in the Dublin market.  What were they last year before the economic war?  The same quality were selling at 36/-. What were they the year before? They were 47/6.  I am quoting specific cases.  Lambs fell from 47/6 to 36/-, and now they are down to £1.  Beef, which was 48/- per cwt., is now down to 23/-.  I sold pigs this year at 25/- per cwt. live weight.  What are they now?  I do not know, because I have not any pigs.  Of course that is what is happening.  What was the price of eggs?  They were 4d. a score some time ago.  Of course that conveys nothing to Deputy Kelly.  He is above all that. He is thinking of Caithlín Ní Houlihán the whole time.</P>

There is not a word to show the farmers of the country that there is to be any hope for them.  What is behind it? Is not that almost inconceivable?  If anybody would say two or three years ago that the prices of live stock would have fallen to such famine levels, to levels they have not touched since 1848, and that yet you could have an agricultural debate in the Dáil to empty benches, with the Minister silent, would it be believed?  I venture to say that no member of any Party in the Dáil would believe it.  Why does it happen? Mind you Deputy Donnelly was on a good point.  He suggested that farmers are of no account.

Fianna Fáil has got a better way.  What their policy amounts to is this.  They have told the farmers in effect that making money in these times out of farming proper is too hard work for patriots.</P>

What is the result?  Three-fourths of the farmers of this country are rapidly reaching the position when they do not expect to live out of farming.  They expect to live out of doles; they expect to get sufficient money this way and that.  Where is all this money to come from?  It has all to come out of the land that nobody will work.  Was there ever in any country in the world such a Gilbertian situation?  That is the pass that the Fianna Fáil Government has reduced this country to.

What is the use in having extra selected eggs, as against trade eggs, when you can get only 4d. a score for them?  The land, the produce, everything is being deteriorated.  Worst of all, the farmers have been demoralised, and it will take many generations of patriotic governments in this country to get the farmers back to their original outlook.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to debate these Estimates at all.  There is no doubt if things were normal, if there was any attempt to put agriculture on a paying basis, to hearten the good farmers and make the others somewhat better, if things were done properly in the country, each of these sub-heads could be taken in details and discussed and improved on.  What is the use of making any suggestions?  Who is ready to listen to them?  There are very few people, except those who have certain reserves and who are not yet bankrupt under the present regime, who have any heart for farming or working.  All this, we are told, is being done in the interests of increased population.  It seems to me that people who talk like that are suffering from softness of the brain.  What is happening in this country?  I will give you an analogy.  Take a period of three years.  There is a family of three in, we will say, three or four years. During that period a man cuts down his production by half or by one-third. He spends one-third more than he ever spent before, and he works about half as hard.  What position would that man be in at the end of it?  How is this country, losing its markets, with agricultural production falling in a most lamentable way, going to support an increased population?  I do not like to have to say this, but it is a fact that the policy put into operation here in the name of the protection of agriculture is going to bring absolute starvation in three or four years.  A good many Deputies on the opposite benches know that.  They know it, but they must go on.  There is no way out <Col N="2220" /> of it.  They have to show that they are different from us.  They took this line, and have not either sufficient brains or courage or patriotism to change it.  The sooner they are told that, and the sooner they realise it the better.</P>
      <P>I made one suggestion last year.  I wonder was it attended to, or was anything done about it.  My experience of farming and my experience as Minister for Agriculture led me to the conclusion that there was one very important defect in the Live-Stock Breeding Act.  It showed itself in the working of the Act, and in experience I had as a farmer, in connection with live stock and particularly with regard to cows, it showed itself very much.  It undoubtedly improved the beef qualities of the cattle of this country beyond measure.  That was natural enough.  It was a very drastic Act.  Nobody could keep a bull without a licence.  The standard was made higher every year. All this licensing took place on a beef basis.  There was no advertence to the history of the bull, and hence the beef animal got through every time, with the result that dairy bulls were weeded out and replaced by beef bulls.  If you look up the results of the various licensing shows in this country you will find that a very high percentage of bulls have been rejected in the County Limerick.  I believe that was due to the fact that County Limerick had a very high percentage of dairy bulls. That was one of the reasons, at any rate.  In any case it is perfectly clear that the dairy bull is at a grave disadvantage, and it is getting increasingly difficult to get a good milch cow.  That is a really serious problem.  As to contagious abortion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be in it too. Take a typical shorthorn cow.  There are plenty of counties where you will have four or five crosses of shorthorn <Col N="2221" /> cows.  It is getting increasingly difficult to get a good milch cow.  That is a very bad tendency.</P>
      <P>It goes to the root of our agriculture, and if that goes on it will be extremely bad.  Again, I confess it is easier to state the problem than to solve it, but I am absolutely certain that the problem is there.  I think it would be worth the while of the Minister to give it his attention. He has a most efficient staff; they are there to face that problem.  I do not see a ready way of solving that difficulty, but if the Minister could solve it he would have done something for the country, and something that would be remembered for him when all his false notions about wheat and sugar and beet would be forgotten.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I am infected with some disease or not, but listening to the debate, so far, and thinking over the position of agriculture, I felt inclined, and still feel inclined, to think that this Estimate for about £700,000 for the Department of Agriculture would be better saved until some sanity comes to the country by getting back markets for the produce of agriculture which the Government will not now allow.  All the nice paragraphs lettered and numbered in the Estimate mean absolutely nothing to agriculture at the present time except that agriculture will have to pay £700,000. There is not a single thing proposed that would give one &ldquo;bob's return&rdquo; for that sum of money.  Deputy Dillon went into details about egg packing, and someone talked about the necessity for drainage.  I would ask, is the best acre of land in the Free State paying at the present time.  If not what is the use then of draining swamps and turning them into agricultural land.  No one is able to say to-day that he is making a living out of agriculture.  Some Deputy who does not make his living out of agriculture throws in an objection to that statement, but, of course, he cannot be asked to prove his contention, and if he attempted to do so he would be excused.  There are a lot of things we could suggest in connection with <Col N="2222" /> this Estimate if we had anything approaching normality.  I suppose if we did not pass this Estimate the League of Nations would mandamus us.</P>

They will be told to cease from meddling with agriculture, and leave that to men who make a living out of it and made it pay such as has happened in the case of crops I sow.

      <P>There would be no reference to the Minister, in a personal capacity, only he began the personalities. If he wants to be personal he will get all he wants.  Deputy Hogan sang the same old song that he has been singing for the last ten years&mdash; the same air, the same music with just a couple of innovations.  One of the <Col N="2223" /> innovations is this subject of wheat that we are talking about.  Deputy Hogan hopes that wheat growing will be experimented with for a couple of years.  While agreeing with Deputy Hogan with regard to wheat, at the same time I must point out that we view the prospect from different angles. I have a belief in the successful growing of wheat in this country if it is done intelligently.  I am not saying that Deputy Hogan is wrong, of course. But holding the belief I have expressed, I cannot admit he is right, because I gather from his remarks that he holds wheat growing is not an economic proposition in this country.  I am not going to argue the two different standpoints. Deputy Hogan expressed the hope that probably if wheat growing is continued for two years, people will realise that they cannot grow it.  I hope that wheat growing, in present circumstances, and under present conditions will be stopped as soon as possible.  I am afraid it will only discredit wheat growing in this country when somebody gets control who knows how to handle the wheat growing problem, just as I am afraid that national protection for our own home industries intelligently worked, will be seriously discredited owing to the ignorant misuse of the tariffs we have at present.  Similarly, I am afraid for future attempts at wheat growing owing to the way it has been mishandled by the Minister and by the Executive Council at the present time. On another debate here on matters appertaining to agriculture, but not so directly concerned with agricultural policy as the present matter before the House, I put it to the Minister to tell the House and to tell the country what was the objective in his experiment. Nobody can make any intelligent experiment without having some object in view.  The Minister betrays some intention, when he gets up at a cross-roads meeting or in a market square and, to quote a very reputable farmer member of his Party.  Deputy Geoghegan, that all the ploughs of the country under their policy&mdash; under his policy, mind you, God bless the mark!&mdash;would soon be working.</P>

To get the market in our own or any other country we must produce for that market and while bread is made out of flour and flour is made out of wheat, it does not follow that every wheat that is grown is going to produce&mdash;cut out the intermediate stages&mdash;good bread, especially the bread the people are accustomed to now, and that is bakers' bread.  On the previous occasions that I spoke on this matter I asked the Minister to mention one strain of wheat grown in this country that will produce a flour sufficiently rich in gluten to give us good bakers' bread.  The Minister has not mentioned one.  I can make the positive statement, without fear of contradiction, that there is not one that is economic.</P>

      <P>In reference to that, I may say that the wheat grown here in 1847 was infinitely superior in baking quality to any wheat we have now. Furthermore, the bread then used was generally griddle or pot-oven bread. The bread that is generally used now is bakers' bread, and that makes a very great difference.  If the Deputies opposite were sufficiently interested in this matter they would know that, when the Glasnevin plant-breeding section interested themselves in the propagation of old native strains of wheat, they introduced the old native wheat from Tipperary into Glasnevin Experimental College.  That wheat was supposed to be the direct successor of the wheat that was grown there about 80 years ago and which was considered to be the best strain of wheat grown in Ireland at that time.  When that was examined here it was found that the one sample contained 65 different varieties.  That is where Irish wheat seed had deteriorated for want of proper attention. The Minister, I notice here, has neglected even giving the proper attention to that aspect of this important subject of agriculture, and the important subject of wheat growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice here that the Faculty of General Agriculture that has taken over the Glasnevin College proposes to spend £24,000 as against £23,700 last year.  The most important branch of that Faculty is the plant-breeding branch, to which a lectureship only has been given and, apparently, there is no provision to be made under this for a professorship.  I can speak with authority on that for, as a member of the governing body of the university. I was a member of the committee that drafted the statute of this Faculty.  I <Col N="2227" /> did my best there to have a professorship of plant-breeding, but I failed.  I was, however, responsible for a lectureship in agricultural engineering, but the post was not filled, and apparently the Minister is not going to fill it now.  The Minister ought to know&mdash; it would not be much trouble to him to find out&mdash;that the growing of wheat is essentially a matter for the laboratory first.  Good hard milling wheat will grow in any country and in any climate in the world, but the same strain will not grow successfully in every country.</P>
    <P>I have here a pamphlet issued by the Dominion cerealist, L. H. Newman, Ottawa, Ontario, in which he traces the development of wheat growing in Canada.  When it was attempted there first it was a failure both in yield and quality.  The first success that attended wheat growing in Canada was with the production of a breed of wheat by David Fife, a cross between Indian, American and Siberian wheats.  This produced a wheat that suited the soil and climate of Canada.  The Minister laughs at that, but that canny Scotchman knew what he was doing.  It is a pity the Minister has not a little of his horse-sense. If he had he would make progress slowly, and would not start breaking up good grass lands in order to grow wheat to feed pigs and cattle, the market for which the Minister has killed.  The Canadian plant-breeding station bred a wheat that enabled them to grow an additional 15,000,000 acres.  If I may instruct the Minister a little, here is the result of the Canadian venture:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Assuming that Marquis now occupies 15,000,000 acres, or approximately 75 per cent. of the area devoted to wheat in Canada, and that this area yields five bushels more than Red Fife would have yielded (had it been possible to grow Red Fife on the same land) we find that our harvests have been increased by 75,000,000 bushels annually.  In other words we are able to realise probably £100,000,000 more from our wheat crop annually than would have been possible had <Col N="2228" /> we still to rely upon the variety with which we started.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will learn something from that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1928.  In Canada they wanted a particular quality, and if they could not get that quality they knew wheat growing would not pay. The Minister has not a particular quality for the market here, and therefore his scheme could not be successful.  If he had a strain which would give the desired quality, I would be as enthusiastic as he is himself. But he has not the necessary strain, and he is growing for the market something that the market does not want.  In Canada they had a good strain, but they could not go any further north because it took Red Fife too long to mature.  They had to get a grain that could be put in in the late spring, when the frost would be gone, and would mature in the early autumn before the frost would come again. They got that breed and the area was increased to 15,000,000 acres, with the added advantages I have read from the official pamphlet.  The Minister is doing here what Canada would not do.  I need not labour the point any further.</P>
      <P>Take another aspect of this wheat experiment.  It is necessary that the wheat product gives a good average yield and is of sufficiently good quality to produce the flour we want. The Minister knows that in this country we have to run over a six years' rotation.  He knows that the best wheat crop is not all immediately convertible into human food.  He knows that over the six years' rotation 80 per cent. of the entire production of the land is animal food; it must be used directly through the bodies of animals.  He knows also that 80 per cent. of the produce of tillage land represents more animal food than 100 per cent. of the produce of the same land under grass; in other words, he is increasing the live stock carrying capacity of the land when he increases tillage.</P>

The Minister will concede from the rough data I have given him that 80 per cent. of the production of the rotation must pay its way, or else the whole rotation will be run at a loss.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what rotation the Minister will approve of, he will hardly deny that approximately 80 per cent. of the entire production would be animal food.  If 80 per cent. of the entire production is animal food it <Col N="2230" /> follows that to make the whole business a paying concern it is absolutely necessary that the animal food must be a paying proposition in itself.  Is there any practical man in this country who will say that if we lose the English market permanently we are going to make the increased animal food production in this country a paying proposition? Eighty per cent. of the rotation which is set going by the Minister's scheme of wheat growing and producing wheat will mean 800,000 acres, and this will amount to an increase in tillage of 5,000,000 acres. And 80 per cent. of the production of the 5,000,000 acres will be infinitely more than 100 per cent. of the present grass production of the best land in the country.  Yet the Minister has cut away the market to make live-stock production and the production of live-stock products profitable.  How is he going to make a little bit of wheat profitable, when it is only 20 per cent. of the entire production?  Even if that wheat were all of the best millable wheat, it could not be made profitable. It cannot be of the best millable wheat, because we have not the proper strain of wheat in this country to produce flour fit to make bakers' bread.  But even presuming it was so, and that we have 80 per cent. of animal food, that will not pay.</P>
      <P>Will tillage pay at £1 for lambs? Will it pay at the price at which eggs are sold as stated by Deputy Dillon to-day?  Is not the Minister rushing headlong and bringing the country headlong into a swallow hole?  He tells the farmers to till for the home market &mdash;for &ldquo;the best market.&rdquo;  If the Minister knew the tillage problem thoroughly and what intensive cultivation could produce he would know that the County Dublin and the County Meath would produce as much food as would feed every man, woman and child in the Free State.  These two counties would suffice for that without going into any other county.  I do not propose to go into the land policy nor to the acreage of farms.  We are dealing just now with agriculture and the question of land is on another Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells the people that we have the home market but I tell him <Col N="2231" /> again that if tillage in an intensified way is carried out in the Counties Dublin and Meath enough food would be produced to feed the whole population of the Saorstát, without any other county producing anything.  Yet the Minister tells us that we are to increase tillage.  The Minister and his colleagues say that they will take the land from the man who does not till.  They are telling this to the poor &ldquo;yahoos&rdquo; at the cross-roads.  Let the Minister tell it to the people in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;The Minister has an Estimate for agriculture, and instead of attending to agriculture he is attending to the roads.  My point is that it would be a saving to the country not to pass this Estimate for the Department of Agriculture. Instead, let the land run fallow.  If I may use an old agricultural term it would be better really to let the soil of this country run fallow than to be putting in crops that will never come to maturity.  We are growing beet, and we could buy sugar as cheaply if we did not grow it at all.  Of course this beet is subsidising certain favoured counties, but getting the subsidy from other counties that get no benefit from it.  A Deputy here said that the Government should do something for the dairying industry. Deputy Hogan went over the position of agriculture and spoke of the policy pursued.  I wonder what people three years ago would think of that policy.  Let us take the position with regard to butter prices.  Take the constituency I represent, North Dublin.</P>

I wonder what interest has the Minister and his Administration in margarine that the people whom I represent should be charged 8/- per cwt. more for margarine than we charge the British for Irish butter.  I am sure that the dairying districts of this country do not want that kind of prosperity, because they know it cannot last.  In addition, the Government is cutting the salaries and wages of these people and depriving them of Irish butter. <Col N="2235" /> They are forcing margarine on them, and that is the Party that was to give the El Dorado to the working man!

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was news to me that it could be discussed on this Estimate, and when Deputy Dillon was speaking I raised a point of order, as I thought that it would come under the Board of Works.  The Ceann Comhairle, however, said that it is not directly under either and that it could be discussed on either of them.  Let us forget the economic position consequent on the economic war.  There are just a few points that could be attended to and to which I would direct the Minister's attention.  One is the Weeds Act.  I think the Minister would be well advised if he could make the cutting of weeds simpler and more direct.  I believe I am right in stating that the weeds inspector is appointed directly by the Minister's Department.  I think it is an annual appointment, and very often he is not appointed in time. The Minister might consider the advisability of having that officer under the control of the Committee of Agriculture, say.  I am not recommending it, but we have found that these inspectors are inclined to travel the main and trunk roads and forget that weeds grow on lands near the smaller roads.  The matter would be worth consideration and, in considering it, it would be well if the Department got the opinion of county councils and county committees of agriculture to see how it works in the various counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to drainage schemes, the method of working these schemes at present is hardly fair.  I believe that two or three people can make an application to the county council to consider a proposed scheme for draining a district or area. The county council has not any discretion in the matter.  They must act on <Col N="2236" /> the requisition of two or three ratepayers and they must have an inspection made by a competent engineer and a scheme drawn up, with the expenses, costs, and everything worked out. When the scheme is ready for putting into execution, it is discretionary with the people whose lands it is proposed to drain whether they will have the scheme carried out and foot the bill. If they say that they will not, the scheme falls to the ground and the county rates have to bear all the expenses incurred up to that.  If the Minister takes up this matter, I suggest he should get the opinions of the county councils on it.  My experience is confined to one particular county that may not be analogous to any other.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to say whether this would require new legislation or not, but the Minister will know how far he can go without legislation. Horticulture should get more attention in this country.  While I would agree in normal times, looking a bit ahead, with the policy adopted by the Minister in protecting the home market from the importation of horticultural produce, he did not help horticulture by putting up a protective barrier in a night.  He did a lot of damage, a lot of harm, and a lot of injustice&mdash; I am sure without knowing it&mdash;to a very hard-working class of poor traders <Col N="2237" /> in the city.  There is a big scope for horticulture here, in strawberries, raspberries, logan berries, currants and I might include also rhubarb.  As the Minister will appreciate, there is no use in giving protection suddenly.  He would want to have a policy working that would develop production, or have protection on a graduated scale over a number of years.  With some fruits, such as apples, it should not be allowed to reach its maximum for seven or eight years.  In the case of gooseberries it could reach its maximum in two years; in the case of strawberries it could reach its maximum in two years; and so on, according to the time it should take for the particular fruit to mature, so that we would be able to produce in this country a crop to meet our requirements by a certain time. When that time would be reached we should have our production at its maximum, so as to protect the growers. That would have to be accomplished through a well thought out scheme. There is plenty of scope for it, and plenty of people in the country who are prepared to avail of it.  It only requires a little knowledge to save the thousands of pounds that annually leave this country to bring in forced rhubarb.  It can be done in this country, and will be done when the dumping that has been going on here for years is stopped.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy woke up.  I suppose, a Chinn Comhairle, it was because I was on a tart subject.  This will have to be worked out by schemes carried through in a spirit of goodwill, and in a graduated way.  Experiments have shown here that we can supply the market with rhubarb every month in the year, except two. Those two are October and November. In all the other months of the year it can be supplied.  Normally it was dumped here from December until March every year, and sold much cheaper than it was sold in Covent Garden.  Generally, the surplus that would rot in Covent Garden was dumped over here.  While naturally I would be interested if protection came, I should like to warn the Minister, if <Col N="2238" /> he contemplates protection for the sake of the consumer, to give timely notice. If people went to him and asked him for a tariff on rhubarb next November, and he thought a case was made for it, and imposed a tariff in November&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to advise the Minister, so that he will not make a false step.  I want him to understand that I am not speaking politically.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Belton is sitting down.  I have no doubt but the position of agriculture generally is very serious.  When we look at those countries that have the full advantage of the British market, the more we think of their position <Col N="2240" /> to-day and the more we think of ours the more we admire our Minister for Agriculture.  I will read for the House from &ldquo;Our Scottish Letter&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Farmer's Gazette&rdquo; of May 27th, of this year.  Here is what it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No real improvement is visible in the farming industry.  There is a feeling of hope in the future but that is about all that can be said. Faith and hope have kept the courage going of many farmers for several years past, but all the time their pockets were being emptied instead of being filled.  It has been a case of motion without progress. Those engaged in agriculture have come through the crisis and crash of prices with a tenacity peculiar to the Scottish farming race.  They are not yet out of the wood.  The worst fright may still be strong about them.  They do not see how direct benefit is to come to the industry by trade agreements with foreign countries and with home marketing schemes.</P>
      <P>In the great oat-growing County of Aberdeen this grain of the very best quality is selling at 4/8 per cwt.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder whether Deputy Hogan, when he complains of 8/- a barrel here, knows that they are getting 4/8 per cwt. in Scotland where they have a complete free noble John Bull market open to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures are 78/- per qr. below the cost of production.  &ldquo;The number of unemployed&rdquo; we are told in this report, &ldquo;on the land is largely increasing. Wages have been cut and economies effected in every department of farming.  The labour bill is still a serious item of expenditure on farms when compared with the income from grain and live stock.  Farmers are doing with a man less and in many instances they are doing away with a pair of horses.  This means that more land is going back into grass, and that is not a good thing for the prosperity of the industry or the country. Mechanical traction is also doing away with horses and men.  If agriculture got a fillip and was set on the road <Col N="2241" /> of prosperity it would absorb more unemployed men than any other industry in Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The paper continues: &ldquo;No Government should neglect its food producing industry, and it is only natural that the people of a country would thrive best on the food produced in their own country.&rdquo;  It goes on to state: &ldquo;Garbity Shorthorn dispersion last week made a remarkable contrast in result to the one that took place on the same farm 13 years ago.  The top price at Mr. McWilliam's sale last week was 42 guineas; when his father's sale took place in 1920 it was 2,200 guineas. The total amount realised 13 years ago was over £28,000; the other day for a greater number of animals it was under £800.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>These are in brief the facts in Scotland where they have a free market, namely the British market, at their very door.  That is the market where they are compelled to sell their oats at 4/8 per cwt., and where the price of cattle has gone down from £28,000 to £800.  That is the market, which, if the Deputies opposite had their way, we would pay five millions a year for.  We have the fact now that Deputy Belton has joined the ranks of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  He told us here to-day that his policy is wheat growing.  If he believes in wheat growing, and if it should happen that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party should come into office, which God forbid, would Deputy Belton come in under a Minister for Agriculture that would prevent wheat growing?</P>

I know what I am talking about.  Deputy Belton was talking about a particular strain of wheat&mdash;Red Stettin wheat.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>But you are all points and you have already been talking long enough.  Deputy Hogan said that the Department of Agriculture was following the same policy all the time, and that there is no change between the policy of the last Minister and the present one.  If we followed the policy of the last Minister there would not be a creamery left in this country to-day. He voted against the stabilisation of butter produce.  The price that the Irish farmer would get for milk to-day, if the ex-Minister for Agriculture was still in office would be 2½d. per gallon. Let us face the real facts.  Deputy Hogan also made another case.  You can never hold the market here as a market gardener and a farmer.  I tried it here once and failed and I have benefited by my failure.  Deputy Hogan repeated here to-day the tale of woe he gave us some six months ago.  I did not think I would have the pleasure of hearing him repeat that statement so soon.  It will be found in volume 44, column 991.  Here it is&mdash;the statement of the greatest Minister for Agriculture in Europe.  He said: &ldquo;Just before I left office, however, I was coming to the conclusion and my experience since then has strengthened that conclusion, that the Live-Stock Breeding Act, as it is operated, is operating against the dairy cow and in favour of the beef animal.  I think if it is operated as it is being operated at present, without making some attempt to encourage milk as against beef, that in a comparatively short time you may find yourself with magnificent looking cows, very fine <Col N="2243" /> cattle and pigs but that it will be extremely hard to get a good looking dairy cow in this country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a statement made by the ex-Minister for Agriculture.  That is the same Minister who brought in the Act of 1925 and kept it going until 1931 when he was put out of office.  He is the Minister who kept it going and paid for it and made the people pay for it as well.</P>

I am stating that the farmer Minister for Agriculture kept that Act going, compelled farmers to license their bulls and paid something like £7,000 a year as a minimum to his inspectors from 1925 to 1931.  Now he has the impertinence to stand up here, after he has been put out of office, and say that as a result of his bringing this Act into operation, the effect is that there is not a good milch cow left in the country.</P>

I say this much, that I agree with Deputy Hogan on that particular point.  I entirely agree with him, and I put it up to our Minister for Agriculture that if he is going to spend this year £24,898 on the improvement of milk production, if he is going to give grants to the county committees of agriculture of £80,000, and going to pay at the same time £3,275 for the operation of the Live-Stock Breeding Act in this country, he cannot have the two together, and one of the two has got to go.</P>

They are his own words.  I have dealt with one change of programme that our Minister for Agriculture has brought in, and that, at least, has prevented the dairying industry of this country from being wiped out.  If the last Minister for Agriculture had been here for the last 12 months there would not be a creamery running in this country to-day.</P>

      <P>That was the first change. Now I come to the second change. When I was over there on those benches for four years I kept appealing to the then Minister to put a tariff on foreign barley.  I was sneered at.  We were told that Guinness's Brewery would go if there was a tariff put on foreign barley.  A tariff has been put on foreign barley and, in addition, a home market was provided for our home barley, as a result of which we got this year an increase at the minimum of from 4/- to 4/6 per barrel on our barley over and above what we would have got if the last Minister for Agriculture had been still in office.  We also got a market for our oats despite what Deputy Hogan says about the man who sells it to-day.  The man who kept oats from October until to-day must be one of those who refused to pay his land annuities, or he must not be any one of those distressed farmers about whom Deputy MacDermot is always talking, because no distressed farmer would keep his oats in the loft from November until June.  I sold my oats this year at £6 15s. a ton at the very time when the price of the best of white oats in the English market was £4 10s. a ton.  In other words, I got <Col N="2245" /> £2 5s. a ton more for my oats than I would have got with the free market that all the talk is about.  Deputies should face facts.  And these are facts. In Scotland also, where there is no 40 per cent., in the great oat-growing country of Aberdeen, grain of the very best quality is selling at 4/8 per cwt. That is the price of oats.  Deputy Hogan complained a while ago because they can only get 9/- a barrel here.</P>

The Deputy is completely out of touch with the farming community, and if anything proves that it is the Deputy's bewailing the state of the farmer who cannot sell oats in June that he harvested last September.  I harvested last September and I had no trouble in getting over £2 more for my oats than I would have got with the free market.  And if I had sold it a week sooner I would have got £7.</P>

That is, £707,000 worth of a market kept here for the Irish farmer.  If we take the first three months of this year and compare them with the first three months of last year, we find that for the first three months of last year 366,000 cwts. of pig meat were imported and for the first three months of this year 363,000 cwts were imported.  That was a market of 3,000 cwts. for the Irish farmer.</P>

      <P>Are you starting now? I shall have a few nice facts for you, too.  I have dealt with butter produce. I have shown that the difference in the policy of our Minister for <Col N="2247" /> Agriculture and the policy of his predecessor in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government has been to the advantage of the dairy farmers.  I have dealt with oats and barley.  I would like to deal with wheat, since Deputy Belton is so anxious about wheat.  The world price of wheat is about £6 or £7 a ton.  I know that in 1926, when I gave up growing wheat, the price of the best wheat was between 6/- and 7/- a cwt.  We are guaranteeing a price of £9 15/- a ton.</P>

      <P>My dear man, you never had anything in your damned pocket, and what are you talking about? Deputy Hogan does not agree that we can produce suitable wheat in this country.  I do not know what are the views of the other lawyer-leaders of the farmers, but Deputy Belton at least believes in wheat.  We taught him that much.</P>

      <P>Short and all as was your stay, you learned something. Those matters are of very grave importance to the working farmer, who tills his land and provides employment; to the milking farmer in County Limerick and the tillage and dairy farmer of East Cork, who produces grain and wants a price for it, and who has cows and wants a price for their milk.  I have no sympathy with the rancher.  The sooner he gets out of ranching and the land is divided amongst other people the better for everybody.  Possibly Deputy Belton visualises himself as a Minister for Agriculture if the Cumann na nGaedheal Party ever get back; but I would not give three farthings for their chances.  It all depends on whether he will stop with them long enough.  I do not think he will.</P>

      <P>We hear a lot of talk about the price of cattle and the effect of the 40 per cent. tariff, and we hear <Col N="2248" /> a lot also about the great English market.  Again I must have recourse to the farmers' bible, the &ldquo;Farmers' Gazette.&rdquo;  In the Scottish news we see that a gentleman who a few years ago got 2,220 guineas as a top price has now received as top price 42 guineas.  We read of one sale where a man realised £28,000, and out of far more cattle this year he got only £800.  Those are facts that Deputies opposite should remember.  I suggest to Deputy MacDermot that he should leave us as an apostle, and go over to the Scottish farmers and endeavour to convert them. When he tells them about the 40 per cent. and how happy they should be and what this great market would be worth to them, I doubt very much if he would get them to pay £5,000,000 a year for it.</P>
      <P>We heard Deputy Hogan and other Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies complaining about the terrible conditions following the English tariff.  Deputy Hogan knows that from 1924 to 1931 the price of our agricultural produce in the English market dropped to the extent of £13,000,000.  He knows that in the 12 months from 1930 to 1931 the price we got for our agricultural produce in the famous English market dropped by £6,000,000.  Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies have got up one after another like unconverted heathens.  On behalf of the ordinary working farmers I wish to thank the Minister for Agriculture for the efforts he has made to improve conditions.  He has done a lot for the dairying farmer who is in a position to employ labour and who is now, thank God, owing to the Minister's policy, getting a price for what he produces.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a question. The purpose of this Bill is to empower the Minister to restrict the import of cement.  In the course of the Second Stage of the Bill as originally introduced, the Minister foresaw that the operation of this Bill would result in a substantial increase in the price of cement to the consumers.  However, he said that he intended to ascertain from various manufacturers the price at which they are prepared to manufacture cement in this country, and that whoever makes the best proposition to him will get the licence to manufacture it.  I want to ask the Minister what form his question to those manufacturers who are looking for a licence to manufacture cement will take?  Is he going to set them a standard of quality for the cement, and when he asks them at what price they are going to supply the cement are they to state this quality?  Is he going to lay down a minimum standard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister as to the powers he is taking, but I am asking him to tell this House what are the specifications he is going to demand.  What is the use of the Minister coming in here and saying blandly: &ldquo;I am going to stipulate and find at what price they are going to supply cement to the Irish public&rdquo;? Of course, they are going to supply Irish cement to the public at a price, but it may be cement of such a kind as has been used in this country already; cement of a kind which no reputable contractor would think of using.  My <Col N="2254" /> point is this: that these people may produce cement at a certain price, and then produce a gold medal cement&mdash;&ldquo;our particularity&rdquo;&mdash;for which an extra charge of 5/- a ton will be made on the ground that it is an article of superlative excellence.  It will be understood that if they want common or garden cement it will be there at the price stipulated.  If they want luxurious cement they must pay 5/- a ton more.  Has the Minister in mind any specification on which he is going to insist as to the quality at which he will insist on the cement being delivered to the public?  Has he in mind any contract price?  Unless he gives that guarantee all the talk of inviting certain people to compete for licences is worth nothing at all.</P>

      <P>I should like to know from the Minister if he is now in a position to tell the House how much extra employment will be given as a result of the establishment of cement factories in this country.  I think on the Second Stage of the first Cement Bill, which the Minister produced here, he was not quite clear himself as to the number of people likely to be employed.  I think it was admitted and it was recognised by most people that as a result of the passing of this Bill and the setting up of a factory or factories in this country, cement would be increased in price by at least 50 per cent. over and above what it is to-day.  The Minister, I notice, smiles at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  I suggest, more than the question of price. Supposing there is a factory in Clare or Limerick.  Apart from the question of price per ton at the factory, I should like to know if the Minister can give us any idea of what the cost per ton will be delivered to the retailers <Col N="2255" /> say, at Nenagh, Clonmel or Thurles, from Limerick or Clare.  That is a very important point.  The Minister knows very well that the question of transport, transport costs, and the whole question of freight has given him more worry than anybody else in this House. I suggest to him that there are three points on which the House and the country are entitled to be satisfied: (1)  the question of the quality of the article produced here; (2) the question of the amount of employment given; (3)  the question of price as compared with the price at which cement can be purchased to-day.  I am not at all opposed to this Bill, and I hope it will lead to the establishment of a number of factories that will be able to produce cement at least as good as that which we are importing at present.  I hope, particularly, that it will give decent and permanent employment to a large number of men. But, while I am anxious for the establishment of factories, I do not think that we ought to accept blindly, without getting from the Minister his views on the matter, and the authority upon which he bases these views, the extra cost to the consumer.  I think it is admitted on all sides that there will be an extra charge, and the question is whether that will be justified, if I can use the word, by the amount of extra employment given.  I should like also to know from the Minister, apart from the factory price, what the cost per ton delivered from, say, Clare or Limerick, or anywhere you like, to any given town in Tipperary or Waterford will be, and how the cost of transport will compare with the present cost of transport, apart from the cost of the article itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of any article must be the price having regard to quality.  The price has no significance unless it is related to quality.  The price at which cement will be available here will vary according to the quality of the cement.  When I say we hope to get cement produced here at a reasonable price, I mean cement of the good quality that is ordinarily specified in contracts at present.  There is a British standard specification.  There is no doubt, whatever, that we can produce any amount of cement here equal to, or better than, that British standard specification.  The only question for us is whether we are going to insist upon a severer specification than the British. I think we will be able to get cement, certainly of the British standard specification, and probably better, produced here.  As regards price, the position is, as I explained before, that we have the momentary advantage of being able to buy cement cheaper than any country in the world.  If any Deputy wants to make some money I am going to tell him how to do it.  He can import into Dublin British cement, pay duty on it, export it again to Liverpool, and sell it at 5/- per ton cheaper than British cement is sold there.  I do not say you will do it twice, but you may succeed in doing it once if you try.  Certainly, the present price in Great Britain and here would justify an operation of that kind.  How long that situation will last nobody can say.  Cement is being sold here from all countries at less than the cost of production, because it is practically the only free market in Europe for cement.  That situation may end at any time.  In fact, it is common knowledge, I think, that there are discussions and negotiations going on between the different producing firms at present which may mean that next week or next month the price situation will have terminated, if the firms concerned can reach an agreement.  They have not succeeded in reaching an agreement heretofore, and we trust that they will not reach an agreement until we have our own cement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the price of our own cement is concerned, I can only say that I have now good reason to believe that the price at which cement will be <Col N="2257" /> available here will be, having regard to the quality, lower than the price that at present prevails in Great Britain.  It will probably be higher than it is at present here, but not very substantially higher.  The price, of course, that is important is the price at the point of consumption. It would be very little use to be able to get cement produced at some outlying place at a very low price if the cost of transporting it to where it is going to be used was likely to be very high.  There is no reason, however, to believe that the factory cost of production will be higher than in any other country.  I think we will be able to get the factory costs down as low here as they are in Great Britain, possibly even lower, because there are certain facilities and advantages here which may enable that to take place. It is then a question of distribution charges.  Of course distribution charges will, perhaps, be somewhat higher than they are at present, because distribution will be taking place from two or, at most, three centres of production, while importation can take place at any point on the coast.</P>
    <P>Apart from that consideration, which will have to be taken into account in determining the most suitable applications, from the point of view of the location of the proposed works, there is no reason to believe that the price of the cement will be higher than the British cement, if we were paying the British price for the cement.  It will be possibly higher than cement is at present, but the present price is entirely abnormal. I have good reason to believe that we will be able to get Irish-made cement of a corresponding quality, available in all parts of the country, at a price that will compare favourably with the price in other countries, and that it will be only very slightly higher than the present price here.  When I say all parts of the country, one has to have regard, of course, to what the market requirements are and what the productive capacity of the works to be established will be.  It is quite possible that for a time there will be parts of the west or south where it <Col N="2258" /> will be more suitable to meet the cement requirements by imports in the future as in the past, until the total consumption here has grown to the point where the establishment of another factory, in addition to those to be created under this Bill, will appear to be justified, in which case again we will have production corresponding to consumption.  In that eventuality, of course, there would be no change in price in those districts, but over the greater part of the country which will be served by the Irish mills we have every reason to believe that the price will be lower than the British price, and in no circumstances we can contemplate is it likely to be higher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of the price at the factory; it is a question of price to the consumer that counts.  The Minister has stated that when this Bill becomes effective, and when cement is being produced in this country, cement at least equal in quality to what is on the market at the moment in this country will be produced at a price very little higher &mdash;I think those were his words&mdash;than the present price.  I should like to tie <Col N="2259" /> the Minister down.  Will the Minister say that, quality for quality to the consumer, we will have cement at, say, 5 per cent, 10 per cent., 15 per cent., 20, 25 or 30 per cent. higher than it is at the moment, having regard to the transport difficulties, and the comparatively greater cost of transport where you have one or two or three centres of distribution?  Of course when buying imported cement you can get it landed at any part of the Irish coast. I want to put before the Minister a further point.  Is he satisfied that there is a sufficient demand for cement in the Saorstát to-day, or that there is likely to be within the next four or five years a demand sufficient to maintain three or four factories?  The Minister was not so sure of that when he introduced his first Cement Bill. As a matter of fact, the Minister, at that time, was not even perfectly sure that the demand was sufficient to maintain one cement factory.  Could the Minister say whether the number of people to be employed by the new cement factories will be 200, 300, 400, 500 or 600?  I submit, sir, with all respect, that that is a very important point.</P>

      <P>I submit, sir, that the Minister ought to know.  He should be able to give the approximate number, because unless we are able to give extra employment as a result of setting up those factories there is no justification for the Bill.  Surely the Minister will agree that if this scheme is successful it will lead to the disemployment of many men who are to-day employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer to the Deputy is that the same amount of cement will be handled; in fact, there will be more transportation of the home produced cement than of the imported cement, and consequently more handling in the transportation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply means that this is not going to lead to any extra employment in the country? If that is so I am afraid I will find it very difficult, speaking for myself personally, to support the Bill, because there would be no justification for increasing the price of cement in this country, having regard to the fact that cement enters very largely into the giving of employment both in the building of roads, the building of houses, and doing work generally.  There is no doubt but there will be an increase in price, and unless the Minister can show to this House that there is going to be a fairly substantial increase in the employment given, I submit that there is no justification whatever for the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put this point before the Minister.  At present the North Tipperary County Council have under consideration a scheme which has been submitted to them by their county surveyor for concreting part of the trunk road between Dublin and <Col N="2261" /> Limerick, that part which runs through the North Riding of Tipperary.  The estimated cost of that concrete road is £68,000.  I should say, of course, that the whole scheme is dependent upon whether the Government will be prepared to give a fairly substantial grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>£68,000?  How much is the cement going to cost?</P>

I want to know from the Minister what addition will the county surveyor have to make to his estimate for £68,000 for the same mileage, when this Bill becomes law, and when the Irish factories come into operation?  I have to assume, having regard to the present state of the finances of the country, that we are not going to get the 50 per cent. grant we were expecting to get, and, therefore, the whole scheme for the spending of £68,000 will be held up until we can get another Government.</P>

      <P>That is a different point.  I want to go further.  Could <Col N="2262" /> the Minister tell us here and now, under the housing scheme, under the thousands of labourers' cottages that are to be built by county boards of health throughout the Saorstát, what is going to be the increased cost to the local authorities and the State through the passing of this Bill?  Is the Minister satisfied that the cement to be produced in this country will be equal in quality to what we are getting at the moment?  The Minister has stated it will, but he does not give us any evidence.  He has not told us on what his belief is based.  As a matter of fact the Minister has been delightfully vague about the whole thing.  I should like to hear from the Minister that the cost of transport of cement in this country from the point of manufacture to the point of consumption will not be, as it might possibly be, greater than the cost of the article itself.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to column 1316, volume 47, number 4 of the Official Debates.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dockrell: On this section I assume that the Minister takes power here to insist that the quality of the cement manufactured at each of the factories is of the present standard specification.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We might insist upon something higher.  The British standard specification is ordinarily accepted by a number of manufacturers of cement at present.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I controvert that most emphatically. It is not true.  I do not suggest that the Minister stated that for the purpose of deceiving the House, but it is not correct.  The Minister's reply continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We would undoubtedly fix a specification, certainly not lower than the British and possibly if investigation showed that the raw material justified it, we might fix a higher specification all round.  There will be a specification that will ensure the best quality cement that can be procured by modern machinery.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Observe the words &ldquo;there will be a specification that will ensure the best quality cement which can be procured <Col N="2263" /> by modern machinery.&rdquo;  A moment before it was going to be British standard specification.  These are the two promises side by side.  So far as I am aware&mdash;Deputy Dockrell probably will be able to give us accurate information&mdash;the British standard specification is changed from time to time.  The average difference between British standard specification and the commercial standard of first class cement&mdash;I am not referring to aluminous cement or to quick-setting cement but to the ordinary Portland cement&mdash;it would be difficult to set them out seriatim, but the average commercial cement would be about 50 per cent. superior to the British Portland standard.  Taking the tensile test alone I think the British Portland standard cement is about 600 lbs. and the average commercial test 950 lbs.  The Minister, I have no doubt, has all those facts at his disposal if he wants to look at them, but notwithstanding that he gets up and says that the British standard specification is ordinarily accepted. We would undoubtedly fix the specification not lower than that, and possibly if investigation showed that we had the raw material we might fix it higher.  I call attention again to the Minister's words: &ldquo;There will be a specification that will ensure the best quality cement that can be procured by modern machinery.&rdquo;  Is it any wonder that I have doubts as to what the Minister is going to stipulate for? Is it any wonder that I put it to him that there is not the least use in his telling the House that we will get cement at 15 or 20 per cent. above what we are paying for it now if we do not know the quality of the cement?</P>
    <P>It astonishes me that this House has not examined the problem more critically from the point of view of housing.  We are going to spend several million pounds in the course of the next few years on housing.  This Bill is intended to give employment to an indeterminate number of men in the production of an article as regards the quality of which we have no satisfactory assurance from the Minister, while it is also calculated to increase <Col N="2264" /> the cost by an indeterminate figure, for the people who are going to build houses.  Remember that every £1 you put on to one of these houses is going to mean so much of an increase in the rent of it.  We are told by the Minister that he does not know what the increase is going to be.  He does not know what the standard is going to be.  We must leave it all to him and he is going to settle it.  I do not think that it is a rational or a sensible thing for this House to pass a measure of this kind, particularly with the housing schemes that are in front of us, without getting all that information, information which undoubtedly this House should have, before it makes up its mind finally on the merits of the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is rather lucky for the prospects of this Bill that the Minister does not profess to know all about the manufacture of cement: that he is leaving a monopoly of knowledge in that regard to Deputy Dillon.  The Minister has indicated that he is going to have the quality of the cement determined by experts and not by himself.  Deputy Dillon introduced some fulsome details as to the tensile stresses of commercial cement as against the British standard specification. As one who has been engaged in the use of cement for over 30 years and claims to have some practical knowledge and experience of the working of it, I have yet to learn that the British standard specification is not good enough for any type of work in this country.  For some inferior types of work Belgian cement has been used.  I have experience of the use of every type, British standard specification and others.  I have seen them tested by expert engineers, and I have never yet met one who was not satisfied with the British standard specification of cement for carrying out any type of work in this country.  Further, I have seen samples of cement manufactured in this country submitted to tests similar to those applied to the British standard specification.  These samples, on test, were found equal to the best type of cement on the British market.  I have seen cement made <Col N="2265" /> from material taken from the bed of the River Shannon.  Expert evidence as to the quality of the cement is available. There are other places, too, in the country where material is available to make cement equal to anything that can be produced in any country in the world.  We are asked to believe that we cannot produce sufficient experts in the country who will be able to determine the quality and standard of the cement to our needs.  If we have the material to make cement equal to that made in any other country, surely we can get the experts in to produce the standard we aim at.  We need not depend on Deputy Dillon's theoretical expert knowledge.</P>

      <P>If I thought that the manufacture of cement was not going to result in increased employment, then naturally I would hesitate as to whether it is worth while going on with this Bill.  But, listening to the argument between Deputy Morrissey and the Minister, it is clear that the Minister believes that there will be increased employment.  It is quite probable that a greater number of <Col N="2266" /> people will be engaged in the handling of the cement produced here than there are at present.  There will be people engaged in excavating the material, in hauling it to the factories and putting it through the various processes of manufacture.  All that must mean that increased employment will be given by its manufacture here. What that number in the factories will be I do not know, but it should not be difficult for the Minister to ascertain what is the man power per ton produced in other factories at the present time and arrive at an idea as to what amount of extra employment would be given in the production of the cement.  In that respect, I would respectfully suggest that the Minister, instead of concentrating rather on two large producing factories in the country, should, if it were still possible to produce it economically, spread it over four, or, perhaps, five factories in the country.  It would mean greater employment of labour and it would mean bringing the cement closer to the points at which it was going to be used and it would make for general satisfaction, provided that the points are suitable and experts are agreed that they can produce it economically and at the right price in units less than the units suggested for these two factories.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister ought to be deterred by all the criticism that has been directed against the scheme.  I think we ought to have some courage in entering into this scheme when we are developing the natural resources of the country.  As I said, we are living in an age of cement and it is a matter for surprise that somebody has not thought fit, long before now, to take advantage of the current demand for cement&mdash;a demand that is likely to last for a generation&mdash;and do something for ourselves instead of being continually dependent on the foreigner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keyes is lacking in that courtesy which I associate with the Deputy.  A certain standard, I think I am correct in saying, was fixed by the British Portland Cement Manufacturers' Association in England, and it is well known to anybody who is engaged in the cement trade. It relates to soundness, setting time and tensile strength, and there is a certain standard fixed as the British Portland cement standard.  It was fixed a considerable time ago and I think it has been amended from time to time.  The commercial practice has been that cement supplied by these English firms is far above that standard and the tendency constantly has been for the quality of British Portland cement to rise above that standard.  I imagine that some of the inferior qualities of foreign cement, of which I have no experience at all, have fallen appreciably below that standard and I think that probably the Belgian cements are somewhere in the neighbourhood of it, but we have been in the habit of getting into this country a high grade of British cement which, in fact, is considerably superior to the British Portland cement standard.  All I wanted the Minister to say was that, with that in his mind, he was going to fix the standard we are accustomed to in British cement, whatever that may be.  We are accustomed to getting the top-grade British cement, and I suggested that any manufacturer who was going to tender for a licence should say: &ldquo;I will deliver cement of the standard of top-grade British cement at such and such a price,&rdquo; and the Minister could then make his choice between the men tendering on that understanding and on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The British standard is set and issued in conjunction with the engineering institutes as being that which is necessary and requisite to do all forms and types of work in which stress is required to be met.  Anything over that is simply done by the <Col N="2268" /> manufacturers to boost their product as against another, but that is accepted as the standard of safety. The Minister says he is prepared to look for a higher standard than that, but I, as one person, say that what we have been doing in this country and what is being done in Great Britain, with that standard set up in conjunction with the engineers of this country and of Great Britain, ought to be quite good enough for us to aim at.  If we are aiming at a higher standard, good look to us, but what we have been getting in this country up to now ought to be good enough for us for a start.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Morrissey in endeavouring to get the Minister to tell us how many people he thinks will be employed when these cement works are established. After all, that is a factor that one would expect would be taken into consideration in determining the amount of support that one would give to the Minister in his effort.  I take it that what is in Deputy Morrissey's mind is that, when the factories are established, a great many quay workers would be disemployed in consequence of the fact that a certain number of tons of cement comes through each of the ports every year. So far as that is concerned, I do not think there will be very much difference because a considerable amount of coal and culm will have to be imported in order to make that cement but, at the same time, I do not think the Minister would have much difficulty in finding out the number of men who would be employed in the two cement works he has in mind.  In the Drinagh works, where the output was something about 200 tons a week, there were 60 men employed for 24 hours on three eight-hour shifts.  I do know that the works are capable of turning out more but I suggest to the Minister that he ought to get that information and give it to us on some stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the standard specification is concerned, I, like Deputy Keyes, have been familiar with projects in which cement was used and any engineer I have ever come into contact <Col N="2269" /> with was always perfectly satisfied with the British standard specification. I do not think there is any inferiority in Belgian cement and I think Deputy Keyes mentioned that. All these continental firms go out of their way, when quoting, to mention that their cement is equal to British standard specification and I feel absolutely certain that, if we can get the British standard specification in the cement produced in this country, it would be quite sufficient.  I think also that we are entitled to hear from the Minister what the actual increase will be, not when the cement works are established, but immediately after this Bill is passed.  I understood from his Second Reading speech on the previous Bill that he proposed to put a tariff on cement in order gradually to bring up the price so that the people would not feel the shock.  If the Minister were to tell us that increase in the price per ton, and not speak in decimal points as he did before, it would enable us to see what effect the increase would have on the housing mentioned by Deputy Dillon.  That is a very important factor in the situation.  For instance, if cement were to be increased by, say, 2/- per ton, it would mean an increase of 6d. per week in relation to the ordinary worker's four-roomed house that is being built at the moment.  That would be very serious, so far as the poor people are concerned and so far as the slum dwellers, who, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health suggests, should be transferred from the slum areas into new houses to be built, are concerned.  These are questions that the Minister ought to endeavour to secure information on so that we could make up our minds as to what our position is in respect of unemployment and the effect of the increase in price on building in the country.</P>

He says that the price will be nothing more than the British price at present prevailing in England.  He has admitted <Col N="2270" /> already that the price in England is not economic.  If I understood him rightly, he said that cement can be bought in England, shipped over to this country, shipped back again to Glasgow and sold in Glasgow, at a good profit, at a price 5/- per ton less than that at which it is sold in England.</P>

      <P>We have that 5/- per ton increase for a start.  That is admitted by the Minister.  I cannot see any other way out of it.  He has said that it can be sold at a price 5/- less in Glasgow than the British price and at a good profit, after shipping it over to this country.  All I can draw from that is that it will be raised 5/- per ton for a start and there will be the profit plus the transport to this country from the British port and back to the Glasgow port.  As to the standard, I agree with Deputy Keyes and Deputy Corish that the British standard should be good enough for us.  By adopting some standard, we would know where we were.  The Minister says that if we go higher in standard we will pay more.  I should like to know from the Minister how high he proposes to go.  He should give us some idea of what price we shall have to pay and what he believes the standard will be.  Is he of opinion that we should have a higher standard than British Portland?  It would be only fair for the Minister to tell us what the increase in price will be and, if he is to go beyond the British Portland standard, what his standard will be.</P>

      <P>I am not putting it forward as an argument but the Minister should tell the House whether or not the price of cement to our own people is going to be increased as a result of this Bill.  There can be only one justification for this Bill, in my personal view, and that is that it will result in providing increased employment.  I should like Deputy Keyes to consider this question: Will a factory producing a thousand tons of cement per week&mdash;I know that a good deal will depend on where the factory is placed and how near the raw material may be &mdash;give employment to 20, 25, 30 or 40 people under modern conditions?  Will the Minister say that three factories producing a thousand tons of cement <Col N="2272" /> per week will each give employment to 25, 40 or 50 men?  That is the real point.  But another point arises.  In view of the fact that we have a scheme for the building of some thousands of houses for agricultural labourers over a period of years and a scheme for the building of a great many thousands of houses to relieve the slum dwellers, if the increase in the price of cement were to amount to even £5 per house, in my view the Bill would not be justified.  An increase of £5 per house would ultimately mean much more because it would involve the payment of increased interest over a period of 35 years.  The Minister ought to be in a position, when he asks the House to pass this Bill, to tell us&mdash;leaving out the question of the quality of the cement, on which I am prepared to accept the Minister's word&mdash;(1) whether the increase in price will be reflected in the cost of the houses to be built here; (2) to what extent it will be so reflected, and (3) to what extent that increase in price will react upon the slum dwellers whom we hope to provide with new houses.</P>

      <P>I am concerned with the effect that this Bill is likely to have on the erection of labourers' cottages.  I come from a rural area and I am interested in the cottages which are about to be built throughout the country.  If the statement of Deputy Corish be correct&mdash;that an increase of 2/- per ton is likely to increase the price of a house by 6d. per week&mdash;I cannot see a hope in the world of the agricultural labourer paying the rent he will be asked to pay.  It might not be relevant for me to express my view now as to the rent which is likely to be charged for these houses.  I understand that it will be about 2/6 per week.  That is too much and I would certainly be against any Bill likely to increase the rent of agricultural labourers, even if the measure were supposed to give considerable employment.  I think that the first care of the Dáil should be to do nothing which would make more difficult the housing problem before the country at present.  This Bill is not calculated to relieve that problem.</P>

      <P>There are two points of view concerning prices and it is just as well to get them stated.  We are getting cement at less than cost price.  That, I think, is agreed. Neither those who buy cement nor those who sell cement deny that the cement coming in here is coming in at less than cost.  Everybody is selling cement here at less than cost because this is the only free market in Europe. That may end to-morrow.  We cannot prevent its ending.  We have no guarantee that the different cement-producing combines of Europe will not reach agreement concerning this market next week or next month. Immediately they do, prices will go up.  We cannot stop that.  They are likely to go up much more considerably in those circumstances than they <Col N="2274" /> are likely to increase when production is commenced under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask all the questions at the same time and then the Deputy can reply.  The Deputy says that the policy of the Centre Party is that we should not try to produce for ourselves anything we can buy more cheaply abroad if it increases the cost to the poor.  I want to know if that applies to butter, beef, eggs, poultry, bacon, pork, and every single agricultural commodity?  Will he tell us what agricultural commodity we are producing here that we could not buy more cheaply abroad?  Apparently the policy of the Farmers' Party is to turn all the land of the country into parks in which we can sit down and eat cheap food from abroad.</P>

      <P>We will first take the point of view that we should endeavour to produce here anything that could be economically produced.  Now if there is anything we can produce here it is cement.  The whole country is built on limestone.  We could produce enough cement to supply all Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the best quality limestone, and we can produce cement, and sell it here more cheaply than cement is sold in the majority of countries.  It is no longer a matter of experiment.  The Deputy's attitude is that we should not embark upon an experiment unless we are sure of success, but this is no longer a matter of experiment.  We have proposals from the most reliable firms.  We have British standard and Portland cement sold here more cheaply than in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the difference in price between what is sold here and in Great Britain?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so wide that the Deputy could make a profit on it.  If the sole argument against making cement here is that the price may go up I ask: Have we any guarantee that the price will not go up if we do not make cement here?  The price may be up next week.  It is common knowledge that interested parties are trying to make an arrangement to parcel out this market before we start.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the price of houses is concerned, the price of cement here is uneconomically low. That is not going to remain so.  The Belgians and the Danes are not going to continue selling us cement at a loss. They will get tired of that and prices will go up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an answer to say that the prices of all classes of building <Col N="2276" /> will be affected, in any event, whether we make cement or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>How does the Minister know that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite all history, I, for one, do not believe the British are mad.  The next point is that Deputy Corish's figures are entirely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, it is only fair to say that my calculation was not correct.  I made it in a hurry.  If the increase was £5 per house, as suggested by Deputy Morrissey, the increase in rent would be about threepence per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the average house, now entitled to a subsidy under the Housing Act, built entirely of cement.  An increase of 4/- per ton in the price of cement would increase the total price of the house by one half of one per cent., and although I cannot say that the increase will be 4/-,. or 5/-, or 6/-, because the price fluctuates, nevertheless, I do not anticipate the price of cement will rise to anything like a point where it will be noticed, even in the price of a cement house.  Against that, I repeat that the price of cement is not subject to our control.  We can produce it and sell it at an economic price. That price will be sufficient to recover the cost of production, of handling and of distribution, and ordinary remuneration on the capital invested.  It will be an economic price; and, as far as we can ascertain, the economic price here is going to be less than the actual selling price in other countries. That is satisfactory.  It creates a prospect of an export trade in cement when the rest of the world has recovered its senses, when the cutting of prices such as has been going on has been arrested, either by wise legislative action or the operation of economic laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point I want to make is this: it is not possible to state the total employment that will be given.  We are having proposals submitted from different firms, but what the total employment is to be cannot be estimated at present.  I cannot say within a hundred what it is to be, <Col N="2277" /> whether you include employment in the manufacture of sacks to be used for the packing, or take into account only the employment given in the actual production of cement. There are many factors, and it is impossible to give a figure; but there are going to be four, five, six or seven hundred people employed.  I do not contemplate that there will be any diminution in the number of people employed in transport.  I believe that the number of persons employed in the transport and distribution of cement is likely to be larger than at present because there will be more transport to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister wanted to know my attitude on the production of beef, bacon and butter, and a long catalogue of articles of that kind.  I hope that the mind of this Party in matters of that kind is the mind of commonsense.  We have no silly preconceived prejudices.  If there is a proposal made for a tariff the sensible thing is to examine the proposal and to strive, intelligently, to find out what the results of that tariff will be, to weigh the evils against the benefits, and then to make up your mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounds like the preamble to a Tariff Commission Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whether this is a tariff or exclusion, but it comes to the same thing.  What we ask is how many men are going to be put into employment, and in the course of putting them into employment en bloc, is this going to help to keep the poor still in the slums?  What is it going to put into the pockets of people who get houses at low rents?  Does it mean a substantial increase of rents to the poor people?  Or if it is going seriously to delay the rehousing of the slum population in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Wexford and other towns, then this House should be very slow to pass this Bill into law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fault I find is that the data that are necessary to any intelligent examination of these proposals have not been made available.  We do not know what the benefits are going to be of the grinding of cement clinkers in this country and we do not know what the <Col N="2278" /> evils are going to be.  The Minister says that he takes it from the attitude of these benches that our view is that you ought not to try any experiments until you are sure they will succeed.  I do not think we are entitled to make experiments to the jeopardy of this country.  It is all very well for the Minister to make experiments in his own business, but not to embark on hare-brained undertakings such as economic wars and so on in order to find out how they will turn out.  The ordinary people of the country and the taxpayers of the country are involved in such experiments.  If this is going to involve a substantial increase in the cost of housing, who is it that will suffer?  It is not the Minister nor anybody in this House who will suffer but the people who are waiting for houses will suffer.  That is why I am reluctant, until the Minister gives us the information we ought to have, to support a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion the Minister has been very unsatisfactory on the main point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the main point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>As to whether or not there is going to be increased employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If so, the Minister might explain.  The Minister confesses that he does not know.  He pretended to know very much more about it when this was first introduced.  At that time he was prepared to mention a figure. He is not prepared to do so now.  He is not prepared to say whether the number to be employed will be 100, 200, 500 or 1,000.  He says he does not know.  I suggest that, if there is any justification for passing this Bill and for the increase in price&mdash;I do not worry so much about the latter if it means added employment and if it means that the cement will be equal in quality and at an economic price for this country&mdash;but if the production of that cement means a substantial increase in the present price, that, in my opinion, can be justified only if it is going to lead to fairly decent employment <Col N="2279" /> in the country.  The Minister is not in a position to say whether it will lead to that or not, or whether 100, or 200, 500 or 1,000 men will be employed.</P>
      <P>I submit that the Minister, or any other Minister, coming before the House with a Bill of such importance as this, and having the reactions that this Bill must have on the question of employment in other directions throughout the country, and having its reactions upon all relief work which is sponsored by the Government or by the local authorities&mdash;and this Bill will have its reactions upon every form of relief work undertaken by a local authority or by the State&mdash;in view of all that and of the increased cost, I submit that the Minister should be in a position to say to this House how many are likely to be employed.  I do not want the Minister to state a set figure as he did on one occasion when he mentioned 84,501.  I will not tie him down to &ldquo;one.&rdquo;  I am prepared to take round figures.  If the Minister would only give half the attention to the indication of a round figure covering the number of men likely to be employed that he gave to the 84,501 in the famous manifesto of 1932, I think it would be a very good thing. The Minister had more responsibility for the result of the 1932 election than anyone else on the Fianna Fáil Benches.  I give him full credit for it. He worked very hard for it and, as I have said, if he would give half the attention he then gave to those particular figures to the question of the number of men likely to be employed as a result of this, I would be quite satisfied.  I am prepared to accept a round figure.  Will the Minister say how many men will be employed per thousand tons output per week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing that I can say is that the number of persons likely to be employed upon the actual manufacture of cement would be from 400 to 500.  That does not include the distribution staff or the clerical staff or those engaged in the packing of the material.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was under consideration&mdash;I am not quite sure yet whether this is the same Bill or another Bill&mdash;but when a Bill was under consideration here some months ago the Minister then had some figures.  His figures to-night are only half what they were a month ago.  If he has time to look up the report of the debates he will see that the figures he has given to-night, as regards the numbers going to be employed, are exactly half what they were a month ago.  I complain, not without reason, that on the previous occasion the Minister was not fair to the House.  He has a Department behind him, and, if that Department is not overworked at the moment, the House is entitled to more information than it has received on either the last occasion or this occasion.  I agree with the Deputies who said that housing is one of the most vital problems before this country at the moment.  There is no country in Europe where housing on a large scale is so necessary as in this State of ours.  Next to the importance of housing is the price of housing.  This House is entitled to know, before it binds itself to this particular Bill, what the effect of this Bill is going to be on housing.  We want to know from the Minister what the increased cost of cement is going to be. It is a very easy thing for the Minister to find out.  He has a Department behind him and he can find out the number of tons of cement which will be in the average house and in that way find out exactly what the additional burden on housing will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out that particular fact when this Bill was under consideration on a previous occasion and the Minister said he had not got that information. <Col N="2281" /> I told him that it was his duty to give that information to the House. Here we are now considering the same Bill.  As I say, I am not quite sure if it is the same Bill&mdash;we have discussed four of them, I think, in the last twelve months&mdash;and whether this is a new Bill, or an old one rehashed, I do not know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>He did not.  Little as the House knows at the moment, there are some Deputies in the House who do not know very much about this particular problem.  The House is entitled to that information.  We have an opportunity now of pressing for it and I think before the Bill is advanced another stage the House should know definitely the effect of this measure on housing.  It is all very well to talk about getting employment for people. You may get employment, but at what price?  Who is going to pay for it?  Is it the unfortunate slum dwellers, as has been pointed out here, who are going to pay for this cement industry, this folly of the Minister?  These are problems with which business men are accustomed to deal.  Having some knowledge of the Minister, I believe he knows exactly what information is necessary.  I will be quite frank with the Minister.  I am a little suspicious that that information is not forthcoming. I do not like to go so far as to <Col N="2282" /> say there is a reason for withholding it. I might be right and I might be wrong. The House, at any rate, is entitled to that information and I do not think we should pass this Bill until we get that information.</P>

      <P>It is with some timidity I stand to speak after the Deputy who is, of course, a practical man on housing. I will take his memory back to what happened during the debate on the last Bill.  Deputy Corish referred to the closing down of the cement factory in Wexford.  He stated that when the Dublin Corporation ceased to take that cement the works had to be closed.  He said that was done just a few years ago.  Deputy Good said that so far as his recollection went the factory was closed over twenty years ago.  Deputy Corish said that that was not so, that it was closed during the time this city was being administered by the Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I think you are a little bit previous, if you will excuse me for saying so.  A question arose at a meeting of the Council as to the amount of money that was being sent out of the City of Dublin for foreign cement.  We then learned that the Belgian Government, properly enough, subsidised their cement production and consequently the Belgians were able to sell cement here very cheaply. It was then decided that we should make an effort to have the Wexford cement used in the city and we succeeded, because we proved that the Wexford cement was cement, and no man could say what the Belgian stuff was.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whom the Minister is bringing in here as experts. <Col N="2284" /> I do know the Minister's economic policy is a sound one and that is why I and other members here are supporting him; otherwise we would not. The question of housing is a very important one here, a very important one indeed.  The money that is to be spent on it in the next few years will reach an enormous sum if the job is to be done well.  Millions of pounds are estimated to be spent in Dublin alone and cement will enter, of course, very largely into the building operations. At least £5,000,000 if a fair job is to be done and probably double that amount if a good job is to be done. That is the figure that the Dublin ratepayers will have to face, if the slums are to be eradicated.  But quite apart from that, is it not a fact that a very large number of the community who are not able to buy houses themselves, or to put up the ready money for them, have been engaged in transacactions with various utility societies and will be engaged in the future for the purposes of building their own houses?  These are houses of very much larger kind and some of them will run up to £1,400 or £1,500 each. Is it not up to the Government here to see that the material put into these houses will be sound and that the houses will be such that a father can bequeath to his children later on? How can anybody prove that with foreign stuff put into the building? What is to be made here is to be cement.</P>

      <P>Well, of course I do not think, expert and all as you are, that there is any necessity to argue the case further.  Not only was the Corporation's policy successful in bringing prosperity to the cement works in Wexford, but it helped materially to keep a large number of men employed there.  That went on as long as the Corporation was in power in Dublin. When the Commissioners came along they brought in foreign cement and <Col N="2285" /> the streets of Dublin were plastered with it.  Foreign cement agents had birthdays here every day in the week; the City Commissioners gave us Civic Week and we had ladies swimming and gondolas on the Liffey and beautiful level streets, but they left us rotten slums.  I have a quotation here that I want to read; I do not like to read in the House this Doomsday Book at all because it is always introduced here to confound your opponent. It is never used for any other purpose. I am not using it in that sense now, only in the historical sense.  This is the quotation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Good: The Wexford Cement Works were closed down twenty years before the Commissioners were appointed.</P>
      <P>Mr. T. Kelly: When Deputy Corish comes back&mdash;I am sorry he is not here at the moment&mdash;we will try to find out if what Deputy Good states is right.  I do not think the Deputy is right.  In fact I am perfectly certain he is not.</P>
      <P>Mr. Good: And I am equally positive that I am right.</P>
      <P>Mr. Kelly: Very well, we will leave it at that until the Wexford Deputy comes back.  I understand that he is Mayor of Wexford.  Is not that right?</P>

We were told that there were 480 applications for grants and few of these have been granted. The object of this Bill is to give employment to 400 people in Dublin or in some part of the country.  But the holding up of this housing scheme in Cavan is keeping thousands out of employment, and I think we should be entitled to some explanation as to why these housing schemes in Cavan are held up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect to the Deputy, I want to say that if the soundness and quality of the cement rests on the conscience of the builder it is not founded on a rock.  I will not go any further except to show that apparently Deputy Kelly, who wants to hand down houses from one generation to another, is apparently indifferent as to the quality of the materials <Col N="2290" /> that go into these houses.  However, I will not go any further along that line.  The Minister says that we can make better and cheaper cement than the cement made in other countries.  I only hope we are going to do that, because there has been a considerable amount of misunderstanding here to-night and I think the Minister started it by talking about the British standard specification.  We all know that Julius Caesar is dead, so is the British standard specification.  It is like Julius Caesar.  Years ago there was a British standard specification set up, but it has been revised, revised and revised again.  So that now the latest British standard specification, in fact, I think they do not even call it British, but the revised standard specification bears absolutely no relation to the original British standard specification. I take it that the Minister is referring to the latest standard specification.  I merely mention that to make it absolutely clear.  Personally, I should like to see in paragraph (h) &ldquo;the nature and quality of the cement manufactured at such factory which shall not be below the existing standard specification,&rdquo; because, I take it, that the cement market is a progressive one and the latest revised British standard specification may be absolutely obsolete in five or ten years.  The Minister says we have all the materials here.  We have.  He has referred to the limestone. I think, on a previous occasion, he said that he hoped to get cement here ground finer even than the existing cement.  If we are going to grind limestone rock finer than they grind chalk in other places, I only wish that the positions were reversed, because it would have an adverse effect, certainly, on the cost of the cement.  We are quite used, in the cement trade, to hearing that certain cement manufacturers are out of the market, as they have only limestone.  We have only limestone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is very optimistic about the price at which cement can be manufactured here.  I take it he is not unaware of the cement factory in Northern Ireland, as to which they say that cement from England can be delivered into the factory cheaper <Col N="2291" /> than the factory can produce it, on account of the cost of manufacture due to the smallness of the unit.  I think the unit there is somewhere about 100,000 tons.  I take it that the Minister is going to make most stringent regulations with regard to the quality. I was rather glad to hear him say, when pressed on the point of the cost of the cement, that that had relation to the quality, and I absolutely agree with him on that.  Price is the major matter about cement, assuming that the quality is all right.  I think Deputy Kelly could recall that the Dublin Corporation some years back had to take cement out of works that failed. We do not want to have that repeated here in the earlier stages.</P>

If I am stressing <Col N="2292" /> the quality of the cement that ought to be used by the Dublin Corporation and others, evidently I cannot bring Deputy Kelly's recollection to help me in the matter, if not of the light that failed, at any rate of the works that failed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point on Section 29.  I would like to know from the Minister whether there is a new procedure set out in the section.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every order made by the Minister under this Part of this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling such order is passed by either House of the Oireachtas within the next subsequent ten days on which that House has sat...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister whether this ten day period involves a new procedure. I think a period of 21 days was set out in every other Act in which we had a section similar to this one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What is in the other Acts is 21 days, or ten sitting days. <Col N="2293" /> This is ten sitting days, which is, of course, 21 days as a rule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be undesirable.  The order, after all, is one authorising the person who is going to manufacture cement to construct a railway siding or operate a ropeway or something of that kind, and is made after local inquiry at which all local interests are represented.  That order should be either approved or rejected in principle, whereas the Deputy's idea would be that it would be the subject of amendment here.  I do not think it could reasonably be amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that.  I am suggesting that the order should be approved by resolution in the House.  The Minister's point that it may be in connection with a railway siding, I submit, strengthens my point that the order should be approved by the House, that the onus should be on the Minister to bring that resolution before the House and that it should be passed by the House.  I think that is quite reasonable.  I am not suggesting that it should be open to be amended and torn up, so to speak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any necessity.  This is the ordinary procedure in relation to an order of that kind.  In any case, we are asking the Dáil to give us that authority in order to facilitate those who want to construct cement works here.  In connection with those cement works it is very probable that there will have to be constructed certain transport works, and an order authorising the people to operate and construct those works <Col N="2294" /> would be necessary.  Otherwise people would have to come to the Dáil and promote legislation in order to get the power.  We are asking the Dáil to grant us power to give those people authority to operate those works by order.  I cannot see any circumstances which necessitate bringing the order directly before the Oireachtas for approval, in so far as I do not anticipate any circumstances in which objections to the making of the order are likely to be raised.</P>

      <P>Section 34 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be payable in respect of every import licence a fee calculated by reference to the number of tons of cement authorised by such licence to be imported, and at such rate per ton as the Minister may, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, fix in respect of such licence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does this mean that if a man is importing a small quantity there would be a higher rate for his licence than if he were importing a large quantity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering that the price of cement is going to be greatly increased so as to acclimatise the people to the price of cement produced here, I think it would be unfair if the rate charged for the licence amounts to any considerable sum. The cost of the licence would be passed on to the consumer, seeing that the cost of cement is going to be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate charged to one person will be the rate for another.  It is a rate per ton, and consequently there will be no more hardship upon the man importing a small quantity than upon the man importing a large quantity.  The Bill provides that there will be published fortnightly the number of licences issued, and the rate per ton fixed.  It is possible that a purely nominal fee will operate for a considerable time, and not likely to be increased until the lapse of a considerable number of months. It may not be increased at all, if, following <Col N="2296" /> the passage of this Bill, the price of cement imported into the country were likely to be raised by the sellers.  In that case the fee might be always a nominal one.  It is only in the event of the price-cutting policy continuing right up to the time when Irish-made cement is available that the fee is likely to be increased to any considerable figure at all.  It is wrong to assume that these powers are being taken entirely for the purpose of grading up the price of cement to the level at which Irish cement will be available.  The powers are mainly taken for the purpose of dealing with the situation after Irish-made cement is available, when it may be necessary to permit the import of cement into parts of the country, and, in certain limited quantities, into all parts of the country.  It will be desirable in that eventuality to have power to fix the fee, which is, in fact, an import duty, and to ensure that there will be no undue advantage in one part of the country as against another because of the lower price of cement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my point.  The point is: would it not be better to have a nominal price?  If you put so much per ton on every ton a man imports are you not penalising him in carrying on his business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is twofold. The rate per ton is fair, because the man who imports a few tons is paying relatively no more than the man who is importing a large number.  If the rate were per licence irrespective of the quantity it would be relatively heavier on the man importing a small amount. It is necessary to fix a rate per ton, having regard to the situation that would exist after Irish-made cement is available.</P>

There is no possibility of forestalling, because cement is a commodity that cannot be stored unduly.  It might last, perhaps, for 12 months, but no one will attempt to keep it longer.  Why not leave the market open so that we could get as many houses built as possible on the basis of cheap cement?  Let other houses bear the burden.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the Second Reading of this Bill, I desire briefly to refer to the existing franchise which governed the preparation of the present Local Government Register of Electors.  The qualifications are to be found in the Representation of the People Act, 1918, and except for an alteration in the qualifying date there has been no change in the law in respect of this franchise. The Electoral Bill of 1923, as introduced, contained provisions in effect to re-enact the franchise qualifications in the Act of 1918, but these clauses were not moved in Committee.  At the time the Minister said that there were anomalies in the law as it stood and that changes were necessary and that it was as well not to ask the Dáil to re-enact the faulty law.  He intended, if the Dáil agreed that the law in this matter should stand, but as that law certainly urgently required consideration and amendment, the Dáil should not be asked to re-enact it as part of the Electoral Bill, 1923.  A member of the House criticised the proposed Local Government Franchise in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to discriminate on the score of age is inequitable and there has yet to be found a satisfactory test of an educational character, and certainly the property qualification is not acceptable to anybody in these days.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2302" /> From this it will be clear that the Oireachtas has given no positive approval to the present local government franchise and has, in fact, expressed an opinion that it requires reconsideration.  This Bill affords a long delayed opportunity of considering what should be the qualifications for a local government elector.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to find a true basis for the existing franchise.  The main requirement is that a person over 21 years of age shall have occupied, as owner or tenant, land or premises for a period of six months, but nothing was said as to the size of the land or premises, or valuation or rent, and a dwelling house was defined to mean any part of a house occupied separately as a dwelling house.  The difficulties of applying this provision were obvious in 1918, because a special provision was inserted to deal with lodgers and joint occupiers.  A lodger is only regarded as occupying a room if it is let to him in an unfurnished state.  The amount of rent paid or the valuation of the room is quite immaterial.  Now it may be said that a person paying rent for an unfurnished room in theory contributes in some remote way to the rates. Following out the same theory, can it really be held that a person to whom a furnished room is let as a lodger does not contribute in the same remote way to the rates?  Any suggestion that the present franchise has any real reference to the rate book has no foundation in fact.</P>
    <P>Further, I hold that the question of who pays rates is not the sole consideration here.  The expenditure of local authorities is made at least 50 per cent. out of grants made by the Oireachtas and that in itself constitutes a fair reason for an extension of the franchise.  Secondly, we have to consider the status of local authorities. In many ways the activities of the county and town councils are more intimately concerned with the welfare of the people at large than the Oireachtas.  The work they carry out is done under authority directly delegated to them by the Oireachtas and we should consider what franchise will be likely to secure membership of these councils such as will most <Col N="2303" /> efficiently carry out the statutory duties for which they were created. Clearly, the theory that only persons occupying four bare walls are fit to elect councillors and that married women under 30 years of age, although they may have voted at Dáil elections, are not competent to vote at a local government election will not stand. I would prefer to extend the franchise sufficiently to give every opportunity for any competent person to come forward as a member of a local authority on this extended franchise rather than exclude such a person by adhering to an archaic theory.</P>
    <P>The Bill extends local government franchise to every person who is a citizen of Saorstát Eireann who has attained the age of 21 years and is not subject to legal incapacity, and such person will be registered in the area in which he was ordinarily registered on the 15th November, but it is not proposed to discontinue the existing right of anyone to be registered in respect of premises of which he is a non-resident occupier.  It will not be possible to designate in the register in force at the passing of this Bill the persons who are local government electors.  That cannot be done until the first register which is prepared after the Bill is passed and a special provision was inserted in Section 3 whereby the existing Dáil electors will be treated as local government electors if they are not already registered as such.  I move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement presupposes a whole lot which he seems to take as of general acceptance but with which I venture to disagree.  One of his chief arguments is that if a person is fit to have a vote in the Dáil elections&mdash;a young woman under 30, unmarried, for instance&mdash;it seems to him ridiculous that he or she should not therefore be able to vote in local government elections. I pointed out here on a previous occasion that that argument could be put up for universal franchise in voting for the Dáil&mdash;I don't say I agree with it&mdash;because the Dáil has legislative <Col N="2304" /> authority and passes legislation governing and controlling the lives of every person in the State.  The Government and the State exist for the distribution of justice among all the people.  The Government and the State exist for the maintenance of that order which is necessary if people are to live normal lives.  These local elections are for a totally different purpose.  The main function of a local government body is to assess rates, to collect rates, and to spend rates.  The Government talk a great deal about a Christian State, and I am not entirely unsympathetic to the end that I am prepared to believe they have in mind, though I may feel that the methods which they are employing are more likely to arrive at the antithesis to the thing which they are aiming at. The present franchise, the Minister says, contains all sorts of anomalies; that is the distinction between the present system and the one which the Minister is proposing.  At the moment the franchise is given to rated occupiers.  The Minister can make play with the difference between a person occupying an unfurnished room and a furnished room, but if we take the general effect of giving the vote to rated occupiers we will notice, to begin with, that it gives the vote to people who have either a great or a small, even a very minute, interest in the assessment of rates, in the economical running of the local governing bodies, and in the spending of the money collected.  Incidentally, when you talk about rated occupiers, if you take the country as a whole you will find, generally speaking, that the rated occupier is the head of the family.  I know, of course, that in Dublin there are people living in rooms; shop assistants in lodgings, and so on; but taking the class that is roughly designated by rated occupier it really means the head of a family living in a house or flat.  Presumably, the Minister as a member of the Government has occupied his mind during the last year or possibly longer with the consideration of creating a State here which would roughly conform to Christian ideas.  That being so, does he think it is for the benefit of society that the family should be <Col N="2305" /> eliminated; that there should be no entities here at all but the State and the person.</P>
      <P>The present system is one that I myself might suggest changes in, but it is to my mind a good one in that it adverts to the family as a unit and the head of the family votes.  The head of the family, generally speaking, may be expected to have a greater sense of responsibility than the younger members of it.  It is the functions that these local bodies are going to fulfil that ought really guide us.  The local body has to calculate what amount of rate it is going to assess.  It has to collect that rate and is responsible for spending the sum so collected.  Now the present Government recognises&mdash;it may deny that the present condition has been brought about by its own policy&mdash;that there have got to be economies in this country.  The &ldquo;Cuts&rdquo; Bill indicates that clearly.  The Minister for Local Government surely realises that local governing bodies must themselves exercise economy just as well as the Government and private people.  Does he think, by swamping out the ratepayers, that economies are going to be carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that there is an anomaly in the present system in that there is no distinction made between great and small ratepayers. I do not think there need be.  The franchise is not based on any class idea at all, but it does ask that the people who are going to control the money collected by these local governing bodies shall have a direct interest in seeing that their work is efficiently and economically done.  In doing that it incidentally adverts to the existence of the family as a unit going to make up society generally.  The present system does tend, as I have said, to put the control of these local bodies in people who are directly interested.  We know&mdash;it is a fact recognised by every thinker all through the ages&mdash;that the irresponsible classes, the multitude generally who are irresponsible, are always in greater numbers than the more responsible people.  If you take this country as a whole you will find <Col N="2306" /> inevitably here as in every other country and in all ages of the world's history that the householder, the head of the family, has more responsibility because he has a greater burden on his shoulders than the irresponsible people.  I do not want to go back on past history.  The Minister will remember that some years ago there was an enormous amount of damage done in this country.  He knows that the people who actually did that damage, vast numbers of them, immediately afterwards cleared off to America.  They had nothing to tie them here.  They were free agents.  They had no ties whatever and were able to go to any place that suited them.  If their own work created bad conditions in one place they could light&mdash;heartedly draw off to some place else.  Rated occupiers, heads of families, do not find that they are such mobile entities as those other people who can go anywhere they like.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister in making this proposal is making one which roughly accords with the consciences of a great number of people in this country merely because they were brought up on such shibboleths as &ldquo;one man one vote,&rdquo;&ldquo;equality for all,&rdquo; and so on.  Equality to be just must recognise inequality.  Justice requires that where you have inequality in value, virtue or anything else, there must also be inequality of right.  I think the Minister would hardly contest that.  To say that the people who are ratepayers, who have a real interest in seeing that things are well done, shall be outnumbered and swamped by an enormous multitude who can easily outvote them, by the irresponsible multitude that is going to be put on the register, together with those on the register who are already irresponsible, is going to create a position here which, I think, the Minister himself must necessarily object to.  If the Minister will try to forget that he is interested in his Party and think of himself as a man responsible for his Department, for the good administration of these various local bodies all over the country, I think he can only come to one conclusion, and that is <Col N="2307" /> that the restriction on the present franchise is really based upon and accords with the votes of those whose interests are more or less identical with the good running of these local bodies.  I think the Minister can come to no other conclusion but that the proposal he is now making is one which is not going to improve the administration of local bodies but is going to disimprove it.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes round the country to election meetings the same as I do. When you go into a village you always find a body of young men or young woman simply howling.  They do not think, but they have a number of <i>clichés</i> which they shout out.  They do not bother thinking.  As a matter of fact they are not tied to the place.  If things do not turn out too well with them they are perfectly free to clear off to Liverpool or New York.  They have no ties to keep them in those places.  They do not pay rates, and consequently they do not mind in the least whether the local body does its work well or ill or whether the rates are high or low.  They do not mind whether the rates collected are spent for the well-being of the people or whether they are ill-spent.  The Minister must know that perfectly well.</P>
    <P>What do we want?  We want a well administered State.  We want to get the best possible people into the administrative posts under these local bodies whose function is to carry out certain works for the good of the people generally.  I think that the Minister in his statement was trying to appeal merely to those 19th century <i>clichés</i> that we took up here.  They were part of our propaganda, I admit, but now after ten years we should look to realities and not to high-sounding phrases.  The Minister draws an analogy between the local government vote and the Dáil vote.  He says that if a person is responsible enough to have a vote for the Dáil why should he not have a vote for a local government body?  There are thousands of people in this country to whom it does not matter one iota whether the local body does its work well or ill, but there is not one person in the country who is <Col N="2308" /> not beneficially affected if the Government does its work well and not adversely affected if it does it ill. I admit that you can have no clear cut categories, but it is a fact that the vote is given for the Dáil only to people who are directly interested in having a good Dáil and a good Government. The proposal now is to extend the franchise to an enormous number of people who are not materially interested in whether or not the local governing bodies do their duties well or ill.</P>
    <P>There is another thing and one may as well be quite frank and say it.  The Minister does know&mdash;and I am not proposing any sort of class-distinction in this because a person living in the worst hovel is a rated occupier just as is the person living in a castle; it is general in all places and not less in this country owing to historic circumstances than in others&mdash;that there is such a thing as envy and that there are thousands of people in this country who would really get a certain amount of satisfaction in having the rate high, even though the money, when collected, was only going to waste, because of the satisfaction of having it taken out of somebody else's pocket. There are thousands of these people who know perfectly well that the rate can never take anything out of their pockets but that it can take it out of others.  To bring about that organic unity we wish to have in a good State, the very things that should be discountenanced are the type of things that arise from that sort of envy and here is what the Minister is going to do.  He is going to pass over power to a great number of people who, by their votes, will do themselves neither good nor ill but can do harm to their neighbours.</P>
    <P>I had hoped, having read so much from Fianna Fáil quarters about the Christian State, that they were going to consider the matter profoundly and give some real thought to it.  Instead of that, they are merely accepting every <i>cliché</i> that was thrown about by 19th century Liberalism and that we absorbed and that we pre-supposed, without bothering to think about it, and they now come along with this <Col N="2309" /> gesture by which there is going to be universal suffrage, not merely for Parliamentary elections but for local elections.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to think of this proposal from the point of view of the Minister for Local Government and not from the point of view of the man who may be having to face an election some time later, and who thinks it might help the prestige of his Party if a situation could be brought about which would mean that the people of his particular political persuasion would be elected in the majority to these local governing bodies.  Personally, I am not urging&mdash; of course, the Minister will not believe me&mdash;my side in the slightest in the interest of the political Party I belong to.  I consider that local governing bodies have really no business whatever in politics, and a man can hold one political point of view and be as good an administrator in a local governing body as if he held another point of view, but I do think that to throw local governing bodies to an irresponsible multitude is calculated to bring our local governing bodies lower than they have ever been before.  It is no good trying to pretend that this is part of democracy and that there is now anything in favour of one class more than another because the poor as well as the rich have votes at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that there is no relation between the franchise and the rate book.  The Minister quotes that and says that more than 50 per cent. of the moneys spent by these local governing bodies is provided by the Government.  That is quite true and I think it is a point that might very well be adverted to.  What is the proposition? He says, in effect, that, in virtue of that 50 per cent. which comes from the Government, these young people of 21, either male or female, shall indiscriminately have votes.  That does not seem to me to be the course that should follow from the fact he quotes in his defence&mdash;that more than 50 per cent. of the money comes from Government. I can see that the Minister would have a very good case for saying that, because more than 50 per cent. of the <Col N="2310" /> money spent by these local governing bodies comes from Government sources, the Government that provides that money has a right itself to appoint certain members to these local governing bodies who would watch the interest of the Government and see that there was economic spending of the money put forward by the Government, but to say that, because the Government gives more than 50 per cent. of the money spent, they are going to take steps to see that the money is ill&mdash;spent, is the last proposal that should come from a Government.</P>
    <P>It does seem to me when the Minister mentions that more than 50 per cent. of the money comes from Government sources that it would be appoint certain representatives of its financial interests in these corporations and councils as Government nominees. I do not suppose that there is much good in urging these points on the Minister, but I do know this, and I think the Minister knows it, whether he admits it or not, that if he spoke only as Minister for Local Government, in the interest of his Department and the work it has to carry out, he would not make this proposal at all but would either leave things as they are or make some proposal which might be an improvement on the present situation and that he knows very well that the proposal he is now making is not in the interest of good administration by local bodies.</P>

      <P>I do not see how it is possible for anybody to support this Bill unless and until some arguments are brought forward in its favour of an entirely different type from those offered in the Minister's speech.  If I may say so, there is no word in his speech except the merest pedantry, the pedantry of political theory.  He has attacked the present system not on the ground that the county councils are functioning badly, but on the ground that the franchise has something about it illogical.  That is the kind of point in which I, personally, am unable to take any interest. On a matter like this, I firmly hold to <Col N="2311" /> the theory that whatever is best administered is best and that we should not trouble our heads with logic and theory but should, as practical men, consider what is going to work best. The Minister has not given us a hint as to whether he considers that the local bodies work well at the present moment, and I think it is due to the House that he should indicate his views on that point and that, in the course of his indicating his views on that point, if he finds matters to comment on unfavourably, with regard to the present doings of the local bodies, we should then perhaps be able to judge whether the change that he is now proposing is of a kind likely to cure these defects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own feeling is that any shortcomings in the present local bodies in this country would be very much exaggerated as a result of the change in the franchise that has now been proposed. If the local bodies were too cheese-pairing in their expenditure, if the rates were unreasonably low, if social services were being neglected, if one could say that these bodies were sorts of strongholds of Toryism and that nothing was thought of except getting the money into the pockets of those lucky enough to have it, I should be very much inclined to favour a change of the sort that the Minister is proposing, but that has not been suggested and could not be suggested. Everybody knows not only that the rates are not unreasonably low, but that they are extraordinarily high and that the people have the very greatest difficulty in bearing the burdens that exist already.  Would the Minister seriously contend, for one moment, that the legislation that he has now introduced is likely to reduce the burden of the rates?  Of course, he would not.  Nobody could possibly contend such a thing.  He is proposing to add to the electorate a large number of people to whom the rates will mean nothing and to whom expenditure will mean everything.  Possibly, some of those who are to be added may be affected, to a greater or lesser extent, by the rates, but the bulk of those to be added will certainly be very much <Col N="2312" /> less interested in the question of rates than the bulk of those who, at present, vote at county council elections.  I wonder is there anybody who will deny that for a single moment?</P>

      <P>Judging by this Bill, the Minister is having his youth late in life instead of at the time he ought to have had it.  Not very long ago the Minister made a speech here which seems strangely inconsistent with his present proposals.  Speaking on the Central Fund Bill on the 22nd March (Official Report, col. 1113) he pointed to the fact that during the last thirty years there had been a tendency to increase expenditure and to demand more and more Government grants for local bodies.  He considered that this was a position fraught with great danger to the whole principle of local government and economical administration.  He said that if this sort of thing went on and more and more grants were demanded from the State, the time would come when we should have to consider whether it would be wise policy for the Government to allow county councils to remain at all if they were not going to provide any of the money&mdash;or a <Col N="2313" /> very small proportion of the money&mdash; they spend.  How is the Minister going to reconcile that doctrine with adding a large number of people to the register?</P>

      <P>In order that I may see, it is necessary for me to put the point.  I might reasonably have expected to be able to see already as a result of the illuminating address which ought to have come from the Minister when introducing this Bill, but which did not come from him.  In my present unenlightened state, I have great difficulty in reconciling these statements with the action of the Minister in adding to the county councils a number of young people who are not going to provide any portion&mdash;or, at all events, a very small portion&mdash;of the money the county councils will spend.  Is the plan that the profligacy of the county councils will be encouraged to reach such a point that there can be no doubt of the Government's acting properly in abolishing them and putting Commissioners in their place?  If it were proposed to make this change and if I were convinced by the arguments that local administration would thereby become more efficient, I should certainly vote for the change.  If it were proposed to abolish the county councils altogether and put Commissioners in their place and if I were convinced by argument that would make for better administration, no considerations of democratic or political theory would prevent me from supporting that change.  I am interested in what will make for better administration and in nothing else.  We have not heard a single word to show that the change now proposed will make for better administration.  We have had utterances about general tendencies, general extravagance, general lack of economy, lack of thought as to where the money is to come from, utterances that suggest quite the opposite of better administration&mdash;that the change now being proposed is likely to be very damaging, indeed, to the interests of the ratepayers of the country.</P>

      <P>This irresponsible multitude, whom Deputy Fitzgerald speaks about, deserve credit, at least, for electing one good Government.  I did not honestly think that there would be any opposition to this Bill.  I do not see why people who have a vote in the election of members of this House should not be entitled to elect members of local bodies.  I cannot see why a labourer who works on a farm and helps to earn the rates of the farmer should not be entitled to some say as to the manner in which these rates are to be spent.  I cannot see why a workman earning the rates for his employer should not have a say as to how those rates are to be spent.  Some people have an idea that a man should be a crabbed old lad of about 60 before he is given any voice in public affairs and that the older he gets the more sense he gets.  My experience is that the older he gets the more soft-headed he becomes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He is at least 40 years younger than you.  He has a young mind.  Some Deputies seem to think that young people have no sense of responsibility.  The young people have to live in the country.  They have to earn their livelihood here and, so far as I know, they are a lot more interested in the country than some of the crabbed old lads who have lived in misery all their lives and can see nothing but misery before them.  I have met these people at election time. The young people came out at election time and did good work for the country by returning a good Government.  I can speak with a fair share of experience on this question.  I have been about <Col N="2315" /> eight years a member of a county council. I can honestly say that county council would have been far better had we had young voters.  The only people who show real administrative ability on that council are the young members.  You get no assistance from these crabbed old lads who in their young days get one idea into their &ldquo;nuts&rdquo; which you could not knock out with a hammer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to pay rates.  My valuation as a farmer is as high as that of anybody else.  I represent on local bodies a very large number of ratepayers of high valuation.  The man who nominates me for the county council has a valuation of about £430.  I cannot see what objections Deputies have to allowing these young people to elect councillors who will administer a couple of hundred thousand pounds a year since they are already permitted to elect members of this House who are charged with the administration of £23,000,000 or £24,000,000 per year.  I cannot see what objection they have. If the people are considered worthy enough to send representatives in here, why should they not be worthy to elect men as representatives on the local bodies.  We send representatives into the county councils and into the urban bodies who may deal with sums of £50,000 or so, but here in this House our representatives have to deal with millions.  In my opinion, the workingman who earns the money and has to go out and sweat from morning to night to make the money&mdash;the farmers' boys and the rest of them&mdash;have a right to say how that money should be spent. There is too much class legislation in this country and the sooner we realise that the better.  There are people like Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald who think that nobody should have anything to say in public affairs but themselves. These people only represent one class of voters, and it is time that the young men and women of this country had their proper say in public affairs. Youth must be served.  The sooner we get rid of these restraints upon progress, which have an effect, just the same as if you threw a wrench between the cogs of a machine, the <Col N="2316" /> better it will be for the country. Young people have a right to a voice in the affairs of the country&mdash;local as well as national&mdash;and they are going to get that voice if we can give it to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken confined himself to one particular point, yet he failed completely to prove that point.  He said that the electorate that returned people to this Dáil should be competent to elect people to the county councils and the urban councils. Everyone knows that all people contribute to the funds administered by this Dáil.  All classes of people pay taxes, direct or indirect; they pay duties and they pay tariffs on a variety of commodities, but the same cannot be said with regard to rates, so that Deputy Corry's point completely fails.  There is one point of interest to me in this matter and that is the principle involved in this Bill. That principle is to extend administrative power to people who do not contribute to the rates.  The views expressed here on one occasion recently by the President revealed a difference of opinion in the Executive Council. Otherwise it indicated that he had changed his policy.  On the occasion that the President referred to the question of derating, one of the strongest arguments he used against that extension was that if the Government were to give the farmers complete derating it would be necessary to abolish the county councils.  Why should it be necessary to abolish the country councils because justice was given to the farmers by giving them complete derating?  There can be no other inference except that you could not allow people to administer local funds because those who elected them did not pay the money that had to be administered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A crop of rumours arose owing to the introduction of this Bill.  One of those rumours was that there was a split in the Executive Council because of the Bill.  That does not matter much.  Another of the rumours was that it was the intention of the Vice-President to make people contribute <Col N="2317" /> by some system of stamping.  There is another rumour that there has been a rift in the policy of the Government and that the President has changed his view again, and that the extension of the principle in this Bill is really preparing the ground for giving the farmers justice.  It is contended that the parliamentary franchise, which is the qualification to elect members to this House, should be competent to elect persons to administer grants made from the Central Fund to the local bodies.  For these reasons I hesitate to commit myself against this Bill until we have further information from the Vice-President as to what really is the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>If they have decided to change their views and this argument of the President indicated a change of policy, and if the Government are prepared to do justice to the farmers in this Bill, I would be prepared to vote for the Bill and the Centre Party as a whole would vote for it.  It depends on how they will treat this question.  We can hardly believe that the President intends to use the principle in this Bill as a cross upon which to crucify the farmers of Ireland.</P>
