      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I call Deputy Martin, I remind those involved that they have two minutes to ask questions, the Taoiseach has three minutes to reply and one minute is allowed for supplementary questions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said last week that the European Union deal was unique to Greece, would not harm Ireland and cause no damage.  Despite the pre-election promises of Fine Gael and the Labour Party on the burning of bank bondholders, they subsequently did nothing about them.  Although they had spent months promising the people that they would burn bank bondholders, the Taoiseach did not even put the issue on the negotiating table.  This was in sharp contrast with Fine Gael&rsquo;s pre-election promises and the commitments made by him and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in regard to what it would do in the Government&rsquo;s first 100 days in office.</P>
        <P>In June the Minister for Finance announced in New York that the Government did not intend to give another cent to the banks, without burden sharing with senior bondholders.  He described Anglo Irish Bank as a warehouse as it received no deposits and gave out no loans.  These bank bondholders were not part of the EU-IMF deal or any bank guarantee, yet the Government is planning to sign-off on a payment to them today of &euro;775 million.  It is worth pointing out that it was Fine Gael&rsquo;s and the Labour Party&rsquo;s promises to burn these bondholders that drove down the price of the bonds.  The investors who bought them will have doubled their money in the past nine months on the basis of the commitments given by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  The Government can hardly complain about speculators making money on these bonds when it was its empty promises that drove down their price and created the opportunity to make these gains.  Last December, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, spoke about the obscene situation in which the poorest of the poor, through taxes and welfare cuts, were being asked to guarantee the speculation of investors in hedge funds and he declared that Ireland has no moral or legal obligation to cover this debt, yet this is exactly what he intends to do today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In short, does the Taoiseach regret misleading the Irish people on this very specific issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should know all about that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation in this country was clarified by the people last February when they gave this Government, comprised of the Fine Gael and Labour parties, the largest majority in the history of the State, to pursue a policy of growth and not default.  That is the first point.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On looking at the books as we found them, a total of &euro;17 billion had been paid to bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank by the previous Government.  I wish to say directly to Deputy Martin that I would love to stand up here and say it is not necessary to pay this money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said it before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We made a case to the European Central Bank when I spoke to Mr. Trichet in March when we were considering bondholders and the other Irish banks.  It was not possible to get the consent and the agreement of the European Central Bank.  As the Deputy will be aware, 17 governors make up their minds in this regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, go to New York on day 99 and make comments to the contrary?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister, Deputy Noonan, spoke on a number of occasions and negotiated with Mr. Trichet about the question of bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank, the European Central Bank would not give its agreement.  I admit it has not been possible for this Government to unravel the agreement that was made by Deputy Martin&rsquo;s Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Government had defaulted on these bonds, we would not have had the support of our colleagues to get a &euro;10 billion reduction in interest rates.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Every member of this Government, including the Taoiseach and those sitting behind him, was elected on a commitment not to pay the full &euro;700 million to the Anglo bondholders, which is being repaid today.  He can dress up his position in all of the brazen nonsense he wants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I will read it out for those opposite.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but he cannot wriggle out of his own clear words.  In fact, the value of the bond collapsed in February as a result of Fine Gael and Labour statements and commitments and since then, the Taoiseach has done absolutely nothing to implement his commitments.  It is incredible the lengths to which he has gone not to burn these bondholders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We would have gone down the tubes.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach stood on many occasions and on many a platform saying he would not pay these bondholders.  At the four crisis summits he has attended&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A supplementary question, please Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;he did not table any measure to allow the burning of these bondholders; he did not meet Mr. Trichet about it; he did not meet Mr. Draghi about it when he was appointing him as the president of the ECB; and he did not raise it with his close friend, Chancellor Merkel.  The Taoiseach made a solemn promise of not another red cent more.  If he was told in March&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must have the Deputy&rsquo;s supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;what was the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, doing in June in New York telling the world he would not pay these bondholders?  He told RTE but he did not have the guts to say it to the bankers on that occasion.</P>

	<P>There is no question in Deputy Martin&rsquo;s comments.  I remind him he was not present at any of the discussions that took place during the four meetings I attended, nor at the discussions I had with either Chancellor Merkel or Mr. Trichet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>

	<P>Is leis an phobal an t-airgead seo, ach inniu tabharfaidh an Rialtas &euro;700 milli&uacute;in d&rsquo;airgead an phobail d&rsquo;Anglo Irish Bank.  Seo rogha an Taoisigh.  Ni bhaineann s&eacute; le Fianna F&aacute;il ach leis an Taoiseach agus an Rialtas.  This is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s choice, his decision.  He did not even allow a debate on this issue yesterday in the House.  Why is the money being paid?  This bank is fully nationalised.  A total of &euro;30 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been ploughed into it.</P>
        <P>I offer a suggestion as to why it is being paid.  The golden circle is still in place.  The chairman of this bank, formerly known as Anglo Irish Bank, is a former leader of Fine Gael.  He still keeps his double pension, worth &euro;100,000 a year, as well as receiving &euro;150,000 in yearly salary from his present position as chairman.  He thinks these bondholders should be paid with the people&rsquo;s money and the Taoiseach agrees.  It is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s choice and the people have to pay for it.</P>
        <P>Why does the Taoiseach not telephone Mr. Alan Dukes before 12 noon and tell him not to pay this money?  Will he name the bondholders?  Who are they?  Let us have their names and a wee bit of transparency on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question is twofold.  I do not know the names of the bondholders, nor does the Government.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no intention of turning this country into some kind of sub-Saharan state, by virtue of reckless decisions that might be made.  We are pursuing an alternative strategy based on growth and the reduction of the overall level of debt burden.  That has been achieved to an extent in respect of the interest rate reduction and the changes to the memorandum of understanding, which have enabled us to reduce PRSI and VAT, to create jobs and to provide a jobs and growth stimulus that is getting our people off the dole and back into work.  That is what good politics is about.  The decisions that were made last Sunday at the European Council meeting and by the members of the eurozone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;guarantee funding for Ireland and other countries that are in a programme.  They guarantee that if we measure up, we will have the support and confidence of our colleagues.  That is the way we want to be.  The longer-term picture for this country is a return to growth, rising employment, expressions of confidence by means of deposits in the Irish banks, continuing investment from abroad and rising confidence in small and medium sized enterprises, one in five of which will be back in the employment business next year.  We require a clear focus and a steady head so we can retain our reputation and our confidence.  If Deputy Adams goes to his local furniture store in Dundalk and offers the owner half the price of a suite of furniture, I am quite sure his reputation and his integrity will suffer as a consequence.  Similarly, with this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as much as the people on trolleys and in hospital corridors, the half a million people on the dole, the thousands of young people who have been forced to emigrate and the children who cannot get special needs assistance.  The Government intends to pay a further &euro;1.25 billion to these unguaranteed gamblers and speculators.  It is not part of the memorandum of understanding.  These bonds are unsecured and unguaranteed.  Sinn F&eacute;in will do its very best to stop the Government from giving the people&rsquo;s money to these elements. <Col N="209"/> We will propose an amendment to today&rsquo;s Order of Business asking that a motion be taken.  I am giving the Taoiseach notice of it so he will have a chance to think about it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fair to say that nobody in this House blames the Government for the situation in which it finds itself today <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the bondholders.  The Government was elected with a mandate to choose to remedy the situation or to repudiate the last Government&rsquo;s agreement on this.  It has decided to do neither.  It has decided to go down exactly the same road that was adopted by the last Government.  I would like the Taoiseach to put himself into the minds of some of those traders who bought these bonds since he came into Government earlier this year.  They made a judgment.  When they looked at the market, they had to decide whether the Government would sting or burn them, or would give them a bonanza.  Let me remind the House that earlier this year some people were picking up these bonds at a price below 60 cents in the case of larger volumes.  They decided to buy because they believed the Government would sting taxpayers as opposed to buyers of bonds.  The individuals or dealers in question have made a profit of nearly 70% on the back of the Irish taxpayer.  They got it <Col N="210"/>right because, unfortunately, they measured the Government correctly.  The Taoiseach had two opportunities to act and I ask the reason he did not take them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The straightforward option was to tell the bondholders the Government would not pay.  The second option was to instruct the bank to embark on a buy-back campaign at a price of 60 cents or higher.  Why did he not do so given that he would have saved the taxpayer a fortune?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ross makes the point that the Government was elected with a very strong mandate either to remedy or repudiate the situation.  The Government sought the agreement of the European Central Bank to repudiate the situation in so far as bondholders were concerned.  The ECB refused to give its agreement or consent for such a move and did so in the most trenchant fashion, both when I spoke to Mr. Trichet and on the numerous occasions on which the Minister for Finance spoke to him.  As it was not possible to reverse the position, the Government pursued an alternative strategy based on trust, confidence, integrity and Ireland paying its way.  The consequence of this strategy has been that we have secured the support of our colleagues in Europe.  This is self-evident in the changes that have been made to the memorandum of understanding in so far as the Government&rsquo;s priority for job creation and providing incentives for employment is concerned and in the support shown by our colleagues by agreeing to a substantial interest rate reduction, one which will result in a saving for the Irish taxpayer of &euro;10 billion over the period of the programme.  It is also self-evident in the support, even at last Sunday&rsquo;s meeting, for countries such as Ireland which are in a bailout scenario.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the agenda for last week&rsquo;s meeting was focused principally on Greece, the restructuring and recapitalisation capacity for leveraging the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and future governance requirements, Ireland, as a small country that was not directly in focus &mdash; no more than Portugal was &mdash; was the recipient of very strong support from our eurozone colleagues.  The concern, which resulted in Prime Minister Berlusconi having to bring a 15-page document to the eurozone meeting, speaks for itself about the priority attached to the situation in Italy.  At the meeting, a good deal of comment was made about the potential catastrophe facing the eurozone if things were suddenly to go wrong.  From that point of view, Ireland has pursued a very steady course.  We are pursuing alternative approaches to having the burden on our taxpayers reduced.  The decision made last weekend allows for further discussions and negotiations in that respect and the Minister for Finance will pursue the matter with other Ministers for Finance.  I did not instruct the bank to buy back the bonds at a reduced rate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>As I did not hear the final part of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply, I apologise in advance if I ask a question he has already answered.  I do not accept the premise that we must seek the permission of the European Central Bank for everything we do, particularly in areas such as this.  Did the Taoiseach consult the ECB about a buy-back of Anglo Irish Bank bonds and if not, why not given that a buy-back would have saved a substantial amount of money?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">What we agreed to here was the facility made available in respect of the flexibility provided by the EFSF and that is the facility by which this issue can be pursued.   As has been pointed out on a number of occasions by the Minister for Finance, were the Anglo Irish Bank position to be captured by the EFSF and dealt with in Ireland over a longer maturity period with a lower interest rate, the savings that would accrue to the taxpayer would be substantial.  The facility agreed to last Sunday will allow that to happen.  In a situation where <Col N="211"/>we are not in control of our economic sovereignty, it is critical that the conditions we have signed up to and those we have renegotiated and changed be adhered to.  While the economic turmoil and confusion are challenging and difficult for the people, it is the longer-term picture of employment, getting out of the bailout and restoring our economic sovereignty which is at stake.  Obviously, I do not speak for bond investors on the decisions they make.  However, the flexibility allowed for will, with the continued support of our colleagues, help us through this difficult period.  I know we will get through it with our reputation and integrity intact which will in itself attract future and continued investment and support from our eurozone colleagues.</P>

I was saying, to enlighten the Taoiseach, that one bondholder is in fact a private Swiss bank which is substantially owned by the family of a Greek shipping magnate, who are bleeding dry not only the working class and poor of Greece but of this State as well.  I call for a variation of the Order of Business to allow an emergency motion that the D&aacute;il agrees that this bond should not be paid today.

	<P Just="Left">It is not agreed.  The Taoiseach is wilfully preventing a debate on this crucial issue.  He refused to allow the D&aacute;il to meet yesterday for that purpose.  Now we have Labour Party and Fine Gael Members on a walk of shame, si&uacute;l an n&aacute;ire, filing through the lobbies to prevent a decent debate.  When the Taoiseach talks about this issue he says the Government has no choice, that it has to be done.  However, he admitted today, for the first time, that this matter has nothing to do with our memorandum of understanding with the troika.  In contrast to what he said when he was elected Taoiseach, about debate, openness and involving the Opposition, this is an example of arrogance, of the Government simply refusing to allow a proper debate on this issue.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Party will not stay here for the remainder of the Order of Business.  My colleagues and I are leaving the Chamber.</P>

In other words, those who believe they are a sovereign Government are in full capitulation to people who are anonymous.  It is an incredible distortion and denial of democracy.  Therefore, the United Left Alliance Deputies, in protest against this, will leave the Chamber until 12 noon in order to mark for the Irish people that we are serious about representing their concerns in this Chamber, and in opposition to what the Labour Party and Fine Gael in Government are shamefully doing.</P>

We forced the D&aacute;il to come back this week to discuss these issues.  I do not intend to leave the Chamber, because my role is to stay and to pursue these issues with the Taoiseach.  In the context of the debate on the European summit, I ask the Taoiseach to be available to answer specific questions that arise from the summit and the issue of repaying bondholders, in respect of which he gave a commitment to the electorate.  People are frustrated and angry at the contrast between the words emanating from the Taoiseach in the past and the actions he has executed in regard to this issue.</P>

        <P>I assure Deputy Martin that I will be here for the entire debate and for the questions and answers which follow it.  We will try to deal with those questions as comprehensively as possible.  As I said in this Chamber this morning, the situation is that we have not been able to unravel the commitments entered into with external partners, particularly the ECB, in respect of these bondholders.  I made it clear there is no question of further moneys beyond what is already committed being brought into play.  While it is not an ideal situation, in the context of where we are as a country and as a people, in respect of our integrity, our competence and our reputation, and in the longer-term interests of our people in respect of employment incentives and opportunities, we are making the decision in this manner.</P>
        <P>Regarding the point made by Deputies on the right to vote, in recent months we have had more discussions about the eurozone and European issues in general than was ever previously the case.  The absent Deputy had the opportunity to put down a Private Members&rsquo; motion last week if he wished to have the matter dealt with this week, but he chose not to do so.  I am not one for hysterics and so on.  Where I come from, one stays on the pitch and fights one&rsquo;s case.  If Members opposite wish to walk out, they are welcome to do so.  I will be here to welcome them back when they return.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to have this early opportunity to brief the House on the outcome of the most recent meeting of the European Council and of the Euro Summit that took place in Brussels on Wednesday evening last.  The meetings were convened by the European Council President, Mr. Van Rompuy, to take political decisions following the useful discussions we had at the summit meetings on the previous Sunday.  A great deal of progress had been made and we met to finalise a comprehensive package to restore stability to the euro area.</P>
        <P>When I addressed the House last Wednesday before I left for Brussels, I said the stakes were very high, but I believed that, with the right political will, we could find the necessary agreement.  I am happy to be able to come back today to inform the House that though our discussions were long, they were fruitful and we now have the comprehensive deal we were working towards.  It covers all the key issues &mdash; bank recapitalisation, debt sustainability for <Col N="220"/>Greece, firewalls to prevent contagion and improved governance within the euro area.  In each area, Irish interests have been fully protected.</P>
        <P>There were two components to our meetings in Brussels.  The first involved all 27 Heads of State or Government of the European Union, gathering as an informal meeting of the European Council.  This was followed by a meeting of the 17 euro area leaders.  The purpose of the informal European Council was threefold.  First it was to brief the non-euro member states on the state of preparations for the Euro Summit to follow.  Second, it was to provide all member states, but particularly the non-euro states, with an opportunity to express themselves on the draft proposals and to underline the common resolve shared among all 27 member states to overcome the crisis together.  Third and most concretely, the meeting of 27 adopted a range of measures designed to restore confidence to the banking sector, as had been worked on by Finance Ministers at their ECOFIN Council meeting on 22 October.  Our later meeting of the 17 eurozone leaders was to finalise work on the other elements, most particularly debt sustainability for Greece, firewalls and governance.</P>
        <P>On banking, we agreed that access to term-funding, that is short-term funding available at the ECB and relevant national central banks, will be facilitated through a co-ordinated approach at EU level.  Banks will be required to increase their capital position to 9% of core tier 1 by the end of June 2012.  Where extra capital is required, this should, in the first instance, come from the private sector.  Where this is unavailable to the institution in question, national governments should step in.  Only in the last resort would the EFSF intervene in the case of banks in the euro area.  The ECOFIN Council will now adopt the necessary follow-up measures.  I am happy to report to the House that these bank recapitalisation requirements have no implications for the funding of Irish banks.  As the House will recall, the banks in this country were the subject of an extremely rigorous and independent stress testing process this spring, and the resultant recapitalisation process, painful as it was, has ensured that further strengthening of their capital positions is not now required.</P>
        <P>Each of the steps agreed last week, concerning European banks, are aimed at stabilising a system which is absolutely essential for a functioning market economy.  The real economy needs access to funds and credit.  Without functioning, solid and secure banks, confidence in the economy evaporates and without that our system grinds to a halt, with disastrous implications for jobs and for the welfare of our people.  This is a good outcome for Ireland and for the euro.</P>
        <P>A key and in many respects the most difficult element of the comprehensive package was agreement on measures to place Greek debt back on a path to sustainability.  After long discussions, including extensive contact on our behalf with industry representatives of the banks, there was agreement that a new programme would be put in place to enable Greece to return to a debt-GDP ratio of 120% by 2020.  This will be achieved through significantly deeper private sector involvement, PSI, based on a voluntary bond exchange, which was signed by the IIF with a nominal discount of 50% on nominal Greek debt which is held by private investors.</P>
        <P>Euro area countries have agreed to contribute up to &euro;30 billion, while the official sector &mdash; effectively the EFSF and IMF &mdash; have indicated a willingness to provide additional programme financing to Greece of up to &euro;100 billion.  The detail of this complex package will now be filled in, with the intention that the new programme for Greece should be agreed before the end of next month.  Mechanisms to oversee implementation will also be strengthened, though this is not intended to take away from Greek ownership of their programme.  The responsibility for its implementation rests firmly with the Greek authorities, which is, of course, as it should be.</P>
        <P>Critically from an Irish perspective, euro area leaders have reiterated that Greece requires an exceptional and unique solution.  As we did in July, euro area member states reaffirmed <Col N="221"/>their determination that each member state will honour fully its own individual sovereign debt and the Government welcomes this.  As I said to the House last week we are working our way through our programme.  Any uncertainty as to our intention to repay what we owe can only have deeply damaging consequences for our efforts to return to the markets at as early a date as is possible.  I therefore insisted that the vulnerable situation of other member states must be fully taken into account in reaching agreement, and it was.</P>
        <P>Another key consideration for Ireland was that there should be adequate firewalls in place to prevent contagion to other vulnerable member states, including ourselves.  In this regard, we agreed to extend the capacity of the European Financial Stability Facility through two basic leverage options.  The first is effectively through an insurance &mdash; credit enhancement &mdash; model; and the second is a special purpose vehicle, SPV.  The EFSF will have the flexibility to use these two options simultaneously, deploying them depending on the specific objective pursued and on market circumstances.  The leverage effect of both options will vary, but could be up to four or five.  This is expected to yield in the region of &euro;1 trillion.  That represents serious economic fire power for the EFSF.  Crucially for Ireland it represents a secure and credible firewall.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have said many times that we should neither underestimate nor under-sell the extensive range of measures which the European Union has taken in recent years to strengthen our common economic and fiscal policy co-ordination and surveillance.  The recently adopted package of six legislative measures &mdash; the so-called &ldquo;six pack&rdquo; &mdash; represents an important strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Similarly, the European semester has helped to ensure that structural reforms stay on track and are co-ordinated, including on the Stability and Growth Pact.  Further, each of the participating member states, including all euro countries, have made commitments under the euro plus pact, with the objective of improving the quality of economic policy co-ordination.  These were all necessary steps which member states are bound to implement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week&rsquo;s euro summit acknowledged something that the current crisis has brought into stark relief &mdash; that our monetary union implies a necessity for a far greater level of co-ordination and surveillance among those member states that share our common currency.  This is not for its own sake, but to ensure the stability and sustainability of our currency union.  As we have seen time and again over the past three years, what happens in one European country, particularly within the euro area, has the potential to spill over on to others.  With that in mind, we agreed to implement a series of additional measures at national level.  These measures include the adoption by each euro area member state of balanced budget rules which translate the Stability and Growth Pact into national legislation.  National parliaments, including this House, will be invited to take into account EU recommendations on the conduct of economic and budgetary policies.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>For euro area members in excessive deficit procedures, the Commission and the Council will be able to examine and adopt an opinion on national draft budgets before their adoption by national parliaments.  The Commission will also be able to monitor budget execution and suggest amendments during the course of the year.  This does not impinge on the budgetary powers and prerogatives of this House.  In respect of a country in excessive deficit procedures, a request to examine the draft budget may come and, if considered necessary, an opinion may issue.  However, it will remain for the national parliament to decide whether, and on what terms, the budget should be adopted, which is an important and necessary distinction.  Nonetheless, the provision is important and one that we should support.  When a country is in excessive deficit, its fellow members of the euro area have a heightened and entirely legitimate interest in how its national budget is managed.  If we have learned anything in recent years, it is that the decisions we take as individual member <Col N="222"/>states have potentially serious consequences for all.  As a small member state, this offers us important protection.</P>
        <P>As a further step to strengthen co-ordination and surveillance, President Barroso announced in the aftermath of the summit that Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner, Olli Rehn, would become a vice president of the Commission.  I welcome this development which should see the Commission&rsquo;s hand reinforced.</P>
        <P>The final element of the comprehensive package was agreement on ten measures to improve euro area governance.  These include regular euro summit meetings &mdash; at least twice a year &mdash; and regular meetings of the Presidents of the euro summit, the Commission and the Eurogroup.  There is a requirement for the President of the euro summit, currently President Van Rompuy, to keep non-euro member states fully informed on the preparations for and outcomes of euro summits, which again is to be welcomed.  I was among those who argued strongly that we should take the utmost care to guard the integrity of the union of 27 countries.  I would not wish to see a situation evolve where there would be two categories of membership or an arrangement of inner and outer circles.</P>
        <P>As agreed at the European Council on 23 October and as I briefed this House last week, we confirmed that the President of the European Council, working closely with the Presidents of the European Commission and the Eurogroup, would prepare a report for the December European Council on possible steps to further strengthen economic convergence within the euro area, improve fiscal discipline and deepen economic union.  As part of the report, President Van Rompuy will explore the possibility of limited treaty change.  The report is to propose a roadmap on how to proceed with these measures which will, of course, be the subject of discussion in the run-up to and at the December European Council.  A further report with proposals on how to implement any measures agreed is to be finalised by March 2012.</P>
        <P>I reiterate what I said last week on the possibility of limited treaty change, namely, that it is just that: a possibility.  As I suggested, we are approaching the work in the right order, examining what needs to be done and then how to go about it.  Where no other means are available, treaty change will remain a possibility.  I made clear my view that treaty change cannot be part of our response to the immediate crisis because it is too long and too uncertain a process.  Looking to the longer term, it is part of a spectrum of possibilities, even if one that should only ever be approached with the utmost caution, as we well know.  There remains considerable potential within the existing treaties which has not been fully explored or exhausted, a view widely shared among partners.  However, as I said previously, a small number of member states take a different view.  I look forward to hearing from President Van Rompuy in December.</P>
        <P>I would like now speak about the situation in Greece.  Last Wednesday&rsquo;s euro summit commended Ireland for its progress in fully implementing its programme, which is gratifying and welcome.  However, I reminded colleagues that although we were making headway, we had a long and difficult journey ahead of us and would need the continuing support of our partners if we were to reach our destination.  Our partners in Europe recognise that after years of decline the economy has again started to grow.  They recognise that even in a difficult international trading environment, we are exporting strongly, our competitiveness has improved markedly and the public finances have stabilised after years of disarray.</P>
        <P>I am convinced that the best thing we can do now to help ourselves is to continue to implement our EU-IMF programme in full and on time.  It is only in doing so that we will manage to return to the open markets at an early stage.  That is what I want for Ireland.  I want full economic sovereignty returned to us as soon as possible.  I have listened to those who have suggested what has been agreed for Greece is an easy ride or a sweet deal.  I point to the <Col N="223"/>political and economic turmoil in that country.  In Athens they do not think they have got off lightly.  They know that they face a long and very difficult road to recovery.  Even with the new agreement, the level of Greek debt will only be reined in to 120% of GDP in 2020 and the reality is Greece is highly unlikely to return to the open markets in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>The decision by Prime Minister Papandreou to put the terms of the new programme for Greece to the Greek people in a referendum is, of course, one for him and his government.  However, for a country in Ireland&rsquo;s position the requirement for certainty and stability is very real, which is what European leaders aimed to secure last week.  The agreement we have reached is a good one.  What is more, it was the only one available.  There should be no doubt in people&rsquo;s minds on whether another set of arrangements can easily be plucked from the air.</P>
        <P>I share the view expressed yesterday by Presidents Van Rompuy and Barroso that last week&rsquo;s agreement is the best one for Greece.  I know from my dealings with him that this view is fully shared by Prime Minister Papandreou.  I strongly support Greece in its efforts to recover, as, in turn, Greece supports Ireland.  We are partners in a union and a currency and wish each other well.</P>
        <P>We now have available to us a comprehensive package that, taken together, can enable the European Union to move beyond fire fighting a series of crises to grow the economy and get people back to work.  What we must do with urgency is implement it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week the leaders of Europe held their 14th summit devoted to the economic crisis.  Having watched events escalate to the stage where the scale of the emergency threatened the foundations of the European Union, the leaders expressed their determination to act decisively.  They announced that they were finally going to face down the crisis, prevent contagion and move the European Union towards recovery.  The challenges were clear and public expectations were high.  Emerging from the marathon session, the leaders talked about having agreed a final and decisive package which would finally draw a line under the crisis and provide a foundation for a return to growth.  The Taoiseach joined the consensus and expressed his pleasure at the outcome.  The rise in stock markets on Thursday was quickly seized upon as proof that confidence had been restored and the deal was working.  Unfortunately, the experience of other summits, in particular the July and March summits, is that a couple of day&rsquo;s figures from the stock markets are about as bad a predictor of the course of the crisis as it is possible to have.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The summit&rsquo;s 15-page communiqu&eacute; is a sobering document.  Regardless of how much one wants the deal to work, the detail gives little or no hope.  It falls short on each of the key issues.  It provides for no actions, only targets; rigidly adheres to failed policies; ignores the real causes of the crisis; does not provide funding as a firewall against future contagion and, worst of all, commits the European Union to many more months of confidence sapping negotiations.  The leaders, once again, failed to put aside narrow agendas and work together in the spirit which created and built the Union.</P>
        <P>In regard to Ireland specifically, this was the summit at which the Government of self-praised tough talkers chose to propose and negotiate nothing, not even to raise the issue of the repayment of &euro;700 million today, for which there is no justification.  For yet another summit the Taoiseach called no leader, met no leader and tabled no issue for discussion.  He sat on the sidelines waiting to find something for which he could claim credit, using his time to script brazen articles about his own record.  It was a failed summit for the European Union and Ireland.</P>
        <P>The events of the past two days were the logical outcome of a deal which was incomplete and inadequate.  The situation in Greece is not the cause of the overall crisis but its most <Col N="224"/>dramatic expression.  A core objective of the summit was to agree to a write-down of Greek debt to allow it to become sustainable.  Austerity is inevitable for Greece because of the size of its deficit but any continued austerity programme has to be based on the idea that there is an end point.  The deal fails to deliver this and that is why it is already falling apart.</P>
        <P>The summit agreed to target reaching a debt limit of 120% of Greek national income in nine years time.  This is based on growth projections from the European Commission which are widely viewed as unrealistically high.  Equally, the Commission failed to factor in the much higher ongoing cost of borrowing which Greece will face when it eventually returns to the market.  Greece does not have Ireland&rsquo;s export base and it has no ability to suddenly create growth potential during a period of austerity.  The agreed figure appears to be based on doing everything possible to avoid the ECB having to take losses on bonds it bought on the market before last year&rsquo;s bailout.  Policy on Greek debt is being driven by the demands of the ECB and not by what is needed.  The fact that the exact details of how the private bank losses on bonds will be implemented are unknown, is remarkable, given that this has been under discussion for two months.</P>
        <P>The call for a referendum is clearly motivated by the parliamentary situation and pre-election manoeuvring.  Irrespective of the motivation, Prime Minister Papandreou is faced with a deal which he cannot sell as a final answer to Greece&rsquo;s problems.  He cannot say that there is a deal which shows how his country can return to a secure level of public service delivery within the next few years.  What is required is a deeper cut in Greek debt with the ECB accepting its role in this.  Nothing else offers the possibility of a programme which can end Greece&rsquo;s sovereign debt crisis and earn public legitimacy.</P>
        <P>The parties in this House calling for an Irish referendum on our EU-IMF programme forget that this was their position in February and it was rejected.  They have also continued to refuse to show how they would fund welfare, education, health and every other public service once the lenders had been told to get lost.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Increasing the funds available for any potential future bailouts was another core objective for the summit.  The headline figure of &euro;1 trillion is at the lower end of what is required.  Given that Italy requires &euro;250 billion next year just to refinance existing debt, the new figure does not provide the definitive answer which was promised.  The detail of the communiqu&eacute; shows that the &euro;1 trillion is nothing but a general aspiration at the moment.  I refer to page six of the communiqu&eacute; which states that the existing funds will be leveraged by over four times with no extra money from any EU country, with no new basic rules and &ldquo;in the context of the agreed instruments&rdquo;.  What is actually involved is a highly risky insurance scheme &mdash; yet to be detailed &mdash; and the making of telephone calls to China, Brazil and others who might have money.  The deal is so complex and so conditional on a string of agreements with others that it is almost designed to undermine confidence rather then to build it.  The simpler and more credible approach of using the ECB to leverage national funding has been discarded, once again putting the protection of a failed policy framework ahead of doing what is necessary.</P>
        <P>As was seen in March, leaving detail to the Finance Ministers is not the same as something being a done deal.  In March, they failed completely to complete an agreement which was effectively ready in February.  They kept failing to act and thereby helped make the situation much worse so that by July another crisis summit was required.  Given this situation, leaving the finalisation of measures to ECOFIN was a bad decision.</P>
        <P>Recapitalising banks to take account of uncertainty and Greek default forms a significant part of the response this time of all 27 members and not just of the euro group.  The higher capital ratios are welcome, but it will surprise many that there is no detail provided about what <Col N="225"/>is actually involved.  The communiqu&eacute; states that private funding should be the first option followed by national governments and finally, possible loans by the EFSF to those national governments.  This is cumbersome and unclear.  It also fails to address the legitimate case for Ireland to restructure key elements of bank-related bonds.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the most depressing part of the summit&rsquo;s communiqu&eacute; relates to the section on reform and governance within the eurozone.  It is based on a flawed and blinkered understanding of the crisis.  Almost bizarrely, it fails to even mention reform of financial regulation and the institutions of the euro.  It focuses solely on fiscal control and advances a pre-crisis agenda which is already distracting the Union from the urgent business at hand.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand how the Taoiseach could have agreed the wording on page nine of the communiqu&eacute; which states, &ldquo;Pragmatic coordination of tax policies in the euro area is a necessary element of stronger economic policy coordination to support fiscal consolidation and economic growth&rdquo;.  Co-ordinating tax policy has nothing to do with this crisis; it has nothing to do with fiscal consolidation and nothing to do with economic growth.  I note the Taoiseach studiously avoided making reference to this in his own contribution to the House this morning.</P>
        <P>The control mechanisms of the eurozone, most particularly the Stability and Growth Pact negotiated during the Irish Presidency of the European Council in 1996, concentrated solely on public sector imbalances.  However, it is private sector imbalances which have caused much of the damage to the eurozone.  The ECB has fundamentally refused to operate as a normal central bank.  The fiscal problems in the United Kingdom and in the United States are worse than in the eurozone yet the crisis is not hitting them as badly.  Their central banks have embraced the role of lender of last resort and have been highly creative in finding new ways to intervene in the markets and the wider economy.  In contrast, the ECB has embraced a destructive orthodoxy, proudly seeking out ways of not acting rather than showing a real urgency or any creativity.  The support it is giving to banks and to sovereign bonds should not be seen as some exceptional actions deserving of praise because this a basic part of its job and the reluctance to go further is a tragic error.  The ECB has been behind the curve at every significant point in the crisis and remains committed to this approach.  There is no part of the deal announced last week where the ECB makes a significant contribution.</P>
        <P>What is most damaging about the flawed reform agenda which is contained in the summit&rsquo;s communiqu&eacute; is the fact that it commits member states to a process which cannot reach a positive outcome and which will involve a major loss of time exactly when we can least afford it.  The President of the Council is due to propose measures, including treaty changes, next month.  Final agreement on measures is due to be reached by next March.  This is an absurd timetable.  There can be no progress without genuine consultation between and within all member states.  There must be an opportunity to consider the real failures of the eurozone, not just the dated fiscal control agenda of a core group.</P>
        <P>The issue of reforms and potential treaty changes is one of many where the Taoiseach and Government have failed to outline or to promote their policies at this or previous summits.  The more we discuss EU matters here the greater the lengths the Taoiseach goes to avoid responding to basic questions about his policies.  Last week&rsquo;s summit marks a very significant moment in the short history of this Government.  After eight months of posturing, it finally became clear that the Government has no European agenda and that it has formally abandoned all of its pre-election commitments.  The only sentence in the 15-page communiqu&eacute; which refers directly to Ireland praises the implementation of an agreement which Fine Gael and Labour condemned and a budget which they voted against.  Otherwise, Ireland and its demands are completely absent.  As the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, revealed under pressure in this House, he sought no meetings with other leaders; he made no calls to <Col N="226"/>other leaders; he neither tabled no issues nor circulated any papers and he made no demands.  This is exactly as it has been for eight months.  In July, the Greek deal was extended to every country so the Taoiseach could rush out of the Council meeting and claim to have negotiated something, but he was not as lucky this time.</P>
        <P>Every member of this Government and every one of those sitting behind them, were elected on a commitment not to pay the full &euro;700 million Anglo bond which is being repaid today.  The Taoiseach can dress up his position in all of the brazen nonsense he wishes, but he cannot wriggle out of his own clear words.  In fact, the value of the bond collapsed in February as a result of the statements made by Fine Gael and Labour.  Yet, since then, they have done nothing to implement their commitments.  It is almost incredible the lengths to which they have gone not to burn these bondholders.</P>
        <P>A major haircut for these bondholders was a demand of the previous Government which could not be implemented because others argued that it could only happen in the context of a comprehensive deal.  The burning of junior bondholders was insisted upon and delivered upon although the Taoiseach is now writing articles claiming that he was responsible for decisions taken before he was in power.</P>
        <P>The demand to burn other bondholders was repeated in negotiations in January and February as part of the successful negotiation of the principle that Ireland&rsquo;s debt needed to be more sustainable.  Both the July deal and this one remove all previous barriers to burning these bondholders but the Government has refused even to attempt this.  The spin aside, what has happened since is a complete refusal to push something the Government claimed was fundamental when it was looking for votes.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, went to Washington after briefing RTE on how much he would do there but he did not raise this matter with the Treasury Secretary, Mr. Timothy Geithner.  He then said he would raise it in Frankfurt with Mr. Trichet, then President of the ECB, but he did not.  At the four crisis summits he attended, the Taoiseach did not table any measure that would allow for the burning of these bondholders.  He did not meet Mr. Trichet on the matter nor did he ask Mr. Draghi about it when he voted to appoint him as the new president of the ECB.  He did not raise it with his close friend, Chancellor Merkel.  He made a solemn promise, &ldquo;not a red cent more&rdquo;, which evaporated as soon as it got the votes he had targeted.</P>
        <P>During their years in opposition, the Government parties developed a very skilled political operation.  As everybody saw during the general election, they put an enormous effort into the presentation of policy rather than into its substance.  As the Taoiseach repeatedly stated, the only focus was on polling day.  In Government the parties have continued their well-oiled media operation, with an ability to hype even the most minor development and make claims which are divorced from reality.  That is how the Taoiseach can remove a net &euro;250 million from the economy and claim it as a jobs initiative.  On major issues and small ones alike, finding things to claim credit for has taken priority over actually setting out new policies.  In area after area this has been a deeply cynical, increasingly arrogant and surprisingly inactive Government.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s ridiculous article today is a classic demonstration of a Government which is self-righteous and brazen in equal measure.  Claiming credit for growth which began before one took up office takes a special brand of cynicism.  Every day Ministers industriously praise themselves for a budget they voted against and for a bank restructuring plan which was written by the late Brian Lenihan.  In February the Taoiseach stated that export-led recovery was an illusion but now he claims to have created it.  He voted for the bank guarantee in opposition and renewed it in government yet writes articles attacking it.  He lectures people about trust and reform but systematically fails to consult or to release basic information before forcing decisions through the Oireachtas.</P><Col N="227"/>
        <P>In many areas the Government&rsquo;s politics first strategy is disappointing, but in others it is very dangerous.  The failure to set out an agenda or even to talk about key issues with other European leaders is beyond doubt.  It does not matter how many Ministers the Taoiseach sends out to praise him for negotiating deals he had nothing to do with &mdash; his refusal even to try to honour a major pre-election commitment will not be forgotten.</P>
        <P>Last week&rsquo;s deal will not hold.  The only question now is whether there will be an opportunity to try again.  Everyone who believes in the European ideal hopes there will be another chance, that Greece&rsquo;s debt will be reduced to a sustainable level, the bailout fund will be finalised and sufficient and banks will have enough capital.  Most of all they hope the leaders of Europe will start to work together on a real reform agenda which learns the lessons of the crisis and helps to restore growth to much of Europe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>The outcome of last Wednesday&rsquo;s EU summit marked a missed opportunity for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government.  He, along with other EU leaders, signed off on a 50% write-down of Greek debt but today at noon, with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s support and authority, a State-owned bank is handing over a cheque for &euro;700 million to unguaranteed bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>The Government missed a clear opportunity to put the issue of Irish banking debt on the agenda and to negotiate a reduction in the billions of euro Irish taxpayers must pay to toxic bad banks and unguaranteed bondholders.  Before the election and his becoming Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny rightly criticised the logic of paying such bondholders when he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The fact of the matter is that there is now &euro;25 billion of unguaranteed bonded debt for which the Irish taxpayer is being asked to accept liability.  I think that is a crushing burden and it is something we should do something about.  In so far as Fine Gael are concerned we will seek a mandate from the people as part of our programme that we should be given the authority and mandate from the people to renegotiate this element of what is a crushing debt on our taxpayers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Sin r&aacute;iteas an Taoisigh.  In the language of Fine Gael election sound bites, this became &ldquo;not another red cent&rdquo; to bad banks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no political, legal or moral obligation on the Government to pay this debt nor was there at the time.  The Taoiseach was right then.  N&iacute; fiacha na ndaoine iad seo.  Seo fiacha amhantraithe sanntacha a bh&iacute; ag d&eacute;anamh amhantra&iacute;ochta ar an mbanc Anglo agus a chaill, ach f&oacute;s t&aacute; an Rialtas ag rith isteach agus ag tabhairt tarrth&aacute;la d&oacute;ibh.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before the summit last week, when my party raised this, the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, ruled out bringing up the issue at the summit but they were able to put forward a credible explanation for why these bondholders should be paid.  Why has the Government decided not to stand up for Ireland&rsquo;s interest?  Is it happy to receive pats on the head from the governments of France and Germany?  Cad &iacute; an strait&eacute;is?  An &iacute;, suigh siar agus a bheith ag s&uacute;il go n-oibreoidh gach aon rud amach as a stuaim f&eacute;in?  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir aon rud eile a r&aacute; faoi seo.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The pain caused by honouring this bond is unjustified as is that caused by any part of the &euro;3.5 billion in unsecured debt left in Anglo Irish Bank or Irish Nationwide.  These banks are now merged and renamed the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, a zombie bank.  The Taoiseach knows better than I that it does not have deposits, does not lend to customers and is not functioning.  Nevertheless, Irish taxpayers are being forced by this Government to endure extreme hardship by paying billions of euro of private banking debt to unguaranteed bondholders.  The refusal of the Government even to consider burden sharing with bondholders in <Col N="228"/>a defunct bank is absolutely bizarre.  There is no logic, rhyme or reason to the Government&rsquo;s decision to pursue its current course of bailing out bank bondholders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach tells the House he is powerless to do otherwise yet he sat at a negotiating table in Europe when the halving of Greek sovereign debt was agreed.  N&iacute;l an Rialtas ionraic le v&oacute;t&aacute;laithe n&oacute; leis an D&aacute;il.  Inn&eacute; agus inniu, chuir an Taoiseach stad le haon seans an obair th&aacute;bhachtach seo a phl&eacute;.  Last week the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il the Government had to oversee the payment of this bond because the previous Government had placed &euro;31 billion of promissory notes in Anglo Irish Bank.  That is neither credible nor true.  The Government would not default on the promissory notes if it ordered Anglo Irish Bank not to pay the private bondholders.  There was and is no compulsion on the Government to pay this, regardless of the disastrous decisions of Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week, members of the Government argued that this bond would be paid out, not from Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money but from the actual resources of Anglo Irish Bank.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might explain to the citizens how a bank which has received &euro;30 billion of Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money, is in full State ownership and completely insolvent, can be described as having its own &ldquo;resources&rdquo;?  Ministers also sought to link the bailing out of these bondholders with the EU-IMF deal.  On the &ldquo;Six-One News&rdquo; on Thursday, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, claimed we had the choice of either &ldquo;repudiating the programme or working the programme&rdquo; and the Government is working the programme.  As the Taoiseach conceded, this matter is not part of the programme, and certainly is not part of the memorandum agreement.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the decision of the Greek Government to hold a referendum on the EU-IMF bailout.  We call for a referendum on the memorandum agreement which the previous Government introduced after negotiation with the EU and the IMF.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government is now implementing that agreement against which it railed at the time.  The approach of the Greek Government on this issue is in marked contrast to that of our Government.  Last week the Taoiseach indicated he was prepared to accept changes to EU treaties, changes which would give Europe greater fiscal control over Irish affairs.  He refused to give assurances that any changes to EU treaties which would mean a further loss of sovereignty would be put to a referendum.  This was yet another flip-flop given that he had previously ruled out treaty change as a means of tackling the European crisis.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party gave away monetary power; the Taoiseach is poised to give away fiscal powers.  The Taoiseach said, &ldquo;I would not wish to see a situation evolve where there would be two categories of membership or an arrangement of inner and outer circles.&rdquo;  That is exactly what he is acquiescing in.</P>
        <P>The leaders of France and Germany have dithered in dealing with the crisis for months on end.  They have acted in their own national interests, rather than in the interests of citizens across Europe.  It is not acceptable that the EU approach to this European crisis is being dictated by the Prime Minister of France and the leader in Germany but not by the Taoiseach.  It is equally unacceptable that European civil servants should make decisions about budgetary matters in Ireland.  The Taoiseach needs to rule out any further loss of fiscal powers.  He needs to assure the D&aacute;il and the citizens of the country that any treaty change will be put to the people in a referendum.</P>
        <P>As I have said many times, I accept that the Government inherited the current disastrous economic situation as a result of the disastrous policies of the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government.  However, this does not excuse the Government&rsquo;s failures.  It has stuck steadfastly to the plan it inherited from the previous Government.  As a newly elected Government, it had a chance to try to renegotiate the EU-IMF deal.  It sought and, more importantly, received a mandate to go back to the European Union and the IMF to ask them to engage in such a <Col N="229"/>renegotiation.  It had an opportunity to tell the European Central Bank that Irish taxpayers would not pay the debts of gamblers and speculators.</P>
        <P>Deputy McDonald and I raised this issue recently when we met the troika on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.  Obviously, the European Central Bank has an issue with the repudiation of unguaranteed bonds.  We told them that we would not pay them.  The Taoiseach and the Minister should have told them the exact same thing, but they failed to do so.  That failure is evident in today&rsquo;s payment of &euro;700 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money to Anglo Irish Bank bondholders, while citizens languish on hospital trolleys and in dole queues and other parts of the globe.</P>

I will not remind them of what they said before the general election because my party leader has already done so.

	<P Just="Left">Who are the bondholders who are being given &euro;711 million of our money, plus interest?  Are they hedge fund speculators, as has been reported?  Did they pay knock-down prices, in the correct belief the Government would pay them in full?  Are speculators in Paris, Frankfurt and New York popping open champagne bottles to celebrate the decision of the Minister?  They must have known he was talking nonsense when he made his speech in New York.  Like the grand old Duke of York, he went to the top of the hill, but nothing happened thereafter.  They can count on him as they pop champagne bottles in celebration.  Who are the hedge fund gamblers who have made a killing on the backs of the people today?  Is Goldman Sachs involved?  It is on the list in the public domain.  Is the former Attorney General, Mr. Peter Sutherland, involved?  He told the people they should pay the bondholders.  Is his company benefiting?  Why can the Government not give the names of the bondholders to the people who are paying them?  In the absence of information, we can only presume that hedge fund speculators are having a fantastic day at the races today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to refer to the decision of the Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Papandreou, to have a referendum in that country.  Why is the Government not giving the people an opportunity to have their say on the huge burden they are facing?  A further &euro;3.6 billion in cuts will be made in the forthcoming budget.  Why did the Government decide, on the advice of the Attorney General, that the European Stability Mechanism did not have to be put to the people?  Why will the Government not publish the advice of the Attorney General?  Like my party leader, Deputy Adams, our finance spokesperson, Deputy Pearse Doherty, and other Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, I have repeatedly asked the Government to publish the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice, but it has consistently refused to do so.  The Government is not prepared to allow the people to vote in a referendum on the issue.  It is not even prepared to explain why that is the case.</P>
        <P>As a result of their protests and campaigns, it looks like the people of Greece will at least have a say on the decisions that will impact on them.  I suggest this proposition would be rejected by the peoples of Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy because it has failed.  I also expect it to be rejected by the people of Greece.  There are three aspects to the issue.  It is a question of unsustainable debt, a banking crisis that has not been properly addressed and a systemic banking failure, not at Irish or Greek levels but at European and international levels.  In the banking system there was a failure of regulation and prudence and people in countries such as Ireland, Greece and Portugal have been forced to saddle the burden.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is smiling on the other side of the House.  Since his election to this House after winning a by-election in the 1970s, he has put himself before the people to the extent that he is now the father of the House.  I take it that his commitment to politics is absolute and that he wants to see change.  Does he believe in his heart that it is fair and acceptable that the people are facing another austerity budget to pay the private debts of bankers who gambled recklessly, took advantage of failures of regulation and accountability and are now benefitting from the crisis?  Does he think it is fair that we may be forced to partially or fully privatise our assets and suffer austerity, unemployment and emigration in order to reward a system that has utterly failed the people?  I do not think he believes in his heart that that is fair.  I do not think the Minister does so either.</P>
        <P>What would be the right thing to do?  Somebody will have to take a stand at some point by saying this is crazy, unsustainable and has to change.  Who will do this?  Will it be the Minister?  Will it be the Taoiseach?  They have to ask themselves these questions.  When the Taoiseach won a by-election in the 1970s and took a seat in this House, just as the new Labour Party Deputy did today, did he think he would be in a position to see the people utterly failed?</P>

	<P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has asked to be quoted in context.  I will cite the words of the Minister in a contribution he made in the House on 15 December 2010 when he was essentially the Minister for Finance in waiting:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland&rsquo;s commitments on sovereign debt and debt under guarantee must be honoured in full.  What legal or moral compulsion is on Ireland, however, to honour in full debt incurred by Irish banks when there was no State involvement in the arrangements?  These loans were entered into freely by willing lenders and borrowers with absolutely no State participation.  The interest rate charged represented the risk at the time and there never was a State liability.  It is obscene that liability for these loans is now being transferred to the Irish taxpayer, in many respects to the poorest of the Irish taxpayers ... In the budget the Minister for Finance reduced social welfare payments, punished the blind, disabled, widows, carers and the unemployed and he taxed the poorest at work, and for what?  It was so that the taxpayer can take on liability for debts the country never incurred and arose from private arrangements between private institutions.  What a disaster and an obscenity.  How can the Government stand over it?</P>
        <P FLI="0">He continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">The latest available bank data shows that Irish guaranteed bank debt has been sold on at a discount to hedge funds in the USA, the UK and Luxembourg, as well as to smaller speculative investors ... The position has now become indefensible that the Irish taxpayer, even the poorest taxpayers, should be required to underpin the speculation of hedge fund investors.  There must be transparent, open, negotiated burden sharing of bank debt.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These are the words of a Minister for Finance of whom I would have been proud.  I believe he continues to hold these views but has made a call that the lesser of two evils is to pay the money to the bondholders.  At the start of this D&aacute;il, the Technical Group called on the Government to hold a referendum on this issue.  Understandably perhaps, it argued that we had just had a referendum, namely, the general election and it had, therefore, a clear mandate.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the mandate his Government secured was for the position articulated by his Minister for Finance while in Opposition.  If the Government now chooses to adopt precisely the opposite position, there is a strong case for putting the matter to the people again.  We have heard the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance repeatedly state on the national and international airwaves that Ireland is a country that can pay its way in the world and will pay its debts.  Every time they make this statement, they make it more difficult for the country to enter into voluntary arrangements such as those that were agreed with Greece first on senior bank debt and, more recently, on its sovereign debt.</P>
        <P>Accepting that none of us wants to pay the bondholders, what is the case for doing so?  I have heard three arguments.  The Taoiseach this morning referred to an agreement with the European Central Bank.  I have tabled parliamentary questions asking for details on the agreement.  In reply, the Minister states he is not aware of any agreement, as was alluded to by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, in a television interview with Vincent Browne.  As parliamentarians, we do not know what agreement is in place.  The language being used, however, suggests a nod and a wink.  I ask the Minister to supply to the House the details of the agreement and a cost-benefit analysis of the reason the Government has chosen this course of action.</P><Col N="232"/>
        <P>The ECB&rsquo;s initial position was that it was of paramount importance that no senior debt or sovereign debt be restructured.  Given that both types of debt have been restructured in Europe, that position no longer stands.  Further, the purported ECB threat that it would withdraw emergency liquidity assistance is not credible as to do so would achieve precisely the outcome the bank is trying to prevent, namely, the collapse of the European banking system.  It is also reasonable to argue that no one agrees with the ECB.  Ireland, for example, does not agree with it and the International Monetary Fund has stated publicly it does not agree with it.  It is ridiculous to argue, as the ECB does, that choosing not to pay &euro;715 million to people who we all accept are short-term speculative investors would collapse the European banking system.  That is not a credible position.  The Taoiseach referred to county councils this morning.  By his own admission, however, we do not know who owns the relevant bonds and, as such, we do not know who we are bailing out.</P>
        <P>I fully accept that the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance are acting in what they believe to be the best interests of the country.  However, I and other Deputies have received hundreds of e-mails from people who point out that paying the bondholders is not the mandate on which the Government was elected.  I ask the Taoiseach and Minister to reflect on that and, at a minimum, return to Parliament and lay out the pros and cons of the measure and allow the people to decide on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is our referendum on this crazy policy of bailing out bondholders and inflicting brutal austerity on ordinary people?  How can the Taoiseach justify the pre-election rhetoric of describing the bailing out of the bondholders of Anglo Irish Bank as economic treason when his Government has chosen to continue committing treason now that the election is over?  Where is his respect for democracy and the citizens of the country when the people of Greece have won the right, through protest and people power, to have a democratic vote on whether they want to continue with the crazy policy of bailing out bondholders and having brutal austerity imposed on them and he denies to the people of this country the same right?  Where is his concern for the many dozens of sick and vulnerable elderly and young people who are lying on trolleys in hospitals throughout the country as we speak, and for the communities from west Cork to Loughlinstown, Blanchardstown, Letterkenny and Roscommon who are living with the fear that, arising from the cuts the Government is inflicting on the health service, they may not have an accident and emergency service in their community if they ever have such a service?  It is shameful that while such cuts are being made, the Taoiseach is willing to hand over &euro;700 million, almost exactly the same amount as has been slashed from the health budget, to anonymous speculators and gamblers on the financial market.</P>
        <P>Where is the Government&rsquo;s analysis of developments in the eurozone?  Does it have any idea of what is taking place?  According to every serious commentator and analysis, the Government&rsquo;s strategy for achieving export-led growth is delusional because the European economy is contracting under the impact of the austerity this Government and other European leaders are imposing and more of which they are demanding be imposed across the eurozone.  The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the International Labour Organisation have both stated austerity is not working, as has the OECD.  Even the IMF has downgraded its growth projections for the European economy.  Despite these warnings, the Government continues to peddle the fantasy that Ireland will have an export-led recovery and repeatedly speaks of achieving growth.  All the facts, whether in Greece, here or anywhere else in Europe, demonstrate that imposing brutal austerity, slashing jobs and leaving large numbers of people unemployed &mdash; in our case, almost 500,000 people &mdash; have the effect of contracting <Col N="233"/>growth, deepening recession and choking off any possibility of achieving the type of recovery the Government seeks.  Notwithstanding this, it persists with the madness.</P>
        <P>There is an expression that when one is in a hole, one should stop digging, but the Government continues to dig under the diktat of the European Union, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank.  Is it not the case that the people of Greece, through people power and protest, have achieved much more than any of the European leaders at all their crisis summits with all their talk of comprehensive solutions that unravel within days because, and the Taoiseach should not, as he consistently does, misinterpret what I am saying, the Greeks have at least forced on to the agenda the idea that the bondholders should pay and be burned and also forced others to question the austerity policy that has been such a disaster for them and the rest of Europe?  Is it not also the case that people in this country should do exactly the same as people are doing on Wall Street and in Athens, Italy and many other parts of the world, namely, getting out on the streets and calling for an end to the madness?  This is a simple choice, one of deciding who comes first: the anonymous bondholders and speculators or ordinary people and their right to a job, decent public services and a future.  It is time for the Taoiseach to make the choice.  However, it seems that currently he has pinned his colours to the mast with the greedy vultures who are wrecking our society.  It is about time he remembered who put him in power.</P>

	<P>The process whereby the prime minister of a country goes to a European summit and then reports back to the national parliament is supposedly a democratic process.  What is happening here this morning is happening in parliaments all over the European Union, but far from being an exercise in democracy, it is a masquerade and a sham because the democratically elected prime ministers, presidents and finance ministers who attend European Union summits and summits of finance ministers are not the ones making the crucial economic decisions which have such serious ramifications for hundreds of millions of Europeans.  Those decisions are being made in the financial markets and the prime ministers and finance ministers of the European Union countries are slavishly bending the knee to the decisions that are made by major bankers, hedge fund operators and assorted speculators in the interest of corporate and private profit.</P>
        <P>This morning in this Parliament we have the spectacle of one prime minister, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, telling the national Parliament, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, that he does not know the identity of bondholders to whom &euro;700 million from the resources of the people of this country has just been paid on his instructions.  In the England of the 18th century and of the highwayman Dick Turpin, at least the victims of his robbery knew who was carrying it out and could look for their property back.  It is incredible that in this era of information saturation we are denied, deliberately as a matter of policy, this most fundamental information.  Shamefully, the establishment media in this State conspires with this shameful secrecy.  Shamefully and with nauseating regularity the key question put by our national broadcaster, RTE, and other broadcasting media, when querying each so-called expert and economist that they bring before them to comment on the latest measure of slash and burn by governments throughout Europe, is whether these cuts or measures which hammer the living standards and livelihoods of our people are enough to convince, reassure and satisfy the markets.  They never ask who are the financial markets or these institutions, individuals, profit-seeking corporations and speculators who wield such enormous power over the livelihoods and the societies of the people of Europe.</P>
        <P>What we have is an economic dictatorship of the financial markets in front of which prime ministers, governments and finance ministers all over Europe fall on their face.  It is in that context that we must see the referendum that is now being offered to the hard-pressed people of Greece.  The people of Greece are being given a false choice by a Greek Prime Minister <Col N="234"/>who up until now has been a messenger for the financial markets, shamefully pulverising the living standards and services of his people at the behest of those markets.  The Greek left will work might and main for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in this referendum, which is the correct thing to do.  However, that is only the beginning.  The false choice is either to vote for the savage austerity or, on the basis of capitalism and the ongoing financial markets, be plunged into a crisis where the markets taking their revenge would try to drive the Greek people back to the dark ages.</P>
        <P>We must offer a fundamental and radical alternative.  We must break the dictatorship of the financial markets, bondholders and bankers and recreate the financial system of Ireland and of Europe on the basis of public ownership, democratic control and accountability, where these institutions are then used to develop our society and invest in jobs and services to recreate a decent society for the people of Europe.  That is the alternative, rather than the savage austerity the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are imposing on our people, as if they were slaves to these unelected, unaccountable financial entities that they allow to wield such power over our people and the people of Europe.</P>

	<P>Given that the Taoiseach saw the issue of burning the bondholders as central in the months leading up to the last general election and that as late as June of this year the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, made it clear that he wanted to do the same and made an ostentatious and public announcement in that regard in the United States to RTE for all to see, I cannot understand how, at the four crisis summits he has attended, the Taoiseach has taken a very hands-off approach to this issue.  He has not shown any leadership in terms of the burning of the specific bondholders and did not meet Mr. Trichet on the issue.  It is clear that at the time of the appointment of Mr. Draghi as president of the ECB &mdash; I suggested in the House this was an opportunity for us to question both the role of the ECB and its policy position on the crisis &mdash; the Taoiseach did not raise the issue with him.  He has not raised the issue with Chancellor Merkel and last week in the D&aacute;il, the Minister for State confirmed that the Taoiseach was not putting the issue on the agenda for this summit.</P>
        <P>There has been a significant change between six or nine months ago and now, namely, the restructuring of Greek debt.  This was agreed at last week&rsquo;s summit, as were the recapitalisation plans.  This creates an opportunity for Ireland to place the restructuring of its bank debt on the table, and specifically this issue.  All along, the ECB would have said that would cause contagion and collapse.  We do not have the details of what is involved because the communiqu&eacute; is lacking in detail, but has the Taoiseach not shown a singular lack of leadership on the restructuring issue by his failure to put it on the agenda of the summit?  Why did he decide not to put it on the agenda and why has he decided not even to pursue the issue?  This question is not about not doing it.  The Taoiseach said he would do it, but he did not.  However, he did not even try to do it.  Why did he not even try to do it?</P>

	<P>Not one cent more is going in than what was already committed.  I said this morning that it was not possible for us to rearrange this particular deal, which was done by the previous Government, without the consent of the ECB.  I am going to quote something I think the Deputy should hear.  It comes from the late, lamented Brian Lenihan, speaking in this House in November 2010 and it is about the issue of senior bondholders not being in the memorandum of understanding.  He said the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">There has been much commentary about the need for senior bondholders to accept their share of the burden of this crisis.  I certainly raised this matter in the course of the negotiations, and the unanimous view of the ECB and the Commission was and is that no programme would be possible if it were intended by us to dishonour senior debt... The strongly held belief among our European partners is that any move to impose burden sharing on this group of investors would have the potential to create a huge wave of further negative market sentiment towards the eurozone and its bank system.  That apprehension was confirmed by Professor Honohan in an interview last Monday, when he said there was no enthusiasm in Europe for this course of action... There is simply no way that this country, whose banks are so dependent on international investors, can unilaterally renege on senior bondholders against the wishes of the ECB.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the ECB rejected the issue.  As it is not in the memorandum of understanding, we are still locked into the commitments that were entered into at the highest level by the Deputy&rsquo;s Government with our external partners.  That is a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That will not wash.  The Taoiseach said he would do &ldquo;X&rdquo;, but he did nothing.  He did not even try.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s assertions that this matter was not raised are patently false.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>No they are not.  The Minister said before the House last week that it would not be raised at the summit.  It is incredible to be hearing this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before he took up his job with the ECB, Mr. Draghi already repeated that there would be no change in European Central Bank policy towards this matter.  He also repeated that the European Central Bank would continue to buy where necessary and to whatever extent required to put the firewall facility of the EFSF in place.</P>
        <P>The Deputy seems to be asserting that I can dictate every item of the agenda and that I spend my time going around Europe meeting the leaders.  Unlike much of what went on in the past, the Ministers of this Government attend their meetings and I spoke to them all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is interrelated.  It gave the Taoiseach his first and only opportunity to do something about this since the original crisis arose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;every other country raised issues relevant to their own need.  The point I made on behalf of Ireland was that while the focus was not on Ireland, where they say we are proceeding with confidence, which we are, and that our reputation is in tact, which it is, people should still not lose sight of the fact that we still need assistance and encouragement.  It is in those areas where we have taken a different route to have the overall debt burden reduced on our citizens, and this is paying dividends.  As the late former Minister said, if we acted unilaterally here, there would not be agreement on an interest rate reduction.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>Hundreds of people have sent emails to TDs and Senators, appealing to them not to support the payment of this money today.  There is massive interest among the Irish people in this.  In that context, I would like the Taoiseach to tell us two things.  What is the rationale for the ECB insisting we pay these unsecured bondholders today and that we pay &euro;1.2 billion in January and a further &euro;2.5 billion in 2012?  How does the ECB define contagion?  How does it define the impact this might have in Europe?</P>
        <P>Can the Taoiseach tell us who are these bondholders?  We have hedge fund speculators who have purchased these bonds from the original bondholders at a knock down price and have now benefitted from the Government&rsquo;s decision to allow this to be paid.  If the Taoiseach cannot tell us who these bondholders are, can he please tell us what legal barrier is in the way of him sourcing this information and putting it into the public domain?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Taoiseach, you have a right to reply at the end, so I would like you to keep your answers brief if possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The rationale of the ECB is that if we do not pay our way, we default and if we default, we have a real problem and we will cause a real problem.  We do not want to go that route.  Our mandate is to sort out the mess that we inherited and follow a programme and a pattern of growth.  That is not easy to shift.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not an answer.  Why are they saying we should pay?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When we enter into commitments, we are expected to honour our commitments.  That is part of the agreement worked out last Wednesday by the 27 member states and the 17 eurozone states.  It is also relevant that the ECB has forked out &euro;150 billion for Irish banks and that it continues to provide finance that pays nurses, garda&iacute;, public servants and everybody else.  It has also extended that from short-term funding to 12 month funding.  The rationale is that if we do not pay, we ruin our reputation and destroy the possibility of continued further investment in here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I listened to Deputy Boyd Barrett, who has vacated the House since making rather hysterical comments about having an export growth policy.  Clearly, exports account for 100% of our GDP.  Is the Deputy seriously suggesting that we should not continue to grow exports on an island nation where one element of the growth of our economy is critically dependant on exports?  The other element is to stimulate our indigenous economy.</P><Col N="238"/>
        <P>I cannot tell the Deputy who are the bondholders.  I do not know who they are.  There is some anecdotal evidence of the categories of bondholders, be they pension funds, hedge funds or whatever.  That is the nature of the bond market.  They buy and sell on a regular basis.  I do not know the names of the individuals.  A deep analysis could give us the category of those who purchase these bonds and sell them on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen Donnelly</NameTxt>
	<P>On the previous point, the emergency liquidity assistance does not pay our public sector bills but remains within the banking sector.</P>
        <P>I have two questions which are based on the so-called agreement with the ECB, which Members on this side of the House do not get.  What does the Taoiseach think would happen if we decided not to pay short-term speculators $1 billion?  Does he believe the ECB would try to pull back the emergency liquidity assistance?</P>
        <P>There has been a lot of talk about reputation from both the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  Who does the Taoiseach think this reputational issue is with?  With regard to the markets, we are already at junk status.  The Minister, in a speech he gave on 15 December last, laid out the rationale that paying this money would worsen our status in the markets.  Clearly, paying this money worsens our reputation.  Is it for the sake of foreign corporates that are considering investing here?  Colleagues I have spoken to in these foreign corporates cannot understand what we are doing; they have absolutely no idea why we are doing this.  It does not seem to be for foreign direct investment reasons.  Is it for the international media?  Again, those I speak to in the international media cannot understand why we are doing this.</P>
        <P>The first question is what the Taoiseach thinks would happen if we do not pay this bond, and the second is with whom our reputation would be damaged were we to stand up and refuse to pay, as Deputy Noonan put very well in his speech on 15 December last.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said that one of the issues at the summit was that of contagion.  Does he accept that so-called contagion, as it relates to Italy and Spain, is not an uncontrollable disease, but the threatened actions of financial speculators who would take the opportunity to blackmail the people of Italy and Spain by implementing usurious interest rates because of their control of the financial markets?  Does he see any contradiction in the supposedly democratically elected leaders at EU summits jumping to the diktats of private institutions in the financial markets which dictate economic policy, savage austerity policies and cuts in services?  Is there not a massive contradiction there?  Does the Taoiseach not think it is a vile system that sees, today, the speculators who bought Anglo Irish Bank bonds on the secondary or tertiary markets walking away with perhaps &euro;300 million in profit on the backs of the Irish people?  Does he not think this is a vile system that needs to be fundamentally remade?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>For the information of Deputies, Prime Minister Papandreou wrote to me and said in the course of his letter:</P>
        <P LI="1">As you are aware, the domestic, political and social situation in Greece is particularly tense and critical.  The Greek Government considers these decisions of historical importance for the country and the Greek people.  However, all opposition parties are absolutely and intensely opposed to the Government&rsquo;s policies and have fiercely and publicly rejected the October 26 decisions.  General strikes, occupations of public buildings, shutting down the Ministry of Finance, disrupting the educational process in schools and universities, demonstrations, violent clashes in Athens and other cities, have become an everyday occurrence.</P><Col N="239"/>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy raised two questions about what might happen if we did not pay this.  It is a valid question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We said all of these things six months ago and pointed out the inconsistency of the Government&rsquo;s position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of options would be open to the ECB if Ireland were to refuse to pay the bond in question.  It could, for instance, increase the interest rate, which would result in substantial difficulty for this country.  It could lend at a higher rate than 1.5% to banks that it felt were overly dependent on central banks, and that would have an absolutely devastating impact on Irish banks and on the wider Irish economy.</P>
        <P>Deputies are aware that Irish banks can borrow at present from the ECB at 1.5%, and the only other option would be to seek this funding through customer deposits, for which the bank pays 4%.  That is one central issue.  The ECB could raise the interest rate if we decided not to pay, which would have even worse consequences than paying the bond.</P>
        <P>Deputy Donnelly asked a legitimate question about reputational damage.  There are a number of areas in which this applies.  The first is foreign investors.  As the Deputy is aware, there have been investments in Bank of Ireland, and banking deposits are starting to grow here, but in addition, the foreign direct investment line in the country is strong because potential investors in business see this as a country with a clear view and with certainty attached to its decisions &mdash; a country that knows where it is going.  Second, there is the attitude of the EU institutions and authorities to a country that has a clear focus on where it wants to be and how it intends to get there.  That is important from their perspective in working with us here in Ireland.  Third, and most important, we expect to return to the markets by mid-2013, and the market reaction to a country such as Ireland, which wants to get out of the bailout situation as quickly as possible, is absolutely fundamental.  That market reaction would not be favourable if the country were jumping from one situation to the next.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have made a clear set of decisions and we intend to follow that through.  Greece, on the other hand, faces ten to 15 years of austerity programmes, as Prime Minister Papandreou has outlined for me here.  We certainly do not want to see that in our country for our people.  We want to follow a growth pattern in which we get the 440,000 who are on the live register back to work and enable them to play their part with dignity and respect for their own localities and for the general economy.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why the findings and conclusions not only from my own contribution but from others have been inserted into the agreement that was reached for guaranteed funding even when a country ends its programme, provided it continues to meet the conditions.  That is the guarantee of our future.  As has been pointed out, the extension of money on a longer-term basis is also critical.  I know the Deputies do not agree with the Government on many issues.  It is not a situation we like to be in, standing up and saying: &ldquo;You have to meet the requirement of this bond.&rdquo;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Major organisations do not agree with the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We must look at the longer-term view for our country and reduce the overall debt burden by alternative methods.  That is where we are making progress.  It would not have been possible to have a &euro;10 billion reduction in interest rates if we had been acting the mick with our European partners.  Of the four Heads of Government meetings I have attended, this was the first at which there was a focus on the real issues &mdash; the state of the Greek debt and what we could do to prevent this contagion from spilling over into other countries with potentially catastrophic consequences not just for Europe but globally &mdash; and a decision to provide <Col N="241"/>the vehicles to leverage that and deal with it in a comprehensive fashion.  Stability and confidence are necessary for this.</P>
        <P>I hope as much as anyone that stability and calm will return to Greece as soon as possible.  Now, we move from this debate to the question of the eurozone with which the Minister, Deputy Noonan, will deal.  However, I was asked a question earlier by Deputy Ross, who is not present.  He asked why Anglo Irish Bank did not buy back bonds when they were at a cheaper rate.  The answer is that Anglo Irish Bank and the State did not have the cash reserves to engage in buying back bonds because every cent the bank had was on loan from the European Central Bank.  To engage in buying back bonds at an earlier date would have involved even more borrowing from the ECB and it is not in the business of lending to the State or banks to buy back their own bonds.  That is the answer to the question which I forgot to answer when he put it to me.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, given the crisis within Europe at the moment &mdash; we all acknowledge that it is a severe crisis &mdash; the allocation of 15 minutes at the end of a debate such as this does not reflect the seriousness of the situation and it is unacceptable.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is like coming to the cinema long ago, the big picture was first and we are back to the cartoons now, with no offence to Deputy Michael McGrath.  We will do our best.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the latest developments in the euro area and, in particular, to update D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the outcome of last week&rsquo;s euro area summit.  To improve the functioning of monetary union will require national parliaments to increasingly take into account the euro area dimension in their day-to-day business.  Therefore, today&rsquo;s statements on recent euro area developments are both timely and appropriate.  As everyone in the House is aware, the euro area sovereign debt crisis has been ongoing for almost two years now.  However, the crisis has moved up a gear in recent months, especially since the summer.  While the euro area does not have a monopoly on public debt problems, unfortunately the region has been the focus of constant market attention.</P>
        <P>Since it is often overlooked, it is worthwhile pointing out that EU policy has responded well since the crisis began.  Among other things, I am referring to the establishment of crisis resolution mechanisms, the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, to help vulnerable member states.  It has also brought forward an improved governance structure and the new European semester.  Notwithstanding these important developments, the perception remained that policymakers were behind the curve and had not fully grasped the scale of the problem.  However, a quantum leap forward was taken last Wednesday in the form of the comprehensive, integrated strategy, although the situation remains fragile, as is evidenced by the markets&rsquo; reaction to the announcement by the Greek authorities to hold a referendum on the strategy.  Nevertheless, the co-ordinated approach clearly demonstrates that the EU can unite and work in the interests of all.  This shows that the European Union is strong and can make significant decisions and progress that, not so long ago, would have been seen as almost unthinkable.  We can all take encouragement from this.</P>
        <P>I wish to outline the key elements of the comprehensive strategy before outlining what I envisage to be the main implications for Ireland.  The need to put the Greek public finances on a sustainable path was of paramount importance.  The agreed approach, which involves appropriate burden-sharing between the private and official sectors, seeks to reduce the stock of Greek public debt to 120% of GDP by the end of the decade.  To achieve this, the banking sector has agreed to shoulder some of the burden through participation in a voluntary 50% write-down of its holdings of Greek government paper.  If Greek debt was reduced to 120% of GDP by 2021 it is unlikely that it would get back into the markets, but under the sustainability profile drawn up by the IMF and the European authorities, this is the most benign scenario.  The outlying malign scenario is that the Greeks would not arrive at 120% of GDP until 2027.  Let us imagine an austerity programme stretching from 2011 to 2027 &mdash; a further 16 years of <Col N="243"/>it.  This underlines how deep Greece is in crisis and why the Government there is under such pressure at the moment.</P>
        <P>Euro area leaders also agreed to fund a new EU-IMF programme for Greece that will be put in place by the end of the year.  The amount of funds from the official sector will be approximately &euro;100 billion.  The Greek authorities will also contribute to reaching the debt target through ongoing fiscal consolidation, privatisation and structural reforms.</P>
        <P>The Greek situation is a key part of the current difficulties and a credible solution is in all of our interests, including those of us in Ireland.  It is inevitable that the involvement of the private sector in resolving the Greek situation has led to similar demands here.  Nevertheless I emphasise, as the Taoiseach has done already, that the restructuring of its public debt will be no panacea for Greece.  In fact, the harsh austerity measures and the conditions affecting the sovereignty of Greece which must complement the new adjustment programme will have serious implications for the living standards of the Greek people for the foreseeable future.  This was underlined in the quotation from the letter of the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Papandreou which the Taoiseach has put on the record.  These austerity measures and other conditions are a great deal more severe than anything that we in Ireland have experienced or will experience.  This fact is ignored by those who call for a default in Ireland.  That is not the way forward, it is the way over the cliff and towards a total crisis.</P>
        <P>In addition, there is the crucial issue of reputational damage.  To renege on our commitments would have major adverse implications for our international reputation and could seriously harm our prospects of attracting inward foreign direct investment and trading our way to recovery.  This brings up a final critical difference between the two economies in this regard that relates to the importance of international trade.  In Greece, exports amount to the equivalent of 20% of its GDP, whereas the figure is more than 100% of GDP in Ireland.  Any move towards a structured or unstructured default may have severe negative consequences for the exports that drive our economy and for its long-term health.  Equally, any reneging on our commitments would necessitate eliminating the primary budget deficit almost immediately.  In other words, it would be disastrous and the effects would be felt by every man, woman and child in this country.</P>
        <P>I am keen to be absolutely clear in this regard: the Government will not go down that road.  The Government is acutely aware of the great burden that has been placed on Irish citizens but our strategy is growth, not default.  We aim to promote growth by working to try to improve the terms and conditions of banking-related debt, in agreement with our external funding partners, in order to reduce the overall burden of debt.</P>
        <P>We have already done a great deal to renegotiate the programme agreed by the last Government.  As I have stated previously, the Government is renegotiating the programme in phases.  The first phase of the renegotiation involved the restoration of the minimum wage to what it was before the Government reduced it.  The agreement contained other measures as well.  We secured an extra year for the readjustment and it is now up to 2015 rather than 2014.  We are allowed to bring down the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% with a particular focus on the tourist industry.  Everyone agrees that this impacted on tourist numbers during the summer months.  We will continue to promote the tourism industry.  At the Heads of Government meeting in July, the Taoiseach finally completed our renegotiation of the interest rate.  The effect of the interest rate renegotiation will involve &euro;10 billion off the debt during the period of the loans.</P>

        <asker> Deputy Michael Moynihan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</askee>
        <Quest>  the progress he has made on the issue of a European wide milk quota to alleviate the pressure of a super levy on dairy farmers here; the steps he has taken in securing a butterfat correction quota increase of 1.5% and 2%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[32328/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>To be fair to Deputy Moynihan, he has raised this issue with me repeatedly in the House and outside it.  He has similar priorities to me.  We both have a concern that the Irish dairy industry may be subject to super levy fines next year if we are not careful.</P>
        <P>Last year we narrowly avoided the imposition of fines.  Many people made a lot of money last year by being over quota and we were lucky to avoid super levy fines.  By mid summer this year I was concerned about the fact Ireland was more than 5% over quota for the time of year.  We have been sending out consistent messages since then that it will be very difficult to get any political flexibility from other European countries to allow Ireland to produce over quota.  That has proven to be the case.</P>
        <P>As I stated in this House repeatedly, we have had bilateral meetings with Denmark, the Netherlands and, more recently, France, when there was a meeting with the Minister in Paris.  Most recently, at the last Council meeting I had a bilateral meeting with my German colleague who happens to come from Bavaria and outlined in no uncertain terms why this was an important priority issue for me.</P>
        <P>The last thing we want to do is fine progressive dairy farmers who are planning for expansion, growth and investment post-2015.  My German colleague took my concerns on board but did not give any indication that Germany was in a position to support what is currently the only item on the table, namely the butterfat correction which would allow Ireland to produce between 1.7% and 2% more milk this year and still be under quota.</P>
        <P>We are still being frustrated in our attempts to get common agreement amongst Council members and Ministers.  We will continue to pursue the issue.  In the meantime I need to send a very strong signal to farmers that they need to operate within quotas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  It is a major issue at farm gates.  I hear stories every day of the week about people who have ceased milk production and dried off stock they have invested huge amounts of money in over the years.  As the Minister said, such people are often progressive dairy farmers who are trying to make sure they are on the curve when quotas are abolished and the new system is introduced post-2015.  They are currently at a huge disadvantage.</P>
        <P>During the last Priority Questions a month or six weeks ago the possibility that butterfat could be adjusted was discussed.  The issue seems to have receded.  Some of the main players in Europe are reluctant to re-enter negotiations.  However, some countries are hugely under quota.  Ireland is hugely over quota.  There are arrangements in place between dairy farmers.  We have to apply huge pressure to correct the butterfat situation.</P><Col N="245"/>
        <P>Post 1 January 2012 there will be a new presidency of the European Union.  Perhaps the issue could be introduced to the agenda as a priority issue at the meeting of the Council of Ministers on agriculture or various other levels.  The Minister stated he held discussions with various Ministers.  He held discussions with the German Minister since the last Priority Questions, who will not negotiate.  Are other like-minded countries in the same position as Ireland or will they be on 31 March?</P>
        <P>Everybody has to advise people to stay within quota.  Decisions that affect people staying within quota were taken at dairy farm level two or three years ago.  I ask the Minister to outline to the House the possibilities when the new presidency takes over on 1 January.  What partners do we have in Europe to push the agenda forward?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Even if a deal was done on butterfat correction it would only give us 2% flexibility.  We are still above that rate, even though farmers have cut back significantly.  It does not solve our problem but eases it somewhat.  Any solution should not reward people for being massively over quota.  People who have been careful and planned responsibly for expansion to operate within the quota system should not be at a disadvantage.  The idea that we would fine people for planning for expansion but who produce slightly over quota is something we need to try to avoid and we are trying to do that.</P>
        <P>The conversation I had with the Deputy on seeking a butterfat correction is still on the table and on the agenda for a number of countries, in particular Denmark and the Netherlands.  Other countries were fined last year and supported us strongly.  A number of new member states, in particular Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, see opportunities pre-2015 in terms of increasing dairy output.</P>
        <P>A minority of countries in the Council would support us on this issue.  Even France is willing to consider it in an effort to try to be helpful.  The German Minister has not ruled it out but has outlined why it would be difficult for her to do it and sell it to German farmers and unions.  We are endeavouring to try to make progress.  The message to farmers must be clear.  We need to reduce output to try to remain within quota if we are to avoid fines.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</askee>
        <Quest>  if he will recognise the traditional rights of fishermen of Inver Bay, County Donegal, to use draft ring net fishing as an artisanal fishery and to ensure they can continue to fish mackerel and sprat as they have done for over 100 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[32418/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have only in recent days become aware of issues in regard to pelagic draft net artisanal fishing in Inver Bay, County Donegal following a letter and supporting documentation submitted by a fisherman late last week.  I am very supportive, in principle, of providing for the reintroduction of traditional fishing methods around the coast, subject to ensuring that such methods are in compliance with EU regulations and do not adversely impact on other fish stocks, particularly wild salmon.</P>
        <P>I will seek the advice of the Marine Institute on the possible unintended impacts of this method of fishing.  In that regard, I will seek the views of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, who has responsibility for salmon conservation, on the issues involved.  I am advised that there appears to be no barrier to fishing for mackerel, herring and sprat using pelagic draft ring net artisanal fishing methods, subject to using the legal and mesh size and having applied for and received an authorisation in respect of herring.</P><Col N="246"/>
        <P>The waters off the north-west coast are the subject of an EU cod recovery plan and additional EU technical conservation measures to protect cod, haddock and whiting.  These regulations restrict the fishing gear and mesh size that may be used in the north west.  These EU regulations do not apply to pelagic fishing where standard pelagic trawls are used with a mesh size of 55 mm or less.</P>
        <P>I am aware that sprat are targeted in the bays of the north west by small trawlers using mid water pelagic nets.  These boats also fish sprat further offshore in the area between St. John&rsquo;s Point, Bundoran and Doorin.  The occurrence of sprat shoals is dependent on many things.  The population is subject to wild fluctuations and a strong year class may occur every fourth year or so.  Its survival may depend on many physical environmental features and the number of predators.  In this case, it will be necessary to establish that the mesh size is in conformity with the provisions of the EU transitional conservation measures for the north west.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P>My Department advertised in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in November 2010 for applicants for herring authorisations in the north west for 2011.  If a fisherman did not make an application at that time, he or she would not have been issued with a herring authorisation.  Other than the requirement for an authorisation &mdash; assuming that the fisherman is using a mesh size permitted under the EU transitional conservation measures for the north west &mdash; there is no preclusion in place to fishing for herring using a draft ring net.</P>
        <P>I am currently reviewing the management arrangements for Irish herring fisheries.  In June my Department asked the industry for its views and I am currently considering its responses in the context of the information on participation in the various fisheries being prepared by my Department.  During the period of consultation which took place, artisanal fishermen from Inver Bay, County Donegal did not communicate to my Department the issues in respect of their specific fishery.  Having recently received such a submission, I am happy to give it due consideration.  However, there is nothing currently in place to prevent such fishermen catching herring once they have applied for and received a specific authorisation and subject to the mesh size being in compliance with EU regulation.</P>
        <P>In Autumn 2010 my Department engaged in a comprehensive consultation process regarding the mackerel fisheries, including advertising in national newspapers.  The arrangements put in place to support fishing for mackerel by boats under 18 m  &mdash; as set out in section 6 of &ldquo;Determination (No. 17) of the Need for an Authorisation for Certain Fish Stocks&rdquo; &mdash; permit the catching of mackerel based on a monthly limit set following consultation with industry representatives.  As for the other pelagic fisheries, the mesh size to be used for mackerel must be in conformity with EU regulation.  I assure the Deputy of my commitment to have the technical issues relating to this gear type examined and to advise the applicant in respect of the fisheries in which he has expressed an interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his positive reply.  I tabled this question because fishermen in Inver Bay who use traditional methods which have been in place there for over 100 years have been placed under severe pressure, particularly by the regional fisheries board.  This is because &mdash; perhaps both fortunately and unfortunately &mdash; the bay is partly formed by the estuary of a river in which salmon spawn.  The regional fisheries board has tried to claim that the individuals to whom I refer are also fishing for salmon when they are out trying to catch sprat and mackerel.  However, they use completely different gear to fish for the latter and, therefore, the chances of their catching salmon are practically non-existent.  It is important that the type of fishing in which they are involved should be recognised as a traditional method.  I understand there is precedent in this regard because a type of gillnet fishery <Col N="247"/>exists in west Cork.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is going to consult the Marine Institute and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte.  I look forward to a positive outcome in respect of this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are trying to be constructive with regard to this matter.  If we can facilitate fishermen who use traditional methods, particularly in respect of specific stocks which fall outside the TAC system, I would be extremely anxious to do so.  Many restrictions are imposed on those involved in fishing in the context of effort, stocks, quotas and the tonnage that applies in respect of their boats.  If we can facilitate some flexibility in respect of allowing the use of other methods of catching fish which do not impact on vulnerable stocks, then I would be anxious to encourage this.  However, we must ensure that we do our homework properly.  The last thing I want to do is provide an indication that it is fine for fishermen to invest and commence fishing and then be obliged to clamp down on their activities in six months time as a result of a decision made by the European Commission.  What we do must remain consistent with the rules and the law.  The reply I have given the Deputy is initial in nature and it suggests that significant opportunities exist if people want to pursue them.</P>

        <Quest>  his negotiating position in relation to the 2014 reference year and 2011 activation clause set out in Commissioner Ciolos&rsquo; Common Agriculture Policy proposals in early October.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[32329/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This question relates to the specific issue of the use of 2014 as a reference year for the new CAP proposals in respect of single farm payments.  The Deputy will be aware that in advance of the publication of the European Commission&rsquo;s document on reform of the CAP, a great deal of concern was expressed to the effect that 2014 would be used as a reference year.  That concern was realised when the document in question was published.  In the period between the commencement of the lobbying effort in respect of this matter and the publication of the document, my officials and I engaged in intensive lobbying of the cabinet of the Commissioner on Agriculture and Rural Development.  We indicated that what is proposed would give rise to major problems in Ireland and that we are extremely concerned that there would be a land grab prior to 2014 if the reference year was set in the future rather than &mdash; as has traditionally been the case &mdash; in the past.</P>
        <P>There was partial acceptance of the argument we put forward because the Commission added a new section which stipulates the inclusion of 2011 as a &ldquo;tie-back&rdquo; year.  In other words, if a farmer has eligibility in the proposed reference year of 2014, he or she can only be eligible for the single farm payment in the future if he or she made some claim for that payment in 2011.  This is designed to stop people from outside the agricultural community coming in and buying up large tracts of lower value land in an effort to secure payments indefinitely into the future.  In essence, the problem has still not been resolved.  I remain concerned that in the build up to 2014 the leasing and conacre markets and, potentially, the afforestation market may be affected by the setting of the reference year in the future rather than the past.</P>
        <P>Farmers should recognise that this issue remains the subject of much discussion.  In that context, I encourage people not to make investment or long-term leasing decisions on the basis of the current reference year of 2014 or the current tie-back year of 2011.  A great deal of negotiation remains to be done in respect of this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Regardless of the complexity of legislation emanating from Brussels, it is amazing how quickly individuals interpret it in order to identify the difficulties which might arise for them.</P><Col N="248"/>
        <P>The Minister referred to entitlements to single farm payments.  I understand that the document published by the European Commission stipulates that an entitlement must be established.  The difficulty I perceive in this regard is that some farmers &mdash; for family reasons or whatever &mdash; leased out their lands to third parties during the period leading up to 2005 or 2006.  Thereafter, perhaps as a result of the death of a parent or for some other reason, a son or daughter may have returned to the family holding and begun farming the land in question.  However, the entitlements relating to such lands remained with those who leased them during the period 2000 to 2002, inclusive.  As a result, a farmer may have submitted a single farm payment application in respect of land of this kind but no entitlement would have been activated in respect of it because no such entitlement existed.  What would be the position of such a farmer in respect of the proposed reforms?</P>
        <P>There is a second matter about which I am concerned.  As a result of the fact that there would have been no perceived financial gain from submitting an application for a single farm payment, a person who returns to take over his or her parents&rsquo; farm and who bought stock and placed it on the land in 2006, 2007 or 2008 could not have activated an entitlement because no application was made.  As per the wording provided in the European Commission&rsquo;s document, those in the two instances to which I refer would not have activated an entitlement in 2011.  This assumes that the wording relating to 2011 and 2014 will stand when the negotiations are concluded.  There are two groups of people, particularly those with difficult family circumstances, who would not be included under the Commission wording.  Is there anything that can be done for these individuals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy makes a valid point.  There is also a third group of people affected and this comprises those who have entered farming for the first time.  I refer to those who are serious about active farming rather than those who are buying land in order to lease it out and obtain payment in respect of it in the medium term.  The people in the third group to which I refer will not have an entitlement in the current year, 2011, but may well be actively involved in farming in the reference year of 2014.  We must facilitate active farmers who are working the land in the context of the choice of any new reference year.  That fact is accepted by many of my counterparts in Europe with whom I have discussed this issue.  To date, the focus has been on those who have existing leases on land, those who traditionally rented land and those who leased land under the conacre system &mdash; either from their neighbours or someone else &mdash; over a period of years and the fact that they would have obtained entitlements in respect of such lands.  The main concern in this regard relates to the leases in question being broken by their landlords in order that they might maximise their own entitlements.  We could not possibly agree to any package whereby those who are actively involved in farming and who are working land in respect of which entitlements should apply would be prevented from obtaining such entitlements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan raised this matter with me on the previous occasion on which I was present for Question Time.  I am of the view that the reply I intend to provide is much more complete than that which I delivered on the occasion in question.</P>
        <P>Applicants must declare all the land they farm in the particular year for the single payment scheme and the disadvantaged area scheme, be it owned, leased or rented.  If, in addition, a farmer is a participant in REPS 4 and has a turbary right, he or she can obtain REPS payment on the turbary plot provided it is declared on the annual SPS application form and he or she has included it on his or her REPS 4 plan.  Normally, land used for turf cutting, whether owned, rented, leased or the subject of traditional turbary rights, is declared as &ldquo;other&rdquo; or &ldquo;bog&rdquo; on the single farm payment application.  Such land is not eligible for payment under the single payment scheme or the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has primary responsibility for protection of special areas of conservation, SACs.  Certain activities are restricted within SACs and can only be carried out with the consent of that Department.  These notifiable actions vary depending on the type of habitat that is present on the site.</P>
        <P>Where a farmer cuts turf on a bog plot where cutting is prohibited, he or she is liable to be penalised under cross-compliance if the non-compliance comes to light during a cross-compliance inspection or is cross-reported to my Department from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The two key elements in cross-compliance are the requirement for farmers to comply with 18 statutory management requirements set down in EU legislation on the environment, food safety, animal health, welfare, plant health and a requirement to maintain the farm in good agricultural and environmental condition.</P>
        <P>The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom the statutory management requirements or good agricultural and environmental conditions apply.  If an applicant is found to be non-compliant, sanctions are provided for in the governing EU regulations and those sanctions will be applied to the single payment scheme, disadvantaged areas scheme and REPS 4.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Next April, if a farmer in receipt of a single farm payment cuts turf, as has been done for hundreds of years, but the land is not declared in his or her single farm payment applications, will he or she be affected?  If so, what financial penalties would be involved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I read that legalistic answer so that it would be on the record for the Deputy, as he has asked for it several times.  SACs have been in place since 1997.  Raised bogs in such areas are protected.  Ireland got a ten-year derogation from ending turf cutting on those raised bogs.  Since 2007, we have been giving assurances to the European Commission that we will be consistent with the directives and stop cutting turf in SACs with sensitive raised bogs.  The previous Government agreed to this.  The European Commission has gone to court and won the case to enforce this.</P>
        <P>If people are deliberately breaking the law, then there will be consequences from a cross-compliance point of view.  That is how the system works.  Deputy Flanagan is a talented communicator in this House.  I encourage him to find workable solutions for the difficult situation of turf cutting in SACs that will be within the law.  It might involve compensation or relocation of turbary rights.  Instead of protest and inciting anger in people, I appeal to Deputy Flanagan <Col N="250"/>to talk to the Minister who is proactive in this area to find an acceptable solution in what is a heated and difficult discussion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>What would the Minister call one of his party&rsquo;s Deputies who got elected for saying he would sign his name in blood to oppose turf cutting bans?  If that is not incitement, what is?</P>
        <P>It should be clear to the Minister and to the Government that the ten-year derogation never existed.  Fine Gael Deputies have said so in the media on many occasions.  In fact, they claim there was a nod and wink to Europe but no official derogation.  The Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, for which I am public relations officer, is attempting to find a solution.  I will be in Cavan tonight meeting with turf cutters to find out what they believe is the best solution for their particular bog.  I will be doing the same tomorrow evening in Clare and in Kinnegad on Saturday.  At that stage, I will have met pretty much everyone who cuts turf on all of the 55 bogs in question.  The Turf Cutters and Contractors Association will present its solution which goes along with what Fine Gael promised before the election.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Our solution contains three parts.  First, there will be compensation, which very few people want.  Second, there should be relocation of turbary rights which most people want.  Third is re-designation which would involve taking part or full bog areas out of the SACs.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</askee>
        <Quest>  the degree to which he intends to seek support for his position and proposals on Common Agriculture Policy reform throughout the other EU member states in view of the fundamental nature of the food industry in Europe and the extent to which Europe can naturally meet the ever increasing demand for food; if he will endeavour to ensure that the industry in Europe is not undermined in the context of other agreements in the context of the World Trade Organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[31733/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Food security in the European Union is the essence of what the new Common Agricultural Policy is about.</P>
        <P>Growing populations and increasing demand for protein-based foods, which is what we predominantly produce in Ireland through the dairy and meat industries, present a significant opportunity not only to continue, as the EU has been, to promote a sustainable way of producing food from an environmental and climate point of view but also to produce greater volumes <Col N="253"/>of food.  We in Ireland have a blueprint to do that in the form of Food Harvest 2020.  By 2020, we plan to produce 50% more milk in volume terms and to increase the value of beef exports by 40%.  Likewise, we also plan for expansion and growth in the poultry, pig, sheepmeat and lamb sectors, and we have the capacity to do so.</P>
        <P>In the recent past, CAP policy has been about deliberately restricting production in order to keep prices officially high within the EU as compared with prices outside the Union.  That argument is no longer relevant because the increased demand for food has put prices outside the Union more or less on a par with internal prices.  I will continue to make the case for sustainable intensification of food production, which is what agriculture should be all about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Has he identified those member states within the Union upon which he can rely in the pursuit of his policy, which is entirely laudable and something with which we all would agree?  To what extent can he rely on their support given the many competing demands that currently arise and will arise in the context of the WTO negotiations and bearing in mind what he said in his reply regarding the importance of the food industry to Europe as a whole and the capacity of Europe to make a major contribution to continuity and security of supply worldwide?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to food security within the European Union and the need to protect our capacity to produce large volumes of high-quality food in this country, there are potential threats in the context of WTO negotiations and other bilateral trade agreements which are currently on the table.  For example, Mercosur, the South American trade bloc of which Brazil and Argentina are the two largest members, is currently in ongoing negotiations with the European Union with a view to producing and selling more produce for export into the European Union with fewer restrictions, in return for which certain EU exports, predominantly financial services and manufactured products, will gain access to South American markets.  From an Irish perspective, this presents threats of which we must be wary.  Given that our largest food export is beef, the prospect of significantly increased imports of high-value beef from countries such as Brazil is a cause for concern.  However, for a whole series of reasons, any deal on Mercosur has been put off for the foreseeable future.  Nevertheless, the overall thrust of the Deputy&rsquo;s point is correct.  Several countries are very similar to Ireland in their thinking on this issue.  There are also countries which are far more protectionist in their outlook in terms of food production and cross-border trade.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s observations on two aspects of the current proposal for the next phase of the Common Agricultural Policy.  First, the indications are that suckler cow herd numbers in the country are on a downward trend, which may well have to do with the economics of rearing calves in this manner.  There are consequences if that decline were to continue in that the supply lines for the beef industry would be affected in a relatively short period.  The proposals are not very compatible with the promotion and development of the suckler cow herd.</P>
        <P>The second issue relates to entitlements established in 2011 and preceding years.  In family settlement situations, for instance, a farm owner with attached entitlements may decide to allocate part of the land and entitlements to two or three family members.  Will those family members establish entitlements within the context of the new proposals in terms, for example, of being able to avail of the land-based support as proposed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern in regard to the suckler cow herd.  As the excitement grows in advance of 2015 regarding the potential of the dairy industry, there is a danger, if we are not careful, that in parts of the country where dairy has real potential the <Col N="254"/>beef herd could become a by-product of the dairy herd, which is not at all what we want.  Currently, half of the beef sold out of Ireland comes from the dairy herd and half from the suckler herd.  All of the high-end, high-value product comes from suckler herds.  We must keep that intact.</P>
        <P>That is the basis on which I am seeking to protect and defend the suckler cow welfare scheme in the build-up to a difficult budget.  We must send a strong signal that we will support the suckler herd financially, if necessary, in order to keep it intact, particularly for those farmers who are producing higher quality beef, as are the approximately 30,000 who are in the welfare scheme and the beef quality assurance scheme that goes with it.  We will continue to pursue policies that counteract a reduction in the size of the suckler herd.  Ireland&rsquo;s beef exports are expected to decline to 460,000 tonnes this year from 500,000 in 2010.  While the value of beef exports is rising as a consequence of increasing beef prices, the volume has decreased slightly, which is something we must address.  It is a similar story in terms of sheep and lamb, although lamb prices are starting to decrease.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</askee>
        <Quest>  his proposals for the future development and extension of the beef, lamb, pigmeat, poultry and dairy sectors in this country with a view to maximising employment and exports thereby contributing to natural economic recovery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[31734/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This ties in with the previous question where Deputy Durkan raised the issue of how agriculture can be a driver for economic growth within the Irish economy.  On assuming office, I stated clearly that as far as I am concerned, my Department is a major economic ministry.  It can and will provide a major good news story in terms of job creation, wealth creation and economic growth in the next four or five years.</P>
        <P>From a pricing point of view, the price of lamb, milk, poultry and pigmeat has rarely been as strong as it is now.  Moreover, the demand for what we produce is stronger than ever.  The global population reached 7 billion in recent days and will continue to increase.  The diet of much of the developing world, where most of the growth is happening, is changing from a carbohydrate-based diet, consisting predominantly of rice and maize, to a protein-based diet comprising the foods which we produce so well in this country.  In that context there are great opportunities for further growth and expansion and the maintenance of strong pricing.  That is why we have a very ambitious blueprint for expansion and growth which enjoys the support of farmers, processors, food companies, politicians, agents of the State and academics.  We are all working to the same agenda.  It is probably the first time that has ever happened in terms of Irish agriculture.  To be fair to the last Government, it was responsible for producing the Food Harvest document.  We are determined to deliver on it month on month, not just every two or three years.</P>
        <P>Whether it is dairy, beef, pigmeat or lamb, our objective is to increase volume.  To that end, we will have to support specific industries that are weak.  We also seek to add significant value to the products we are producing.  The opportunity to do so in all of these sectors is there and waiting to be delivered upon.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P>In addition to being Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry, the agrifood sector is characterised by a high output multiplier, low import content and a significant regional impact, with attendant direct and indirect economic benefits which are heavily weighted towards rural communities. <Col N="255"/> Measured in terms of export earnings, the economic reach of the industry can be gauged from the fact that food and drink exports were worth &euro;7.9 billion in 2010.  This strong export orientation means the agrifood sector will be pivotal to our plans for economic recovery.  The broad strategy for maximising the employment and export potential of the agrifood industry is set out in the Food Harvest 2020 report launched in July 2010.  It provides a roadmap for the future development of the specific sectors identified by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Beef production is the predominant activity on Irish farms with more than 100,000 holdings involved in supplying the raw material to an industry that employs almost 8,000 people and produces an exported product worth more than &euro;1.5 billion in 2010.  The prospects for 2011 are even better with the value of beef exports expected to grow by 9% to upwards of &euro;1.7 billion for the year.  The Food Harvest report offers a vision for the long-term development of all the main food industry sectors.  In regard to the beef sector specifically, an industry-led activation group reported earlier this year.</P>
        <P>This report suggests there is market demand to support growth in the suckler and dairy herds.  Maximising beef output potential from the national herd is contingent on a number of factors, not least the price of beef on EU and international markets.  In light of current and future market developments, it is essential that a co-ordinated approach is taken by stakeholders to improve efficiency at farm and processing level, breed better animals, maintain high standards of quality and food safety and maximise the market potential of Ireland&rsquo;s unique natural advantages.</P>
        <P>We are already seeing results in, for example, the areas of innovation and collaboration.  Bord Bia has secured accreditation for its beef carbon footprint model.  It is now part of the beef and lamb quality assurance scheme, making it the first such scheme to include environmental criteria.  Plans are in train to extend this model to other products and to include additional environmental benchmarks on water and biodiversity.  This is as an important practical step towards the goal of creating an umbrella Brand Ireland identity as recommended in the 2020 strategy.  On the production side, Teagasc is working with the processing industry on research projects investigating dairy beef production and on optimal young bull production.  My Department continues to make a substantial financial contribution to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation to support its efforts to improve breed quality.</P>
        <P>In recent times, there have been many positive signs pointing to a recovery in the sheep sector.  Last year the average factory price for heavy lambs was approximately 17% ahead of 2009 levels and this trend is continuing in 2011, with average prices for the year to date running almost 10% ahead of 2010.  Another encouraging sign is that for the first time in over a decade, 2010 saw a halt in the annual decline in sheep numbers, with numbers increasing by 1.3%.  I am hopeful that 2011 will be another good year for sheep farmers.</P>
        <P>The long-term future of the sheep sector will depend on its ability to meet the needs of the market.  To do so successfully it must focus on competitiveness, innovation and the demands of the consumer.  The Food Harvest 2020 strategy sets a target of 20% growth in the output value of the sheep sector by 2020.  This is achievable given the right policy framework and favourable market conditions.  Particular actions have been identified in the Food Harvest 2020 report covering the areas of farm competitiveness, the processing sector and marketing.</P>
        <P>The sector has benefited from several key supports in recent years, including &euro;7 million from the 2009 single farm payment national reserve under the uplands sheep payment scheme and &euro;54 million for the three-year grassland sheep scheme which commenced in 2010.  These measures have provided a much needed boost to sheep farmers&rsquo; incomes.  The grassland scheme in particular is proving to be a valuable support mechanism by improving income and confidence in the sector.  In addition, Bord Bia will spend up to &euro;1 million this year on the promotion <Col N="256"/>of sheep and lamb at home and abroad, and Teagasc has allocated almost &euro;1.5 million for sheep research for 2011.  I remain committed to supporting this valuable industry and monitoring its progress closely.</P>
        <P>The pig industry is a valuable component of the overall agrifood sector and has a farmgate value in excess of &euro;300 million.  The sector supports approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services, which are dispersed around the country.  Prices during 2011 are higher than in both of the previous years and currently stand at &euro;146.10 per 100 kg, some 9.3% ahead annually, while production has increased by more than 8%.  Exports for the first six months of 2011 reached almost 84,000 tonnes, an increase of 23% compared with the same period in 2010.  The value of this trade, at some &euro;196 million, is 18% ahead year on year.  All markets have registered an increase with trade outside of the EU more than doubling.  My Department and its agencies will play a central role, along with industry, in ensuring the Food Harvest targets are met.</P>
        <P>The farmgate value of Irish-produced poultry meat is approximately &euro;120 million.  The sector supports approximately 6,000 jobs both directly and indirectly.  Despite considerable competition from imports, the domestic industry has proven to be quite resilient in recent years.  The majority of Irish product is consumed in this country with exports focussing largely on by-products.  The target in the medium term is to increase the share of the Irish poultry meat market being supplied by Irish producers.  The development of high standards of food quality has been a particular focus for my Department and its agencies.  To this end, Bord Bia is developing and enhancing policies with regard to poultry quality assurance.  Food Harvest 2020 has targeted a 10% increase in the value of poultry output.  Work towards this target will be aided by several initiatives which have been taken in the areas of animal welfare, disease surveillance and food safety.</P>
        <P>From a dairying perspective, the Food Harvest report sets an ambitious target of a 50% growth in milk production by 2020 compared with the average for the 2007-09 period.  The realisation of this target will be dependent on the achievement of maximum efficiency at production and processing levels.  The report&rsquo;s recommendations focus on changes needed in milk processing, on-farm competitiveness, the transfer of technology and knowledge to dairy farmers, and in research and development and marketing.</P>
        <P>The dairy expansion activation group has got the implementation ball rolling in the dairy sector.  Earlier this year it produced a roadmap setting out 55 actions that are required to achieve the 50% increase in milk production.  These are broken into four categories, namely, on-farm production, efficiency in the milk processing sector, the development of market opportunities and general agriculture policy.  Dr. Sean Brady, who chaired the dairy expansion activation group, is continuing to facilitate the process of implementation and to monitor progress.  All stakeholders are being encouraged to discharge the responsibilities assigned to them, and the response is being monitored and reported upon.</P>
        <P>In so far as international trade is concerned, I have been extremely active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the type of confidence in Irish production and control systems which will provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.  As part of that effort, I hosted a visit from the Chinese Vice-Minister for Agriculture earlier this year and signed a mutual co-operation agreement in the agrifood sector.  In addition, my Department has engaged with a range of third countries, including Australia, the Philippines, South Korea, China, Turkey, Egypt, Algeria and others, with a view to opening new markets and expanding the presence of Irish food products in existing markets.  Bord Bia continues, through its marketing and promotional activities and its quality assurance schemes, <Col N="257"/>to consolidate the position of the Irish agrifood sector on the domestic market and to expand its presence in EU and third-country markets.</P>
        <P>Food Harvest 2020 is the key strategy document for the development of the agrifood sector in the next decade.  I am chairing a high-level implementation committee to ensure the actions necessary to facilitate the development of the agrifood sector are taken.</P>
        <P>Milestones for Success, the first annual progress report on the implementation of Food Harvest 2020, was published in July.  More than 90% of the 215 initiatives have been commenced.  A great deal of effort has already been made by all stakeholders and there is a strong commitment to delivering results.  A good start has been made and I am confident the momentum generated by that good start will be carried forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a replica of questions on this industry that I and other Members have tabled over many years.  To what extent, if any, has the Minister engaged with the stakeholders in the beef, lamb, pigmeat, poultry and dairy sectors with a view to identifying specific targets and employment increases that could be gained as a result?  To what degree, if any, has it been possible to determine in the present economic climate precise targets for expansion in respect of volume, which is most important as the Minister has correctly pointed out, as opposed to merely relying on price increases?  Is it intended to set out specific targets in this area?  It is generally accepted that the growth areas of the economy at present will be the means by which the country can work its way out of its present difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct &mdash; there is no point in having broad aspirations about growth.  That is why anybody interested in the agrifood sector should read the Food Harvest 2020 document, which is a very easy read.  It is specific in the targets.  It is not specific on employment because it is very difficult to calculate direct employment creation in a number of these sectors.  It is easier to gauge employment in the seafood sector.  In this year alone we have seen an extra 272 jobs in seafood processing which has been supported through grant aid.  There will be a 26% increase in exports to France, the country to which we export most seafood.  That is linked to some of the work we are doing on processing.</P>
        <P>In some of the other areas we are quite specific.  Dairy should have 50% growth in volume and there should be a 40% value increase across all the sectors by 2020.  The initial Food Harvest 2020 document planned for a 20% increase by value in beef exports and we have subsequently upgraded that.  The specific beef activation group that is monitoring the progress of Food Harvest 2020 has subsequently given me a report suggesting that we upgrade that target to a 40% increase rather than a 20% increase because of the increase in beef prices that has happened.  If the Deputy wants specifics, he should look at the document, which is very specific.  It is also specific on how we get there.  I chair an implementation group that meets every second month and reviews delivery on the targets set out in the document.  This is a working document that is changing all the time and is very much driving the industry forward.  The proof of that is that this year we will export an additional &euro;1 billion worth of food.  We will go from just under &euro;8 billion worth of food exports last year to just under &euro;9 billion this year, which is phenomenal growth given the recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe everybody has bought into the vision for agriculture and the food industry.  Regarding the extra &euro;1 billion worth of food exports, there is some concern within the sector that the increase is down to price increases rather than increases in the amount we are producing.  Does the Minister have figures to indicate if it is the volume that has increased or if it is down to the prices we are getting?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="258"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is both.  I do not have exact figures on the breakdown.  However, the average price for beef, for example, is 15% to 18% higher than the average price last year.  Even though the tonnage of beef exported has reduced slightly, the value has increased because of prices.  In the case of beef it is more about an increase in the price of beef rather than an increase in volume.  However, in other sectors &mdash; certainly in the seafood sector &mdash; it is both value and volume, as is the case in the dairy sector.  I can get the Deputy the exact breakdown if he wishes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the increases in prices as opposed to volume, can any action be taken to engage with the various stakeholders to identify areas where the industry might overheat which might in turn result in market resistance leading to a downturn in that element of the economy?  What steps could be taken unilaterally or under the aegis of the EU to ensure that would not happen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have some figures to hand.  In the first six months of 2011, exports of pigmeat reached 84,000 tonnes, an increase 23% on last year.  Lamb prices are approximately 10% higher than at this time last year and demand across key export markets is strengthening and medium-term forecast is good.  Sheep supplies to date in 2011 are running 1% higher than last year.  I already gave the figures for beef.  Dairy prices remain strong with global prices well ahead of last year &mdash; milk is 34 cent per litre in Ireland.  The Commission forecast is for global production to continue to increase steadily but for prices to remain at high levels, well above the average for the past decade.  The value of dairy exports has increased by approximately 37% in 2011.  The export increase reflects increased prices and increased volume.</P>

	<P>The dairy figure is very significant and makes up most of the growth we are discussing.</P>

        <Quest>  his plans to amend the Noxious Weeds Act 1936 to provide an up-to-date and realistic penalty for breaches of the Act; when there was last a prosecution pursuant to the Noxious Weeds Act 1936; and if he will draw the attention of the Garda Commissioner to the need for the enforcement of this legislation.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[31633/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
        <P>The Noxious Weeds Act 1936 provides for the control of the spread of six noxious weeds, namely, thistle, ragwort, dock, common barberry, male wild hop plant and the wild oat.  Under the Act, it is an offence not to prevent the spread of these noxious weeds.  The owner, occupier, user or managers of lands on which these weeds are present are subject to the provisions of the Act, including a fine of up to &euro;1,000 on conviction.</P><Col N="259"/>
        <P>The last prosecution under the Act was taken in 1988.  However, the Department actively seeks to enforce the provisions of the Act by issuing notices to destroy in all instances where it becomes aware of the presence of noxious weeds.  A total of 26 such notices were issued in 2010 with a further 35 having been issued to date in 2011.  These notices are issued as a result of inspections carried out by Department field officers or on receipt of complaints made by the public.  Follow-up action may be undertaken by my officials with the landowner to ensure the notifications are acted upon and that the particular weeds have been dealt with as stipulated in the notice to destroy.</P>
        <P>Additionally, under the EU single farm payment scheme, farmers are obliged to keep their lands free from noxious weeds under the cross-compliance measures of the scheme.  Failure to do so may result in a reduction of their payment entitlements.  In the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 penalties under the single payment were applied to 27, 31 and 46 farmers, respectively, for failure to take appropriate measures to prevent the proliferation of noxious weeds.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to engage with all local authorities and the National Roads Authority to ensure a consistent programme of treatment and disposal of noxious weeds on roadsides on an ongoing basis.  The Department has conducted a number of public awareness campaigns in recent years seeking to raise awareness of the impact of such weeds and the necessity for the control of noxious weeds and to promote best practice with regard to the control and elimination of noxious weeds.  These campaigns were directed at landowners and users of land &mdash; mainly farmers, developers and local authorities.  The campaigns utilised various tools such as the publication of advertising in local, national and trade publications and the production of posters for display in all departmental, Teagasc and local authority offices.  In addition, my officials will be in contact with all local authorities during the coming months to emphasise the importance of treatment and disposal measures to eliminate and prevent the spread of noxious weeds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Deputy Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  There are noxious weeds everywhere, including in the Phoenix Park, which is infuriating.  Does the Minister propose to amend the Noxious Weeds Act 1936 to provide for an updated and realistic penalty for breaches of the Act?  Noxious weeds are toxic to cattle, horses, deer, pigs, goats and chickens, as they cause copper to accumulate in the liver resulting in ill-health and death.  There are noxious weeds all along the motorways and, as I said, in the Phoenix Park.  I regret to say the Minister&rsquo;s attempt to eliminate the problem through the advertising campaign is not working.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s point is, to a certain extent, fair.  While I will look at this issue again, I am keen on implementing the existing legislation rather than introducing a whole new set of regulations or primary legislation.  A fine of &euro;1,000, if enforced, will change habits.  Dealing with the local authorities will, however, be more difficult because they are an arm of the State.  Cutbacks in local authority budgets might have resulted in a lower level of maintenance of green areas and roadsides and consequently more weeds, particularly in public areas.  I will ask my officials to look at this matter in more detail and come back to the Deputy on it.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</askee>
        <Quest>  the steps he will take to support the development of a regionally balanced dairy sector post 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[31632/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  However, I am not sure what, in the context of development of a regionally balanced dairy sector, he is looking for <Col N="260"/>from me.  I assume his question relates to the position post-2015, preparations being made in that regard in the context of the absence of dairy quota and a dramatic expansion of the dairy industry and how we ensure that expansion will provide a dividend for all regions, rather than particular pockets of the country.  The honest answer is that it will be difficult to do this.  Certain farms, soil types and skill sets will allow particular parts of the country to expand more aggressively than others.  Lest there be uncertainty, there is strong viability to produce milk in all provinces.  For example, there are pockets of fertile land within disadvantaged areas.  </P>
        <P>Dairy farms are efficient.  We must continue our journey towards efficiency within the dairy sector which is very much under way through structures such as the dairy discussion groups and other initiatives taken by processors in building the business skills base on dairy farms.  Glanbia recently launched a proactive initiative and I expect other co-operatives to do the same.  I do not see any reason development of a new market for milk and milk related produce cannot be of benefit across the country, be it in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency or mine in which traditionally people have assumed most of the growth will take place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that this is an issue close to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rsquo;s heart.  I congratulate Mr. Aaron Forde and his team at Connaught Gold on its negotiations which were completed last weekend.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister might address the issue of the balanced expansion of the dairy industry.  Naturally, particular parts of the country are ahead of the curve in that regard.  However, two critical issues in my part of the country are farm scale and access to processing capacity and the efficiency of processors.  The Minister will be aware that farm consolidation relief lapsed in June.  Has consideration been given to re-establishing it to ensure farm consolidation can take place, which would help to achieve significant efficiencies in these areas?  Also, what steps are being taken to try to improve processing capacity and efficiency?  Is it the case that following the abolition of dairy quotas, what will be important is access to a contract with a process in order to deliver milk?  That is going to present a big challenge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made a number of relevant points.  On farm scale and consolidation, he is correct that farm consolidation relief ran out at the end of June.  I have already submitted a package of taxation measures to the Department of Finance which it is hoped will be approved in advance of the budget.  Through that package I am trying to achieve a number of things, the first of which is to increase land mobility in Ireland, in other words, ensuring we will have more land for sale.  For example, while the average field in France comes up for sale once every 70 years, in Ireland it only comes up for sale once every 400 years.  We have a problem with the availability of land for purchase, which means the price of agricultural land is far higher than it should be.  Second, I want to ensure continued support for longer term leases in order that people will be able to get their hands on land to expand in order to achieve scale.  Third, I want to encourage the handing over of land to younger farmers fresh out of college who are full of new ideas and energy, whom it is hoped will receive support, in terms of a top-up payment, through the new proposals attached to the single farm payment.  We want to get young farmers farming, as only 7% of farmers in Ireland are under 35 years of age, which is not good enough.</P>

	<P>We are trying to be helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>In trying to achieve economies of scale for farmers on small holdings we want to encourage farm partnerships, not alone partnerships within families but partnerships between neighbours in order that there will be a collective approach towards purchasing or leasing machinery, fertilisers, sprays and so on.  Ultimately, we want to see facilities such as dairy parlours being shared to ensure maximum use.  We want veterinary bills to apply to a number of farms rather than to an individual farm following the call-out of vets on different days and so on.  There is a lot we can do to challenge and encourage farmers to act collectively while retaining their holdings.  While not compromising the ownership model, they could buy into a co-operation or farm partnership model which we hope to encourage through the taxation system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a series of items into which farmers with small holdings could buy to help them to become more efficient and thus reduce the cost of their inputs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Two questions arise from the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  Are there any plans to reintroduce farm consolidation relief which lapsed in June?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>On farm partnerships, the Minister will be aware that part of the difficulty in this regard is that partnership law dates back to British rule.  The law in this regard is completely outdated to meet the needs of today.  This is part of the risk associated with going down the road towards partnership.  Does the Minister propose to introduce primary legislation to deal specifically with farm partnerships or to reform the partnership process in general?  The processing capacity will be a challenge in all parts of the country but particularly in my part of the country.  Without a contract to deliver milk to a processing facility, many farmers will not be able to re-establish dairying in our region.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question about the farm consolidation relief, I would like to see this re-introduced but it is not a decision for me.  I have made the recommendation but we will have to wait for the Department of Finance to issue a response.  I do not want to make too many promises in advance of the budget.  We have a package of taxation measures which are currently under consideration.  We have submitted them in plenty of time and I hope I can have the majority of them agreed.  The farm consolidation relief is one of them.</P>
        <P>If primary legislation is required to deal with partnerships, I am happy to introduce it.  I am informed much can be done without the need for primary legislation.  Teagasc is supportive of this concept and it has done a lot of work in this regard.  I am hopeful that next year a number of partnership pilot projects will be set up in the west and in other areas and in different types of farm settings in order to demonstrate to other farmers how this can work without a compromise of their ownership or their decision-making.  It will also show them that they can also forego participation in the partnership model if they wish and without a large cost to themselves as I understand this is a big worry for farmers.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct in his view on processing capacity.  The required investment by the processing sector in Ireland could be measured in hundreds of millions of euro over the next ten years in order to deal with the increased volumes of milk.  We must face the fact there has been no investment at all in dealing with extra volume of milk since the mid-1980s, since quotas <Col N="262"/>were introduced.  We still produce 5 billion litres of milk every year, just as we did in the mid-1980s.  I acknowledge there is an issue.  As quotas are phased out we will also see contracts being phased in.  In other words, there will not be an unbridled expansion of milk production as farmers will not be able to produce whatever they want and expect it to be bought and collected from their yards.  We will need to have some kind of contract or supply model or a co-operative model to respond to an absence of quotas.  The challenge is to ensure that this is provided in all parts of the country so that farmers will have an opportunity to expand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Two brief questions from Deputies Moynihan and Durkan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I refer to Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s question about peripheral regions.  There has been an acknowledgement of the counties where dairying is to be expanded and this has been referred to in the House on many occasions.  Over the past 30 to 35 years, there has been a significant movement away from agricultural production on the western seaboard and in peripheral regions.  There are parishes where half the land is afforested.  The dairy industry was the industry that began the co-operative movement in some of the poorer regions of the country and it was the mainstay of the western side of the country. With the abolition of quotas we must ensure that the dairy industry and milk production is maintained in these peripheral regions.  As the Minister has acknowledged on several occasions this is not just an economic policy but also a social policy.  We have to ensure that these regions are garnered and while they may not have the most fertile land or cash-efficient production methods, these societies have a value and they should be encouraged to continue in agricultural production.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the views expressed by the previous speaker.  The Minister and Deputy Naughten have identified a very important issue.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be pleased to know that my grandfather, born in 1865, supplied milk to the establishment now called Connacht Gold.  Depopulation in rural Ireland was the issue at the time and there was a need to counteract the impact of social deprivation and constriction.  The views of Sir Horace Plunkett are still true to this day.  I ask if these views might be implemented by way of more co-operation and a re-introduction of the co-operative system to ensure that the basic family farm producer is not ostracised and pushed out of the system.  Provision should be made for two concepts, the viability of that unit and the need to ensure that rural parts of this country retain an economic value and are not regarded solely from the point of view of tourism.  Given the Minister recognises the importance of the situation, I ask if he will use his good offices with his European colleagues to ensure that this concept is promoted to the greatest extent possible because it will lead ultimately to greater employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The last two speakers made comments rather than asked questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It prompted a question and an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The difference between politicians and economists is that we have a social responsibility as well as an economic one to ensure the country has a functioning economy and also a society that functions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is why I have repeatedly said that I have a dual priority. The first is to meet the targets in Food Harvest 2020.  The second is to develop the potential of a significant opportunity for increased agri-food production while at the same time trying to support parts of the country which do not have the capacity to avail of the opportunities <Col N="263"/>for growth because of farm size, fertility of land and a series of other restrictions, such as SAC designation.</P>
        <P>However, we must work to increase the productivity and efficiency of small farms and smallholdings with limitations in land type and fertility.  We must encourage farming communities to improve their production in order to gain from the market.  There is a vast difference to be noted between efficient dairy farmers and those who are less efficient but on similar types of holdings.  There is a significant difference between good and bad farming.  This holds as much for disadvantaged areas as for the fertile fields of east Cork.  It is a case of ensuring that everybody can maximise the potential of their holding whatever the challenges and restrictions.  Supports are available by means of disadvantaged area payments and through schemes such as AEOS and REPS.  We must not lose sight of the fact that for many farmers there is always more to learn about improving the efficiency of their holdings.  This could result in a more sustainable and exciting growth story in the agri-sector.</P>

	<P>While our part of the country may not be as efficient at producing milk as in south Leinster and Munster, when a comparison is made on a European scale we are very efficient in producing milk in our region.  With regard to the peripheral areas of this country, can some form of a mechanism be put in place to bring the processes together?  It would mean bringing together those involved in the industry to see where the bottlenecks exist and what steps could be taken.  My fear is that post the quota regime, the big processors in the southern half of the country will speed ahead &mdash; the best of luck to them &mdash; and dramatically increase capacity but the region I represent will be pushed out of the industry altogether.  We do not want to see this happen.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to see that happening either.  I believe we will see dramatic expansion in south Leinster and Munster although there are parts of Munster that have similar challenges to parts of Connacht.  It is important not to label entire regions as being either productive or non-productive.  It is very much a patchwork quilt.</P>
        <P>If we are to meet the targets laid out in the Food Harvest document expansion is required in the west, north-west and midlands and in parts of Munster.  The expansion in the latter may not be quite as dramatic but it is required.  There is already much talk within the processing sector, four years away from consolidation, as well as an examination of ways in which we can get more efficiency into the processing sector.  This is not only about trying to get efficiency at farm level.  We need to ask ourselves whether we have the right model in terms of the number of processors in place, where they are geographically and whether we can encourage consolidation in that sector in a sustainable way.  Ultimately, these processors are all privately owned and run and are not controlled by the State.  We talk to them and will continue to do so even more as part of the implementation group within Food Harvest.  Some of the processors are represented on that group.</P><Col N="264"/>
        <P>We also talk to the Irish Dairy Board on a regular basis regarding its views on the matter.  I assure the Deputy there is no shortage of consultation.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for the enforcement of general food labelling legislation including country of origin, rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, a body under the aegis of the Minister for Health.  This is achieved through service contracts between the FSAI and the relevant agencies including the Health Service Executive, the local authority veterinary service, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and my Department.</P>
        <P>Under the EU general labelling Directive 2000/13/EC, the place of origin of foodstuffs in circulation within the EU is required to be declared only where failure to provide it would be likely to mislead the consumer.  Specific country of origin labelling for beef and veal was introduced under EC Regulation No. 1760/2000, originating with the need for traceability arising from BSE.  Certain other products such as honey, fruit and vegetables and olive oil also require origin labelling under EU legislation.</P>
        <P>In 2007 my Department submitted draft national legislation to the European Commission that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultrymeat and sheepmeat and on food products containing over 70% of these meats.  A negative opinion was adopted on the grounds that the proposed regulation was not considered to be consistent with the EU labelling directive.</P>
        <P>More recently, the EU Commission brought forward proposals on origin labelling as part of a new regulation on information to the consumer. This regulation initially proposed an extension of origin labelling to other products including other meats, dairy products and food ingredients.  Following deliberation, it is expected that a proposed regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council will extend country of origin labelling to pork, sheepmeat, poultrymeat and goatmeat with effect from late November 2011.  Producers will have a two year transitional period to adopt the regulation.  The question of origin labelling for dairy products and meat ingredients will be subject to further review by the Commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the coming legislation.  Regarding existing legislation, namely, labelling regulations of 2000, there have been very few prosecutions in that regard.  Is the Minister concerned there have been so few?  Has any progress been made on the abuse of the existing labelling laws regarding the gaping loophole, otherwise known as substantial transformation, that allows a chicken fillet or pork chop to come from one part of the world and have breadcrumbs put on it in this country, thereby becoming an Irish food product?</P>

	<P>I ask the Minister to be brief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>On the second question, that is the reason we are introducing legislation.  Essentially, consumers are being misled.  That cheap chicken is brought into and processed in Ireland and labelled as an Irish product is something we need to move away from and that is why poultry and pigmeat will be subject to proper country of origin labelling in the not too distant future, as beef is at present.  When that happens it will be welcomed strongly by the industry.</P><Col N="265"/>
        <P>Regarding enforcement of existing rules for beef, if people have examples of regulations being flouted I would love to hear about them.  We will certainly follow up on them.  The Deputy raised a particular company with me and we followed it up with the result that the company now has very clear labelling within the premises.  I do not wish to give out its name as that would be unfair.</P>

      <sTitle>Thalidomide Survivors</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="SeanKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 50 years since a pregnancy drug called thalidomide went spectacularly wrong.  The word &ldquo;thalidomide&rdquo; entered the dictionary, referring to an unthinking and risky approach to medicines which blighted the lives of thousands of people.  Babies were born with devastating injuries.  Families were torn apart and many of those affected have since died.</P>
        <P>The babies have grown up but will face an enormous burden for the rest of their lives.  Thalidomide was sold in a number of countries across the world from 1957 to 1961, when it was withdrawn from the market after it was found to be a cause of birth defects in what has been called &ldquo;one of the biggest medical tragedies of modern times&rdquo;.  It is not known exactly how many victims there are worldwide.  Estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000 people.  In Ireland there are 32 acknowledged survivors of the thalidomide tragedy who are now approaching their 50s.  All are suffering rapidly deteriorating health, and disabilities usually seen in much older people.</P>
        <P>The Irish Thalidomide Association has been seeking justice for those affected by the drug.  It also seeks openness and transparency on the part of the Government along with an acknowledgment of the wrong that occurred.  In addition, the association seeks an apology from the Government, together with a fair and equitable compensation.  It engaged in discussions with the then Minister for Health and Children almost three years ago in regard to the fairness and adequacy of an arrangement entered into in 1975 on behalf of those affected.  A comprehensive response is still awaited.  During this time members of the association have witnessed a complete revision of these arrangements in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>In December 2009, the British Government delivered an apology to those affected by thalidomide in Britain but the Irish Government still fails to acknowledge that a wrong occurred in this country.  In Ireland the Attorney General advised there was no legal responsibility for the State.  I find that hard to believe.  The fact remains that the Government of the day failed to remove the drug for several months after it had been declared unsafe.  It knew thalidomide was unsafe.</P>
        <P>I have been made aware of the phrasing in Government documents relating to this issue, which date back for years.  Phrases indicate that the Department was concerned about the economic cost of compensation by the State.  There appears to be little indication of the human concerns in question.  What about the parents of these children?  They are now in their 80s and <Col N="267"/>their children aged 50 and upwards are still trying to sort out some sort of comprehensive recompense for what happened to them.  I welcome the Minister for Health&rsquo;s statement that he wants to enter into meaningful discussions about making a financial gesture of goodwill to survivors of thalidomide, in addition to the health care package that has already been mentioned.  Regardless of any legal responsibility, there is certainly a moral responsibility on the State in this regard.  A real and comprehensive settlement, rather than a token gesture, should be made to the survivors of thalidomide in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Kenny for raising this issue.  I am glad to have an opportunity to respond to him on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  The Minister met representatives of the Irish Thalidomide Association, and separately the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society, in July of this year.  He informed both organisations that the main aim of the Government in this respect is to address the health and personal social care needs of thalidomide survivors living in Ireland.  The Minister has written to both organisations to inform them that the parameters of a HSE health care package are being drawn up by officials in the Department of Health and the HSE.  The Department will be in touch with the organisations when it is in a position to discuss the details involved.</P>
        <P>The commitment in the programme for Government is to reopen discussions with survivors.  The Government is committed to doing that.  At his meetings with representatives of the Irish Thalidomide Association and the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society, the Minister said he would have to be guided by the legal advice regarding the State&rsquo;s liability.  The Attorney General has confirmed that the State has no legal liability in this matter.  Notwithstanding this position, the Minister wants to enter into meaningful discussions about a financial gesture of goodwill towards Irish survivors of thalidomide.  This would be in addition to a health care package.  However, none of us can ignore the severe financial challenges the health service is facing at present.  It is likely that these challenges will increase next year and continue for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>The thalidomide product sold in Ireland was manufactured by a German company, Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal.  Irish survivors of thalidomide receive compensation from a German foundation that was set up for that purpose.  Monthly payments range up to &euro;1,116 per month, tax free, and annual payments range up to &euro;3,680.  A monthly allowance is currently paid by the Department of Health and is worth up to &euro;1,109 per month.  The majority of Irish survivors are in receipt of the maximum allowance from Germany and Ireland.  When the German and Irish payments are combined, the maximum payment individuals receive is &euro;30,386 per annum or &euro;2,572 per month.  On average, they receive a tax free payment of &euro;26,000 each year or &euro;2,166 per month.  The monthly payments are tax free and are not reckonable for State benefits including disability allowance.  Each individual is automatically entitled to a medical card.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s proposal to provide a health care package and to engage in meaningful discussions about a financial gesture of goodwill towards Irish survivors of thalidomide is a reasonable and compassionate response aimed at meeting the medical and other needs of survivors.  The Deputy will join me in saying the State has great sympathy for the survivors.  It is most regrettable that they were put through so much pain and suffering.  The Government acknowledges the physical and emotional difficulties they and their families have faced as a result of the use of this drug.  We recognise the challenges that persist for each individual.  I assure the House of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the health care and related needs of all the Irish survivors of thalidomide.  I thank Deputy Kenny for raising this issue.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to dealing with this matter.  I reiterate that thalidomide sufferers in the UK received <Col N="268"/>an apology from the British Government for what happened to them.  I understand thalidomide victims in this country are seeking a similar gesture.  Will the Minister consider making such a gesture?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 33 Irish survivors of thalidomide.  Thalidomide was not licensed by the Irish State.  The regime in Ireland in the late 1950s and early 1960s was self-regulated by the drug companies.  A regime of self-regulation by drug manufacturers also applied in most other European countries and states.  The Government is satisfied that very few countries had systematic controls for licensing drugs at that time.  Most countries developed such controls in light of the thalidomide experience.  It is certain that a different approach to this matter would be taken today.  Judged by the standards of the time, the Department acted in an appropriate manner at the time when faced with an unprecedented situation.  The whole approach to dealing with issues of medicine control was completely different in 1962 than it is now.  Responsibility for this tragedy rests with the manufacturer of the drug.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatrickODonovan"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the presence in the House of the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall.  I wish her well in her role.  Like other Deputies, since I was elected my attention has been drawn by a number of parents to the issues of orthodontics and dental care, especially as they relate to children.  When I did some research into the operation and governance of the dental profession in Ireland, I discovered that in both 2002 and 2005, joint Oireachtas committees produced recommendations on how the dental strategy in this country should be operated.  Nine years on from the 2002 report and six years on from the 2005 report, the situation is no better and is probably worse.  I have spoken to parents who are frustrated because their children&rsquo;s teeth are getting worse as waiting times increase.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am struck by the length of time for which the position of chief dental officer has been vacant.  I understand there is an embargo on recruitment into the public sector and I appreciate the implications of the filling of posts.  Having said that, the need for a chief dental officer cannot be underestimated, particularly given that the Dentists Act 1985 provided for the establishment of the grade of dental therapist, as an assistant to dentists and orthodontists, in order to help the State to reduce waiting lists.  Unfortunately, that was never realised.  As things stand, an Irish person who receives a dental therapy qualification in the UK is not allowed to practice in Ireland.  If such a person presents himself or herself to the Dental Council, he or she will essentially be asking the council not only to ratify him or her but also to ratify the course he or she studied in the UK.</P>
        <P>The international experience in this regard is that waiting lists for orthodontic care, especially for children in their formative years, are much shorter in countries where a different strategy is pursued.  There has been a reluctance to consider such approaches in Ireland, for whatever reason.  It is a pity we are still in such a position, 26 years after the original legislation was passed.  I understand the Dental Council is considering giving acknowledgment to a course that can be studied in the UK.  It should be noted, however, that the General Dental Council in the UK currently accepts seven courses as suitable for a person who wishes to work as a dental therapist there.  None of them is currently recognised in this country.</P>
        <P>Ireland is unique in western Europe for its failure to make great headway in increasing the number of people who receive dental treatment.  I acknowledge the presence in the Chamber of the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  During his tenure as Minister for Health in the rainbow coalition of the 1990s, massive progress was made at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin.  The strategy that was applied was different from that we are used to now.  A similar strategy was <Col N="269"/>applied by the former Mid-Western Health Board.  All of that good work disappeared with the abolition of the health boards and the creation of the bureaucratic monster that is the HSE.</P>
        <P>Is there an appetite for dealing with this within the Department of Health, the HSE and the dental profession itself?  Having spoken to some of those who work in this sector and some of the parents of children on waiting lists, it seems there is a reluctance to deal with the issue effectively.</P>

        <P>To cite a specific case, a journal published in 2010 in Camarthenshire in Wales indicated that orthodontic therapists could treat 2,268 children in one year.  This is a substantial number of children and given that rural Wales is not much different from any area of Ireland, I ask that the Minister of State examine the issue, particularly in light of the reluctance shown to date towards implementing the recommendations made by the joint Oireachtas committee in 2002 and 2005.</P>
        <P>While I accept that we face budgetary constraints, constituents have visited my clinic to show me pictures of their children&rsquo;s teeth or present their children in person in order that I can look in their mouths.  I am then placed in the unenviable position of having to inform them that their child may have to wait for two or three years for treatment.  I ask the Minister of State to raise this matter with the Minister for Health and I look forward to a response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan for raising this issue.  Oral health services span primary, secondary and tertiary care services, including acute hospitals.  The Department of Health agrees objectives and performance indicators with the Health Service Executive for the public dental service and dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, and oversees the development of policy and service delivery in this regard.  The DTSS is provided by contracted dental practitioners and the public dental service is provided by salaried dental staff of the HSE.</P>
        <P>The current goal for the DTSS is the provision of a basic level of service within budget to medical card holders.  Unfortunately, owing to the current position of the public finances, it has been deemed necessary to reduce the services available under the scheme.  However the Health Service Executive has measures in place to ensure patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs receive priority for treatment.  In addition, a free oral examination every calendar year and free emergency dental treatment with a focus on the relief of pain and sepsis are available to all eligible patients.</P>
        <P>The current goals for the public dental service are the provision of pain and emergency services for children aged under 16 years and routine care for targeted classes of primary school children with the provision of advanced, specialist and consultant care in hospital settings.  Orthodontic services, which are also delivered by salaried dental staff of the HSE, are provided to eligible patients based on the level of clinical need.  Oral and maxillofacial surgery are delivered either by secondary or tertiary services.  The HSE intends to review the delivery of orthodontic services and all possible avenues related to internationally recognised models of good practice will be considered in that context.</P>
        <P>The HSE is implementing the recommendations of the strategic review of the management and delivery of dental services undertaken in 2010.  This includes the development of a national oral health office and an inspectorate.  A national oral health lead has been appointed on an interim basis and is leading the implementation of the recommendations, which place a particular emphasis on probity and governance issues.</P>
        <P>The National Recovery Plan 2012-2014 provides for changes in the existing range of dental services and supports provided through the health care and social protection systems to improve access to essential dental services for those most in need.  This proposal is being considered in the context of the comprehensive review of expenditure.  The current moratorium <Col N="270"/>on the filling of posts has meant the Department of Health has not been in a position to fill the post of chief dental officer.  Future decisions on this post will be taken against the backdrop of the Department&rsquo;s need to balance the delivery of business priorities with falling levels of overall resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickODonovan"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>While I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on the current economic climate, the appointment of auxiliary personnel working in orthodontic teams, as they are described in Finland, offers the potential to achieve much better outcomes using the same level of resources.  It is an indictment of all Governments since 1985 that the model of delivering orthodontic services has not changed in the past 25 years.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to examine this issue.  At present, the role of chief dental officer is being  performed in an acting capacity.  The position must be afforded the priority it deserves if we are to drive forward the delivery of the orthodontic service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan that we can achieve more with existing resources and I am keen to change the way in which services are delivered.  I am also sympathetic to his call for the appointment of a chief dental officer.  I hope we will be able to take a decision on the matter when the position becomes clearer in the new year.</P>

      <sTitle>General Government Debt</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not give me any pleasure to raise this issue, which can only be described as a humiliating schoolboy error committed by the Department of Finance in the calculation of Ireland&rsquo;s official debt figure, the general Government debt.  Ordinary people can justifiably ask how the State authorities can make a mistake of the magnitude involved when calculating a figure of such importance as the official debt position of the country at the end of 2010.  One question which immediately springs to mind is why a reconciliation was not done between the balance of the general government debt at the end of 2009 and 2010, respectively, as one would expect from the point of view of basic financial control.  Why was an exercise not done showing the opening position, followed by all the movements over the period and arriving at the closing position?  It is clear that such an exercise was not done in this case.</P>
        <P>A more detailed examination of the figures highlights how grave the mistake was.  The opening position as at the end of 2009 was a general Government debt of &euro;105 billion.  At the end of 2010 the equivalent and incorrect figure reported was &euro;148 billion.  This indicates a movement of &euro;43 billion over the course of the year, of which &euro;31 billion was accounted for by the promissory notes.  The net movement, therefore, when one omits the value of the promissory notes, was an increase in general Government debt of only &euro;12 billion.  Given that the figure was overstated by &euro;3.6 billion, the miscalculation accounted for approximately 40% of the net movement, which is an astounding error.  It is especially astonishing when one considers that this is the standard measure of a country&rsquo;s indebtedness, the figure used across the European Union by investors when they are examining a country&rsquo;s total debt position as part of their investment decisions.</P>
        <P>It is fortunate that the error in this case was favourable.  While it is embarrassing, it would be much more difficult for the Government or anyone else to explain a scenario in which the total debt position had been understated by &euro;3.6 billion at the end of 2010.  Mistakes such as this undermine the credibility and integrity of information being provided by Government bodies on issues as sensitive as the debt position.</P>
        <P>The explanation for the error has not been adequate and I hope the Minister will be able to shed further light on the matter.  The National Treasury Management Agency stated it brought <Col N="271"/>the matter to the attention of the Department of Finance on a number of occasions from the autumn of 2010 onwards.  How many times did it raise the issue with the Department?  Did it bring it to the attention of one official who then failed to act in an appropriate manner?  It is important that the Minister sets out the chain of events, including the correspondence between the NTMA and Department on when the potential of double-counting the sum of &euro;3.6 billion was first raised.</P>
        <P>It is noteworthy that the NTMA included the incorrect figure in its own annual report and annual accounts published on 21 July 2011.  If it had concerns about the figure, why did it include it in its official report and annual accounts which were signed off by the chief executive?  The error also slipped passed the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As the Minister indicated in his interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today, the accounts in question were signed off on 19 September last and included the incorrect figure.  We need to know the precise chain of events, including the date on which the matter was first raised with the Department by the NTMA, the number of times the agency raised it, the reason the information was not acted on and when the Minister first found out the mistake was in the accounts.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy McGrath for raising this serious and important issue.  I will give the Deputy the information I have to hand, but if it needs to be supplemented later, I will provide additional information.</P>
        <P>My Department has informed me that the general Government debt figure reported to EUROSTAT at the end of September last for the period up to the end of 2010 overstated the actual debt figure as a result of a double count.  The reported figure for the end of 2010 was &euro;148 billion, which overstated the amount by &euro;3.6 billion.  From the immediate review of the records to hand, it is the case that the matter was signalled at a technical level to the Department by the NTMA last year.  At this stage it is too early to be definite as to what action was taken, but it would seem that the significance of the matter was not appreciated at that time.  I understand that &ldquo;last year&rdquo; refers to August 2010.</P>
        <P>In the context of the current work under way for the publication of the forecasts later this week, the information was again raised by the NTMA at an official level with my Department.  Following examination of the issue by my officials, together with the Central Statistics Office and the NTMA, and after establishing that a double count had occurred, I was informed of the issue yesterday and briefed in detail on it.  The CSO has already informed EUROSTAT about the double count and the information has also been communicated to the European Union and the IMF.  The record shows the NTMA contacted the Department twice, one contact last August which was not acted on and one while we were preparing the figures for the coming Friday&rsquo;s publication, which has been acted on.  The NTMA may also have made verbal contact, but I do not know that.  The record shows the number of contacts to be two.</P>
        <P>The double count in our debt figures arose because in 2010 the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, borrowed directly from the NTMA instead of from the open market.  General Government debt is compiled by adding the central Government debt borrowed by the NTMA to debt sourced on the open market by other Government bodies. However, when the HFA borrowed from the NTMA, the &euro;3.6 billion in question was already in the central Government debt figure.  As the liabilities of the HFA were then added to arrive at the general Government debt figure, the &euro;3.6 billion was counted twice.</P>
        <P>Before turning to how this could have happened, I want to address the issue of what the revision means in terms of the Irish economy and public finances.  First of all, our debt to GDP ratio for the end of 2010 is now 92.6% of GDP, not the 94.9% previously published.  The reduction to the base at the end of 2010 due to this correction has been improved by 2.3% of GDP.  This means that our projected peak level of general Government debt will be lower than <Col N="272"/>previously forecast.  The details will be made clear in the medium-term fiscal statement that will be published this Friday.  However, this revision did not change the net debt position for 2010 &mdash; the general Government debt less liquid assets and cash &mdash; and does not have any effect on the general Government deficit for 2010 or for this year.  In overall terms, Ireland is no better or worse off and the target deficit consolidation for 2012 and future years, to which we are fully committed, has not changed.  Suppose, for example, a person got an incorrect statement from his bank which understated his current account by &euro;500.  The correction of the error in the statement would not make the person any better off.  He would still have the &euro;500 in his account &mdash; no more and no less.  That is the situation.  The total debt is being reduced, but this has no effect on the budgetary position whatsoever.</P>
        <P>The questions to be addressed now are whether the mistake could have been prevented and what should be done to ensure that such errors do not happen in the future.  This is a serious issue and I am determined that the necessary lessons are learned and immediately acted upon.  It is clear there has been a systems failure.  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance has already asked for a full report on the matter and will arrange for an external review of the systems in the Department, the NTMA and the CSO to be carried out in order that I have the necessary information to be satisfied that any systems errors have been addressed.  Once I have the full facts of the matter, we will be better placed to establish the processes and systems we need to implement to ensure the data supplied by the State are robust and beyond doubt.</P>
        <P>That is my information to date.  If further information comes to me, I will communicate it to the Deputy and the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important issue.  The statement made by the NTMA yesterday gave the impression that the issue had been raised repeatedly.  It suggested it had raised the matter on a number of occasions, from as far back as autumn 2010.  The Minister&rsquo;s information is that it was raised once in August 2010 and quite recently in the context of the preparation of the medium-term fiscal plan.  Clearly there has been a breakdown at a number of levels.  We had a breakdown of procedures in the Department of Finance in that it made the incorrect calculation.  The NTMA says the Department is responsible for that calculation.  Then, when the mistake was brought to the attention of the Department at a so-called technical level in August last year, it was not acted on.  We need to know why and need more detail on that.  There is also a question for the NTMA as to why, having signalled this error in August 2010, it included the incorrect figure, about which it had suspicions, in its annual report and accounts published in July 2011.  There are, therefore, outstanding questions that need to be answered.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact the Minister has commissioned a report.  If I understand correctly, that report is to be prepared by the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, to be followed by an external review of the systems.  The review into the matter should be conducted by an external person given that officials in the Department are involved at the heart of the issue.  The Minister should ensure an independent external person is appointed to carry out the investigation and that the report is returned to him and published.  It is wholly unsatisfactory that Ireland&rsquo;s official debt position was overstated by more than 2% of GDP and that foreign investors looking at Ireland over recent months would have been basing their investment decision on incorrect information.  This is deeply unsatisfactory.  I hope the Minister will ensure there is an external review of what has happened in this case.  There are also questions for the NTMA and the Minister should take those up with the agency and report back to the House on the outcome.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="273"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may well be right in what he says, but the documentary evidence available is that the NTMA e-mailed a particular person in the Department of Finance questioning the manner in which this was treated.  That was in August 2010.  There is no indication and I do not believe for minute that my predecessor, Brian Lenihan, was informed of this.  Therefore, I am not trying to spread the blame at all.  It came to light at the start of the preparation of the figures for the budget &mdash; the budgetary process &mdash; and it came to light again this year in preparation for the statement to be issued by me on Friday on the fiscal position into the future.  Obviously, the level of our debt is one of the crucial numbers included.  An e-mail came again on that, but to a different official.  It was acted upon this time, but not the first time.  I do not know whether the NTMA rang officials or whether it had private conversations or what kind of interpersonal exchange took place between it and Department of Finance officials who are in contact with it at several levels every day.  The record shows a couple of e-mails.</P>
        <P>With regard to the inquiry and where we go from here, it is important to find out what happened and what caused the mistake to occur.  So far, it looks like human error on the part of a particular official.  That is not the big issue.  Chasing an official in the Department of Finance who made a mistake is not the big issue.  The issue is whether the systems are in place to ensure the figures are correct.  We all know the word &ldquo;systemic&rdquo; from previous exchanges in House.  The issue is whether there is a systemic problem in that section of the Department of Finance.  Human errors occur, but whether this is a company or a section of a Department, we expect that where a human error occurs, the checks and balances within the system will ensure that somebody elsewhere in the process will discover the error.  That is how we trap, correct and contain mistakes.  I am quite happy to let the Secretary General inquire to establish in further detail the facts of the situation in respect of the error.  However, an examination of the situation to see if we need to change systems will have to be conducted by an outside agency, as the Deputy rightly says.  That cannot be internal and it has to examine the section in the Department of Finance, the relevant section in the CSO and the NTMA, because it occurred in the relationships between the three.</P>
        <P>The system failed again when it was not picked up and when the Comptroller and Auditor General examined the 2010 accounts and reported to the House in September 2011.  In fairness to the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff, his primary scrutiny when looking at Departments is to track money in and out.  While this would be within his remit, the overall figure for the debt would not be his primary concern when he is examining the account of a Department.  I am not making a criticism of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen Donnelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I think it is fair to say there is agreement across the House that there is no moral or legal obligation on us to pay the bond due to be paid today by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited, formerly Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited.  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s own assessment from last year that it is a disaster and obscene thing for us to be doing.  Taking that for granted, I would just like to understand why we are doing it.  In his own speech last December, he dismissed the contagion argument, and I agree with that assessment.  He pointed out that paying the bonds worsens our reputation, as has been borne out since, because we are now graded as lower than junk status.  I also agree with that.  This only leaves one argument, which is this assertion that the ECB believes that not paying this money back to the speculators would collapse the European banking system in some way.  The IMF does not agree with that.</P>
        <P>My understanding of the argument is that the ECB is forcing us to pay these speculators and if we do not, it has one of two options available which it will invoke.  The first is that it will increase the interest rate for the emergency liquidity assistance and the second is that it can remove that emergency liquidity assistance.  Doing either of those things would destabilise the Irish banking system and would cause exactly what the ECB claims it is trying to avoid.</P><Col N="274"/>
        <P>Within that context, I would appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s position on the following two questions.  Why does he think the ECB is credible if carrying out that threat on behalf of the ECB will cause what it is trying to avoid?  Has the Government done a risk analysis of the cost of the ECB pulling either of these triggers relative to the costs of paying the bondholders?</P>

	<P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this topic.  I accept that the Minister has been dealt a terrible hand, but I think the goalposts have moved in Europe.  I do not think we should continue to give a certain impression to the Europeans about things.  We are eager to be positive and there is nothing wrong with that.  However, we are not calling our position as stark as it might be.  I wonder if Chancellor Merkel is quite aware of just how difficult things are for many Irish people.  It is all very well for her to stand up in the Bundestag and say nice things about us and how well we are doing.  I would like her to come over here and have a look at some of the things that are going on here at the moment owing to the austerity measures we have been obliged to introduce.</P>
        <P>Our domestic economy is in a poor place.  Life is so difficult for 450,000 people who are unemployed.  We are cutting learning support SNAs and language support to the marginalised in our society.  We are closing hospital beds to balance budgets.  If Chancellor Merkel came over here, perhaps she would be a little bit more sympathetic.</P>
        <P>Someone stated the following in an article in <i>The Guardian </i>today:</P>
        <P LI="1">Greece quitting the euro of its own accord would probably come as a surprise to policymakers in the EU.  They never really intended to drive Greece out since the risk to banks would be enormous.  Misled by the meek attitude of the Greek government, they imposed ever harsher measures, imagining they were doing Greeks a favour.  Someone in the bubble of Brussels should have told the decision-makers what was really happening among Greece&rsquo;s grassroots.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Chancellor Merkel might be more sympathetic if we gave her a clearer view of how difficult things are for many people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will read the prepared reply first and then will answer questions if we have the time.</P>
        <P>It has always been my position that, given the significant cost of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited and the Irish Nationwide Building Society, now known as the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited, to the Irish State and the Irish taxpayer, there should be no repayment of unguaranteed senior unsecured debt.  To avoid such repayments, the most logical option would have been to put the bank into administration.  This was an option available to the previous Government, but instead it put the taxpayer on the line for the liabilities of the IBRC.</P>
        <P>If we were to suspend payments to creditors in the IBRC, this would have a significant impact on both the bank and ultimately the State.  This senior debt, unsecured as it is, is an obligation of the bank.  If the bank does not meet such obligations, it would lead to a default and, following that, most likely insolvency.  This would result in a significant increase in the cost to the State to resolve the IBRC.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the period from the introduction of the guarantee in September 2008 to 31 December 2010, the previous Government allowed substantial repayments of around &euro;20 billion of senior debt for the IBRC.  One would gag on the hypocrisy of a party leader standing up here today complaining about a repayment of &euro;750 million when his own party had already paid up to &euro;20 billion to the creditors of Anglo Irish Bank.  Since coming into Government, we have explored options with our European partners on senior debt burden sharing.  As I stated after my meeting with ECB President Trichet and Commissioner Rehn last month, our European partners <Col N="275"/>expressed strong reservations about burden sharing with senior bondholders in IBRC.  Mr. Trichet voiced his opinion that he is against such actions for two reasons.  First, private sector involvement carries very significant contagion risk and may be inconsistent with encouraging private investors to return to markets.  Second, he said Ireland had done particularly well over the summer.  He mentioned the narrowing of bond spreads and he said that he felt that anything to do with senior debt burden sharing might knock the confidence of the market in the absolute commitment of the Government to take its place once again in normally functioning markets.  As a result, bond yields could widen again and we would lose the ground we had gained.</P>
        <P>Mr. Trichet&rsquo;s views were echoed by Commissioner Rehn.  The positive international commentary on Ireland has been created by the Government&rsquo;s successful renegotiation of the memorandum of understanding, the introduction of the jobs initiative, the sizeable reduction of the interest rate on the EU-IMF programme and the reduction in the cost of the banks to the taxpayer.  The value of support, present and future, we receive from our European partners far outweighs any short-term gain from imposing burden sharing on these bonds in the face of European opposition to such a move.  For example, &euro;110 billion of funding is provided by the ECB and the Central Bank of Ireland to the Irish banks at a cost of 1.5%, a figure below which they could borrow in the market.  This is in addition to the &euro;85 billion set out in the programme with the troika.</P>
        <P>However, we still have unfinished business with our partners to find the most cost-effective way of resolving the IBRC over the long term.  Technical discussions between officials are under way at present on the IBRC promissory notes.  For these reasons, I have decided not to take unilateral action on burden sharing on IBRC senior debt.  Therefore, the IBRC has today repaid senior debt of $1 billion, which is around &euro;700 million.  This was a publicly traded senior liability and, as noted earlier, the bank was contractually obliged to repay this liability on its maturity date.  The IBRC has announced the sale of its &euro;9.2 billion loan book in the United States.  The process is continuing and approximately &euro;3.5 billion in gross loans have transferred to buyers.  The net proceeds from the sale will allow the bank to repay these unguaranteed bonds and also to reduce its borrowings, including emergency liquidity assistance from the Irish Central Bank.  It is important to state that the redemption of the bond will be made by the IBRC.  It will not be funded by the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>Both of the Deputies were in the House this morning, or at least Deputy Donnelly was, when the Taoiseach read out a quote from my predecessor as Minister, Brian Lenihan, stating that when he introduced the issue of burden sharing by senior bondholders with the European Central Bank back in December, he was told that if he pursued that course of action there would be no programme.  Thus, it is not just the threat of increased interest rates or a turning off of the tap of liquidity to the banking system.  By the way, neither of these threats was ever made, but the point I am making is that these were not our only concerns.  There was also the concern about the collapse of the programme.  If the programme collapsed, we would have to make the full adjustment in one year.  To reply to Deputy Wallace, that is when we would really have problems in this country, if we had to make the adjustment that is paced out to 2015 in one year so that our revenue receipts matched our expenditure.  That would devastate public services.</P>
        <P>This is a judgment call.  I do not like it, and I have not changed my position on it.  It is a choice between two evils, as far as I am concerned, and the decision we are making is the lesser of two evils.  It is my judgment and that of the Government that it is more in the interests of the Irish people to grit our teeth and allow Anglo Irish Bank to pay the bond than to default, because default takes us over the edge of the cliff.  As the situation in Greece deteriorates by the day, could the Deputies imagine what would happen if, from the point of view of the euro, a second front was opened in Ireland by a default?  It could bring the whole thing down.  I am not prepared to put the Irish people or this House in that position and I take that responsibility.</P>

	<P>In the Minister&rsquo;s prepared statement, the two arguments he gave from Mr. Trichet were ones that he himself dismissed when in Opposition.  He absolutely dismissed them.  I agree with his previous analysis and I do not accept Mr. Trichet&rsquo;s analysis.  I do not accept that there is a significant risk of contagion from not paying bonds such as the one today.  I simply think he is talking nonsense, and the Minister himself said exactly the same thing in this House when he was sitting in Opposition less than a year ago.</P>
        <P>My question is about the emergency liquidity assistance.  The Minister is saying that no threats were made.  Actually, the threat is the collapse of the IMF agreement.  I think he said that no threats were made on the interest rate.</P>

	<P>I will clarify that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen Donnelly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said the real threat is on the IMF agreement.  The agreement, as we all know, says nothing about these bonds, and therefore we are being held not just to an IMF agreement but to something beyond that agreement.  I encourage the Minister to provide anything on the record to Members of the House in order that we can debate that and consider the cost-benefit analysis.  I accept it is his judgment, but as fellow Members of Parliament it would be useful for us to be able to make judgments, and for that we need more than the Minister&rsquo;s say-so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is saying that if we were to refuse to pay the unsecured bondholders on this occasion, it would likely result in Armageddon and it would be a bit of a disaster.  The rules are changing.  Things are not as they were in Europe even last month, and they will change more.  Bondholders will take it on the chin a lot more, and not just what they took in Greece last week.  They will be taking more haircuts in the next two years.  I am not saying we will fall out with the Europeans, but we need to put more pressure on Europe to give us a fairer deal.  Everybody realises at this stage that bondholders will not continue to get all their money in the next two years.  It is time the ECB got real and took that on board in dealing with our problems.  Rather than being dogmatic with us &mdash; telling us we have to do this or that &mdash; it must give a little more leverage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Donnelly asked about the connection between the programme in which we are involved and the repayment of senior debt.  The bit that is on the record is what the late Brian Lenihan said in this House before Christmas last year when he said it was made absolutely clear to him by the European Central Bank that if there was any talk of burden sharing with senior bondholders, there would be no programme.  That is the connection between the two.</P>
        <P>With regard to threats, the ECB does not operate that way.  Jean-Claude Trichet is a perfect gentleman and I have had several conversations with him and with others in the ECB.  It is also true, however, that when I start discussing in the same conversation the possibility of burden sharing with senior bondholders, I am always reminded of all the ECB has done for Ireland and how it kept the Irish banking system going with liquidity.  Even now, when we have reduced the amount dramatically through deleveraging and accessing funds on the wholesale market, it is still &euro;110 billion.  It never threatened to raise the interest rate either, but it is also mentioned in conversation that not only is the ECB giving Ireland all this money, it is giving it at very favourable interest rates, and it will continue to do so.</P>

	<P>I am asking the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="277"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I think there is a risk.  These facts are put on the table in the politest possible way in the course of the discussion, and we did not make headway on it, but there was never any statement that the bank would not continue to support us, and it has been very helpful to us elsewhere.  It is also my judgment that the best way to succeed is to continue to negotiate the programme.  We did it in May and July and we have set up a position of negotiation to reduce the debt burden, which will be ongoing into next year.  To do that successfully, we need the goodwill of the European authorities, and we have it.  It is not that those concerned are giving us pats on the head; they actually think we are doing a good job.  They are prepared to work with us and they have told us they will continue to work with us.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Wallace that the situation is evolving rapidly in Europe, but we have not withdrawn from the renegotiation.  Our primary commitment at election time was that we would renegotiate the programme, and we are renegotiating it in phases.  We did the May phase and the July phase on interest rates and we are now trying to position ourselves for a phase in which we will get a reduction on the burden of debt.  There are various ways of doing that, and what I have in mind is the objective of taking a tranche of that off the shoulders of the Irish taxpayer, rather than the methodology of getting there.  One option is to pursue the promissory note, which we are actively doing.  It would be of great benefit if we could re-engineer the financing of the promissory note, and there would be no default or restructuring.  However, there are other options, and we are pursuing those also.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am.  When I moved the suspension of the House, I was talking about the possibility of renegotiating.  I made the point that we were renegotiating in phases and that the next phase was to renegotiate the burden of debt.  That gives continuity with what I was saying before the previous debate was adjourned.  I believe this is the most appropriate course of action, and this is what we are trying to do.  The strategy is beginning to pay dividends.  The economy is growing once again, the public finances are on track, and deposits are returning to Irish banks.  As the Taoiseach pointed out this morning, our ambition was to be the first eurozone country to emerge successfully from a bailout.  I refer back to the comprehensive strategy to address the euro area crisis as part of which leaders pledged to increase the effective capacity of the stability fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, to limit the contagion effects.  Two main options to boost its firepower have been identified.  The first involves an insurance-type arrangement that will be available to member states whose debt issuance is under pressure.  In this way, a relatively small number of guarantees can generate a large amount of investment.  The second option will bundle resources from private and public financial institutions and investors, via a special purpose vehicle, to increase the amount of funds available to provide stability support.  In terms of the actual impact, it will depend on market conditions but it could be up to four or five times the size of the remaining capacity of the EFSF, in other words, approximately &euro;1 trillion.</P>
        <P>What does this mean for Ireland?  Ireland conducts limited business with Greece and financial links with Greece are limited.  For us, the decision to erect sizeable and robust firewalls is important because there is a risk of contagion from the Greek crisis.  This will help to reduce the risk of derailing the recent substantial progress we have made and as such it is welcome.</P>
        <P>The third element of the strategy involved leaders of all EU countries endorsing a package of measures to restore market confidence in European banks.  The package, designed by the European Banking Authority and based on a mark-to-market treatment of banks&rsquo; holdings of sovereign debt, has several aspects to it.  The first part involves a co-ordinated scheme of bank recapitalisation throughout Europe.  In practical terms, banks will be required to create exceptional and temporary capital buffers to address current market concerns about sovereign risk, <Col N="278"/>resulting in the need to reach a core, tier 1 ratio of 9% by the middle of next year with mark-to-market in addition.  The objective is to reassure markets about the ability of European banks to withstand a range of shocks.  It has been agreed that to finance the capital increase, banks should use private sources of capital first, including through the restructuring and conversion of debt-to-equity instruments.  If necessary, national governments should provide support and, if this is not possible, recapitalisation can be funded via a loan from the EFSF in the case of euro area countries.</P>
        <P>The second aspect relates to EU co-ordinated public guarantees on bank liabilities to support banks&rsquo; access to medium-term funding, which has become increasingly difficult recently.  Such guarantees will help banks continue their lending next year and avoid forced de-leveraging, which would have negative implications for the European economy.  The outcome of the European Banking Authority exercise shows that Irish banks do not require additional capital under the higher standard now required.  This outcome underlines the robust and conservative nature of our own prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, conducted in March this year.  As Deputies are aware, a final &euro;24 billion recapitalisation of the banking sector took place in July this year following the PCAR process and earlier steps taken by the State during 2009 and 2010.  Given the additional PCAR capital, Irish banks are now among the best capitalised banks anywhere in the world.  In other words, additional capital is not now needed.  Approximately one third of this capital was generated from private sector investment and liability management exercises.  This is a clear vote of confidence in the Irish banking system and in the future of the Irish economy.  Some &euro;15 billion of revenue was secured from what is colloquially described as &ldquo;burning subordinated bondholders&rdquo; but &euro;15 billion is a great deal of money.</P>
        <P>The fourth element of the strategy involves a strengthening of economic and fiscal co-ordination in the euro area.  A set of measures that go beyond recently adopted reforms will be put in place, reflecting the need for greater co-ordination within a monetary union.  In general terms, the surveillance of national budgets in the euro area will be tightened.  Specifically, among other things, euro area member states will be required to adopt fiscal rules into national legislation and to consult with other member states before adopting any policies with potential spillover effects.  More rigorous oversight is envisaged for member states in excessive deficit, in other words, where deficits or debt is too high.  Heads of State also agreed that a pragmatic co-ordination of other policies would be implemented.</P>
        <P>What does this mean for Ireland?  First and foremost, we in Ireland recognise that in a currency union economic and budgetary policies in one country can have spillover effects on other countries.  One of the greatest problems during the first decade of monetary union was the failure of many countries to take the euro area dimension sufficiently into account in their budgetary policies.  Measures have been agreed to help address this issue which will be of benefit to all euro area member states, including Ireland.  Ireland is already moving in the direction of improved fiscal rules, the latest example being the forthcoming fiscal responsibility Bill which will, of course, be debated by the Oireachtas.  The Bill will put the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, which has been established already, on a statutory basis.  As the Taoiseach has outlined previously, Ireland will engage constructively on the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base.  With regard to the Commission&rsquo;s recent proposals for a financial transactions tax, I have made clear that such a tax, in whatever final form it might take, should apply on as wide an international basis as possible.  Such an approach would avoid the danger of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where such a tax is not levied on financial transactions.  Furthermore, as I and others have previously stated, if a global agreement is not possible, it is important that any such tax would apply on an EU-wide basis to prevent any distortion of activity within the Union.  Others have a different view about whether it should apply to a smaller grouping in the EU.  We must see what proposals emerge and how they evolve but much work remains to be done in this area.</P>

	<P>In recognition of institutional shortcomings, several important governance improvements were endorsed last week.  There are many dimensions to this including the following arrangements: Heads of State or Government of the euro area will meet at least twice a year in euro summits to strengthen euro area governance and ensure closer integration; there will be a president of the euro summit; the EU Commissioner for economic and financial affairs has been given additional functions; and, various changes at official level to improve matters are envisaged.  In addition, the President of the European Council has been given a mandate to identify possible steps to strengthen the economic union, including exploring the possibility of limited treaty changes.  An interim report will be presented in December 2011 and a final report by next March.  Our view is that governance reform is absolutely necessary because there is no point in addressing the symptoms without addressing the underlying root causes.  In other words, the Government&rsquo;s view is that every appropriate step should be taken to avoid a recurrence of the difficulties confronting us.  We are supportive of enhanced economic governance within the euro area.  The lesson from the current predicament is simple &mdash; being part of a monetary union requires effective co-ordination and surveillance of monetary and fiscal policies and this can only be achieved through an adequate and balanced system of governance.</P>
        <P>With regard to further economic integration within the euro area, we look forward to considering the interim report on strengthening the economic union within the euro area that President Van Rompuy will present in December 2011.  We welcome the proposals from the Commission to strengthen the role of the Commissioner for economic and financial affairs as well.  It is important to recognise that a series of significant measures are already in place including the European semester, which is proving its worth by ensuring a co-ordinated, flexible and effective system of budgetary planning at member state and EU level.  In addition, a series of legislative reforms to improve economic governance has been agreed and will be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I outline some of the main guiding principles regarding our approach to the governance debate as it moves to the next stage.  Ireland is firmly in favour of improved, balanced governance that offers correct safeguards.  We believe this is in all our interests.  The urgency of the current situation demands prioritisation of value-added measures that will be implemented quickly and preferably within the existing treaty.  We must see and then assess any proposals that may require treaty change.  We propose that institutional balance must be maintained, avoiding excessive use of intergovernmental methods where possible and respecting the role and expertise of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>I have outlined the comprehensive strategy to address the euro area sovereign debt crisis which, if fully implemented, will put the euro area back on the right path.  However, the announcement by the Greek authorities that the adjustment programme is to be put to a referendum has put a spanner in the works and has contributed in no small part to renewed market turbulence.  This is unfortunate and has added to uncertainty in the euro area.  Obviously, it is in all our interests to minimise this uncertainty and to enhance confidence with regard to the euro area.  Therefore, the sooner clarity is restored, the better for us all.  Ireland is doing its part to resolve the euro area crisis.  The fourth quarterly review by the troika was successfully completed recently.  The mission has concluded that the programme is on track and our funding partners are firmly of the view that Ireland continues to make tangible progress in all the key areas.</P>
        <P>Market sentiment towards Ireland has improved, with a clear decoupling from other programme countries evident since the summer.  While sentiment is not yet consistent with a return to market-based funding, we are moving in the right direction.  Of course, we cannot and will not be complacent.  I want to assure the House that the Government will continue to act <Col N="280"/>appropriately and decisively.  Ireland will continue to deliver on its programme and work our way back to the markets, and we are making real headway.</P>
        <P>The summit last week represents a major step forward for Europe and for the euro area in particular.  The adoption of a comprehensive package to tackle the crisis is an important development.  While many details remain to be ironed out, we are on the right track.  It will still be a bumpy ride ahead, as we have seen in recent days, but we must remain confident and continue on the right path.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned, the EU and the euro area in particular have come a very long way over the past year or so.  The decisions of the Heads of State and Government on 26 October were another key step forward in that process.  We now need to ensure that we implement these decisions as soon as possible and continue to act together to tackle the crisis facing the euro area.  As has been said on a number of occasions, the euro area member states will act to restore confidence and do whatever is necessary to protect financial stability in the euro area.  The decisions of 26 October must be seen in that context.  I look forward to the contributions of Deputies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his opening remarks on this critical issue.  At a time of deepening crisis across the eurozone, which is spreading beyond it to the global economy, it is appropriate that we are in the House today and are being given an opportunity to make our contributions.  The debate can sometimes seem abstract to people at home who are watching what is happening in Greece and turbulence in the stock markets, and they can understandably ask how it affects them and their families.  The answer is quite straightforward.  It affects people in a very real way, something I will discuss.</P>
        <P>If proof were needed, there is evidence that Ireland could potentially be affected by the turbulence in the eurozone, namely the decision of the EFSF today to postpone a bond auction of &euro;3 billion which was earmarked for Ireland as part of the programme of assistance with the EU and IMF.  I assume it has no impact on the funding position of the State, even though bonds are maturing in November.  However, it serves to highlight the possible implications for Ireland if the crisis is not resolved decisively and with some speed.  That is the fundamental issue we all want to see dealt with.</P>
        <P>We are in a bailout programme with the EU, the IMF and the ECB.  In a sense we are insulated from movements in the markets, in particular the cost of borrowing which is beneficial for Ireland at this time.  We do not have to go to the markets at a time when there is such volatility in the cost of borrowing for other eurozone members, a point which is worth making.  We do not want to see a situation develop where the tranches of funding we have to draw down from the EU and IMF are jeopardised by turbulence in the markets.  It was significant that the bond auction had to be postponed today by the EFSF but it is to be hoped it will take place shortly.</P>
        <P>The Government will announce the new medium-term fiscal framework on Friday.  There are potential implications for Ireland because the question of our debt sustainability and economic recovery is very much tied up with the wider economic situation in Europe.  We are focused on an export-led recovery.  We are doing very well with exports but if our main trading partners in the eurozone and the UK are struggling to generate growth in their economies inevitably the demand for goods and services produced in Ireland will be affected.  The single most danger<Col N="281"/>ous threat to our economic recovery is a weakened eurozone and global economy.  It is a very real threat.</P>
        <P>At the end of this week the Government will outline its new growth forecasts for 2012.  The 2.5% growth forecast for GDP now looks wholly optimistic and will be significantly downgraded.  If the media reports over the weekend are to be believed, a percentage point will be deducted and the growth projection for next year will probably be in the range of 1.5% which has budgetary implications, as the Minister outlined.  Every 1% growth in GDP that is not achieved impacts on State revenue to the tune of about &euro;800 million.  Economic growth is absolutely central to our economic prospects, debt sustainability and Ireland returning to the bond markets as a sovereign country again, something we all aspire to.</P>
        <P>The October Exchequer returns have been released. I have not received any information on them but I hope they are in line with the budget adopted last December and we are continuing to make progress on the public finances.  It is a central element of our efforts in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Greek situation could hardly be more serious.  I was somewhat shocked and surprised when I read that the Greek Prime Minister decided to call a referendum on the outcome of the European summit negotiations.  The main issue it raises is that the certainty we all hoped for and investors were optimistic about following the summit of 26 October has now been replaced with huge uncertainty and turbulence in the markets.  There were stock market collapses yesterday on a par with those in the autumn of 2008, a place to which we have returned.</P>
        <P>Prime Minister Papandreou is meeting the German Chancellor and President Sarkozy this evening.  I am sure there will be some straight talking, as there needs to be.  From a democratic point of view it is commendable that he wishes to put the proposal to the Greek people.  It would give it democratic legitimacy.  However, there are also huge risks involved.  There will now be a vacuum for an undefined period of time.  The timing of the referendum is not clear.  Whether the Greeks have the capacity to hold it before Christmas is seriously open to question.</P>
        <P>There are elements of the communiqu&eacute; from the summit that have yet to be finalised.  Even if the Greeks were ready to press a button on a referendum tomorrow they do not have a full package of measures to put before the people.  It is not clear what question or questions will be put to the Greek people.  It may well be a political calculation by Mr. Papandreou.</P>
        <P>The Greeks have already obtained a substantially better deal than that which was negotiated last July.  They now understand that when the referendum is put before the people, as seems increasingly likely provided the Government survives a vote of confidence on Friday, the eyes of not just Europe but the world will be on Greece.  The question of additional concessions for Greece may be on the table.</P>
        <P>The German Foreign Minister made it clear today that the deal was not open to negotiation and was concluded in Brussels on 26 October.  I would not be surprised if the Greeks made a calculation that there was more to give on the various issues under discussion.</P>
        <P>It would be in all our interests if that referendum were held as quickly as possible.  In light of the fact that Greece has not held a referendum since 1974 and given its record on issues relating to corporate governance, financial control and public administration, one is obliged to question the capacity of that country to hold and administer a referendum successfully in a short period.  It is to be hoped, however, that it will be able to do so.  It is critically important that the vacuum created which gave rise to the carnage that took place on the stock markets yesterday and, to a lesser extent, today be replaced by an element of certainty.  Such certainty is essential.</P>

        <P>Clearly, the elephant in the room is Italy.  While the entire focus has been on Greece, rightly so, as a result of the forthcoming referendum to be held there, the situation in Italy is becoming more serious by the day.  Its cost of borrowing increased to 6.3% yesterday and remains at over 6% today.  A country with a debt of &euro;1.9 trillion &mdash; equating to approximately 120% of GDP &mdash; faces fundamental questions about the sustainability of that debt.  I am aware that emergency <Col N="282"/>meetings are taking place in Italy today in advance of the G20 meeting tomorrow.  The commitments which Mr. Berlusconi made to his European colleagues will have to be honoured in full.  However, the issue of the sustainability of Italian debt is coming centre stage.  The fact that the existing eurozone infrastructure simply does not possess the capacity to bail out a country of Italy&rsquo;s size is one which must be confronted.  It is clear that Italy is relying almost entirely on the interventions of the ECB in the markets in order to keep its bond spreads within reasonable parameters.  However, I wonder how sustainable it is for that country to continue to borrow at rates of over 6% when programme countries such as Ireland, Greece and Portugal can access funding through the EFSF at a rate of approximately 3%.  That is a question for which an answer must be provided.  The Italian stock market dropped by 6.8% in value yesterday, the largest decline since October 2008.  This provides a measure of the crisis in Italy and throughout the wider eurozone.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I wish to deal with some of the individual elements of the communiqu&eacute; signed in Brussels on 26 October.  Moving from a position where the Greeks were offered a discount of 21% on sovereign bonds held by European financial institutions in July to one where they are being offered a discount of 50% demonstrates the extent to which summit meetings can be affected by an air of unreality.  The most recent summit is one of a series which have singularly failed to address the current crisis in a meaningful way.  This is particularly evident when one considers the increase in the discount on offer, from 21% to 50%, in just a few months.  Some commentators have pointed out that because the bonds held by state institutions and European authorities will not be subject to the haircut, the actual discount on overall Greek debt will be approximately 20%.  That fact appears to have been lost in the general debate.</P>
        <P>Spain was the subject of comment in the communiqu&eacute; and is going to be obliged to deal with serious challenges in its economy and the difficulties with which it is faced.  Ireland is commended in the communiqu&eacute; for the progress made in the full implementation of its adjustment programme which is delivering positive results.  This is true, to an extent.  However, the Minister is a practising politician.  He is well aware that the people will not agree with the assertion made in the communiqu&eacute; and that they will not see any tangible difference until jobs begin to be created and the 450,000 individuals on the live register are given a measure of hope and some grounds for optimism.  All Members are focused on ensuring the latter will happen as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I will not discuss at length the issue of the bond relating to Anglo Irish Bank that was redeemed earlier today.  This matter has been well and truly debated, both inside and outside the House.  However, I disagree with the ECB&rsquo;s analysis.  I accept that there are risks involved from the point of view of the Government and that the Minister is now in a position to fully appreciate the difference between being on this side of the House and on the opposite side.  The risks to which I refer must be weighed up in a more careful way, particularly in the light of the level of turbulence in the markets.  The extraordinary cost &mdash; &euro;64 billion or over 40% of GDP &mdash; the State has been obliged to take on in order to recapitalise the banks does not compare to that taken on by any other country in Europe or elsewhere.</P>
        <P>Some recognition must be given in this matter.  The bond to which I refer was paid earlier today.  However, Ireland&rsquo;s case in redesigning the promissory note structure must have been strengthened by recent developments.  I admit that the promissory note structure was costly, but it was put in place at a time when Ireland simply did not have &euro;30 billion to recapitalise Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  It was developed at a time when there was no European fund of which Ireland could avail in order to lessen the burden in bailing out Anglo-Irish Bank.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="283"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The EFSF is being established as a lender of last resort and will come into play following the injection of any available funding by the private sector and national governments.  However, its existence will mean that countries across Europe which need to recapitalise their banks will ultimately be able to avail of a relatively cheap source of funding at a rate of approximately 3%.  This highlights the exceptional case for Ireland to press for the promissory note structure to be redesigned.</P>
        <P>Everyone wants the elements of the deal agreed on 26 October to be finalised.  This will allow the Greek Government to put the matter to its people in a referendum at the earliest possible opportunity. The outcome of that referendum will indicate whether Greece will remain in the euro and whether it will accept the terms of the second bailout deal.  It is clear that the situation in Greece is contaminating the remainder of the eurozone and the global economy.  We must continue to focus on domestic issues and exert pressure on our colleagues across Europe in order that this matter is put to bed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is one word which sums up Irish and European political leaders during the past week, it is &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.   In Brussels last Wednesday the European Council failed to reach the promised and much hyped comprehensive deal to end the eurozone crisis.  Later that day the leaders of the European Council and the European Commission, together with the IMF and leaders of Europe&rsquo;s banking sector, failed to reach a workable deal to stabilise the financial system.  Once again, the Irish Government failed to even get a seat at the table when the most important discussions were taking place.  It is not as if this would really have mattered, particularly when one considers the position taken by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach on their way to Brussels.  In advance of negotiations that would see the Greek Government secure a reduction in its debt burden, the Irish Government stated unequivocally &mdash; not for the first time &mdash; that it would honour all of its debts, including those which do not even belong to it, namely, the toxic banking debt with which we were saddled by the previous Administration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Gone were the pre-election promise not to pay a single cent more of toxic private banking debt, the promise to amend legislation &mdash; contained in the programme for Government &mdash; to allow for the restructuring of unsecured and unguaranteed senior bonds and the promise the Minister made in Washington last June to the effect that senior unguaranteed bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank would be burned.  Once again, the Irish delegation sat through a eurozone summit and asked for nothing, offered nothing and quietly hoped that something would be thrown its way.  When the serious discussions were taking place between the European Union, the IMF and the banks, where was the Irish delegation?  It was either in an hotel or on its way back home.  When Greece was securing a reduction of 40% in its debt-to-GDP ratio, did the Minister even ask whether we could obtain a similar reduction?  In the discussions in which he engaged at the summit, did he make the case for a reduction in the private banking debt imposed on the taxpayer by the previous Government?  Did the Taoiseach raise these issues?  Unfortunately, I and many others know the Minister did not.  While Greece secured a debt write-down, our Government gave a promise to force Irish taxpayers to pay every cent of toxic private banking debt, even where there is no legal or moral obligation on the Minister or his colleagues to do so.</P>
        <P>If this was not bad enough, the Minister then came back home and told people the deal signed was in our interests.  He told us this agreement would help stabilise the euro and assist Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  Worse than that, he suggested we were lucky not to have secured a debt write-down.  He explained that had we had such misfortune, we would have been saddled <Col N="284"/>with a decade &mdash; 16 years was trotted out by the Government &mdash; of deep austerity.  These claims are untrue.  It is sad the Minister has reduced himself to the level of throwing out this nonsense on the airwaves in an attempt to confuse listeners.</P>
        <P>Today, Greece&rsquo;s debt-to-GDP ratio stands at 180%.  The write-down struck last week in Brussels will see that ratio reduce to 120% over ten years.  Even then, Greece&rsquo;s debt will not be sustainable.  Ireland&rsquo;s debt-to-GDP ratio, however, is nowhere near that figure.  According to the Department&rsquo;s prediction, it will peak at 118% in several years&rsquo; time.  A write-down similar to Greece&rsquo;s would bring our debt-to-GDP ratio down to between 70% and 80%.  Would Ireland suffer 16 years of austerity?  Would we have no moneys to pay our doctors and nurses?  Has Greece no moneys to pay its nurses and doctors?  Of course it has.  It is still in a programme and yet it gets a 50% write-down of its debt.  The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance, along with other Government spokespersons, tried to confuse the people with rubbish last week, however.  This was done in an attempt to put on a brave face when in fact the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance walked away from a crucial negotiation after betraying the people and the commitments they made in the elections only eight months ago.  The Minister for Finance was reduced to telling absolute lies and trying to confuse the people.</P>

	<P>What the Government is involved in is deeply dishonest.  It is hardly surprising the Government has not been able to do its maths.  It still does not know the full cost to the taxpayer of the Anglo Irish promissory note.  It is confused on the scale of the national debt to the order of a staggering &euro;3.6 billion.  All of this is now academic, however, as it appears the Government never even sought a debt write-down.  It prefers to continue with a policy that makes every man, woman and child in this State pay for the mistakes of bankers, developers and politicians rather than force the banks to pay their fair share.</P>
        <P>Today of all days, when taxpayers&rsquo; money has been used by Anglo Irish Bank to pay over &euro;700 million to a bondholder, does the Minister not think it is time to come clean on his policy on toxic banking debt?  The people have a right to know if the Government has abandoned its pre-election promises and programme for Government commitments.  If so, when did the Cabinet abandon the policy of seeking to impose losses on private banking debt?  What did the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, say when the Minister told her about paying this bondholder after his conversation with Trichet?  She jumped up and down on these Opposition benches about imposing burden sharing on unguaranteed bondholders.  How did she react when the Minister for Finance told the Cabinet that even though the bond was sold on at 20 cent in the euro, the Government must pay the full 100 cent?  What did she say when the Minister added Ireland would have to pay another &euro;1.25 billion on unguaranteed bonds to Anglo Irish Bank on 24 January 2012?  Did the Labour Party Cabinet members say anything against this or did they just vote to put the people to the slaughter and come up with more austerity measures so the people can bail out these high finance bankers who lent recklessly to Anglo Irish Bank?</P>
        <P>This is not the commitment the Government entered into with the people before the last general election.  In the past eight months, the Minister has done little to reduce the debt burden on ordinary families.  While he may wax lyrical about the reduction of the bailout interest rate, which is to be welcomed, it must be remembered it only happened because of the Greek situation.  These were crumbs thrown from the table.  The Government&rsquo;s approach is ask for nothing, expect nothing but welcome everything.</P>
        <P>Last week was the Minister&rsquo;s golden opportunity.  He could have argued that our debt levels were unsustainable and that the toxic private banking debt was not the responsibility of the Irish, or indeed the German or French taxpayer.  He could have argued the Irish Government should not be liable for the infamous Anglo Irish Bank promissory note with which Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party saddled us.</P>
        <P>Instead, he did nothing.  Consequently, hundreds of thousands of people will remain on the dole because money that could have been used to invest in job creation will be wasted paying off toxic banking debts.  Tens of thousands of people will fall into mortgage arrears because the Government refuses to consider making the banks shoulder their fair share of the cost of the crisis.  A whole generation of young people will be forced to seek a future abroad because the Government refuses to break with the failed Fianna F&aacute;il policy of putting the interests of <Col N="286"/>banks and bondholders before the interests of our children&rsquo;s education and our grandparents&rsquo; health care.</P>
        <P>At least the Greek Prime Minister, George Papandreou, had the decency to seek a mandate for his austerity policies.  While his move has come a little late in the day and his motivations are far from noble, he has given the people the final say.</P>
        <P>What was the Government&rsquo;s response to this development?  The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, talked about hand grenades.  That is some way to talk about the will of the people.  Is this how the Government sees the exercise of democracy, as a hand grenade thrown into the machinations of unelected political elites in the European Commission and Central Bank?  God forbid that we ask the people their opinion on matters that will impact on their lives and those of their children and grandchildren.  God forbid we seek a mandate for policies that put bondholders and hedge funds before citizens.  The Government&rsquo;s disregard for the basic principles of democracy is a matter of record.  Deputies opposite disregarded the will of the people after the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  They continue, in government, to disregard the will of the people by denying them a referendum on the current bailout programme and on the future of the European Stability Mechanism.  I repeat Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s demand for a referendum on the policies of bank bailout and austerity contained in the EU-IMF programme and the proposed changes to the European Financial Stability Facility and the future permanent bailout mechanism, the ESM.  The Minister has failed once again to stand up for the interests of Irish people.  His meek and cowardly acceptance of the European Commission and European Central Bank&rsquo;s policies of bank bailout and crippling austerity is nothing short of social and economic sabotage, forced on a population which only eight months ago voted his party into office on a promise of change.  How those voters must regret their decision.</P>
        <P>Regarding the detail of the deal announced last week in Brussels, the Minister can at least take comfort in the fact that his failure is shared in equal measure among his counterparts in the European Council.  This was the 14th eurozone crisis summit and it followed what has become a predictable pattern.  First we have the hype, with talk of the summit to end the crisis and the deal to calm the markets.  Then we have the last-minute rush to dampen expectations as the inevitable disagreements, particularly between the French and Germans, once again appear unsurmountable.  After that we have the summit itself running late into the night, followed by a hastily cobbled together half-agreement which is big on rhetoric but short on detail.  The following morning we have political leaders basking in the initially positive market reaction before the inevitable unravelling of the deal as the unworked out detail is exposed and the markets once again take fright.</P>
        <P>The same problems emerge time after time.  The European leaders simply do not understand the causes of the crisis and, as a consequence, are unable to devise the solutions to bring it to an end.  Instead, everything they do makes it worse, with more austerity imposed on already suffering populations in deeply indebted countries.  Is it any wonder Greece is in such chaos?  The policy of  bank bailout is continued despite the lack of certainty as to the size of the black hole at the heart of the European banking system.  Last week the Minister and his European colleagues agreed to increase massively the funds available to the EFSF.  In doing so they dramatically increased the exposure of ordinary European taxpayers to that toxic black hole.  They fixed the EFSF so well that they cannot even go to the bond markets today to raise &euro;3 billion for Ireland.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with many of the points raised by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  All of the summits have adhered to a trend whereby we get a great sense of optimism in the lead-up followed immediately afterwards by a degree of rallying on the markets before sober reality kicks in some days later and any gains are lost.  Europe has proved unsuccessful to date in solving the main problems it faces.  The Minister claimed in a radio interview last week that the euro now looks secure, that Europe will return to growth and that the threat of a recession emanating from Europe has been removed.  Those claims are surely somewhat optimistic.</P>
        <P>Several major questions emerged from last week&rsquo;s summit, namely, whether it would make Greece viable; whether the banks would be able to increase their capital ratios without causing another credit crunch; where would the money come from for the EFSF; would it take the heat off Italy; and, what are the chances of improving Europe&rsquo;s growth prospects.  The notion that Greece will be able to reduce its debt to 120% of GDP by 2020 is grossly optimistic.  That target is calculated on the basis that the country will have an average annual growth rate of 2% in the next nine years.  Given that it is currently at minus 5.5%, such a positive prediction is stretching credibility.  Moreover, the markets have indicated that Greece will need to reduce its debt to approximately 80% of GDP before they will resume lending to it.  Developments in recent days bear out the reality that Greece is far from out of the woods.</P>
        <P>In regard to banking, European banks have been quite open in their indications that in order to deleverage they will either refuse to extend credit or else call in loans which they would not otherwise have called in so quickly.  We all know how difficult it is to secure credit in the current environment.  If the European banks become as closed as their Irish counterparts, it does not bode well for Europe&rsquo;s growth prospects.</P>
        <P>On the EFSF, we will have to adopt a wait and see approach.  The facility seems to have been divided into two sections: first, a special-purpose investment vehicle which there is a reliance on the Chinese to fund; and, second, an insurance fund which will indemnify investors against the first 20% of any losses on sovereign bond purchases.  Given that we are already at 50% in the case of the Greek debt, it is difficult to see how the EFSF will be Europe&rsquo;s saviour.  Moreover, it will not function as a lender of last resort; that is not the German plan.</P>
        <P>With regard to growth, I remain to be convinced that the austerity measures being promoted by European leaders will stimulate growth.  Rather, Europe will likely be obliged to do aU-turn on this issue.  Krugman and Stiglitz have been shouting from the rooftops for several years that austerity will not bring about the growth we are seeking.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Although it is a done deal at this stage, I wish to comment on what happened earlier today.  To find an analogy one must imagine a sign outside Boylesports or Paddy Power advising customers that they need not worry if their horse, dog or team loses because their bet will pay out regardless.  That is what has happened with the decision to pay &euro;750 million to unsecured bondholders at Anglo Irish Bank.  We are rewarding speculators who gambled and lost.  We seem to feel some moral obligation to pay these people, many of whom bought at a discount and are thus reaping substantial profits.  These are nameless, faceless entities; the Taoiseach has acknowledged he does not know who they are.  Deputy Joe Higgins <Col N="288"/>made an interesting suggestion about a Greek person; it certainly does not say much for Greek patriotism that all of this money is apparently out of the country.</P>
        <P>The situation in which we find ourselves is the responsibility of the previous Government and, as such, it is difficult to listen to the objections of Fianna F&aacute;il Members.  Theirs was a quick-fix solution which has come back to haunt us.  I hope there are no more quick-fix solutions when it comes to selling State assets.  The Taoiseach said this morning that paying this money is in the best interests of the people.  The Minister said on radio this morning that it is not in Ireland&rsquo;s interest to impose a cut on bondholders.  I am still trying to figure out how it is in Ireland&rsquo;s best interest to honour a gamble.  I am certainly in favour of honouring our obligations, but where is the morality in honouring this particular debt?  Why have Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s unsecured bondholders  &mdash; gamblers and speculators &mdash; been deemed a priority?</P>
        <P>Was any consideration given to paying a reduced rate, which would have made significant savings for the country?  Where is the liability for this country&rsquo;s taxpayers to pay the bondholders?  The latter expect justice, but where is the justice for ordinary Irish people?  Saving the euro and keeping the ECB happy seems to be the mantra of Government.  That is fine, but where are the concessions for Ireland, which is playing the role of the dutiful child?  It does not make sense to pay out &euro;700 million on a failed bond from a failed bank.  It is ludicrous to give these people precedence over our citizens.</P>
        <P>The new eurozone debt deal seeks to counteract the threat of a European crisis and a double-dip recession and to minimise the risk of contagion to weakened eurozone countries.  Sovereign and private investors from countries such as China are being sought.  The concerns over the inroads that country is making in certain developing countries does not augur well for any such co-operation.  I am not sure that Greece has secured a better deal.  The package is extremely severe, with cuts in the public sector, reductions in pay and pensions, new taxes and privatisation of services.  There is a need for us to renegotiate our debt repayments.  Many believe that if our bailout terms are reduced, Ireland will enjoy higher economic growth.  This morning the Minister intimated the possibility of a lower interest rate.  Our priority should be this country; we should not get caught in the crossfire between European countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Several times today and as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the Taoiseach said the policy of the Government was to ensure growth, not default, a message that was repeated by the Minister.  Is it not more correct to say the Government&rsquo;s policy is one of a wing and a prayer, namely, to comply with all of the terms of the troika bailout, follow to the letter the orders from the ECB and in the process inflict austerity on the people and the economy which neither can afford and then hope for the best?</P>
        <P>We cannot get out of the mess we are in without growth in the economy, and we cannot achieve the level of growth needed if the Government continues with the savage austerity programme of the past three years, taking &euro;20 billion out of the economy in cuts and taxes, and plans to take out another &euro;10 billion in the next three years.  People expected more from it.  Continuing with this level of austerity is not a strategy for growth but, at best, a strategy for very low growth and stagnation, with mass unemployment, high emigration and the dismantling of essential services.  Is it not obvious that the problems of Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland cannot be solved by austerity?  Surely we should learn the lesson of Greece, the economy of which is expected to contract by 7% this year and must now face ten more years of austerity.  If the Greek referendum is held, there is little doubt about what the result will be.</P>
        <P>In the same way that the Government has no strategy for growth, the solutions from the EU summit contain no strategy for growth, no strategy to deal with the 17 million jobless, to respond to the OECD prediction that the growth rate in the euro area will be a mere 0.3% in <Col N="289"/>2012, and to deal with the &euro;16.5 trillion debt in the European Union.  There is not a snowball&rsquo;s chance in hell of any of this working and it is only a matter of time before Italy seeks a bailout and the Greeks default.  The idea that we can decouple from these problems by following the programme laid down for us is ludicrous.  Instead of decoupling, why are we not linking up with Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal to demand real solutions?  Why are we not telling Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy that if they want to save the euro and the German and French banks and the peoples of Europe, they need to put their hands in their pockets and challenge the dictatorship of the market?  The people are not prepared to stand by and take the austerity measures which are not in our interests and will not solve the problems or deliver growth.  The Government should give the people the opportunity to vote on this issue in a referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past week Chancellor Angela Merkel said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Nobody should take for granted another 50 years of peace and prosperity in Europe ... That&rsquo;s why I say: if the euro fails, Europe fails.  We have an historical obligation: to protect by all means Europe&rsquo;s unification process begun by our forefathers after centuries of hatred and blood spill.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Someone should remind Chancellor Merkel that it was her country that started the Second World War.  It was her country&rsquo;s lust for control that led to the deaths of millions of innocent people.  While there were obviously contributory factors as to why this happened, it would not have happened without the acquiescence of a large proportion of the German population.  In order that we do not face such a prospect again, is she seriously saying we must all be subsumed into a united Europe with Germany calling the shots?</P>
        <P>In the 1990s I spent two and a half years living in Germany, during which time I visited Dachau Concentration Camp.  I was curious as to why such a place remained open as a museum and they had never bulldozed it and moved on.  The answer I was given was that people should never forget.  It appears that Chancellor Merkel has certainly forgotten one thing, that people do not want to have Germany in control of their lives, whether it be as a result of a war or financial threats.  She should also remember that one of the reasons given for the Second World War and the rise of extreme right-wing politicians was that the German people and state had been treated too harshly after the First World War.  Now she wants the people of Ireland to suffer extreme austerity as a punishment for the crimes of a previous Government.  It is this very pressure which increases the chances of Europe falling apart and descending into mayhem.</P>
        <P>What real lessons has Chancellor Merkel learned from the catastrophe of war?  We hear that she is incandescent with rage at the idea of a referendum being held in Greece.  In other words, we again have a German leader who is annoyed that a sovereign state is making its own decisions through a legitimate democratic process.  She is also forcing us to put the interests of gamblers in the bond markets before those of people with special needs, old people and the most vulnerable in our society.  In the past week it has also become clear that one of the ways her dream of European integration is being kept alive is by borrowing money from China, a country which to this day has concentration camps.</P>
        <P>Many people, including Anthony Coughlan, warned that the process of monetary union would end in tears and the only way it would work was by having complete fiscal union.  At the time we were told this was not necessary as a way of fobbing off those who did not want to see further integration into a European super state.  Now that the inevitable has come to pass, we are being told that full fiscal union is the only way forward by the very ones who denied it was a requirement in the first place.</P><Col N="290"/>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I commend the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, for the work he has been doing.  Everybody agrees he has risen to the most difficult task with which he was presented on the formation of the Government.  I record my admiration and that of the people of Limerick to whom I listen for the work he is doing in responding to the difficulties presented to him.</P>
        <P>We are dealing with economics in a very harsh way.  I would like to deal with the social aspect which is often depicted in economic terms.  I refer to some information I gathered in undertaking some research into the social aspects of default and a reneging on agreements made by a previous Government and changing the approach taken.  This was outlined very clearly prior to this debate when the Minister was responding to a Topical Issue debate, which I found extremely informative.</P>
        <P>People are talking about default as a solution.  Earlier this year Louise McBride in a <i>Sunday Independent</i> article analysed the effect a default would have on the social fabric of the State and how it would affect the people.  It could be debated that default might be an economic solution, but what would be the social implications?  It would destroy our international reputation and there would be serious implications for life opportunities and the standing of our citizens.  We might decide to leave the eurozone, but if we were to default, it is likely we would be thrown out of the eurozone and revert back to our own currency.  It is likely that the value of the Irish currency would collapse causing a currency crisis as happened in Argentina.  Before that country defaulted on its foreign debt in 2001, the Argentinian peso was on a par with the US dollar.  After the default, it lost 70% of its value.  Mr. Kevin O&rsquo;Doherty, a director of Compliance Ireland, has claimed that a default would probably result in the value of savings being wiped out and make it impossible for people to get their hands on their savings.  He claims that if Ireland defaults on its foreign debt and reintroduces the punt most of the money in our bank accounts would be in punts rather than euro and as such given the economic situation in the country the value of the punt would plummet; the value of savings would decrease as the currency depreciated, and people with life savings in a credit union would find the value of them diminished as the cost of foreign goods and services became more expensive.</P>
        <P>I am quoting the experts in this area because I am not an expert but believe both sides of an argument should be presented.  Mr. Cian Twomey, a lecturer in financial economics at NUI Galway, claims that if Ireland defaults and leaves the eurozone the value of people&rsquo;s savings would be halved, our savings would be worth 50% to 70% less in punts than they would have been in euro and that people might also find themselves locked out of their savings accounts.  When Argentina defaulted in 2001, the Argentine Government froze deposits to prevent savers converting them into a more valuable foreign currency.  It also restricted the amount of money Argentinians could withdraw from their accounts to 250 pesos &mdash; &euro;135 &mdash; per week.  Not long afterwards it was common to see Argentinians search for ATMs that were not empty.  Also, people could lose their savings if their bank or credit union went bust.</P>
        <P>The Irish Government currently guarantees savings of up to &euro;100,000 and in excess of that figure in particular circumstances.  In this regard, Mr. Twomey asks, &ldquo;If Ireland defaults, how would the Government continue to guarantee deposits?&rdquo;  The Government can only continue to guarantee deposits if its ability to borrow is guaranteed.  If Ireland defaults on its EU-IMF loans, the chances of anyone lending it money at non-prohibitive interest rates are slim.  More than &euro;100 billion worth of savings were withdrawn from Irish banks last year amid fears caused by our banking crisis.  If Ireland defaults and the Government, as did the Argentinians, clamps <Col N="291"/>down on savings, billions of euro could leave the country.  In this regard Mr. O&rsquo;Doherty claims that people with a little money would fly off to France and other European countries to open euro bank accounts.  Some believe that if Ireland leaves the eurozone a person with a cheap tracker mortgage might have to kiss goodbye to it.  According to Mr. O&rsquo;Doherty, interest rates on such mortgages could be set to Irish punts, which means one&rsquo;s ECB tracker would disappear.  A tracker mortgage is a contract which a person has with a bank.  As such, the question of whether a person would lose his or her tracker mortgage if Ireland left the eurozone remains to be seen.  In circumstances where interest rates on mortgages are tied to the Irish punt, following an Irish exit of the eurozone, they would soar.</P>
        <P>Less than 20 years ago a currency crisis hit Ireland.  The Irish punt was devalued by 10% and Irish interest rates reached unprecedented levels.  Mortgage interest rates in Ireland climbed as high as 16% in 1993.  What would be the level of interest rates if our currency was to devalue by 50% to 70% against the euro?  Those who have taken out a loan from a European bank would also be in deep trouble.  An Irish citizen being paid in punts would find it much harder to repay a mortgage in euro as the punt would rapidly be worth less than the euro.  What would be the situation if Ireland followed the footsteps of other countries that have defaulted?  When Argentina defaulted, it expropriated pension funds transforming them into Government bank loans to service debt.  The price of goods in foreign countries embroiled in currency crises has exploded.</P>
        <P>A few months after default, inflation in Argentina hit 30%.  The same would probably happen here.  Domestic prices, including for newspapers or milk, would remain the same because they would be in punts as devalued.  However, Mr. O&rsquo;Doherty claims the cost of products produced outside of Ireland, including foreign holidays, cars and half of what consumers purchase in the supermarkets, given 50% of what we purchase in supermarkets is sourced outside this country, would become much more unaffordable.  The only positive of a currency crisis would be for tourists whose foreign dollars or euro would be twice or triple the value of the Irish punt.</P>
        <P>As regards what might happen in terms of social welfare, the Department of Finance &mdash; I accept some might be concerned about taking its view on board &mdash; claims that if Ireland defaults on the EU-IMF loan it would no longer have the financial support it needed to plug the massive budget deficit.  The Government would have to unleash spending cuts of &euro;18 billion to fund itself.  To achieve this the Government could slash by one third, child benefit, dole payments, State pensions and public sector wages for our doctors, nurses, local authority workers and those working in other sectors.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the eurozone and related financial matters, which issues have been the main topic of discussion today not alone in the House but throughout the country at large and will remain so for some time to come.</P>
        <P>The problem we have at European level is a financial one.  Part of the problem is that politicians believe they can solve what is not a political problem.  I have said on a couple of occasions during the past few months that the solution put forward by politicians, despite their being the democratically elected leaders of their countries, might not necessarily be the right solution.  Unless the financial basics underlying political agreements are corrected, they will not hold.</P><Col N="292"/>
        <P>The recently held fourth summit of Heads of State and Government was a failure despite the Taoiseach returning home and expressing his pleasure with the outcome of it.  The problem that is not being dealt with by the various governments is the level of deficit likely to be run up each year by governments.  Not alone Greece, Ireland and Italy but practically every country in the EU, and eurozone in particular, are running deficits.  Germany is to a small extent doing the same.  A country that is running a deficit year-in and year-out must borrow money year-in, year-out, resulting in an increasing accumulation in debt taking account of borrowings and interest rates.  This issue is not being tackled at source.  The EU is simply trying to deal with the mountain of debt.  The mountain of debt is not what is causing pain for citizens across Europe in whose countries austerity measures are being implemented, including in Greece and Ireland.  There needs to be consideration of how to cut budget deficits on a year to year basis to ensure we do not continue to add to the debt mountain.  This has not yet been fully grasped.</P>
        <P>While Greece might have been offered a 50% reduction in its debt, Greek people will have to suffer enormous pain to achieve that by way of cutbacks in expenditure and increased taxation.  The two issues are separate.  I believe there is a specific problem facing the 17 members of the eurozone.  I also believe in the euro currency.  It is a good idea that has not been given an opportunity to work.  I support a common euro currency throughout Europe.  I would like to see all 27 members of the EU become members of the eurozone area.   The problem is that we set up a euro currency without putting in place the infrastructure to support it.</P>
        <P>As I recall, in recent years, the operation of that currency could be compared to a facade of a building.  It looked good and everybody had the currency in their hands and in their bank accounts.  We believed we had a real currency like the US dollar.  However, we did not have the financial infrastructure in place to back it up, as in one central bank equivalent to the US Federal Reserve.  There are 17 mini-central banks in the eurozone and a governor from each of these banks goes to the European Central Bank to try to operate on a European basis.  This is not the best way to run a central bank.  I acknowledge there needs to be direct input from the various countries but a currency must be managed and it is not just a case of keeping everyone happy.  This is what has happened in recent times.  Greater monetary union will be required but fiscal union and agreement on taxation rates and various other expenditure measures cannot be undertaken on a European-wide basis.  The United States of America comprises 50 states and different local economic circumstances apply, but there is one federal reserve and one dollar which is supreme.  This has not as yet been achieved in Europe.</P>
        <P>Last week, Greece was on the trolley in the accident and emergency department.  Nobody was dealing with the European problem nor with the underlying issues.  The Greek Government arrived and it needed a Band-Aid to get it over the weekend.  Even though Heads of State believed they had done a good day&rsquo;s work, we all know this has been short-lived as a result of Prime Minister Papandreou calling a referendum.  Europe will need to be very careful that it does not chastise democratically elected leaders who for whatever reason ask their public to express their views on a particular issue.  There is a democratic deficit in Europe and this is part of the reason people are not engaging with Europe as strongly as they should be.</P>
        <P>I contrast what is happening in Europe with the situation in the United States of America.  The US has a strong currency and people believe in it and have confidence in it.  The Americans were strong enough to let Lehman Brothers fail and as recently as last weekend they were strong enough to allow MF Global, a US brokerage firm, to fail, collapse and disappear off the face of the planet.  This represents the strength of the US authorities that they would allow financial institutions, some of them bigger than most of the banks in Europe, to fail.  This is a very important point.  The dollar is strong enough to allow failures in the American financial <Col N="293"/>system.  Europe must do the same.  In recent years, Europe has been operating out of a sign of weakness.  Phoney stress tests are arranged whenever an issue arises with regard to a bank.  These tests do not examine the big issue.  No sooner do banks pass a stress test than they are in financial difficulty a few months later because the terms of reference of the stress test did not include a wide enough examination.  For example, some stress testing of banks did not deal with mortgages or with possible sovereign failure at EU level.</P>
        <P>Europe must allow banks and bankrupt financial institutions to go bust.  Ireland today is a microcosm of the European problem.  Anglo Irish Bank has a new name, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited.  There was a big debate about the billion dollar unsecured senior bondholders being repaid, but the issue goes deeper.  We must recognise that Anglo Irish Bank was bankrupt from the very beginning.  Europe would not permit us to allow Anglo Irish Bank go to the wall as it did not want a financial failure.  It insisted that we should prop up Anglo Irish Bank, that the Irish taxpayer should pay the bondholders and that the bank should be nationalised.  We have come a long way and our two pillar banks have been separated from any contagion from the former Anglo Irish Bank.  The time has come to re-privatise Anglo Irish Bank and immediately liquidate it.  The cost will then be borne by everybody who has a bond or a share or a deposit in the bank and those who have taken the risk to leave funds there.  Like any liquidation, those people will get their return of 10 cent, 30 cent or 40 cent in the euro.  The Minister knows that it could be done even though our partners in Europe may not like it.</P>
        <P>The Minister adverted in his contribution to the EU-IMF deal which stated there would be no deal if burden-sharing with senior bondholders was on the table.  The Minister was correct in this regard but Europe crossed the Rubicon last week when it agreed to a 50% write-down for Greece.  Europe now accepts there has to be burden-sharing by senior bondholders and this can now be applied to Anglo Irish Bank under its new name.  Legislation will be required to re-privatise it and the liquidator should be called in.  Any assets should be sold.  Any company going into liquidation has to take its chances.  It would be a sign of strength for the euro if a bankrupt bank is allowed to fail.  Otherwise, it will be a continuing draw on the euro if Europe does not face up to the financial realities and let a bankrupt bank go to the wall.</P>

	<P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the development of the European Union which is the conversation on everybody&rsquo;s lips.  Greece is the subject of comment every morning on national radio and Italy is the subject of comment on local radio.  This morning, the president of the Athens chamber of commerce was interviewed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; which was a sign that this world has changed.  Five years ago, a conversation about Greece would have been with regard to holiday destinations and temperature and sandy beaches.  Now we are hanging on every word of the president of the Athens chamber of commerce.  This is an evolving and serious debate which affects every individual in this country.</P>
        <P>Different degrees of the monopoly of wisdom exist in this House.  There seems to be a concrete monopoly on wisdom on the other side of the House.  I do not have a monopoly on wisdom and I am not good at predicting the future, unlike others on the other side of the House.  I like to stick to the facts and the debate should deal with what is known and what is possible.  There is uncertainty within the EU.  Following the announcement of a referendum in Greece there was an increase in this uncertainty.  Prior to the EU agreement, money had started to flow back into our banks and capital started moving back into this country.  Investors watch the situation on Twitter and anything that happens in New York is monitored instantaneously in Beijing.</P>
        <P>The Government was given a twofold mandate last February.  It was a mandate to clean up the mess and a mandate to renegotiate the EU-IMF deal.</P><Col N="294"/>
        <P>I wish to put on record the important interventions by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, in the first place to get our house in order but also to renegotiate different aspects of the deal.  It is a naive argument to state this is not an ongoing process.  It would be foolhardy to say our officials are not constantly engaged in trying to renegotiate this deal for the future.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We divide the argument into what we cannot do, what we know and what we can do but as a politician I have my reservations and I would be disingenuous not to articulate reservations from within my constituency regarding the EU project.  We gave a resounding &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote to Lisbon in the first treaty referendum and in the second one Donegal people were consistent &mdash; the county was the only one in the country that voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  There are reservations, therefore, about certain democratic deficits in the EU project, as mentioned by the previous speaker.  That is where the debate lies &mdash; how do we address these democratic deficits?  As we go into the future with the EU project how can we ensure we have certain safeguards?  We need to ensure the 17 eurozone members have a better fiscal capability and there is understanding between nations rather than consensus on one level and broken deals on another.</P>
        <P>It concerns both me and my constituents that there is a cosy Sarkozy-Merkel duet going on.  Every time they turn on the television people are consciously and subconsciously looking at those two figureheads.  They see them every time something seems to be going wrong, every time there is a summit or when certain language is used such as Prime Minister Papandreou being &ldquo;summoned&rdquo; to the G20 for a &ldquo;dressing-down&rdquo;.  This type of language is not healthy.  It does not sit well or rest comfortably with me that from a media point of view these two figureheads seem to be driving the EU project and its development.  That is certainly not the case but it is the perception which is being orchestrated at EU level.  Our officials, our Minister and everybody within the EU, whether the Finns or the Irish, are working hard and together.  We should be conscious of this.</P>
        <P>Where do we go from here?  We can look at the crystal ball territory through which certain Members of the Opposition are travelling.  I do not believe we have a monopoly on predicting the future.  We should keep at what we are doing, try to get our own house in order and instil that confidence which is permeating internationally at present.  If one speaks to investors, to people across the United Kingdom, as I did recently in Brighton, or to colleagues, one finds we are developing a reputation.  This is a reputation that used to be present but it was tarnished.  We are rebuilding it.  It is not an easy job but it is happening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The populist moves and options exist.  There is the populist option of reneging on the &euro;700 million due from Anglo Irish Bank to which we are legally bound, although not from a bank guarantee point of view.  Let us call a spade a spade.  Who in this Chamber knows the ramifications of what might happen if certain unsecured bonds are reneged on or defaulted upon?  What are the knock-on effects?  They could involve not only that &euro;700 million but also other unsecured and unguaranteed bonds.  Does anybody have a monopoly on the future?  The finance spokesperson from Sinn F&eacute;in, who is not in the Chamber at present, had a monopoly on wisdom before the last general election.  His party was going to run the country using &euro;15 billion, plus another &euro;15 billion from the Central Bank, after they had reneged on the EU-IMF deal.  That was to take us up to the end of the year but now that we are near the end of the year, when that &euro;30 billion would have been spent, where would we go?  We need a genuine debate.  We must be very careful about the kinds of confusion that come not only from politicians but from the very magnitude of the challenge that lies in the EU project.  We owe it to our citizens at least to be honest regarding the job we have.</P><Col N="295"/>
        <P>There is and will be a great deal of emotion.  No doubt, when the Greek referendum is put to the people there will be much emotion, whatever the result.  There is dangerous territory when we use emotion as a political tool in this House.  We on this side of the House are conscious there are people who are losing special needs services and people leaving the country on a daily basis.  These are not just young people but men who are leaving their families to go to Australia.  We know this emotion because we come across it every day.  People on the other side of the House do not have a monopoly on understanding what our constituents are going through at the moment, what people in this country are going through.  It is very tempting and alluring to use emotion as a political tool.  Times are grave.  We do not need to tell the people this &mdash; they are absolutely terrified about the future.  Let us bring them a bit of sense with this debate, tell them what we know and what we can do.  Let us bring this debate to a position that is not simply about coming out of uncertainty.  We will never have constant certainty but we must at least be genuine with our constituents and the people of this country.</P>

	<P>I will not get into electioneering.  There must be some worries in County Donegal in regard to the outcome of the presidential election.</P>
        <P>It is clear, even to the most casual observers, that the handling of the euro crisis by European leaders has been nothing short of disastrous for many of their citizens.  As member states teeter on the brink of bankruptcy and lurch from one crisis to the next much of the focus that should go towards finding a viable strategy to deal with the crisis has instead been wasted on securing the interests of big bankers and meeting the narrow political interests of the French and German Governments.  The Irish Government has been complicit in allowing this to happen.  For many outside observers, the coalition partners, despite all their pre-election promises, have failed to negotiate robustly with our European partners in order to achieve a fairer deal for Irish people.  We are going on the information we are receiving in that regard.  The Minister may have a different view.</P>
        <P>As recently as last Sunday, the President of the European Council, Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, spoke of the need for what he called &ldquo;limited treaty change&rdquo;.  The aim of such changes points towards a greater centralisation of economic and fiscal powers.  The Taoiseach is on record as stating he is opposed to such measures but it is unclear whether he voiced those views at the Council meeting.  Now, in his latest U-turn, he states he has no problem with limited treaty change.  Consistency on these matters is clearly not one of his strong points.  For anybody involved in negotiations, it is very difficult to negotiate with an individual who flip-flops from one issue to another.  It also shows a weakness in regard to the argument.</P>
        <P>Let us be clear that before any current EU treaties are changed, especially if such change would lead to further loss of our fiscal powers and economic sovereignty, a referendum must be held in order to give our citizens their say on the issue.  Clarity and strong leadership are needed but the Taoiseach is flip-flopping on the issue and is seemingly ready to agree to treaty changes that will have far-reaching implications for our economy and future prosperity.</P>
        <P>This is also further proof, if such were needed, that the leaders of France and Germany are being allowed to drive EU policy in the arrogant belief they have the sole right to decide the future of the European Union.  One need only examine their approach to tackling the crisis in the eurozone.  Key policy decisions have been taken to further their own countries&rsquo; narrow national and political interests, with little or no consideration being given to how this will impact on fellow member states.  As this happens, the Irish Government is allowing itself to be sidelined and patronised with faint praise which extols our efforts to bail out the banks and repay the bondholders in our role as good Europeans.  We may be good Europeans, but we are certainly not in a Europe of equals.  No one in Sinn F&eacute;in underestimates the extent of the <Col N="296"/>problem facing the banking sector in Europe.  We have consistently called for greater stress testing to clarify the extent of the problem so viable solutions can be found.</P>
        <P>This crisis was not created by the citizens of this State, nor by the people of Greece, Portugal or Italy, many of whom are suffering as a result of increasingly punitive austerity measures that have the greatest impact on the weak and the vulnerable.  The greed and the reckless unregulated lending of the banks led us to the point of economic meltdown.  These large European institutions perversely appear to be determined to obstruct the reaching of an agreement that would recapitalise the banking system, create a stronger European Financial Stability Facility and involve a write-down of Greek debt.  In their determination to support big bankers and the narrow political interests of the French and German Governments, EU leaders have manifestly failed to help smaller or less prosperous states in the European Union.  The rights and future prospects of millions of EU citizens are being callously disregarded as eurozone Governments fail to work collectively to find solutions to this worsening crisis.</P>
        <P>The previous Government, which was led by Fianna F&aacute;il, failed to stop this country&rsquo;s banks from behaving recklessly.  It put the interests of bankers and speculators above the interests of ordinary citizens.  Its approach has been replicated by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  Despite their past lofty rhetoric, they have failed to deliver any meaningful change.  It is clear that it is Frankfurt&rsquo;s way and not Labour&rsquo;s way.  The implications of this crisis for ordinary Irish people are becoming more pronounced with each passing day.  Growing hardship is resulting from the sweeping cuts that are destroying our education and health systems, which were already at crisis point.  Job losses have resulted in large scale emigration and hundreds of thousands of people are on the live register.</P>
        <P>Climate change and severe weather are causing further damage to our already antiquated infrastructure.  As recently as last week, I witnessed the despair of hundreds of families in Tallaght and Dublin South-West, whose homes and personal possessions were destroyed by flood water.  Some of those victims had suffered similar catastrophes previously, meaning they were left without insurance.  They face a bleak future, if not ruin.  The Government can find billions of euro when it wants to bail out toxic banks and repay bank bondholders.  This obscene and shameful situation is an indictment of our political system.  I cannot understand how we can find this money when there is no money for people in other situations.  There is no talk of emergency or crisis funds.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in does not oppose the possible write-down of Greek debt.  It has been estimated that the write-down will be between 50% and 60%.  By contrast, the Taoiseach has refused to make the case for a reduction in banking debt.  The Government is persisting with its policy of paying the unguaranteed and unsecured bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank in full.  It beggars belief that the Government can accept the write-down in Greek sovereign debt while Irish taxpayers are forced to pay in full for the recklessness and greed of private speculators.  The Government needs to speak with a single voice on this issue.  It should campaign and negotiate in the interests of Ireland and reassert our national sovereignty.  The future prosperity of our country&rsquo;s citizens must be the Government&rsquo;s priority.  Anything less is unacceptable.</P>

	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to say a few words on the important issue of recent developments in the eurozone.  It has often been said that a week is a long time in politics, but a couple of days is a long time nowadays.  Such fast and furious changes are most evident in the eurozone during the current economic crisis.  It is positive that <Col N="297"/>EU member states, particularly eurozone countries, have started to focus properly on the extent of the problems facing many eurozone countries.  They are no longer blaming smaller peripheral countries as they did some months ago.  Ireland had argued strongly in favour of a wider focus.  At last, Germany and France have taken the initiative and started to take this issue seriously.  Germany, in particular, seems to be displaying a new and vigorous determination to consolidate and protect the eurozone, which is very important.</P>
        <P>There have been many developments in recent times.  A substantial package was put in place at the summit of 21 July last.  The establishment of the European Financial Stability Facility and the economic governance proposals are major measures.  The European semester is an absolutely fundamental way of conducting our business.  All countries will co-ordinate their budgetary facilities.  We will come together &mdash; not in convergence but in consultation and co-ordination with each other &mdash; to ensure there is no breach of the Stability and Growth Pact and we are keeping within the lines that have been set.</P>
        <P>On 23 October, a major proposal in relation to the growth agenda was agreed by the European Council.  As we know in this country, growth is everything.  In the absence of a growth policy, we will not get out of the crisis and the whole consumer side of things will continue to stagnate.  On 26 October, it was decided to strengthen the monetary and economic policy of the member states, which is important.  Under the package that was proposed for Greece, a 50% write-down will be done on a voluntary basis, largely by the EU banking sector.  That, taken with the &euro;130 billion that has been put forward in the new EU-IMF programme, is an extremely significant contribution to bringing Greek public debt back to 120% of GDP.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> is that Greece has to reach a certain debt target through further fiscal consolidation, privatisation and structural reforms.</P>
        <P>That is the point we had reached when the Greek Prime Minister decided to seek a mandate from the people for austerity measures.  Many of us may disagree with that decision, or with the manner in which it was announced.  There was an element of surprise.  He did not consult his colleagues in the European Union or, as far as I can gather, his colleagues internally in the Greek Government.  It was sprung on the people.  It certainly left a lot to be desired.  It unsettled the markets to an inordinate degree.  If the referendum is successful, it will enormously enhance the position of the Greek Government by giving it a mandate to move forward with austerity measures and deal with the situation we see daily on our television screens.  I refer to the rioting on the streets, which is causing enormous difficulty for the Greek Government as it tries to act in a cohesive fashion.  It is absolutely crucial that a decision be taken soon and any referendum be put before the people as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The position of Ireland is totally different.  We are an export-oriented country.  We need to have security in relation to our exports and global trade.  Any default on our debt, structured or otherwise, could incur huge difficulties for us.  This Government was elected six months ago to deal with the economic crisis.  The general election was essentially a referendum on the economic crisis.  Last week&rsquo;s elections &mdash; the by-election in Dublin North-West and the presidential election &mdash; were both won by candidates nominated by the Labour Party.  Clearly, there is strong support for the Government&rsquo;s side of things and very little support for the Opposition.  We should not forget that.</P>
        <P>I look forward to seeing the report that will be published in December by President Van Rompuy, which will examine how to strengthen fiscal matters within the eurozone.  It will be a major report, even though it is an interim report.  It will merit major debate in the House very shortly.  Difficult decisions may be required in response to the report, some of which will determine the direction in which the eurozone will move.  In the months ahead we will need to decide whether we are able to move in a certain direction, whether further convergence will <Col N="298"/>be required or if we will be able to operate on a co-ordinated basis and whether treaty changes may be required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurSpring"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Spring</NameTxt>
	<P>The eurozone is in a crisis that is without parallel since the end of the Second World War.  Jean-Claude Trichet put the matter aptly when he described the crisis as the most significant on the Continent in more than 70 years.  Developments thus far indicate that people are not working together.  In this respect I concur with some of Deputy Crowe&rsquo;s remarks on the European Union.  At their meeting today, President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel summoned the Greek Prime Minister to discuss austerity measures and the proposed referendum in Greece.  Whereas President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel have been elected, Commission President Barroso has not received a solitary vote.  People who do not have an electoral mandate are bullying others on the Continent who do have a mandate.  It is worrying that unelected officials are pushing people around.</P>
        <P>Although I did not support the single currency when it was introduced, I accept membership of the euro has been good for Ireland.  Without the assistance of the eurozone, we would not be able to pay teachers, nurses, garda&iacute; and other public servants.  Everyone in this country must be made aware that it costs &euro;52 billion to run the country every year and our current income is &euro;34 billion.  We are borrowing every cent of the difference to keep the country working.</P>
        <P>None of what is being done is nice.  The &euro;700 million to which Deputy Crowe referred could be considered the lesser of two evils.  While the Government may be wrong in that regard, I trust the Ministers we have and the external advice we are receiving.  Unfortunately, I do not trust the Department of Finance which made an enormous mistake when, having been informed of an accounting error to the tune of &euro;3.6 billion, failed to act over the past 15 or 16 months.  While we are losing credibility on some fronts, we are gaining it in others.  Gains include agreement to reduce the interest rate on our loans, the decision to extend the terms of the loans and the possibility that we will return to the markets quicker than other programme countries.</P>
        <P>The diplomatic offensive has started.  A previous speaker referred to the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  When Members meet their European counterparts they tell them what action is being taken to address the country&rsquo;s problems.  Ireland is being applauded for the measures we are taking and gaining friends who want to help at every step of the way as we try to emerge from the crisis.  I met a German MP who had no idea that Ireland&rsquo;s problems were so bad.  When I referred to a number of statistics, she asked me why people were not rioting on the streets if things were really so bad.  I replied that we had responded in a peaceful manner at the ballot box.  Of the three parties in the previous Government, two were obliterated at the general election and are no longer represented in the D&aacute;il, while the third lost 75% of its seats.</P>
        <P>Greece has taken the wrong course of action, as many of its citizens agree.  Deputy Crowe is wrong to support the 50% write-down of Greek debt.  If we are to believe the information provided by the Bank for International Settlements, Ireland owes Greece &euro;800 million whereas Greece owes Ireland &euro;8.5 billion.  I do not want Ireland to be burdened with a further &euro;4.5 billion in debt as a result of the inaction of others.</P>
        <P>We need to remove the International Monetary Fund from our shores and everything we do in the coming years will focus on that goal.  I will rejoice on the day sovereignty is returned but the country will have junk status for my first term in the House.  The Government is cleaning up a mess without the benefit of sovereignty which is a difficult position to be in.  I applaud some of the measures taken in the eurozone but as Deputy Wallace noted, Chancellor Merkel does not understand how bad the position is in Ireland.  The International Monetary Fund and our colleagues in the eurozone need to comprehend that 130,000 young people, primarily <Col N="299"/>ambitious and skilled graduates, have left our shores.  This level of emigration needs to be curbed because we have a great skill base and a promising future.  We need more help from Europe, including some substantial wins because the patchwork of wins we have secured is not sufficient.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sean Fleming described the current crisis as financial as opposed to political in nature.  We are experiencing a financial crisis that was born out of a particular political model, namely, a neoliberal model with light touch regulation that was predicated on the values of individualism and had greed at its core.  Speculators took risks and were supposed to lose because those who lose generally expect to pay a price.  That was not the case, however, in respect of Anglo Irish Bank bondholders who received &euro;700 million today and will receive more money next year while the Irish taxpayer picks up the bill.  We will pay directly out of our pockets and through the diminution of health and education services and social welfare benefits.  Moreover, we will have less scope for investing in the productive economy, including in efforts to develop an indigenous industrial base.  People understand the position and are rightly outraged as a result.</P>
        <P>We are constantly informed that the Government hopes to re-enter the bond markets in 2013.  Decisions taken today will determine what opportunities will be available after 2013.  The combined level of personal and national debt is unsustainable and will be unsustainable when we our sovereignty is returned.  The choices of how, when and where we spend money will be limited to the extent that we will hardly notice the difference in the decades after sovereignty is restored.</P>
        <P>What political model underpins the current debate in Europe and what values support it?  Are they the common values espoused by Robert Schuman, for example, who came from the same tradition as the Minister?  Schuman called for a democratic model of governance in Europe, one which would develop into a community of people living in freedom, equality, solidarity and peace.  I do not know what the European project has become because I cannot detect what values underpin it in the discussions taking place at present.</P>
        <P>I did not support the Maastricht treaty, one of the reasons being that I had a specific problem with the convergence criteria, specifically the criterion that the ratio of government debt to GDP must not exceed 60% in the preceding fiscal year.  If solidarity is to mean anything, the eurozone countries should adopt the idea of eurobonds.  Sovereign states act in their sovereign interests and Ireland should act in its interests if we do not see the values of solidarity and equality underpinning developments in Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard a Government Deputy suggest the Government has a mandate for the approach it is taking.  Let us be clear on this matter; Fine Gael and the Labour Party do not have a mandate for the policies they are pursuing.  When their members travelled the country in January and February last, we heard them distance themselves from the policies of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government, promise to burn bondholders and protect vulnerable people and claim that it would be the Labour Party&rsquo;s way rather than Frankfurt&rsquo;s way.  We all know what happened.  The new Government changed into the old Government&rsquo;s clothes and is operating the same policies as the Fianna F&aacute;il Party before it.  We know the austerity and difficulties ordinary people must bear.  Someone said earlier that what is happening is not nice.  It is not nice, but that is a very mild way of putting it.  We handed over &euro;750 million to faceless, anonymous speculators today.  These people made a huge profit from speculation.  They bought these bonds from 53% to 60% and have made approximately &euro;300 million in a rip-off of the Irish taxpayer today.  The Government allowed that to happen, without a murmur.</P><Col N="300"/>
        <P>What is not nice is the other side of the coin, namely, that the so-called Minister for Social Protection is implementing cuts in fuel, electricity and gas allowances, bringing fuel poverty for elderly people.  Research to be published in two or three weeks by the Institute of Public Health in Ireland and Dublin Institute of Technology will show that approximately 1,200 people died as a direct result of the lack of heat in the year 2006-07.  Age Action Ireland is running a petition currently asking the Government to reverse these cuts.  It says it is a life and death situation.  I agree.  Rather than pay &euro;700 million plus to faceless speculators, the Government should reverse the cuts that affect elderly people who are at risk, not just of ill health or illness but of death, over the coming winter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>When I watch debates like this and when I hear the advice like that given today to Mrs. Merkel, Mr. Trichet and other such people, I sometimes wonder whether they will hear it, let alone take it.  I tend to see this debate in a narrower context and hope that we can ask the questions and have our words heard by the Ministers here, who will then carry them to Europe.  I ask what can Ireland get out of the situation that is happening in the eurozone currently.</P>
        <P>The lessons are dismal and dim.  For me, the lesson of today&rsquo;s events here and of what is happening in Europe is that a rogue nation is dictating the pace in Europe.  Greece is in the driving seat.  Greece is calling the tunes.  Greece is setting the agenda, not Angela Merkel nor Sarkozy.  They will be down on their knees to Greece by the end of the evening rather than dictating to Greece and asking it to do various things.  Similarly, this nation and Government are on their knees before Anglo Irish Bank today.  The pace in Europe is being dictated by a rogue nation and the pace in Ireland is being dictated by a rogue bank.  That is the situation.</P>
        <P>I wonder why Ireland is keeping its head down so low in Europe.  Why are we so quiet in the mega rows taking place?  Admittedly the rows are taking place among people of greater influence, between Berlusconi, Sarkozy and Merkel in particular and Greece and others.  What role do we have there?  We are not playing any role.  Nobody takes any notice of us currently, but why is that?  The reason is that we are posing as &ldquo;good Europeans&rdquo;.  However, being good Europeans seems to mean being bad Irish people.  To be good Europeans, we must do what Europe wants us to do, but not what is in the interest of people here.  I am frequently asked, but find it difficult to answer, why the Government is pursuing this policy.  Why is it doing what it is told by Merkel, Sarkozy, Trichet and the lot?  Why is it not rebelling a bit and kicking up?  Why did it capitulate so immediately to the demands of our European colleagues?</P>
        <P>I do not know, but I suggest two reasons.  First, this is, to some extent, a vanity project.  When they get into government, people get taken over by the structure, the offices and the people they meet in Europe.  They get intimidated and sucked in.  They also get taken over by the Department of Finance, which has disgraced itself in the past two days.  Not only is it incompetent, it is innumerate.  They get taken over by the ECB structure and they succumb to it too easily, rather than taking the alternative view.  While the alternative view is very credible, it is dismissed.  I heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, respond to one of his party&rsquo;s Deputies, Deputy Peter Mathews, at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform recently when he suggested a sensible and credible series of write-offs.  The Minister said that if he were to suggest that in Europe, he would be accused of being demented.  I am not sure the word &ldquo;demented&rdquo; was used, but he inferred insanity of some sort.</P>

	<P>There is no doubt that this is a political and economic crisis across the 17 nations of the eurozone.  Many of the comments tonight make the issue out to be simplistic and basic and suggest it is a question of whether we pay or do not pay our bondholders.  They suggest that somehow the Government does not have a clue what is going on in Europe and that it is responsible for this awful mess.  If it was only so simple, it would be easy to solve this crisis.</P>
        <P>What Greece is going through currently is horrible.  Its debt is unsustainable and it faces a bleak future and a desperate decade.  Some people feel that even the 50% haircut of the debt owed by private banks in Greece will not be enough to get Greece out of the position it is in.  That is a terrible situation to be in.  If there is one country the situation in Greece does not apply to, it is Ireland.  Members of the Opposition speak about sovereignty, republican sentiment and nationhood, but try to drag down the level of the country in this Chamber.  It is pitiful and annoying to have to listen to that.  I wish they would grow up and stop talking like that.  We are not at that level.  Most commentators agree our position is fairly sustainable.  Our road to recovery will not be affected by Government policy now.  It is events outside the country that will have the greatest knock-on effect here, such as a global recession or the failure of the eurozone to get its act together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with many of those who have spoken on this issue and pointed out that the eurozone comprises 17 sovereign nations that must work together.  Allowing Sarkozy and Merkel to control and lead events in this regard is not producing the result we expected.  Perhaps that is to do with the situation for Mr. Sarkozy and Angela Merkel in their own countries.  They face elections in their countries and face an examination of their position by their people.  This may not be constructive towards sorting out the crisis in the wider eurozone.</P>
        <P>One thing that is clear is that our Government is doing its job.  The Taoiseach is doing his job and the Minister for Finance is doing his.  They are building our recovery bit by bit.  Members of the Opposition like to go for the big bang theory.  They like to think that we can somehow set off a major explosion and that everything will be sorted as a result and we will resolve the crisis.  Sinn F&eacute;in, in particular, loves the big bang theory.  I wonder what would have happened if the election went a different way last February and our Minister for Finance in Europe now was Deputy Pearse Doherty.  If he were Minister, he would be going to Europe and telling Angela Merkel and Sarkozy what to do.  He would pay nothing to bondholders and would burn all around him.  I would love to know what our economic situation would be now if he was in charge.  For all the hype, bull and false anger he expresses here, is he really as reckless and irresponsible as he likes to indicate here?  The absolute nonsense that has come from Sinn F&eacute;in and some Members of the Opposition with regard to a policy for dealing with and resolving this crisis would frighten the daylights out of people.</P>
        <P>Deputy Donnelly asked a very sensible question this morning in the Chamber about what would be the consequences if we defaulted.  There is a need for us to drill into that a little bit more.  However, from what I can gather, it seems the most benign situation is that the European Central Bank would be unhappy with us and the very least it could do is raise interest rates on money we borrow from the bank.  As we intend to borrow tens of billions of euro from the ECB over the next couple of years, our little pyrrhic victory gained from not paying the bondholders would quickly become a massive cost to the Irish taxpayer.  When members of the Opposition show such great concern about those individuals who are lying on trolleys, living on social welfare payments and relying on old age pensions, do they realise the least benign consequence of defaulting?  The least benign consequence is that the State would not be able to borrow money anywhere.  If we were not able to borrow money anywhere, as was pointed out by Deputy Spring, we would be left with a deficit between what the Government earns and spends.</P><Col N="302"/>
        <P>This hypocrisy particularly belongs to Sinn F&eacute;in.  Armchair economists in the Technical Group do not really bother me that much, because they do not affect the overall situation.  However, Sinn F&eacute;in sells a policy to the people and it projects itself as offering this alternative policy.  If Sinn F&eacute;in policies do not stack up, it must be exposed by us in the Government.  Are Sinn F&eacute;in Members saying they would rather gamble with cutting pensions, social welfare payments and pay to garda&iacute;, nurses and teachers by a third in return for burning bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank?  That seems to be the most significant consequence of what could happen.  If ECB rates went up on money this State needs to borrow to run the country, at the very least we would definitely see it impacting on our hospitals, schools and services we provide to the sick and vulnerable in our society.  This needs to be exposed strongly.  When Deputy Doherty comes back into the House to make his next &ldquo;angry young man&rdquo; speech to the nation, he might tell us the consequences of Sinn F&eacute;in policy.  I am not an economist, but I have listened to many things and I am still waiting for Deputy Doherty to provide the consequences of his party&rsquo;s policy statements.</P>
        <P>This is why I support fully what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are doing.  They are not putting the future of this country at risk.  They are going out and negotiating our position.  We are winning some days and we are not doing as well other days, but we are constantly chipping away to make life better for the people.  We must not at any stage let a rush of blood to the head dictate economic policy for this country.  There are many unpredictable variables in the eurozone at the moment.  There is much happening to the world economy.  We are a very small part of that and we are very fortunate that we have managed to get as far as we have got over the last few years.  Any individuals who are undermining our sovereignty and our future as a republic need to be questioned on the policy positions they are trying to get the Irish people to take on board.</P>
        <P>I do not mind the simplistic talk of the some of the Sinn F&eacute;in backbenchers about a lack of leadership, or that we are rigid in what we talk about, because all that is just simple rhetoric.  However, they must explain the overall consequences of their policies to the Irish people, as must any other Member who talks about burning bondholders.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il Members have also spoken about burning bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank.  This is quite ironic, considering we have paid &euro;97 billion to bail out the bank.  We have a responsibility for &euro;700 million of it this morning and another &euro;3 billion next January, while &euro;94 billion was the responsibility of Fianna F&aacute;il when it was in Government.</P>

	<P>The Deputy and his party understood the concept of what I am talking about when they were in government, but they seem to have forgotten it purely for simplistic, populist reasons.  As a group that considers itself a serious Opposition party, perhaps it should defend policies that it claims were its own when it was in government, although our implementation of those policies is substantially different.  We are more focussed on how it affects people, and that is the way it should be.  Much of what was done by the previous Government was done in a rushed manner.  Much of what happened after the IMF came in was bounced on that Government to some degree, and some of the decisions it made were wrong and perhaps were not proofed to protect the Irish people as they should have been.  We have managed to make that shift to protect the Irish people more.  I would like to see the Deputy and his party support those moves.  We are more realistic about what can be achieved for the people in this terrible crisis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  There seems to be no end to the challenges and unexpected shocks to the worldwide economy over the past three years.  When this debate was initiated last week, there appeared to be an air of calm in Europe and especially in the eurozone.  An accommodation had been reached on the Greek situation.  The Greek debt problem had been addressed and the leaders across Europe had looked at the notion of providing a haircut of up to 50% with the support of the banks concerned.  To some extent, there was an acceptance that difficult decisions had been taken and we were getting back to addressing the crisis.  There was also a recognition that Greece was isolated in a way that prevented contagion and was ring fenced by the solution.  That was seen as a positive move overall.</P>
        <P>The impact of the haircut on European banks was significant.  The leadership across Europe looked at the necessity of addressing the recapitalisation of those banks.  That process had been agreed and a path to implementation was clearly underway.  The bolstering of the EFSF was also recognised and the broad parameters of that were accepted, so that it could be strong enough to act as a deterrent to the predatory approach of many of the speculators we have spoken about.  While more specifics needed to be worked out, it looked like a solid proposal.  The funding of the EFSF to deal with the predatory approach of speculators was underway.  Klaus Regling had made contact with Asian markets and sovereign wealth funds in that region, and all this looked extremely positive in addressing the crisis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Suddenly we have been thrown into a crisis that looks infinitely more challenging than what has gone on before.  I will not use this opportunity to be critical of any other country or the leadership of any other country.  Things have been done with the best intent by the Greek Prime Minister in addressing what he believes was a necessity to have the affirmation of his people.  It certainly is not helpful in the current climate, but we should not question the motivation.  I am surprised by some of the comments in the last couple of days around Europe and at the criticism being levelled at Greece.  It can be argued that the leaders of France and Germany have taken positions that have been in their own interests over the past few months that have allowed this situation to go on and on over the course of 13 or 14 meetings without facing up to the serious issues involved.  Some might suggest the Prime Minister of Greece is being a little bit nationalistic in seeking the support of his people through a referendum, but one could argue he has been led by the nose into this due to the approach taken by President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel, who have not been able to agree a strategy and have been playing a game of politics in trying to keep their own people behind them.  I do not think we should be as surprised as some have sought to suggest about the Greek stance.  There is no doubt it has created considerable panic, and not just in Europe &mdash; it has also affected the USA in terms of the market write-offs we saw yesterday and the further uncertainty at a time when we need to create much more certainty.  There was a view that such certainty was starting to creep back in, but unfortunately it has not.</P>
        <P>The biggest difficulty with this economic shock is that although there has been an impact on the markets, we have not reached the end of the life cycle.  Previously, when shocks occurred, we started to build from there on, whether it was the collapse of Lehman Brothers or any other crisis that enveloped us.  Now, however, it takes much longer to reach the point at which we know the impact of the shock and we can start to rebuild.</P>
        <P>It is not clear when the referendum in Greece will take place.  I welcome the comments today by the Minister for Finance, who has obviously encouraged Greece &mdash; I am sure other leaders are doing the same &mdash; to try to advance the date of the referendum, because leaving a vacuum of uncertainty will certainly create greater problems.  It is unclear what the outcome of a referendum might be.  We do not know what will happen if there is a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote; are we looking at unstructured default?  What are the implications for us in Ireland?</P><Col N="304"/>
        <P>In that context, we need to talk about the Anglo Irish Bank bonds.  I am somewhat disappointed with the comments of the previous speaker, Deputy Twomey, who sought to suggest that the current Government has an exceptional handle on dealing with the bonds.  He seeks to put forward a simplistic approach when he talks about the &euro;93 billion that was invested by the previous Government and says we should take responsibility for that.  We have done so.  I argue that the current Government is very much following the banking policy that was adopted by us.  Much of the &euro;93 billion that was pumped into Anglo Irish Bank was asset-backed and will give a return in the long run.</P>
        <P>It was the Deputy&rsquo;s own Minister for Finance, on his 99th day in Government, who raised expectations and, I would charge, had an impact on the euro crisis by seeking to throw further uncertainty on the bond market when, in the United States, he made a clear and public statement that he was seeking to perpetrate a haircut on the bondholders, the first tranche of which we are dealing with today.  He said this at the time without reference to Mr. Trichet or the European Central Bank.  The Taoiseach, during Leaders&rsquo; Questions and on the Order of Business today, indicated that as far back as March it was made clear to the Government that there was absolute opposition in Frankfurt to the notion of burning any senior bondholders.  I could go through in some detail the comments made by various players on the other side of the House.  They were made in the heat of the election campaign, and I am prepared to accept that.  The Government wiped the slate clean to an extent and suffered the political fallout by being asked to respond in this House on an ongoing basis to the promises it made.  However, this promise was not made prior to the election.  It was an intervention by the Minister for Finance, sitting in a comfortable room somewhere in the United States, as far as he possibly could be from Frankfurt, when he told the world the Irish Government intended to take an aggressive approach to senior unsecured and unguaranteed bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank.</P>

	<P>However, today&rsquo;s interjection by the Taoiseach stated it was clear from his perspective that there was no opportunity to do that.  I would accept it if the Minister for Finance, in isolation, put on the record his desire to talk to the ECB and challenge it with regard to a policy of reducing the commitment to senior bondholders at Anglo Irish Bank, for all the right reasons.  There is scarcely anybody in the House who would not accept there is a case to be made.  The Minister put forward the proposition that he would make that case.  The indication was that he had not yet done so and that he was starting afresh.  However, it now appears, based on what the Taoiseach said today, that the initial conversations had started and that the ECB had spoken vehemently against it from the beginning, when it was first raised in March.  Are we to believe there was some kind of discord or disharmony between the Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance &mdash; that the Minister for Finance was not aware that the ECB was against the idea?  Or was he aware?  I do not want to call into question the integrity of the Minister for Finance or, indeed, the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It had become a hostage to its commitment at an early stage that it would do a hell of a lot more in 100 days.  Nobody expected it to.  We realise it is not a sprint.

	<P>There has been talk today about the Anglo Irish Bank bonds.  The reality is that, thanks to the actions of the last Government, this is sovereign debt.  We have a choice as a country: do we stand over our sovereign debt, or do we walk away from it?  If we were to walk away from our sovereign debt, where would it leave us?  It would leave us in a simple situation: we could not pay nurses or garda&iacute;, and we would not be able to keep the lights on in this building.  I do not think the ushers would come in, and the Acting Chairman would probably find something better to do than to sit here listening to me.  Sinn F&eacute;in and the Technical Group, who have now been joined by their cheerleaders in Fianna F&aacute;il, have never yet come up with a single solitary suggestion about what we should do if we walk away from our sovereign debt.  If we walked away from our European and international obligations tomorrow morning, we do not have a single suggestion about what to do, not even from the financial editor of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> &mdash; he might not be the financial editor, but he is a columnist who used to come into the House on a regular basis and pontificate that Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick would be a great candidate for Governor of the Central Bank, or God, or whatever he was running for at the time, and is now saying the Government is not doing what it should be doing.</P>
        <P>The public is becoming weary of this as well.  Ultimately, they want the Government to take this issue by the scruff of the neck.</P>
        <P>They want credible politicians to negotiate on behalf of Ireland at a European and international level.  They have no wish for this will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp or <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> economics whereby one bangs the table and declares one will not pay back what one owes and will walk away in the hope that everything will be rosy in the garden.  The public is not stupid.  People know that if they go to their local credit union and borrow &euro;300, unless the credit union agrees to write down that debt, it must be paid in full.  At the moment we are in negotiation to try to get our debt written down.</P>

        <P Just="Left">It is unfortunate that every time we come in here we listen to the same old drone that we should not pay this, that or the other.  Those who suggest this do not provide an alternative.  It would be far more constructive for the Opposition to take the initiative and the invitation offered to them by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to come up with ways in which this can be done and to use their relationships in the European Union, although limited, to influence their colleagues.  I am unsure whether any of their colleagues are in Government anywhere &mdash; perhaps there might be one in Government in Libya &mdash; but perhaps they could influence their colleagues to do something for this country rather than sending out this diatribe which is being broadcast all over the world.  Everyone is listening to what is going on in Ireland because everyone wants to know whether they will get paid, whether we can be trusted and if we will pay them back in future if we borrow from them again.  Thanks be to God the people had the foresight and knowledge not to put into Government people who would not repay anyone, who would run us into the ground and who, when everything was gone and the lights were turned off, would turn around and ask what they should do next.</P>
        <P>I wish the Government well in its exploits, especially the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are in difficult times and it is about time some people in the Chamber put on the green jersey.</P>

The communiqu&eacute; at the close of the European summit stated, &ldquo;The euro is at the core of our European project of peace, stability and prosperity.&rdquo;  I am amused when I listen to Deputies Doherty and Dooley.  Deputy Dooley spoke about being hostage.  The people are hostage to the debauchery of his party when it was in government for the past decade and a half.  Greed, poor governance and lack of respect for people have us where we are today.</P><Col N="307"/>
        <P Just="Left">I challenge Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and his party.  They are in Government in the North of our country.  They have positions of responsibility and they are acting there but they are not acting here.  They walked out of the D&aacute;il today and then returned in two minutes because it was a set piece occasion and they had no wish to miss the television opportunity.  Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s speech in the House tonight was a rant with no constructive or positive comment.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to our Taoiseach and the Minister for going to Europe and achieving re-negotiation of our position.  The success of the summit depends on the implementation of the agreed measures by all signatories.  The summit was an attempt by the sovereign Governments to provide reassurance and certainty to the financial markets and throughout the European zone.</P>
        <P>I do not play the stock market but let us consider what happened in the stock market.  We witnessed the sharpest decline in a five-week period because of a decision by a Greek Prime Minister to hold a referendum.  Today, the Taoiseach stated that it is his decision to do as he wishes and he is correct.  However, it must be about Europe and the European project.  Today, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance were at pains to emphasise that if we renege, we have an implication for Europe.</P>
        <P>I put it to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, who I like, that, with regard to the Anglo Irish Bank bond repayment, that what is happening today is difficult for many on this side of the House to swallow.  However, the reality is that the State has already put all of its share of funding into the failed bank.  Under the previous Government, some 97% of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s liabilities were paid.  When I hear Deputies Michael McGrath, Martin and Dooley I get sick.  They were the people who stood in the Government chamber and paid out the money.  These are the people who wanted to end the &ldquo;Punch and Judy&rdquo; politics, yet they are on the plinth tonight making capital from it when they were the architects of it.</P>
        <P>The reality is that the European Central Bank did not agree to further burden-sharing and it would not be responsible to risk the entire agreement for 3% of a bank&rsquo;s liability.  Do the Members opposite believe we should risk the gains we made for 3%?  Is that what they are saying?  This the reality.  If we act alone, we run the risk of causing the same shock waves the Greek referendum proposal caused.  This is about the future and about being responsible.  The markets are volatile, as we are all aware.  It is not the place of a responsible Government to cynically exploit this volatility for a quick fix or for short-sighted or short-term gain.  I agree with Deputy Dooley that France and Germany have an obligation to the European project and to play the game of Europe, not the game of Sarkozy or Merkel and their attendant internal political struggles.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Government and the Minister for Finance on the responsibility they have shown and the leadership they have given.  They have shown foresight and sure-footedness in re-negotiating some of the terms of the EU-IMF agreement.  I look forward to their continuing efforts in further re-negotiations.  The responsibility of being in Government is about bringing people along.  It is about ensuring the country will be there in five weeks, five months and five years.  A responsible Government will not unnecessarily risk the future of the country or its people on an uncertain outcome.  This Government has not done so and will not do so.</P>

        <P>In the various speeches from Deputies just now we were called upon to be constructive and responsible.  People were described as ostriches.  I am not an ostrich and I hold my head up high because I believe in Ireland &mdash; I would not be here otherwise.  However, many people in the Chamber seem to believe that they must be good Europeans first and they have forgotten about the need to be good Irish people &mdash; &Eacute;ireannaigh maithe.  This, in the face of demands from faceless gamblers, to whom they are willing to kowtow and give away Irish taxpayer&rsquo;s money hand over fist when it is not required.  We saw as much earlier today and it appears we will see it again in January when a further &euro;1.2 billion will be handed over to faceless, unsecured bondholders.  This is the consequence of this Government taking power but it is totally contrary to the position adopted by the Minister for Finance in June this year, when he asked for the support of US officials in his application to burn senior bondholders.  He might not have received that support or the support of Europe but that was the position he took publicly in the United States.  What has changed since?  Nothing has changed from the point of view of Ireland except that we are in a bigger hole now than we were at that stage.</P>
        <P>The Government figures prove that austerity is not working in this State and cutbacks will not achieve the desired aim.  The Exchequer deficit now stands at &euro;22.2 billion, much of which is due to the bailout of Anglo Irish Bank and the recapitalisation of the other banks.  There is a pot within that which does not need to be spent and should not be on our deficit book, namely the &euro;711 million which was handed over today.  The &euro;3 billion handed over every year in promissory notes could be better invested in services and setting up a proper fund  to create jobs.</P>
        <P>The figures show that income tax receipts are down and projected VAT receipts have decreased by &euro;383 million, a figure which will rise to &euro;500 million by the end of the year.  People are not spending because they do not have money.  The only figure which has increased is income tax take, a result of the universal social charge, which is on the back of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>And the pension levy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly, which affects the ordinary working classes in the main.</P>
        <P>All of that money has been taken out of the Exchequer and is contributing to job losses.  Europe may not be interested in this and it is perhaps why the Minister was not pushed about attending the latest emergency meeting to deal with the euro crisis.  The consequences of what is happening are that people are becoming unemployed, children are going to school hungry, children with disabilities do not receive proper services and hundreds of thousands of Irish people are emigrating.</P>
        <P>People are not going abroad to get work experience to return in a year or two, despite what some people seem to think.  They are moving lock, stock and barrel to Australia, America, New Zealand and further afield.  The investment of the Irish people is being lost to future generations.  Their skills are being lost to our economy, yet nothing is being done.  The Government is more concerned about dealing with Anglo Irish Bank bondholders than creating jobs.</P>
        <P>If we asked for a similar write-down of debt to that obtained by Greece our debt would probably be sustainable.  It would be easier for us to begin to rebuild our economy in which people have work and can pay their fair share.  The vast majority of Irish taxpayers are on low and medium incomes and are suffering the consequences of the ills of the previous Government but the problem is being compounded by the ills of the current Government.</P><Col N="309"/>
        <P>I am being constructive in saying that the money can be spent in another way and we could have a stimulus package to help retain some of the jobs in the retail industry.  Such a proposal is constructive and not, as other Deputies have suggested, irresponsible.  It is irresponsible not to negotiate, set out a stall and demand a write-down.  The Government is irresponsible because it has not done that.</P>
        <P>The State, because of the Government, has taken an unsustainable course of action to pay unsecured bondholders in full.  It is not sustainable because it is morally wrong and economic madness.  The term &ldquo;economic treason&rdquo; was used by the T&aacute;naiste, a term which could be used to properly describe the current course of action, namely to continue to pump more money into a black hole to sustain a pension fund in Germany or other financial institution while Irish jobs and companies are collapsing left, right and centre.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am interested in whether the Taoiseach is answering to what he considers to be his real boss.  His real boss is the Irish electorate.  However, he seems to accept what comes from the diktats of Angela Merkel and those in the Christian Democratic group in the European Union and that what he is doing is being a good European.  There is nothing Christian about making the poor suffer for the benefit of the rich.  In the Bible I read, I thought it was the other way around, that is, that the rich were supposed to suffer to help the poor.  The script might have been rewritten by the Government, as the Minister and the Taoiseach have rewritten their pre-election promises.</P>
        <P>The poor should not be suffering the consequences of greed and arrogance but they are.  We are calling, in a constructive fashion, for another direction because the approach of this and the previous Government is not working and will not work.  It is making life unbearable for hundreds of thousands of people in the State.  It is unjustifiable because such people did not cause the problem in the first place or benefit from the greed or arrogance of those who went before them.</P>
        <P>Unsecured bondholders should not be paid a red cent.  Frankfurt&rsquo;s way should be rejected.  In its election literature the Labour Party said it was &ldquo;Labour&rsquo;s way or Frankfurt&rsquo;s way&rdquo;.  The same situation pertains now.  There is a different way which involves investing Irish taxpayers money and ensuring over time we pay our sovereign debt.  Nobody is saying we should welch on it but we will pay it when we have the money and are good and ready.</P>
        <P>We should invest money in jobs and recreate the economy.  We can then consider addressing Ireland&rsquo;s debts.  In the meantime the Government should go to the 15th EU crisis meeting and ask for a similar write-down to that of Greece, which it might get.  It would make the situation sustainable for the Irish people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been a useful debate because it has exposed a number of very clear positions between the Opposition and Government.  There is a majority view in the House for the position as outlined by the Government, a position which stands.</P>
        <P>I wish to take up some of the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  Like him, I believe in Ireland and the future of the country.  I want a future in this country for my children and everyone else&rsquo;s children.  We will only have that if the country can get back on its feet.  We are a small, open economy and depend on traded goods and services.  Our reputation is crucial in that regard.  The idea that we would follow the default position, as the Deputy correctly outlined in regard to Greece, would be a recipe for disaster for this country.</P>
        <P>He rightly points out the misery that Irish people have to bear as a result of unemployment, reductions in services and the like.  The misery would be compounded threefold this year in terms of the adjustment that would be required if we were to follow the option he and his party <Col N="310"/>have articulated.  With the greatest respect to the Deputy, the Government is not prepared to play with people&rsquo;s lives.  If one is prepared to follow the Greek option of default, then one is ready to engage in a gigantic game of chance.  If Ireland had chosen that option, it would immediately have been obliged to find approximately &euro;16 billion for the current year&rsquo;s budget as opposed to &euro;6 billion.  It is as a result of this that I and the majority of other Members occupy a position which is fundamentally different to that held by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>There is one group in the House &mdash; which comprises the Deputy and others &mdash; the members of which argue that for Ireland to go forward, a unilateral position must be adopted.  There is another group on the Government side &mdash; until recently I thought this group included Fianna F&aacute;il but that party has now caved in to populism &mdash; the members of which argue that the option for Ireland is to proceed through negotiation.  I argue that our position is best advanced by negotiation rather than by taking unilateral positions on any of the issues under discussion.  It is in our national interest to attempt to obtain better terms and conditions in respect of the deal that was put in place by the previous Administration.  The Government has enjoyed some success in this regard.  I accept that such success has been limited in nature but it is success nonetheless.</P>
        <P>In May, in the context of the jobs initiative announced by the Minister for Finance, we were successful in overturning some of the decisions taken by the previous Government and in reducing the rate of VAT.  One of the reasons this month&rsquo;s VAT returns announced earlier today are down is that we lowered the rate in respect of certain goods and services from 13% to 9.5%.  I accept that this is not the only reason for the decrease in VAT returns and that the problems relating to the domestic economy continue to have an impact.  The reduction in the rate of VAT came about as a direct result of our policies, one of which relates to a desire to improve the experience of tourists who visit this country.  In July, we concluded a significant settlement in respect of the amount of money the country is borrowing and the period over which it will be obliged to pay it back.  This development also came about as a result of negotiation.  Was it helped by the fact that the position of Greece had taken centre stage at that point?  The honest answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  However, it was also helped by the fact that we had been involved in careful negotiations with our EU partners in respect of the range of funds that were to become available.</P>
        <P>What is our next plan?  We want to discover whether we can redesign the promissory notes that were put in place by the previous Administration.  The amount to be repaid in respect of those notes is &euro;47 billion.  This will have to be repaid by this Government, and that which succeeds it in 2015 or 2016, over a ten-year period.  Would it make more sense to repay that &euro;47 million over a longer period and at a lower rate of interest?  The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I do not state that we will have immediate success.  If we are successful in respect of the &euro;47 billion to which I refer and on redesigning the promissory notes relating to Anglo Irish Bank, that would be infinitely better &mdash; I suggest that any honest person would agree with me &mdash; than matters going to the wire in respect of the debt of that bank.</P>
        <P>It remains the Government&rsquo;s position that it would have wanted to do something different with regard to the senior debt of &euro;3.7 billion that remains on the books at Anglo Irish Bank.  Some of that money was repaid today and the remainder will be repaid next year.  However, our opinion does not reflect the majority view of the ECB.  To return to the Deputy&rsquo;s argument regarding unilateralism as opposed to mine in respect of negotiation &mdash; and taking into account what the Minister for Finance said earlier with regard to the lesser of two evils &mdash; we must ask whether it would be better to accept the view of the ECB on this issue in the hope of being in a position to try to negotiate something better in the future.  In a nutshell, this is the approach we have adopted.</P><Col N="311"/>
        <P>In the run-up to the general election, I did not state &mdash; I challenge people to prove me wrong &mdash; that there would be unilateral burden-sharing in respect of senior debt.  I stated &mdash; as reflected in our manifesto &mdash; that we would immediately introduce burden-sharing in respect of subordinated debt.  We managed to achieve this in the context of recapitalising the banks.  However, we did not give a unilateral guarantee to the effect that we would do this outside the framework of the ECB.</P>
        <P>When he spoke about this issue in the United States during the summer, the Minister was correct to state that it should be firmly restored to the agenda.  That is what one does in negotiations.  As a means of achieving something greater, one brings forward issues about which one feels strongly.  As other Deputies and I are aware, people feel passionately about this issue because Anglo Irish Bank is no longer functioning.  As the Minister stated, that institution is a warehouse.  In the context of our ongoing negotiations, I am not prepared to take the risk that we would not be able to achieve our objectives as a result of taking a firm stance on this issue, particularly when the greater prize is a write-down in respect of some of the promissory notes and an extension to the repayment period.</P>
        <P>The ECB has invested a great deal of money in Irish banks.  To date, it has provided the banking sector here with up to &euro;110 billion in liquidity.  The interest rate which applies in respect of this is 1.5%.  If any of the Deputies opposite can identify another international agency or institution which would be prepared to lend &euro;110 billion in liquidity to Irish banks at a rate of 1.5%, I would love them to do so.  Ireland is on a life support machine, not just in terms of its current deficit but also with regard to the banks.  There is agreement among Members that the two banks which are systemically important are AIB and Bank of Ireland.  If we want these two pillar banks to have a future, then we should not argue in favour of a 50% haircut.  How could we possibly attract private sector funds for those banks if we took a unilateral decision in respect of them tomorrow morning?  That is not the way in which developed economies operate.</P>
        <P>A 50% haircut similar to that which will apply in the case of Greece does not represent a solution to our problems.  Such a development would give rise to a nightmare scenario similar to what would be experienced in a nuclear winter.  Ireland would be frozen out of the markets for a considerable time if such a haircut were applied to our debts.  Greece will be in the accident and emergency department for more than a decade.</P>
        <P>Many Deputies have asked about the Government&rsquo;s plan.  Our ambition and our objective is for the country to return to the markets by the latter part of 2013 in order that we might be able to fund our own way again.  The only way this can be achieved is by taking a strong position on this issue and by working with our partners in Europe and the IMF to ensure that we can obtain a better deal.  We must renegotiate the current deal in Ireland&rsquo;s interests and we must do this is a clever and significant way rather than by engaging in the kind of stampede politics which those on the benches opposite appear to favour.  There is not any credibility in politics of that type.  We will emerge from the programme and regain our economic sovereignty and the independence Irish people cherish.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue.  I thank the Government for agreeing to demands put forward by the Opposition last week to the effect that the House should sit today to debate it.  This is an extremely important issue for us, as European citizens, and for the nation, as a political entity in the context of the European Union and the eurozone.  I welcome the comments by those on the Government side in respect of the challenges we face and the difficult choices and decisions which must be made.  Unfortunately, these decisions will give rise to pain for citizens across Europe.  That pain has never been more evident than today, particularly when one considers the decision taken by the Government of <Col N="312"/>Greece to hold a referendum on the bailout and the potential for a haircut of 50% in respect of its debt which has been foisted on it and its people by the European Union.</P>

        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises that the social welfare budget trebled from 2000-2010 and forms a vital safety net for vulnerable members of the community and those adversely affected by the economic crisis that has hit Europe;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />in addition recognises the reductions in benefits borne already by social welfare recipients due to the crisis and the need to achieve the fiscal targets laid out under the EU/IMF programme;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />agrees that these savings can be achieved through tackling social welfare fraud and increased employment, rather than further reductions to present social welfare rates;</P>

        <P FLI="0">I wish to share time with Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Browne.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>From 2000 to 2010, when resources were available, Fianna F&aacute;il tripled social welfare expenditure.  It now continues to emphasise the need for a safety net for the most vulnerable in society and those affected by the economic crisis.  In meeting our targets <Col N="313"/>under the EU-IMF programme of financial support, the advances Fianna F&aacute;il made across social welfare programmes should be protected, especially given the potential for EU support for our bank recapitalisation.</P>
        <P>In July at a summer school in County Donegal, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton referred to the huge advancements over the past ten years in social welfare rates for pensioners, unemployment benefits, child benefit, care and medicine schemes, improvements to capital and servicing the disability sector, supplementary allowances, back-to-school and education advancements.  She said Fianna F&aacute;il was cynical in increasing benefits and rates for electoral gain.  The same Minister, however, referring to pension increases, claimed:</P>
        <P LI="1">I recognised that they were well deserved, since it was the pensioners who made this country what it is today.  They need the extra money to meet our very high and inflationary cost of living, not least the cost of heat, gas and electricity, not to mention the VAT of 21% that they pay on almost everything.</P>
        <P FLI="0">On increases in fuel allowances, she once said, &ldquo;I welcome the increase in the fuel allowance of &euro;4 to the princely sum of &euro;18 a week.  It is approximately the cost of a bag of coal and half a packet of firelighters but welcome for all that&rdquo;.  It is a pity then, since assuming office, the Minister has cut the fuel allowance, the electricity and gas allowances for the elderly, for the most needy, the most deserving and those, as she said herself, who made this country.</P>
        <P>Allied to this we have the constant threat since assuming office of this Government not being able, prepared or principled enough to take advantage of changed financial circumstances which have since evolved that would allow it to honour its commitments.  This motion is necessary, as it will offer the opportunity for facts to be laid bare and for markers to be finally put down.</P>
        <P>The most vulnerable in society can no longer be left worried and frightened by the threat of cuts to social welfare rates.  Those very people voted in their numbers for a change of Government.  They were mindful of election promises and commitments.  The Labour Party, for example, promised to overturn last year&rsquo;s budgetary cuts of 4%, cuts that continued the heavy lifting of the previous Government.  These were necessary cuts taken in the face of an oncoming election, when no amount of populist rhetoric, grandstanding or politics of anger could change or alter the necessary adjustments of over &euro;6 billion then required to stabilise public finances.</P>
        <P>That initial promise to overturn those cuts evaporated on the formation of the Government because the post-election commitment was to maintain rates rather than overturn them.  This was re-affirmed by the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade after 100 days in office.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gilmore, said the entire range of commitments in the programme for Government remain the Government&rsquo;s policy.  He further re-affirmed his commitment in <i>The Irish Times</i> on September 7.  Not to be outdone, the Taoiseach recently told the same newspaper on September 20, &ldquo;The Minister for Social Protection ... has expressed the Government&rsquo;s interest in keeping headline rates of social welfare intact&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>When I saw the successful Labour by-election candidate, Deputy Nulty, celebrating his election win with the Plough and the Stars flag rather than a rose-tinted red one, I was heartened that he too would reaffirm the commitments given to his Dublin West constituents.  On the plinth today, in the company of the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, that commitment was given by Deputy Nulty.</P>
        <P>This motion offers a definitive opportunity to the Minister for Social Protection to finally agree with her colleagues and assure this House rather than the media outside that this commitment stands, that her colleagues in the Labour Party cannot be forced back to their constituenc<Col N="314"/>ies with a U-turn of this magnitude.  I would expect it from the far right of Fine Gael.  Has the Plough and the Stars been defamed, however?  Is the red rose to wilt so quickly after it blossomed for Michael D. Higgins over the weekend?</P>
        <P>Constitutional republicanism is a virtue paramount to our democracy.  It was defamed for too long by a terrible substitute called militant republicanism.  One does not have to look too far in the Chamber to see its exponents.  Improvements to the lot of the poor, underprivileged, sick, disabled and carers is and should be awarded with electoral success because that is what politics is all about, the essence of constitutional republicanism.</P>
        <P>We make no apologies for the advancements made in social welfare by Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.  The only apology emanating from this debate will be from the Fine Gael-Labour Government when it should apologise to the electorate for making promises in this area that it did not need to and, more importantly, the irresponsibility of playing on feelings of a fearful electorate.</P>
        <P>As stated earlier, the social welfare budget has increased substantially.  Pension levels increased since 2000 by 130%, unemployment benefits by 130% and child payments by 330%.  The changed European context and prospects for EU support for bank recapitalisation means that we should save money on the banks that we can use to protect those affected by the crisis.  Self-employed people should not be penalised from social welfare supports after taking the risk in setting up a business.  The Government&rsquo;s emphasis should be placed upon further anti-fraud savings and job creation to reduce social expenditure while reaching a new agreement with the EU to ensure we have financial support for our bank recapitalisation.  Money saved on this should be used to alleviate pressure on the unemployed.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il introduced several measures that the Minister, Deputy Burton, is claiming credit for in the drive to exact greater savings from curbing social welfare fraud.  Despite the fanfare surrounding this anti-fraud drive, the Minister&rsquo;s measures are the same actions introduced over the past several years.  For example, in 2009 the Department reviewed 750,000 people.  In 2011, that target has been increased to a whopping 780,000.  Welfare fraud savings in 2007 came to &euro;447 million, &euro;476 million in 2008, &euro;484 million in 2009 and &euro;483 million in 2010.  This year&rsquo;s target is &euro;540 million while for 2012 it is &euro;625 million.  Based upon answers to parliamentary questions I received two weeks ago, I am not convinced this year&rsquo;s target will be met.  Laughably, earlier this year when listening to the Minister answer questions in this House, it could be construed that maintaining welfare rates was dependent on savings in her Department such as this.</P>
        <P>Today, in its pre-budget submission the Society of St. Vincent de Paul stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland is facing a serious social crisis and there is a palpable worry and uncertainty among people on social welfare and child benefit rates.  Further cuts including the proposed flat-rate annual household charge will push them further into debt and poverty &mdash; they have no more to give.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Social welfare forms a major part of the income support of 2.1 million people and is a substantial generator of economic activity.  Despite the soft hints from certain quarters and the accusations of unfortunate recipients having made lifestyle choices, Ireland does not spend a disproportionately high amount on social welfare given its unemployment numbers.</P>
        <P>Social welfare acts as an automatic economic stabiliser.  Some commentators have suggested that we should apologise for the cost of bringing our percentage expenditure of GDP on social welfare from 10% in 2000 to 20% in 2009, which is below that of France, Finland, Germany and Austria and on a par with that of Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands.  The eurozone <Col N="315"/>average is 19%.  Having built up significant social welfare supports, Fianna F&aacute;il undertook a progressive budget of fiscal consolidation in light of the economic crisis.  It is ironic that the Government is now accepting praise from the troika for implementing measures they voted against at the end of last year.</P>
        <P>The Government should not slam on the brakes too hard and jeopardise economic recovery by undermining domestic demand.  Despite statements to the contrary from several Government members, the troika has agreed that a balance must be struck between fiscal consolidation and pro-growth strategies.  Several colleagues and I recently met with representatives of the troika and were relieved to hear their views in this regard.  They recognise that decisions in this budget are a matter for the Government.  They acknowledge that the means by which savings are made are a matter for the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Only within the parameters the Deputy&rsquo;s party set for us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>They also indicated their awareness that these decisions will be difficult politically.  They noted that this is a coalition Government and that agreement, while difficult, must shortly be made.  This tallied with the Minister, Deputy Noonan&rsquo;s, comments after his meeting with troika that any decrease in social welfare rates would be a matter for the Government to decide at budget time.  Crucially, he added that the troika has no difficulty with the Government &ldquo;substituting one fiscal measure for another one of equal value&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The discovery of an accounting error amounting to &euro;3.66 billion alleviates some of the long-term burden on the State&rsquo;s finances, with overall debt now standing 2.3% lower than previously thought.  This reprieve should be used to ease the onerous burden of reducing social welfare expenditure.  The new eurozone plan for bank recapitalisation offers the Government an opportunity to extract EU financial support for our bank recapitalisation.  Ireland should not be unfairly penalised for having taken the initiative in tackling the bank crisis rather than kicking the can down the road.  Part of the rate reduction on our bailout repayments, which was achieved by accident rather than design, should be used to ease the burden of reducing social welfare expenditure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Deputy say the rate reduction was achieved &ldquo;by accident&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Self-employed people are an integral part of the Irish economy.  Those who take the initiative and risk in setting up a business and creating jobs should be facilitated and encouraged, not penalised in our social welfare system.  There are approximately 268,000 self-employed people in Ireland.  Small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, directly support 700,000 jobs throughout the State, and Ireland has a higher proportion of SMEs in comparison with the EU average.  Given the high unemployment rate, there is a pressing need to develop a strong social protection safety net in order to encourage and foster entrepreneurship and thus stimulate job creation in the SME sector.</P>
        <P>The Government should live up to its promises in the programme for Government to establish supports along the lines of those available under various international welfare systems, such as Denmark, which offer immediate support to self-employed individuals who encounter income difficulties as a result of business closures and slowdowns.  The Irish Small and Medium Enterprise Association has outlined the disparity in treatment as between employees and the self-employed under the social welfare system.  Employees have an immediate entitlement to benefits; are not subject to a means test; their personal savings, other income and cohabitee income are not assessed; the value of their property is not taken into account; and they are covered for invalidity and disability benefit.  By contrast, the self-employed have no immediate entitlement to benefits; are subject to a full means test; all savings, other income and cohabitee <Col N="316"/>income are fully assessed, the value of their property is fully reckonable; and they have no invalidity or disability cover.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s defence in implementing reductions in social welfare expenditure will undoubtedly be that they are an unavoidable consequence of the recklessness of previous Governments.  Despite all the advancements made by the previous Administration in the areas of social welfare and protection, Opposition Members constantly complained that there was not enough being done, that the country was awash with money and so on.  As a member of a local authority during the 1990s and 2000s, I am well aware that these arguments were repeated in county councils throughout the State.</P>
        <P>A brief look at the election manifestos of the Labour Party and Fine Gael in 2007 shows they had little thought for restraint.  Observing that the broad macro-economic outlook for the Irish economy was good, the Labour Party promised a two-point reduction in the standard tax rate, from 20% to 18%; 2,300 more hospital beds; five half-days of free preschool education for all children; the abolition of the means test for carers; and an increase in the number of community garda&iacute; to 1,500.  Fine Gael, in the same boom-time election campaign, promised to cut the standard tax rate, increase the State pension to &euro;300 per week by 2012, provide a laptop for every school child, introduce free GP visits for every child under 16 and continue the public sector benchmarking process.  Given these examples of their own election promises, neither party is in a position to criticise as fiscally irresponsible the investment made by Fianna F&aacute;il in social welfare and other areas in the past decade.</P>
        <P>Labour Party and Fine Gael candidates travelled around their constituencies between November 2010 and February of this year making many promises.  In the case of the Labour Party, they promised to overturn rate cuts of 4% in the previous budget, before agreeing, upon entering government, to accept those reductions.  We accept this was a compromise reached with their partners in government.  However, they have continued to reiterate that commitment right up until lunchtime today, but always outside the House.  It is always when they are talking to journalists from <i>The Irish Times</i> or radio news channels that they make this claim, or when they were standing on the Leinster House plinth to mark their 100th day in office.  Now is their chance to put this matter to bed in this House, in the company of their peers.  The great socialist flag, the plough and stars, was waved on Friday last in Dublin West.  The rose was blooming in Dublin Castle on Saturday as Michael D. Higgins celebrated his fine election win.  I hope we will not be left to dine on pink salmon this evening.</P>

        <P>At Leaders&rsquo; Questions recently we debated the promise made by this Government not to reduce social welfare payments.  The T&aacute;naiste was quick to state that my party in government had built cuts in the total social welfare budget into the four-year plan.  He chose to ignore that this plan outlined our hierarchy of choices as to how these savings should be achieved.  The last choice, the one to be avoided if at all possible, was rate cuts.  Moreover, we spelt out what needed to be done in order to ensure that option was not necessary.  The first one we identified was control measures &mdash; while the Minister keeps talking about it, I do not know what she is <Col N="317"/>doing about it.  Listening to the Minister one would think the issue of control and reducing wrong payments was one she invented.  In fact it was laid out quite clearly in the four year plan.  This year&rsquo;s figures are smaller than they were last year because the figures last year only related to ten months owing to the industrial action which did not stop the work but stopped the counting.  What new control measures has the Minister introduced?</P>
        <P>The second one was labour activation measures.  It had been my objective to roll our labour activation measures so that all of those who are long-term unemployed would get an opportunity to be involved in some gainful way in society, which I accept it will take time to roll out.  I know of very few people who are unemployed who would not take work even on a scheme as opposed to being unemployed.  I also accept that activation measures allow us to deal with the issue of those who are drawing and working, who represent a minority but a very expensive minority.</P>
        <P>The third was structural reform.  We all agree on the need for structural reform within the social welfare system.  The final one is the creation of employment.  For every 1,000 jobs created the State saves approximately &euro;25 million in the social welfare budget between payments to the unemployed and the income that now comes in directly to the Department from PRSI.  It is considerably handier for the new Minister because there is no longer a sharing of that with the health levy and it can be very accurately assessed now.  Through all these measures it should be possible to make the &euro;600 million saving without touching headline payments.</P>
        <P>What has the Minister done since she came to office?  Since one of the biggest customers, effectively, of the ESB was the Department of Social Protection, I had made a proposal that a saving could be made to the Exchequer by demanding a better deal from the people supplying the free electricity to the customer.  What did the Minister do?  She did it with the private sector with telephone suppliers, but she failed to force change on the electricity companies &mdash; the main one being the ESB which has by far the biggest number of pensioner customers and at the time had an inflated electricity price because of the regulator&rsquo;s ruling.  She failed to make the saving there and instead reduced the number of free units to people in receipt of free electricity from 2,400 units to 1,800.</P>
        <P>She might say there were difficulties.  When the departmental officials told me about the difficulties I said muna f&eacute;idir liom &eacute; a fh&aacute;il ar bhealach amh&aacute;in, gheobhaidh m&eacute; ar bhealach eile &eacute; and the second way was very simple.  If we could not get a bulk discount &mdash; even though we are the best payers on time all the time and they need to spend nothing collecting this money &mdash; I said that there is a very easy answer and that is that we could make the saving by demanding an extra dividend from Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the ESB if all else fails.  Just as the Minister did not cut the free telephone rental allowance, in no way was it ever intended that a saving would be made by cutting the free electricity allowance to people.</P>
        <P>When I left the Department we had proposals on mortgage interest supplement at an advanced stage of development.  One of those was to abolish the 30-hour rule.  In many cases because two household incomes have been reduced to one there is still a partner working for more than 30 hours which automatically disqualifies people from mortgage interest supplement.  A document that was left for the Minister of which I have a copy, proposed the abolition of that provision and many other improvements to mortgage interest supplement.  Listed in the document prepared by Department of Social Protection officials was to introduce a Bill in spring 2011 to abolish the 30-hour rule.  I asked them to give me a timescale in which these things could be done.  I have the document they gave me and the timescales were their timescales.  Obviously I wanted it done as quickly as possible and they suggested a Bill in spring.</P>
        <P>I got an answer to a parliamentary question today which stated the Department had put all that back, indicating that it was not really concerned about people being unable to pay mort<Col N="318"/>gages.  It suggested they could wait while we have another committee to consider it all over again and come up with different solutions.  The Minister should consider all the people she could have helped if she had been willing to make the simple changes &mdash; which are often the best ones &mdash; in the mortgage interest supplement for which we had provided when we were in government.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Regarding control measures, I ask the Minister for an update on the PPS card which was ready to roll and how many she has issued since she came into office.  The Minister never tires of telling us about the fundamental reform she will introduce into the social welfare system and how she will change it all.  I hope she does so because we had already laid out the menu of changes and had already introduced some legislative changes. I will now spell them out.  We passed a law relating to partial capacity, which allowed people in receipt of invalidity pension depending on the extent of their incapacity, to retain part or all of their payment and engage in long-term gainful employment.  This was a very human proposal because it gave certainty to people rather than the present system which grants an exemption for a year and perhaps for one further year but the person will never get fully commercial employment because of his or her disability and often winds up having to go back on social welfare full-time.  We had passed the law and were drawing up the regulations to introduce it.  Having made that very important first step for those with disabilities, I wonder where the impetus has disappeared.</P>
        <P>In the four year plan we had also provided for an integrated child income support system replacing the child dependant allowances and child benefit with a universal payment and a top-up payment depending on a person&rsquo;s income.  The advantage of that was that it would introduce a single system and eliminate wrinkles in the existing system that can create poverty traps.  We had also outlined the need for the development of a single social welfare assistance payment rather than the myriad of payments that create so many difficulties at the moment.</P>
        <P>I have heard the Minister talk generically about the need to reform the system as if she had invented the entire idea of reforming the Department.  I have never heard her spell out those reforms in detail.  Many of those reforms were already in train when the previous Government left office.  As the Minister knows it takes time between the conception of an idea and its delivery, but there was considerable work going on that would make it a much better system, focused on the people rather than being focused on the schemes.  At the moment our system, like many systems, is based on the concept that a person fits into the scheme.  The social welfare of the future should be such that the scheme fits the person&rsquo;s requirements and is tailored around those needs.  Considerable work had been done.</P>

        <P>I hope the Minister can confirm tonight that there will be no change in social welfare rates and that the cut in the free electricity allowance will be reversed.  I hope also that she will outline in detail the structural changes of which she spoke and what structural changes already in place she will implement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the motion which gives us an opportunity to address social welfare issues in general.  Like previous speakers, I hope Fine Gael and the Labour Party, who promised so much prior to the election, will deliver on their promises and that there will not be in the forthcoming budget cuts in social welfare payments or tax increases for people currently living barely above the breadline.</P>
        <P>Given some of the recent speeches of the Minister for Finance there is concern that the forthcoming budget will introduce cuts in social welfare for pensioners, people on disability allowances and other social welfare recipients.  As has been said, the social welfare budget increased from &euro;6.7 billion in 2000 to &euro;20.9 billion in 2010.  Pension levies increased by 130%, <Col N="319"/>unemployment benefits increased by 130% and child payments increased by 330%, which is as it should be.  Given the ready availability of money during the boom times it was important the less well off in our society were protected.  At that time, unemployment was 4.4% and 2 million people were in employment.  The latter figure has now reduced to 1.7 to 1.8 million people working.  Each week, 1.4 million people receive a social welfare payment, with 2.1 million people benefiting from weekly payments.  A huge amount of money is being paid out but people are deserving of this money.  It is important this continues into the future.</P>
        <P>The four year plan introduced in November aimed to achieve savings in social welfare expenditure through a combination of control measures, labour activation, structural reforms, further reductions in rates, as necessary, and in a fall in the liver register.  However, it is important to note that the fall in the liver register has not occurred and that the figure in respect of unemployment, as of September 2011, is 14.3%, which is a considerable increase on the 13.9% figure when this Government took office.  Despite the Government&rsquo;s introduction of the jobs and other initiatives the number of people working has not increased.  The Minister might, when replying, comment on that issue.</P>
        <P>I would like to raise a number of issues with the Minister.  There is much talk on radio and reference in media reports to tackling fraud.  While it is important fraud is tackled, it is also important that people on social welfare are not labelled criminals.  Much of this talk would lead people to believe that the only people engaged in fraud are social welfare recipients.  The percentage of fraud in this country is minuscule.  While it is right to stamp this out we must ensure we do not go over board.  In this regard, huge numbers of people in receipt of disability allowance and invalidity pension are having their allowances withdrawn.  These are seriously ill people.  We have all been visited at our clinics by disabled people and by people with serious problems whose allowances are being withdrawn, causing consternation and severe hardship.</P>
        <P>Most people appeal these decisions.  I have attended social welfare appeals with many constituents.  Generally, following a nine or 12 month wait for an appeal, the independent appeals officer restores a disability allowance or invalidity pension.  I do not know what type of medical personnel are undertaking these assessments but some of the decisions to withdraw invalidity pension or disability allowances are not in the best interests of the client.  The Minister should take a serious look at this area.  The long delays and the waste of the time of appeals officers in having to travel to places such as Wexford to engage with seriously ill people in respect of having their payment restored is not good enough.  The issue needs to be examined by the Department.</P>
        <P>Many long term unemployed people are seeking places on what are currently termed &ldquo;activation schemes&rdquo;.  In my earlier days in politics these were known as F&Aacute;S and CE schemes.  There is demand for places on such schemes.  However, a person who has been in receipt of social welfare during the previous year may only take up a place on the scheme for one year.  This needs to be re-examined.  People want to remain on these schemes rather than return to claiming unemployment benefit.  They want to contribute to their communities, be it the GAA or soccer club, tidy towns or so on.  It is a waste of talent and manpower to have such people return to claiming social welfare benefit, the amount of which is often akin to what they would get while on the scheme.  It is ridiculous that these people are being returned to the unemployment register when they could remain on these schemes.</P>
        <P>When in office, former Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, announced he had employed extra appeals officers.  However, it can still take up to nine months before an appeal is heard.  Perhaps the Minister will when replying will tell us how many extra appeals officers are now in the system and why it is taking nine months to a year for appeals to be heard, which is the case in my constituency.   It should be possible to speed up this system.</P><Col N="320"/>
        <P>Another issue of concern, as highlighted by Deputy Cowen, is self employed people, many of whom, through no fault of their own, lost their business and income, in particular in the construction sector.  These people are being put through the ringer when they go to claim supplementary or job seeker&rsquo;s allowances.  Most times, they are refused, following which there is a cumbersome appeals system.  In fairness, it should be easier for these people, who have worked all their lives and have never claimed social welfare payments, to get help when they need it.  After all, they have contributed to the State and should not be abandoned by it, as is currently the case.  It is not good enough.</P>
        <P>My final point relates to part-time workers who take up short term work for, say, two or three months or, seasonal work.  People in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will not take up short term opportunities owing to difficulties in the system in terms of reclaiming jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  I believe anyone engaged in part time work for a minimum of three or six months, be it in strawberry picking, as is common in my constituency, should be automatically returned to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance when that work finishes.  They should not have to make a claim, have it refused and then engage in the appeals system.  These issues need to be addressed.  While I accept the need to combat fraud, the genuine person should not be penalised.  There should be in place an easier system which allows people who take up part time work to reclaim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance when that work finishes.</P>
        <P>There are other issues I could raise, including the free fuel and back-to-education allowances.  Perhaps the Minister will, when replying, tell us the number of people awaiting payment of the back-to-education allowance.  Many people in my constituency have still not received their allowance.  I am aware the Minister has done her best to speed up the process and that the problem is one of increased numbers of claimants.  However, people are dependant on the allowance, the processing of which should be speeded up further.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am interested and intrigued by the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il has finally raised the issue of social welfare in this motion.  However, it is deeply hypocritical that the very party that did so much to bring this country to the point of collapse by its reckless spending should now seek to bring forward such a motion.  When we came into Government and did the maths, we quickly realised that the country could not afford the bill that Fianna F&aacute;il had left us.  We realised we needed to put the funding of our social welfare system on a more sustainable footing.  The alternative would be to leave the country where Fianna F&aacute;il had left it, bankrupt and dependent on others for financial support.</P>
        <P>This Government wants to restore our national sovereignty.  We want to be in control of our own destiny by the time we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising in 2016.  We want to be financially independent and to pay our own way but we have a way to go before our income matches our expenditure.</P>
        <P>As the House is all too aware, the social protection budget grew in a particularly dramatic fashion over the past decade when Fianna F&aacute;il was in power.  In 2001, spending on social protection stood at &euro;7.84 billion; by last year this had grown to &euro;20.85 billion, an increase of 266%.  To put that in context, inflation increased by around 30% during the same period.  Some of the social welfare spending increases are down to the dramatic rise in unemployment since 2007, but the most significant factor is a surge in both rates and the number and size of schemes over a very long period of Fianna F&aacute;il governance.  Frankly, the increases in social protection payments were often cynically and very effectively timed to help Fianna F&aacute;il win elections and this is certainly what happened.  The party showed little or no regard as to whether the State could continue to afford to meet these Fianna F&aacute;il promises.</P>
        <P>The fact that these schemes were funded from unsustainable revenues caused by the housing boom appears to have been lost on the previous Government.  As a result, we have inherited a level of social expenditure that is completely out of sync with the funding base of the State.  Worse, even in the good times, Fianna F&aacute;il distinguished itself by a wilful lack of ambition for the people who turned to the State for protection.  I find it very difficult to remember that Fianna F&aacute;il characterised so many people as being unemployable as well as unemployed.  In its &ldquo;spend it, when you have it&rdquo; way, Fianna F&aacute;il threw money around like confetti at a wedding.  They doled it out without regard to the needs of their clients, many of whom would have benefited more from help with a job, education or training.  As a result, our social welfare system has taken a largely passive approach.  These are not my words but the words of a number of international commentators and of recent national reports.  We allow people to receive certain benefits indefinitely.  Under Fianna F&aacute;il, there were only very limited sanctions for those who refused offers of work or training and often there were very few offers of work, training, back to education or work experience.</P>
        <P>Over the past decade, most OECD countries have successfully introduced such policies while in Ireland there has been hardly any movement in this area.  More is the pity, for the OECD has estimated that we would have entered the recession with 100,000 fewer people on the live register if Fianna F&aacute;il governments had introduced such policies during the good times.  When <Col N="322"/>the recession hit, Fianna F&aacute;il was the first to hit the low-paid workers with a cynical reduction in the minimum wage, which this Government immediately reversed upon taking office.  I introduced the motion to reverse this decision.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I will acknowledge that the current Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on social protection supported my measure to re-introduce and re-instate the minimum wage.</P>
        <P>As we all know, overall Government spending in 2011 will be roughly &euro;18 billion more than this year&rsquo;s overall Government income.  The Government will get &euro;42 billion from tax and PRSI this year. My Department alone is expected to spend over &euro;20 billion of this.  One of the core commitments in the programme for Government is the restoration of financial stability.  For that reason, the transition to a more balanced budgetary position simply cannot be made without affecting social welfare spending.</P>
        <P>The EU-IMF agreement, signed by Fianna F&aacute;il, commits the Government to a further adjustment of at least &euro;3.6 billion in budget 2012, including a reduction in expenditure of &euro;2.1 billion.  The Department of Social Protection has a major contribution to make in achieving a more balanced budget, as it accounts for 39% of expenditure or about 13% of GDP.  Most Deputies know that this 13% of GDP is of vital importance to many local economies and regions.  The EU-IMF agreement also commits the Department to reforms that can better support people on lower incomes while also ensuring that for welfare recipients, work pays.  Despite these severe constraints, the Government is determined to do its utmost to protect the most vulnerable people in Irish society.  I recognise that the people who turn to my Department for protection generally had no role in causing this economic crisis and should therefore be shielded from the worst of its consequences.</P>
        <P>There are considerable challenges ahead, including the need to safeguard, as far as possible, the key income supports and services operated by my Department.  I recognise the severe impact on families, individuals and communities as a result of this economic collapse and we are determined to protect them from the worst consequences of this very deep recession.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about reform and transformation of social protection.  The transformation and reforming of our system of social protection is key to preserving our way of life in this country.  While our social protection system is successful in providing a basic level of income support and a threshold of decency, it does not sufficiently enable people to get themselves back on track, into work, or, in the absence of jobs, to go back to education or training, and ultimately to achieve their full potential and financial independence for themselves and their families.  Internationally, a number of features of our system are outliers.  I refer to the emphasis on universal child cash benefits where other countries place emphasis on child care and preschool education.  In our system it is possible for a small number of people to remain indefinitely on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  The system has also had very limited success to date in what is known as activation, assisting people in getting back to work, education or training as soon as possible, by providing advice, placement and training referral services.  Given the significant increases in rates over the past decade, the so-called replacement rate, or the proportion of their former wages that unemployed people receive in benefits, has increased in the case of some recipients to levels where it may discourage them from seeking work.</P>
        <P>The troika is asking very hard questions about the extent to which we can preserve such benefits that are considerably in excess of what is provided to citizens of the countries that are funding our State.  Strong systems of social protection are at the heart of some of the world&rsquo;s most successful and dynamic economies.  Countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Finland and the <Col N="323"/>Netherlands, some of which are comparable in size to ours, have over time developed systems that enable citizens to cope with the economic risks of modern life.  They provide sufficient income to deal with unexpected circumstances like unemployment, illness or disability or support for particular stages of life like childhood, the birth of a child and, in particular, when people become older and retire.</P>
        <P>These countries view social security as a social contract between the state and the citizen.  Like all contracts it imposes duties and obligations on both parties.  When we compare our system of social protection to the social contract that exists in the Nordic countries we see they require the recipients of state assistance to do something in return, whereas we rarely do.  I welcome Deputy Browne&rsquo;s reference to his desire to see more places available to people.  I believe many people wish to be active and assist their community.  They wish to be contributors, in the broadest sense, even if at this time of recession they find it extremely difficult to get a job.</P>
        <P>The key element of our transformation from a passive system of income support to a more proactive model is the establishment of the new National Employment and Entitlements Service, NEES.  This is effectively a public employment services policy.  The service will merge F&Aacute;S employment services and community employment programmes, along with community welfare, into the Department of Social Protection. The idea is to create an integrated service providing a one-stop shop for people seeking to establish their benefit entitlements.  The service will engage with people on the live register in a different way so that we can help to get more people back to work.</P>
        <P>I reiterate my concern that our social protection system does not ensure the outcomes that children who are in poor families deserve to have.  Many poor children in poor families in this country grow up to be poor adults.  I would like to see emphasis put on more and better preschools and on early education rather than simply on cash transfers to families.  That has been done very successfully in many countries and as a society we need to think about it.</P>
        <P>Many contributors spoke about the issue of fraud.  Most people on social welfare get what they are entitled to, no more and no less.  Most people involved in social welfare are honest.  They regard it as a mark of honour to treat with the State honestly.  However, there are people who abuse the system.  The difficulty with fraud and abuse in the system is not simply the money this costs but the undermining of the integrity of the system.  Those people who pay into the system see people benefiting, perhaps within or near their own community.  They work in the black economy or are scamming and ripping off the system in other ways.  They are small in number but are very significant in terms of undermining the system.  We have adopted a new approach based on targeted approaches by social welfare squads, integrated squads working with the Revenue Commissioners, Customs and the Garda to tackle social welfare fraud.  There are also &ldquo;feet on the street&rdquo;, inspectors who visit employers to ensure all their employees are registered for PRSI.  They visit people in their homes to check they are genuinely what they claim to be and are receiving the benefits to which they are entitled, no more and no less.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is another important point.  At present we are taking in approximately &euro;7 billion in terms of social insurance contributions but are spending approximately &euro;9 billion.  The gap is &euro;1.9 billion.  Most Deputies, regardless of our political difficulties, want to see us having a strong, high-quality system of social protection.  However, the deficit between what we take in in social insurance contributions and what we spend is &euro;1.9 billion and we must address it.  During the bubble in the construction sector it was filled by the enormous tax revenues the Government generated but the deficit is now &euro;1.9 billion.</P>
        <P>That is one of the issues we in this House must look at with regard to how we build a sustainable social welfare system that protects, in particular, our older and retired people who through their work and effort helped to build up this country.  In my focus in approaching the <Col N="324"/>budget, I want as far as possible to ensure the protection of the primary social welfare rates but also to see that social welfare expenditure is targeted at the people who need it most.  In regard to older people, for example, we spend a great deal of money on fuel allowances.  We might be far better off spending more of that money insulating older people&rsquo;s homes.  Instead of having heat going out through single-pane windows and going up the chimney in badly insulated and poorly repaired homes we would save on fuel allowances.</P>
        <P>These changes of emphasis are very important in terms of getting the kind of society we believe is appropriate.  If one is dependent on a social welfare income the State offers support but equally, if one is of working age, the State expects one to work during one&rsquo;s working life and be a contributor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickODonovan"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  Having listened for the past ten or 15 minutes, it is refreshing to hear the Minister speak as she did, referring to the need for restructuring the social protection system and focusing on outcome rather than cold figures.</P>
        <P>I also agree with much of what Deputy Cowen said concerning reform, how things might be done differently, and the importance of the social protection schemes.  It is a pity that during the previous 14 years that same level of empathy with people was not seen in the previous Government.  To borrow a phrase from someone else, &ldquo;We are where we are&rdquo;, and it is not a very good place.  As the Minister observed, more than &euro;20 billion is being spent currently on social protection as a direct result of the economic collapse the country has endured.  That is a story for another day.</P>
        <P>The most important aspect of the Minister&rsquo;s speech concerned the vital need to protect the needy, those people who are reliant on social protection payments to get from Monday to Sunday.  One cannot underestimate the importance of this when one is sitting in one&rsquo;s constituency office and a person comes in who is almost embarrassed to be looking for assistance with the completion of a form.  I am sure every Member in the Chamber has seen this.  The individual does not want to be in this position but he or she has no alternative.  People tell me the indignity of losing their job is one matter but it is compounded by having to go through a system which in many cases does not treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve, having lost their job and being put into this position.  I was at a committee meeting recently when the issue of the quantity of PPS numbers was raised.  Some of them are way out there in space.  God only knows who is responsible for them, or what actual purpose they have.  I am concerned about the number of PPS numbers, what is happening with them and how they correlate with the needs of the country at this time.  Deputy Browne spoke about the access to social protection of the self-employed when they fall on difficult times and the use by some people of the social welfare system to compete with the self-employed.  Such issues need to be highlighted.  The Minister alluded to social welfare fraud earlier.  I raised the use of PPS numbers in the House previously.  It should be possible for them to be accessed by officials working in housing, motor tax, the HSE and all other aspects of public expenditure.  Passenger records are transferred between Ireland and other jurisdictions so we have details of those moving in and out of this country.  However, we are unable to provide that level of information to the Department of Social Protection.</P>
        <P>As the Minister said, social welfare fraud is not an attack on a particular individual, but an attack on the State as a whole.  A small minority of people are ripping the State off.  This Government has made substantial savings in this regard, as did the previous Government, in fairness to Mary Coughlan.  I wonder if further savings can be made in this area.  We all know of people in every town and village in this country who have no visible signs of income but are <Col N="325"/>enjoying the life of Riley.  They are small in number but, as the Minister said, they cause questions to be asked among taxpayers, people who pay into the social welfare system and other legitimate service users.  They want to know how they can be in their positions when people who have never worked a day in their lives have the life of Riley.  I wish the Minister well in her endeavours.  I congratulate the Opposition on introducing this motion and giving us a chance to inject a decent amount of fact into this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmKeaveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Colm Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the previous speaker, I am delighted to speak on this motion.  I welcome some of the comments that have been made.  Good ideas are emerging as part of the reform agenda, particularly from members of the Opposition.  Fianna F&aacute;il has left us with a level of social expenditure that is completely out of sync with the State&rsquo;s capacity to meet the social welfare needs that exist.  That is a consequence of 14 years of giveaway Fianna F&aacute;il budgets that brought the country to near ruination.  When the Government came to power earlier this year, it quickly realised that the country could not afford the bill that Fianna F&aacute;il had left it.  We realised that we needed to place the funding of the social welfare system on a more sustainable footing.</P>
        <P>One of the core commitments in the programme for Government is restoration of this country&rsquo;s fiscal stability and economic sovereignty.  As Deputies know, overall expenditure under this year&rsquo;s budget will be approximately &euro;18 billion more than this year&rsquo;s overall Government income.  The Government will get &euro;42 billion from tax and PRSI this year.  The Department of Social Protection is expected to spend &euro;20 billion this year.  Therefore, a transition to a more balanced budgetary position cannot be made without affecting the delivery of social services.  The EU-IMF agreement commits the Government to a further adjustment of &euro;3.6 billion in the 2012 budget.  The Deputies opposite signed off on that agreement when they were in government.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection has a major contribution to make in achieving a more balanced budget, as it accounts for almost 39% of expenditure.  The EU-IMF agreement commits the Department to reforms that can better support families with lower incomes, while ensuring that work pays and that welfare recipients receive adequate support.  The Department accounts for 39% of gross current expenditure, which is equivalent to 13% of GDP.  Most of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure, including associated administrative costs, can be divided into a number of broad areas.</P>
        <P>A wide range of supports for people of working age account for approximately 50% of the Department&rsquo;s overall expenditure, or nearly &euro;12 billion.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit account for &euro;3.6 billion.  Just over &euro;1.1 billion is spent on one-parent family payments.  Carers receive nearly &euro;750 million.  Pensions and other supports for retired and older people account for nearly 29% of the Department&rsquo;s overall expenditure, or nearly &euro;6.1 billion.  Almost 60% of that, or over &euro;3.6 billion, goes on the State contributory pension, which is the single biggest social welfare scheme.  A further &euro;951 million is required for the State non-contributory pension and &euro;920 million is required for the widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s non-contributory pensions.  Support for children and families accounts for almost 12% of expenditure, or nearly &euro;4 billion.  It is estimated that almost &euro;669 million is spent on qualified child increases while &euro;199 million is spent on family income supplement.</P>
        <P>The manner in which the service is delivered is critically important to this debate.  The service provided by the Department affects the lives of almost everyone in the State.  In 2010, the Department processed approximately 2 million claims and made over 84 million payment transactions.  Over 6 million telephone calls were received at the headquarters section.  Almost 1 million reviews were conducted by the Department last year.  In 2011, an average of 1.4 million people will receive a social welfare payment each week.  When qualified adults and children <Col N="326"/>are included, a total of more than 2 million people will benefit from weekly payments.  In addition, child benefit payments will reach nearly 600,000 families, with nearly 1.1 million children affected positively every month.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government states that the most positive way of reducing social welfare expenditure is to facilitate the maximum number of unemployed people to take up employment or self-employment.  The Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative has already started that process.  The rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI in respect of employees on the national minimum wage has been halved from 8.5% to 4.25%.  VAT has been reduced from 13.5% to 9% on a range of tourism related products and services.  The introduction of the national internship scheme, JobBridge, gives work experience to unemployed people in the form of placements of between six and nine months.</P>
        <P>JobBridge has assisted in breaking the cycle whereby jobseekers were unable to get jobs without having experience, either as new entrants in the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills.  The scheme gives people a real opportunity to gain valuable experience to bridge the gap between study and beginning work.  JobBridge and the national internship scheme are part of the Government&rsquo;s job initiative and were launched on 1 July this year.  Claimants continue to receive their primary social welfare payment as well as a &euro;50 additional payment for participating in the scheme.  As of Thursday, 27 October, a total of 2,508 internship opportunities with host organisations were available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Some 2,185 interns have commenced internships under the JobBridge scheme to date.  Some 630 of them have converted from work placements.</P>
        <P>JobBridge exists to assist individuals to bridge the gap between unemployment and the world of work.  It aims to assist individuals of all levels of skill, ranging from those who left school early to highly qualified graduates.  It is a unique opportunity to develop new skills and earn valuable experience.  Feedback on the scheme has revealed that many excellent internships have been offered to non-graduates in the retail and catering sectors.  Participants are learning new skills, staying in touch with the labour market and putting themselves in a better position for full-time employment.  The JobBridge scheme contains a number of measures to minimise displacement.  Host organisations must declare that none of their participants is displacing an employee.  The JobBridge team checks applications, where possible, to ensure vacancies advertised on the F&Aacute;S Jobs Ireland website do not involve displacement.  If displacement is an issue, the inspection team ensures there is liaison between F&Aacute;S and management and can intervene.</P>
        <P>Under the advisory groups on tax and social welfare, we are harnessing the type of experience needed to examine the operation and interaction of tax and social protection.  Recommendations will be made on the most cost-effective solutions and how employment can be incentivised and improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, especially in the area of child poverty, by identifying specific, practical administrative improvements in their operation.</P>
        <P>This is a very important debate.  The programme for Government clearly sets out the Government&rsquo;s determination to do its utmost to protect the most vulnerable.  The country faces a significant challenge in safeguarding, in as far as possible, the key income supports and services operated by the Department of Social Protection.  We must recognise the severe impact of the economic collapse on families, individuals and communities.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis na Teachta&iacute; Seamus Healy agus Michael Healy-Rae.</P>
        <P>The motion before us is slightly bizarre.  Having used its final few budgets in government to target social welfare recipients, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has a brass neck proposing the motion and pretending to care about them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should check out the increases in social welfare over the previous ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The party&rsquo;s attack of conscience is a little rich and a little late.  If it is genuine and sustainable, it is welcome but I must wait and see if that is the case.  Between 2008 and early 2011, Fianna F&aacute;il imposed unnecessary, counter-productive and draconian cuts to social welfare payments which affected the lives of many people.  They targeted jobseekers, carers, people with disabilities, pensioners, children and lone parents.  The cuts were introduced to protect the wealthy and the money saved was ploughed into the black hole of bank bondholders, an issue the House discussed earlier, and used, in the main, to pay off rich German and French gamblers.</P>
        <P>The social welfare cuts introduced by the previous Government have had a depressing impact on local economies, the result of which has been more job losses.  We continue to see the horrendous effects of cuts, such as the abolition last year of the Christmas bonus, on those directly affected, whereas their effects on local retailers and manufacturers have not been fully quantified.  Many shops closed and many jobs were lost as a consequence of this measure.  Rather than protecting the Christmas bonus and using it as a stimulus mechanism, as Sinn F&eacute;in advocated, the previous Government chose to abolish it.</P>
        <P>As to the impact of the cuts, a couple with two children who were struggling to survive on social welfare had their allowances cut by nearly 10% between 2009 and 2011.  Over the same period, a lone parent with a three year old child had her allowances cut by &euro;43, while carers and people with disabilities suffered similar reductions in income.  While it was depressing enough to go through that period under the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government, the new Government, which was elected on a platform that included a commitment not to cut social welfare, a commitment it repeated in the programme for Government, has proceeded to implement one of the most serious cuts to date.  I refer to the decision it took in July to cut the <Col N="328"/>household benefits package and fuel allowance, which will be a matter of life and death for many people.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael-Labour Party Government is pursuing a depressingly familiar approach.  Between 1,500 and 2,000 avoidable deaths occur every year as a result of cold.  The recent cuts in fuel allowance will undoubtedly increase this figure.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment calls for their reversal before they seriously impact on health, specifically the health of pensioners and those who live alone or in substandard accommodation.  The consequences of proposed cuts must be examined before they are implemented.  This was not done in this case.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed an alternative to the Minister for Social Protection.  Rather than impose cuts on the fuel allowance, she should have imposed cuts on energy suppliers such as the ESB before contemplating any other cut.  She chose not to do so until after the cuts were introduced and has still not managed to address the issue in the ESB.  The cut which was introduced in July and took effect in September must be reversed immediately.</P>
        <P>Recently, at the launch of new research, Eamon Timmins of Age Action described the cuts in the fuel allowance as &ldquo;literally a life and death issue for hundreds of older people who will struggle to heat their homes to a safe level over the coming months&rdquo;.  The research shows that during the winter of 2006-07, there were 1,281 excess winter deaths, of whom the vast majority were older people.  The figure has increased in the meantime.  I guarantee that the exceptionally cold conditions of last winter and the abolition of the Christmas bonus resulted in many more people being forced to leave lighting and heating switched off.  The consequences for many will have been death or admission to an accident and emergency department.</P>
        <P>Age Action sent out a questionnaire to a large number of people.  Almost one quarter of respondents stated their homes were too cold.  Even more startling was the finding that 51% of respondents went without other necessities such as food and clothing to pay their fuel bills.  Anyone who canvassed in the recent presidential election or the general election in February will have noticed homes where lights were not switched on and the interior was almost as cold as the outside temperature.  This was not because people want to live in such conditions but because they cannot afford to switch on their lighting or heating.  At the very time the Minister was imposing changes to the household benefits package, the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is were increasing their prices by between 20% and 25%.  This is an additional factor.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that social welfare payments here are higher than in other countries.  One of the reasons for this is that the cost of living here, including the price of fuel and other necessities, is higher than in other countries.  For this reason, current social welfare rates must be retained to enable people to survive.</P>
        <P>The Minister went further than anyone else in her efforts to demonise people on social welfare when she described unemployment as a &ldquo;lifestyle choice&rdquo;.  Attacking the unemployed for being out of work allows the Government to shift on to others the blame for the state of the economy.  Rather than accept responsibility for not having a job creation strategy and refusing to bail out the banks, it is pursuing easy targets, namely, the hundreds and thousands of people who rely on the little they receive from the State to get by.  It is possible to tackle the annual budget deficit without cutting spending on social welfare but a political decision must be made to do so.  While I support measures to address social welfare fraud and reduce the bureaucratic and human error which leads to overpayment, I will not accept any demonisation of those who are dependent on social welfare.</P>
        <P>Contrary to what the previous speaker stated, jobs are not available and retraining and educational opportunities are limited for those who are living a soul-destroying life on the dole. <Col N="329"/>  What we need are real sustainable jobs.  These jobs are even harder to come by for people who are disabled, people with child care responsibilities and people aged 50 or over.</P>
        <P>We need a change, but the Government does not seem to be bringing about that change.  Hopefully, the amendment I am putting forward will be accepted.  At the least, I hope it will be read by the Minister when considering any cuts to the social welfare rates in the forthcoming budget.  Any cut will mean that people will be left to suffer the consequences, which may, as we know already, mean death.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for allowing me use some of his time.</P>
        <P>Social welfare levels should ensure that people have sufficient income to live with dignity.  They should also be designed to ensure the existence of effective pathways to education, training and employment, including access to quality and affordable child care and after school care for parents.  The cuts to payments reduce peoples&rsquo; capacity to participate fully in society.  For many, the cuts impact on their ability to heat their homes to a sufficient level and to provide adequately for themselves and their families   For those who are unemployed, the cuts reduce their capacity to interact in a way which opens up training and employment opportunities.  This results in negative physical and mental health outcomes, including depression, for many people.</P>
        <P>The cuts also have a wider negative impact on disadvantaged communities.  From a purely economic perspective, social welfare cuts also reduce spending in the economy, as those on low incomes need to spend all their money to survive day to day.  Therefore, a cut to welfare levels takes money out of the economy, has a deflationary effect and cannot be seen as a euro for euro saving for the Exchequer.  The decisions the Government makes regarding social welfare payments are its decisions and cannot be blamed on the ghost of governments past.   On 9 March when I first spoke in this House, I reminded the incoming Taoiseach of the late Declan Costello and his Just Society document.  Never before or since have the aspirations of the just and fair society been called into question.  I again remind Members of this Government of this document.  Never in the history of this State has there been a time when the least well off have been seen to be paying for the sins of the speculators.  It is time we put our people first and ensured that their needs are a priority.</P>
        <P>I appreciate fully that a person of the immense personal wealth of the Minister for Social Protection will find it hard to appreciate the hardship of a person or family living on benefits after a lifetime of living on immense salaries and drowning in personal wealth.  It is very hard for a person like that to understand or comprehend why people will go cold this winter or why it was such a horrible decision to cut back on the fuel allowance, particularly considering the winter we had last year and the winter we possibly face this year.  The Minister will certainly not go cold, but the people she and I and other Deputies represent will go cold.  A significant number of them will go cold, but if one is drowned in personal wealth, one finds it hard to understand that.</P>
        <P>It is a poor thing if the best any Minister can come up with is to look back on previous Governments and attack them.  This Government has the ball in its hands and it is running the country.  It is time it gave up this nonsense of looking back at the past.  It must shoulder its responsibilities.  It is running the country and it has its say now.  It makes the decisions and can decide where cuts will be made.  It must give up the nonsense of looking back all the time, because we are getting sick of that.</P>
        <P>One last point, the tag being given to the Minister of the &ldquo;Minister for lifestyle choice&rdquo; is a bad tag to be stuck with for a term.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for reminding me of that.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="330"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Healy-Rae.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on this issue.  I condemn out of hand the conduct of the Government and its shameful attacks on elderly people.  These shameful attacks will mean not just that the safety of elderly people is at risk, but that their lives are at risk.  The actions of the Government and of the so-called Labour Party Minister for Social Protection in cutting back on heating, electricity and gas allowances will have a huge effect on elderly people over the coming winter.  The cuts will not only affect their health, but unfortunately, elderly people will die as a result of the cutbacks.  James Connolly and Jim Larkin must be turning in their graves when somebody who claims them as her predecessors will implement these savage and shameful cuts to allowances for ordinary elderly people.</P>
        <P>The Age Action Ireland organisation recently set up a petition on its website which asks how low the Government can go.  It states that hundreds of older people die each year in winter here because they cannot afford to keep themselves warm and that lives could be saved if the Government reversed its decision to cut their electricity and gas units.  It goes on to call on the Government to reverse the cuts to the free gas and electricity units available under the household benefits package, given the increased hardship they will cause for older people on low incomes.  Age Action Ireland believes that deaths will arise as a result of the savage cutbacks to allowances to elderly people.</P>
        <P>Age Action Ireland goes on to say that this is a life and death issue for hundreds of older people who will struggle to heat their homes to safe levels over the coming months.  The organisation has indicated that research which will be published in the next fortnight or three weeks by the Institute of Public Health and the Dublin Institute of Technology will show that during the winter of 2006-07, some 1,281 excess winter deaths occurred.  Of these, the majority were deaths of older people.  Some 1,216 were aged over 65.  Age Action Ireland says that these people are dying because they cannot afford to heat their homes to a safe level.  It is concerned, in particular, about older people who live alone on low incomes in older, poorly insulated houses and who are often in poor health or suffer with a physical disability.</P>
        <P>These cuts are outrageous, particularly in the context of the &euro;770 million the Government paid over to faceless and anonymous speculators in Anglo Irish Bank today.  The choice was to pay these bondholders, speculators and bankers.  The Government paid them, yet it imposed cuts on the fuel, electricity and gas allowances of elderly people.  These cuts will have a serious impact on the health of these people and will cause deaths this winter.  These cutbacks come at a time when gas and electricity prices have increased by 20% and 25%.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister, who is a Labour Party Minister, to reverse these cuts and to ensure that ordinary elderly people who had no hand, act or part in creating the recession are decently treated by the Government.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A passport application for the daughter of the person in question was submitted to the Passport Service on 1 June, 2011.  In accordance with the provisions of the Passports Act 2008, this Department must be satisfied that an applicant is an Irish citizen before issuing her with a passport.   As the applicant was born in the State in May, 2011 her entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by Section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, (the Act).  The Act provides that a person, who is born in the State on or after 1 January, 2005 and does not have a parent who is either an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for a passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three of the four years preceding the birth of the child.</P>
        <P>This Department assesses such applications in line with guidelines provided by the Department of Justice and Equality, which is responsible for matters of citizenship and immigration.  In accordance with these guidelines, the proofs of lawful residence, which are accepted and considered in connection with passport applications, are immigration stamps in passports or the registration cards/books which are given to persons registering with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  Letters from GNIB which outline the various permissions to stay in the State that are issued by them, are also taken into account. These are official documents, which can be objectively verified and are relied on by the Department in the processing of passport applications.</P>
        <P>In line with the requirements of the Act, the lawful residence in the State of the applicant&rsquo;s mother in the four year period preceding her daughter&rsquo;s date of birth was examined.  As a <Col N="332"/>result of this, the Department wrote to the person in question on 23 June and 20 July, 2011 to inform her that from the submitted evidence, the total amount of her reckonable residence did not meet with the statutory requirement of three years and that as her child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship had not been demonstrated, the Department could not issue a passport to her.</P>
        <P>However, solicitors representing the applicant&rsquo;s parents wrote to the Department on 28 July, 2011 and presented additional evidence of the mother&rsquo;s reckonable residence in Ireland.  This evidence was in the form of a letter, dated 24 March, 2009, from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which granted permission to stay in the State for three years from the date of the letter.  The effect of accepting this letter as evidence of reckonable residence for the purposes of the Act would increase the amount of reckonable residence above the statutory requirement thereby demonstrating the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship and a passport.</P>
        <P>Legal advice from the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office has been obtained.   Officials in the Passport Service are presently discussing this advice with the Department of Justice and Equality.  I have asked for this case to be given highest priority with a view to finalising this matter in the next two weeks.  I will revert to you directly at that time with the outcome of these consultations.</P>

	<P>I am gravely concerned about the case of Mrs. Asia Bibi. In November 2010 a Punjab court found Mrs. Bibi guilty of blasphemy, sentencing her to death by hanging. I understand that this is the first time a woman has been sentenced to death in Pakistan under its blasphemy law. My information is that Mrs. Bibi&rsquo;s case is to be the subject of an appeal to the High Court in Punjab. Her detention while awaiting appeal, and the conditions of that detention, are deeply troubling.   When the case came to the attention of my Department, a senior official contacted the Embassy of Pakistan to express our concern at the conviction and sentence. He also expressed our disquiet at the nature of Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy law. Mrs. Bibi&rsquo;s case and Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy laws were discussed at length during bilateral political consultations in Dublin at the end of May with the Pakistani Additional Foreign Secretary for Europe, when our concerns about the conviction, sentence and the nature of Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy laws were again strongly expressed.</P>
        <P>Senior officials in my Department remain active on the case, including in representations to the authorities of Pakistan. Representations have been made as recently as last week to the Embassy of Pakistan.</P>
        <P>At European level High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Catherine Ashton, has also expressed her concerns at the Asia Bibi judgement and others like it, and called on Pakistan to respect human rights as guaranteed under international conventions to which it is a party.  She also re-affirmed the European Union&rsquo;s position on the death penalty as a cruel and inhuman punishment.</P>
        <P>Respect for human rights is a cornerstone of foreign policy for both Ireland and the European Union as whole.  The Pakistani Government has made commitments to protect religious minorities and to promote religious tolerance. The establishment of a Ministry for Human Rights, a Ministry for Minorities and the proposed establishment of an independent national <Col N="333"/>Human Rights Commission are initiatives in this regard. However real, tangible progress on the ground is what is required.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to urge the Pakistani Government to resolve Mrs. Bibi&rsquo;s case as soon as possible and to initiate a thorough review of its blasphemy law, including the use of the death penalty. I would also ask them to respond to the concerns of Ireland, and the international community, by addressing the conditions of Mrs. Bibi&rsquo;s detention. Mrs. Bibi&rsquo;s case will continue to be followed closely by me and my officials will remain in contact with the Pakistani authorities on this matter.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the registration of vehicles.   I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that some thought has been given to the question of having two registration periods in the one year.  However, it is not clear if it would achieve its aim of spreading the sales of vehicles more evenly throughout the year.  It may also distort the market of both new and second hand sales during the year of introduction and may deny vehicle owners of reasonable expectations of the future value of their vehicles.  For these reasons, this proposal needs considerably further study and analysis before any change could even be considered.  </P>
        <P>Furthermore, any potential change to the system would involve significant costs for Revenue and other stakeholders.  Legislation would need to be amended, forms and leaflets would need to be updated and an information campaign would have to be launched.  Information and Communications Technology systems in Revenue and the Department of Transport would have to be amended, and it may be necessary to recalibrate the number plate recognition systems operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities and toll operators.</P>

	<P>NAMA advises me that it does not directly employ developers. NAMA does, however, work with developers where it considers that this will provide the best return to the taxpayer. The alternative is to take enforcement action against a developer, which NAMA has done in 91 cases so far.    I understand from NAMA that, as part of its business plan agreements with debtors, it normally looks for and obtains a reduction of 50% to 75% in overhead costs and that any remuneration paid to debtors is payable from this much-reduced budget. The Chairman of NAMA has recently stated that the majority of debtor remuneration packages fall into the &euro;70,000 to &euro;100,000 range, including all benefits-in-kind. He also confirmed that in two cases the debtor&rsquo;s remuneration package, authorised by NAMA as part of the budget for overheads, is &euro;200,000.</P>
        <P>The terms and conditions under which individual debtors work with NAMA constitute commercially sensitive, confidential information.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>In circumstances where it is obvious that the purpose of an asset transfer, whether to a spouse or otherwise, was a pre-emptive attempt to put assets beyond the reach of NAMA, NAMA has a number of statutory remedies available to it under Irish law. These include the provisions of the Conveyancing Act, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 and Section 211 of the NAMA Act which provides that NAMA may apply to a Court to declare a disposition to be void if it can show that the effect of the disposition was to impair the value of an eligible bank asset or any rights that NAMA would have acquired but for the disposition.    At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, the Chief Executive of NAMA pointed out that, having been through the business plans of debtors which account for close to 75% of NAMA debt, he does not consider that there is a &ldquo;huge pot of gold&rdquo; that can be recovered through legal proceedings to reverse asset transfers by NAMA debtors. </P>
        <P>I am informed by NAMA, however, that most of the debtors who engaged in such transfers are co-operating with it as regards a voluntary reversal of asset transfers. As negotiations are ongoing with many debtors and assets are being re-valued at current prices, it is not yet possible to determine the final valuation of reversed asset transfers.</P>
        <P>In a number of cases where debtors are refusing to co-operate, it has been necessary for NAMA to adopt a number of approaches, depending on the legal advice received in each particular case. This may involve the pursuit of personal guarantees through the courts and, in some cases, will require litigation to reverse asset transfers where the original intention appears to have been to place the assets concerned beyond the reach of NAMA.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Finance has had no direct contact with the European Banking Authority (EBA) in relation to potential further recapitalisation of the Irish banks.

Officials from the EBA do however present at various committees, for example, Ecofin, at which the Minister or his officials are present. </P>
        <P>The Central Bank of Ireland has informed me that in October 2011, the EBA conducted a review of the capital requirements of the 90 European banks that participated in the 2011 EU-wide stress test against a more stringent set of conditions (mark-to-market of all sovereign exposures and removal of certain regulatory capital filters) and a higher capital ratio of 9% Core Tier 1. As the Irish PCAR stress test published in Mar-2011 was more conservative, all three Irish banks who participated in the 2011 EU-wide exercise are not required to undertake any further recapitalisation as a result of this EBA update exercise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no question of the Government seeking to restructure sovereign debt. The impact of such an action would be highly detrimental to our chances of returning to sovereign debt markets. Such an action would probably cause great damage to our reputation and sacrifice the credibility we have built up through implementing policies that will assist our economy in returning to growth. It would be unwise to jeopardise those hard won gains.  In that regard, it is important to recognise that Ireland is in a totally different situation to Greece. The Greek debt to GDP ratio is projected by the IMF to rise to 186 per cent of GDP by end-2013. The equivalent number for Ireland, published in my Department&rsquo;s latest <i>Stability Programme Update</i>   (SPU) in April, is 118 per cent.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Greek economy is still in the midst of a severe recession. By contrast, Ireland is emerging from recession. April&rsquo;s SPU forecast that real GDP would grow by 0.8 per cent this year and strengthen next year and beyond. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, economic growth will help to bring about a return to debt sustainability. In Greece, the economy is shrinking and this is compounding the problem of an unsustainable debt burden.</P>
        <P>A further critical difference between the two economies relates to the importance of international trade. In Greece, exports amount to the equivalent of just 20 per cent of GDP. This means that export growth cannot provide a significant offset to the contractionary effects of fiscal austerity. In Ireland, by contrast, exports amount to the equivalent of over 100 per cent <Col N="337"/>of GDP which means that the growth of exports can provide a powerful offset to the negative effect of budgetary consolidation on economic activity.</P>
        <P>I have stated on many occasions that all of the sovereign debt owed by the Government will be repaid. We are determined to work together with our European colleagues to find a common, shared approach to the issue of the sovereign debt crisis.</P>
        <P>There is no reason to apply a different reasoning to the senior debt of Ireland&rsquo;s going-concern banks. This will be repaid in full.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has insisted on a strong recapitalisation of the banks and that the Government&rsquo;s policy remains that all creditors of these banks be repaid in full. This policy is already bearing fruit.  Deposits are recovering and the Irish banks have already successfully tapped into wholesale term funding markets since July at a time when many of their European counterparts are experiencing very difficult funding environments.</P>
        <P>However, as the Deputy will be aware the Government has considered burden sharing with senior bondholders in both Anglo and INBS in consultation with our EU partners.  We have said that we will not act on this without the agreement of the ECB. This agreement has, as yet, not been forthcoming.</P>

We have said that we will not act on this without the agreement of the ECB. This agreement has, as yet, not been forthcoming.   I had the opportunity to meet with President Trichet on the margins of the ECOFIN meeting in Poland on Saturday, 17th September. I raised with him the issue of the burden sharing with the senior unguaranteed bondholders in IBRC (formerly Anglo (including INBS)). This was unresolved business and I pressed the case for such burden sharing. However, President Trichet was of the strong view that such action was not in the interests of Ireland or the Euro Area, particularly given the challenges facing the euro area at this time and the contagion that we witnessed recently that has affected Italy and Spain. Commissioner Rehn also made the same point on this issue when I met him at a separate meeting.</P>
        <P>President Trichet was very complimentary of the progress being made by Ireland and he noted the narrowing of bond spreads that had taken place, which he would not wish to see put at risk. I noted the points he made and I said I would report back to Government on the discussion.</P>
        <P>I also discussed with President Trichet, and in the separate meeting with Commissioner Rehn, the situation in relation to the Promissory Notes. These Promissory Notes are amounts due from the State to IBRC as consideration for the capital provided in 2010. While the State has budgeted to meet both the interest and cash requirements I am eager to have the Promissory Notes examined to see if they can be re-engineered in a better way for the State, for example, by lengthening their maturity and reducing their interest rate. This re-engineering would have to be completed in a manner which does not impact on the capital position of IBRC. This may or may not be feasible. I proposed that our experts get together to examine <Col N="338"/>the technical aspects and the implications of any potential changes. These technical discussions are underway. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 35 and 36 together.</P>
        <P>As I stated after my meeting with ECB President Trichet and Commissioner Rehn last month, our European partners expressed strong reservations about burden sharing with senior bond holders in   Anglo Irish Bank, now known as IBRC. Mr. Trichet voiced his opinion that he is against such actions for two reasons: </P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Firstly private sector involvement carries very significant contagion risk and may be inconsistent with encouraging private investors to return to markets.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Secondly, he said Ireland had done particularly well over the summer. He mentioned the narrowing of bond spreads and he said that he felt that anything to do with senior debt burden sharing might knock the confidence of the market in the absolute commitment of the government to take once again its place in normally functioning markets; bond yields spreads wider again and we lose the ground we had gained.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Mr. Trichet&rsquo;s views were echoed by Commissioner Rehn. The positive international commentary on Ireland has been created by the Government&rsquo;s successful renegotiation of the Memorandum of Understanding, the introduction of the Jobs Initiative, the sizeable reduction of the interest rate on the EU IMF Programme and the reduction in the cost of the banks to the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>The value of support, present and future, we receive from our European partners far outweighs any short term gain from imposing burden sharing on these bonds in the face of European opposition to such a move.</P>
        <P>However, we still have unfinished business with our partners to find the most cost effective way of resolving IBRC over the long term.  Technical discussions between officials are underway at present in relation to the IBRC promissory notes.</P>
        <P>For these reasons I have decided not to take unilateral action in relation to burden sharing. IBRC is therefore repaying, today, senior debt of USD1 billion (circa &euro;0.7 billion). This was a publically traded senior liability that the Bank was contractually obliged to repay on its maturity date.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the process of issuing new bonds is normally through underwriting, where one or more securities firms or banks form a syndicate buying the entire bond issue from the issuer and then re-selling to investors.  Primary issuance is arranged by these syndicates who contact potential investors and advise the bond issuer in terms of timing, tenor and pricing of <Col N="339"/>the bond issue. The bond issuer will likely have little knowledge of the original owners of the bonds; also these initial investors may over time sell the bonds to other investors.</P>
        <P>Bonds are usually issued in bearer form which means that the purchasers of the bonds are unknown, with the bonds usually held by a securities depository company (e.g. Euroclear and Clearstream). When paying interest and principal the bond issuer will transfer the required funds to the securities depository company who in turn will pay the funds through to the bondholders.</P>
        <P>The function of the securities depository company is to receive the appropriate interest or principal payment for the entire bond issue from the issuer and to distribute the required amounts to the individual bondholders. This is a standard process for all such issuances. Therefore throughout this entire process the bond issuer is unaware of the individual bondholders&rsquo; details.</P>
        <P>IBRC has announced the sale of their $9.2 billion loan book has begun and approximately $3.5bn of gross loans has transferred to buyers. The net proceeds from the sale will allow the Bank to repay these unguaranteed bonds and will also allow the Bank to reduce their borrowings, including Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) from the Irish Central Bank.</P>
        <P>It is important to state that the redemption of the bond will be made by IBRC.  It will not be funded by the Exchequer.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that tax relief is available for fees paid by an individual for approved courses in approved colleges. The claim maybe in respect of a number of students. For 2011 and subsequent years the maximum annual relief for tuition fees is &euro;7,000 @ 20% per individual per course i.e. &euro;1,400 but limited to the amount of tax paid in the year by the claimant. The first &euro;2,000 of all fees claimed by an individual does not qualify for tax relief where any one of the students to whom the claim refers is a full time student or the first &euro;1,000 of all fees claimed where all of the students are part-time students.     Further details, including the application form, are available in Leaflet IT31 available on the Revenue website &mdash; <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and the Health Levy.  It is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  The USC is designed to apply across income levels with a smoother progression and to address the irregularities caused by &lsquo;step effects&rsquo; in the previous system of levies.  It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base and remove poverty traps.  The USC is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced.     The USC is collected like all other taxes, and is used to provide the resources to pay for the services provided by the State. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that development land is defined as land, the consideration for the disposal of which is greater than its &ldquo;current use value&rdquo;.  The current use value of land is its value if it were unlawful, to develop it, apart from development of a minor nature, and it continues to remain unlawful to do so.   Principal private residence relief (PPR relief) extends to a disposal of a residence and its surrounding grounds of up to one acre.  The charge to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is entirely relieved if the proceeds of disposal do not relate to development land.  If a disposal of a principle private residence is also a disposal of development land, then PPR relief will apply only to that part of the gain calculated as if the current use value were the disposal proceeds.  The gain on this part of the proceeds (that is, the part equal to the current use value of the land) is entirely relieved from CGT.  The gain on the remainder of the proceeds (that is, the full proceeds less the current use value) represents the development land gains on the garden and will be chargeable to CGT at the rate of 25%.  A portion of the development land gain could be subject to the windfall tax rate of 80% if the land had been the subject of a &ldquo;relevant planning decision&rdquo;: that is, a decision by a local authority since 30 October 2009 to rezone the land or a decision by a local authority since 4 February 2010 to materially contravene its development plan.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The practice when reviewing the level of tobacco taxation has been to determine the amount of any increase by reference to cigarettes, and to apply pro rata increases to other products such as fine-cut tobacco for the rolling of cigarettes and other smoking tobacco. In the case of the last increase in the tax rates, which was with effect from 8 April 2009, an increase of 25 cent (inclusive of VAT) was applied to a pack of cigarettes. This represented an increase of 4.12 per cent in the tobacco tax, and that increase was applied also to all other tobacco products.   Tobacco products other than cigarettes are taxed by weight of tobacco, and the rate of tax on cigarettes is expressed as a fixed amount per 1,000 cigarettes, together with a percentage of the price at which the cigarettes are sold. When the tax rates for the various products are compared in terms of their weight of tobacco, the rate of taxation on cigarettes is higher than for the other products.</P>
        <P>I am aware of calls from certain interests for the tax on other products to be increased relative to the tax on cigarettes. Any question of a change in the relative taxation of the products would fall to be considered in the Budget process.</P>

	<P>It is assumed that the threshold for the proposed new tax bands mentioned by the Deputy would not alter the existing standard rate band structure applying to single and widowed persons, to lone parents and married couples. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2012 incomes, of the introduction of the proposed new rates and bands would be of the order of &euro;1,125 million.    However, given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how, in practice, such new rates could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.</P>
        <P>These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2009 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2012. They are therefore provisional and likely to be revised. </P>

Those subject to the full restriction, at adjusted incomes of &euro;400,000 or greater, pay an effective income tax rate of 30% in addition to PRSI and Universal Social Charge.   On the basis of historical incomes and claims data available for 2009, the latest year for which the necessarily detailed information is available, it is tentatively estimated that the full year yield to the Exchequer from applying the measures mentioned in the question would be of the order of &euro;120 million. The impact of the economic down turn on current personal incomes and potential claims for tax reliefs cannot be fully factored into the estimate of yield provided because the tax returns for 2010 and 2011 are not yet received. For this reason the figure of yield provided should be regarded as only indicative.</P>
        <P>To impose the effective income tax rates suggested by the Deputy solely on those taxpayers that claim specified reliefs, would effectively penalise taxpayers for availing of those reliefs and incentives. Obviously this would make tax incentives redundant in terms of their potential for contributing to the achievement of the socio-economic objectives for which they were designed.</P>
        <P>Taxpayers, who only claim personal tax credits, pay an effective rate of income tax of around 30% where their annual incomes are in the region of &euro;125,000. To implement the rates suggested by the Deputy such that they would apply to all taxpayers, would involve the imposition of higher marginal rates of income tax and/or the reduction of the general tax credits available.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is referring to the Domicile Levy, announced in Budget 2010 and introduced in Finance Bill 2010.  The Domicile Levy can be paid at any time up to 31 October in the year following the valuation date, which is 31 December of each year.  The first valuation date for the levy was 31 December 2010 and the tax return and payment of the levy for 2010 was not due until 31 October 2011.  Some taxpayers affected by the levy may be paying their income tax through the Revenue On-line Service (ROS) in which case they would have additional time to pay the tax.   As with other areas of taxation, the rules are constantly kept under review and any changes will be determined in the context of Budget and Finance Bill.  However, in order to facilitate individuals who are paying the balance of income tax due for 2010 using the Revenue On-Line Service (ROS)   and who wish to avail of the credit for income tax paid against Domicile Levy, Revenue have extended the Pay and File deadline for Domicile Levy for 2010 to 15 November 2011. This date coincides with the Pay and File deadline for payment of the balance of income tax due for 2010 using ROS. As of today, 5 returns have been received in relation to Domicile Levy for 2010. The tax paid in relation to these 5 returns was &euro;879,586. At this stage, it is not possible to estimate the full amount of revenue that may be raised from the Domicile Levy in 2011. It is not possible to estimate the number of non-residents that this measure will affect. Many non-resident individuals who file Irish tax returns are not Irish citizens or have a foreign domicile and therefore would not be subject to the Levy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Central Bank&rsquo;s supervisory powers and its administrative sanctions regime, together with the potential for criminal prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions in more serious cases, provide significant powers to regulate any breaches. Furthermore the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas, provides for the strengthening of the ability of the Central Bank to police, investigate and punish such practices in the future, including providing that the limit of penalties that can be imposed under the administrative sanctions regime will be increased to  &euro;10,000,000 per contravention. </P>
        <P>In cases of systematic overcharging uncovered by the Central Bank, the Bank works with the financial institution in question to ensure that all customers are refunded the amounts  overcharged and ensures that the institution remedies the problems that occurred within its internal business processes. The Central Bank has concluded two cases under its administrative sanctions regime. Details of these cases and the settlement terms can be found on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website <i>www.centralbank.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might wish to note that it is not permitted to impose financial penalties under the administrative sanctions regime and, at the same time, bring a criminal prosecution. The administrative sanctions regime is a strong deterrent due to the significantly higher financial penalties available under it.</P>
        <P>In view of the availability of the Central Bank&rsquo;s supervisory powers and its administrative sanctions regime, the enhancement of these powers through the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 and the potential for criminal prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions I am satisfied that the legislative framework governing these practices provides the authorities with sufficient powers to regulate any breaches.</P>

This compares to a projected annual yield from the levy of &euro;470 million.   I am also advised by the Commissioners that they are aware of a small number of pension schemes in respect of which the levy remains outstanding.

	<P>The interest rate margin reduction for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) was incorporated into a new legal agreement on 27th October. The interest rate margin is now defined as zero. It was agreed that countries borrowing from the EFSF would pay a guarantee commitment fee of 0.10% per annum on top of the cost of funds and the cost of operations of the EFSF. This will apply to all future borrowings from the EFSF. In relation to the existing borrowing from the EFSF, I expect that the margin, which was prepaid, will be refunded upon the maturity of the bond backing the loan to Ireland in July 2016. It cannot be repaid before that time as it an integral part of the terms and conditions of the bond. The details surrounding this have to be confirmed with the EFSF.    In relation to the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), the margin reduction was incorporated into an amendment to the existing legal agreement on October <Col N="346"/>28th and it is now defined as zero. This will apply to EFSM borrowings back to the date upon which they were issued.</P>

It sets out a wide-ranging programme of reforms in initial teacher education courses, in professional development for teachers and school principals, and in the content of the curriculum at primary and post-primary levels in order to achieve these vital skills. To implement the changes, close consultation is taking place between my Department, the <Col N="347"/>Teaching Council and the Colleges of Education.  The Teaching Council&rsquo;s Policy Paper on the Continuum of Teacher Education, published in 2011, also seeks significant changes in initial teacher education programmes.

        <P>Firstly, I wish to explain to the Deputy that there is no automatic system of transfer of resources from one school to another.

Circular 37/2011 provides information to schools regarding the arrangements which are being put in place for the 2011/12 school year for the allocation of Resource Teaching hours for children with assessed special educational needs.  In relation to the allocation of individual Resource Teaching hours, the position is that for the 2011/12 school year an allocation of 90% of valid identified resource teaching allocations has been made by the NCSE to schools, in the first instance, to provide schools with the majority of their allocation, while also preserving enough capacity to deal with late applications and ensure that the Department of Education and Skills can remain within Employment Control Framework obligations.</P>

	<P>Earlier this month, I announced and published the headquarter locations where VECs are being merged as a result of the Government decision to reduce the number of VECs from 33 to 16.  In arriving at my decision in relation to the location of headquarters of the merged VECs, including the location of the headquarters of the Louth and Meath Education and Training Board at Drogheda, I considered a range of factors. These included the need to ensure that the location of a VEC headquarters will, to the greatest extent possible, facilitate staff redeployment under a redeployment scheme within the context of the Croke Park Agreement and the need to operate at lowest cost having regard to the accommodation available in existing locations.</P>
        <P>The detail in relation to upgrading, refurbishment or acquisition of accommodation at Drogheda will be worked through by the Department in conjunction with the VECs involved and the new merged body when established. Staff employed in the VEC headquarters are public servants and under the terms of the Croke Park agreement, such staff employed in a permanent capacity cannot be made compulsorily redundant. However, surplus staff may be redeployed.  In common with all areas of the public service, VECs are subject to an Employment Control Framework (ECF).  This places an upper limit on the number of staff which a <Col N="350"/>public service organisation can have. Both VECs have each been set ECF targets to be achieved by the end of 2011. Redeployment arrangements to bring about the staffing reductions required to meet ECF limits will be agreed in accordance with the principles of the Croke Park agreement and will involve the unions representative of the grades concerned.</P>

	<P>Teacher allocations to secondary school are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In addition to this, schools can be allocated concessionary posts for a number of reasons e.g., curricular concessions, special needs, language support etc.  The Post Primary Allocations section of my Department have allocated 7.38 whole time equivalent teaching posts on a concessionary basis for the 2011/12 academic year to Pobail Scoil Cloich Cheann Fhaola. This is a substantial increase in staffing at a time when my Department has to exercise additional control and reporting measures to ensure that the number of teachers employed in schools is consistent with the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland.</P>

	<P>In 2005, following an independent identification process, 875 schools were selected for inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the Department&rsquo;s initiative to combat educational disadvantage. The school to which the Deputy refers was among a number of schools that was judged not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage to warrant inclusion in DEIS. An appeal by this school to the independent review body confirmed that the level of disadvantage did not warrant the school&rsquo;s inclusion in DEIS process.</P>
        <P>An ongoing evaluation of DEIS has been underway since the rollout of supports commenced in 2006. My Department commissioned the Educational Research Centre to undertake this evaluation, the aim of which is to monitor the implementation of the programme and assess its impact on students, families, schools and communities at primary and post primary levels. An evaluation report, the second in a series of reports, is currently being finalised.  In addition, the Inspectorate of my Department conducted evaluations of planning in a sample of 36 DEIS schools, 18 primary and 18 post-primary. A national composite report on the effectiveness of DEIS planning in primary and post primary schools has been completed and is expected to be available shortly.  The Department will fully consider these evaluation reports before any decisions can be made regarding the future of DEIS.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that a Comprehensive Expenditure Review is ongoing in all government Departments at the request of the Minister of Public Service Expenditure and Reform. In any case the current economic climate does not allow for the possibility of additionality to the DEIS programme.</P>

	<P>The standardisation of the staffing schedule for Gaelscoileanna so that it is the same as that which applies to primary schools generally was one of a number of measures introduced in Budget 2011 to control and reduce teacher numbers. While mainstream staffing for any school year is based on the previous September&rsquo;s enrolment, there is a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment. The retention of such posts in the current school year is subject to schools having achieved their projected enrolment on 30 September. If the enrolment is not achieved the post allocated on developing grounds is suppressed. The school referred to by the Deputy was allocated two additional mainstream posts on developing grounds. However, the projected increased enrolment was not achieved and the posts were suppressed accordingly.</P>
        <P>The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0019/2011. The school referred to by the Deputy has submitted an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeal Board. The Board of Management of the school will be notified of the outcome of this appeal shortly.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</P>

        <QRef>[31921/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating teaching staff and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to special schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Departments criteria in allocating such support.  My Department&rsquo;s Circular 0042/2011 was issued in June this year to notify school management authorities of the staffing arrangements which would apply in special schools in the 2011/12 school year. The Circular states that there are a small number of special schools which have significant excess teacher posts and that the NCSE may therefore contact such schools to review the individual circumstances in these schools. The Circular indicated that the NCSE may suppress a post in schools which have excess teaching posts in order to create a post in a school which does not have excess posts and which has growing pupil numbers.</P>
        <P>The special school referred to by the Deputy caters for pupils with severe/profound disability and ASD. The correct teacher allocation ratio for schools catering for children with severe and profound disability is 6:1. In 2010/11 the school had 7 approved class teaching posts, 3 surplus teaching posts and 28 SNAs. The enrolment is 38 pupils, including 9 children newly enrolled for September 2011. One of the surplus teachers retired at the end of the last school year and the school is not eligible for a replacement. A further surplus post has been withdrawn leaving the school with 1 surplus post above recommended staffing allocation levels.  It is the position of both my Department and the NCSE that given the exceptionally high levels of teaching and support staff which have been allocated to the school, that notwithstanding the outcome of any review, that the school has sufficient support within its overall allocation to enable it to provide for the teaching and care support requirements of all of the children enrolled to the school.</P>

	<P>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority &mdash; local authority or VEC. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details that would be contained in an individual&rsquo;s application form, including those relating to nationality, it would not be possible for me to say whether or not a student would qualify for a grant.  However, the nationality requirements for the student grant scheme are set out in section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and regulation 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2011.  In summary, it is the student, and not his/her parents, that must meet the nationality requirements in their own right to qualify for a student grant.  Students are advised to contact their local grant awarding authority for clarification on particular aspects of the student grant scheme, where this is needed, relative to their own particular circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school.  Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</P>
        <P>Article 42 of the Constitution provides for the right of parents to choose the form of education they provide or to have provided to their children.  Primary legislation gives effect to this right and includes the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.</P>
        <P>None of the foregoing legislation specifically distinguishes between parents who act in concert and those who disagree and are separated, divorced or unmarried.  Enrolment of children is, in the first instance, a matter for Boards of Management who must address the circumstances of each case while respecting any order made by the Court in relation to the custody and welfare of the child.</P>
        <P>In general, it is my Department&rsquo;s view that both parents should be encouraged to take an active interest in their children&rsquo;s education and it is to the benefit of the children and the school when they do.  It is appreciated that practical difficulties for schools can arise where parents are separated.  However, my Department&rsquo;s approach to the issue of the rights of separated parents to involvement in their children&rsquo;s education is that the rights of both parents should be respected and given meaningful, practical expression in matters such as school reports, attendance at parent/teacher meetings and other school functions and that generally both parents should receive the same information and level of co-operation from the school.  A qualification to that approach would arise where the best interest of the child required a different approach.</P>
        <P>Schools are best placed to exercise their own judgements as to what is appropriate in each individual case given their particular knowledge of the individual circumstances and having regard to any order made by the Court in relation to the custody and welfare of the child.  I launched a public discussion paper last June on the area of school admissions and enrolment.  The document, &ldquo;Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment&rdquo; is avail<Col N="354"/>able on the Department&rsquo;s website (<i>www.education.ie</i>) and contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent.</P>
        <P>I wish to make clear that the paper was not meant to be prescriptive, nor have any decisions been made as to what elements will be contained in any final regulations or legislation.  The purpose of the paper was to lead and provoke debate on enrolment policies and practices.</P>
        <P>I invited education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department by Friday last, 28th October and one of the submissions made was from Equality For Fathers. The feedback from this important consultation with the public will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment.</P>

Applications from schools for gas, mechanical and electrical works were prioritised under the Summer Works Scheme funding this year and I regret that the application made by the school in question was not selected. A letter to this effect has issued to the school.  While further funding has been made available for school projects under the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative, I regret that the application was also unsuccessful under the Initiative as it was necessary to prioritise some categories of works over others. </P>

	<P>All works to be allocated funding under my Department&rsquo;s Devolved Schemes must be offered to the market in accordance with EU and National procurement guidelines.  This includes the Additional Accommodation Scheme which allows school management authorities to carry out building or improvement works to their schools. School management authorities must comply with all the requirements of Technical Guidance Documents TGD 007 and TGD 008 (Design Team Procedures for Small Works and Engaging Professional Consultants for Small Works respectively) which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  These guidelines provide opportunities for all contractors to tender. Failure to comply with theses guidelines may expose the school management authorities to challenge and subsequent financial penalties from a consultant or contractor who feels he/she was not afforded an opportunity to tender. Any such challenge could also result in the project being substantially delayed.  </P>

	<P>Following detailed consultation between the Irish universities and the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI) in the context of the ongoing process of implementing the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), the universities have agreed that the initial post-primary teaching qualification, hitherto known as the Higher Diploma in Education and latterly as the Graduate or Postgraduate Diploma in Education, is to be formally included for the first time in the NFQ at Level 8 with immediate effect.  All qualification titles used prior to 2011 (i.e. legacy titles) are also included in the NFQ at Level 8.  The qualification will now be known as the Professional Diploma in Education, to avoid confusion with any Level 9 award type.  Universities are autonomous institutions within the meaning of the Universities Act 1997 and my Department does not have any <Col N="357"/>function in relation to their academic affairs, including decisions concerning course provision, postgraduate fees or internal consultation processes with students. </P>

	<P>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 being upheld.  The selection and enrolment of pupils in schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected. The Deputy will be aware that I recently launched a discussion paper on school enrolment. The document,&ldquo;Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment&rdquo; contained suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent and I invited education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department by the 28th of October last. My officials are co-ordinating the submissions to the discussion paper in question. The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB may be able to offer assistance and advice <Col N="358"/>on securing a school placement within the pupil&rsquo;s area. The contact details for the NEWB is National Educational Welfare Board, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7, phone number 01-8738600.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts. The organisation of school visits is a local matter between school management authorities and SENOs. I have arranged for the information provided by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply in this regard. The NCSE has now advised all mainstream schools of their SNA allocation for the current school year, taking into account the care needs of qualifying pupils attending the school and has published statistical information in relation to the allocation of SNA posts and resource teaching hours to Primary, Special and Post Primary Schools. The information is provided on a county by county and school by school basis on its website at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. The NCSE has a retained capacity to respond to emergency cases, or where additional care needs arise for schools as a result of new school enrolments, injuries or diagnoses, during the school year, in the context of existing SNA provision in the school.  The NCSE will advise schools in the near future of a process to review allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that they comply with my Department&rsquo;s policy. The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism.</P>

<P>In determining Mullingar as a headquarter location, I was aware that both Co. Westmeath and Co. Longford VECs are very closely matched. However, I am satisfied that geographically Mullingar is the most favourable location for the headquarters.  I expect that headquarters staff of Co.

However, I expect that the office in Longford will remain open for some time and that the approach to redeployment will be measured and considered. The detail in relation to the implementation of the merger, including the move of staff to the newly designated headquarters in Mullingar, will be worked through by my Department in conjunction with the VECs involved and the new merged Education and Training Board when established. My officials are currently involved in discussions with SIPTU and IMPACT, the trade unions representing staff in the VEC sector, regarding the proposed VEC mergers.  An agreement has recently been concluded with SIPTU, on a redeployment scheme for CEOs in the context of the Croke Park agreement.  </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
<P>In arriving at my decision in relation to the location of headquarters of the merged VECs, I considered a range of factors including the need to ensure that the location of a VEC headquarters will, to the greatest extent possible, facilitate staff redeployment under a redeployment scheme within the context of the Croke Park Agreement and the need to operate at lowest cost having regard to the accommodation available in existing locations. In relation to the specific merger of Co. Kildare VEC and Co. Wicklow VEC as you know I have decided that the headquarters of the Education and Training Board will be in Naas.  In determining Naas as a headquarter location I was satisfied that geographically Naas is the more favourable location for the headquarters. The current office in Wicklow will be maintained as a sub office as the distance between it and Naas does not allow for redeployment of staff as provided for under the Croke Park agreement. It will be a matter for the CEO of the new Education and Training Board to work through how particular administrative functions are arranged across both locations having regard to the skills and experience of the staff concerned.</P>
<P>It will be a matter for the CEO of the new Education and Training Board to work through and judge what the best approach is to ensure the optimum approach to service delivery. The establishment of SOLAS is also likely to have a bearing on the precise arrangements to be made.  I want to make clear that my Department will not be forcing any one size fits all approach to staff deployment and office accommodation by the new Education and Training Boards. We will be receptive to any reasonable and sensible arrangements that are the best fit for the needs of the areas served by the new board. The Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes suggested that overall savings of &euro;3million could be realised. The reconfiguration to 16 can, over time, yield such savings in the recurrent cost of the headquarter functions of VECs which, at present, is of the order of &euro;40 million in total. Staff employed in the VEC headquarters are public servants and under the terms of the Croke Park agreement, such staff employed in a permanent capacity cannot be made compulsorily redundant. However, surplus staff may be redeployed. In common with all areas of the public service, VECs are subject to an Employment Control Framework (ECF). This places an upper limit on the number of staff which a public service organisation can have. Both VECs have each been set ECF targets to be achieved by the end of 2011. Redeployment arrangements to bring about the staffing reductions required to meet ECF limits will be agreed in accordance with the principles of the Croke Park agreement and will involve the unions representative of the grades concerned.</P>
<P>My officials are currently involved in discussions with SIPTU and IMPACT, the trade unions representing staff in the VEC sector, regarding the proposed VEC mergers.  An agreement has recently been concluded with SIPTU, on a redeployment scheme for CEOs in the context of the Croke Park agreement.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is compiling the list of community schools and the religious trustees as sought by the Deputy.  This will be sent to the Deputy shortly. The Deed of Trust to which the Deputy refers essentially grounded the roles and responsibilities of the trustees of the schools on a property lease relating to the plot of ground involved.</P>
        <P>Subsequently the Education Act 1998 defined a school patron as the persons who at the commencement of the legislation stood appointed as trustees.  Accordingly the trustees of community schools became the joint patrons of the school concerned.  In general under the Act the powers conferred on a patron and the functions to be exercised by a patron are not property dependent but derive from the legislation itself.</P>
        <P>As their membership declined religious orders involved as patrons or trustees of voluntary secondary schools have over recent years been making arrangements for the patronage and governance of their schools through the creation of trust boards.  The withdrawal of the religious orders from school patronage is also an issue in relation to community schools and must inform policy development in relation to the patronage and governance of those schools.</P>
        <P>Over the past decade policy in relation to property ownership of schools has also evolved with the state increasingly purchasing sites for schools instead of relying on school trustees or patrons to provide land or partial funding for schools, and with the use of the PPP model of procurement.</P>
        <P>A review of the deed of trust of community schools is currently underway which, inter alia, is looking at the whole concept of the relevance of a property-based model in the case of community schools.</P>
        <P>Some religious orders have sought to provide for their exit from individual Deeds of Trust and a transfer or their role and functions.  My Department has asked the religious orders and church authorities, if they are seeking the preservation of catholic joint patronage, to consider the creation of a single catholic patron to discharge the functions of patron instead of individual orders or trust boards.  While information regarding historic financial contributions towards construction costs made by the religious orders when the community schools were first established is not readily available, the Deputy will appreciate from the information that I have provided above that there are wider and more significant issues to be teased out in determining either the appropriate patronage and governance arrangements for the schools concerned under the Education Act or property ownership arrangements into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that, in general, education and training providers should bear in mind the potential for using, where feasible, social media to assist job seekers and those seeking further training and education opportunities.</P>
        <P>For example, F&Aacute;S has recently launched a &ldquo;Jobseekers App&rdquo; that provides access to the F&Aacute;S Jobs Ireland website where jobseekers can find information on job vacancies, on JobBridge internship and Work Placement Programme (WPP) opportunities as well as on Community Employment vacancies.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has a number of Facebook pages and Twitter accounts relating to F&Aacute;S, JobBridge, the Work Placement Programme and Screen Training Ireland.  These pages are used to provide information and updates on new programmes and courses, upcoming events and press releases etc.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S already provides a range of On-Line courses that cater for individuals who are IT-literate and who wish to work at their own pace and in their own time and without a requirement for any additional supports.  I understand that Learners can register for on-line courses through <i>www.ecollege.ie</i></P>
        <P>In addition, F&Aacute;S in partnership with the Library Council of Ireland has devised a programme, E-Learning at the Library, to make learning available to clients in circa 100 local libraries.  The aim of the programme is to up-skill local persons in Digital Competence and IT Skills.</P>
        <P>In the Further Education sector, while opportunities for distance learning are limited, the National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA) has developed a number of distance learning opportunities including a TV series: Read Write Now (2000 to 2004), The Really Useful Guide to Words and Numbers (2006 and 2007) and Written off?  (2008 and 2009).</P>
        <P>Skillnets, a state funded, enterprise-led support body that promotes training and upskilling has also been using social media in recent months in communicating with/advertising its services/programmes to job-seekers.  In addition, Skillnets is commencing an advertising campaign with LinkedIn which is targeted at HR staff. Skillnet network managers have recently produced an Online Promotion Guide which is a network manager&rsquo;s guide to social media promotion through LinkedIn and Facebook</P>
        <P>In relation to the development of the framework for SOLAS, this project involves working towards the full integration of the separate Further Education and Training sectors.  The education and training programmes to be provided through SOLAS will be modernised over the whole sector to become more relevant, accessible, and more effective.  Since August 2011, I have been leading detailed planning work for the key elements of the new organisation, including its Mission, Legislative basis, Structure, Staffing and Funding.  A draft Action Plan is nearing finalisation and my Department will shortly commence consultations with various interested stakeholders on it.</P>
        <P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative, 6,000 part time higher education places are being funded through Springboard, a specific initiative targeted at unemployed people who have lost jobs in sectors where employment levels will not return and who will need new qualifications and skills to re-enter employment as the economy recovers.  Many of the Springboard courses are delivered online including a number of programmes with the Open Univer<Col N="367"/>sity and Oscail.  Full details regarding all Springboard courses including course delivery methods can be found on the Bluebrick.ie web portal.</P>

	<P el="0">The report referred to by the Deputy contained six recommendations, numbers 11 to 16, in relation to the Office of Public Works. Substantial progress has already been made in relation to all of the recommendations as follows:</P>
        <P><i>Recommendation No. 11: The OPW&rsquo;s funding for flood risk management should be substantially and strategically increased to reflect levels of flood risk now known to exist in several major river catchments.  The OPW should commence and if possible accelerate the implementation of the Lee CFRAMS, commence the Shannon CFRAMS and those of other major river systems;</i></P>
        <P>A total of &euro;234.5m has been spent by the OPW in the years 2006-2010 on flood risk management activities, with another &euro;54m approximately expected to be spent this year.  During this period OPW has been able to undertake construction works on 13 major flood relief schemes.  Another 17 schemes have been progressed through various stages of design and planning, on which it is hoped to undertake construction works in the period up to 2014, subject to the availability of finances.  These schemes will mitigate substantially the known risk of flooding at the locations in question.</P>
        <P>OPW has commenced a Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study Programme which will provide the foundation for future flood risk management in line with national flood policy and the requirements of the EU Flood Directive.  Consultants have already been commissioned to undertake studies for four of the River Basin Districts, including the Shannon system, and the studies for the remaining two RBDs will be commissioned before the end of the year.  The pilot CFRAM study for the Lee catchment has been substantially completed.  The CFRAM studies will produce a plan of prioritised structural and non-structural measures to address flood risk in each catchment.  The plans will be completed by the 2015 deadline set out in the Floods Directive.  These Plans will inform the assessment of the funding needed to address effectively flood risk in a proactive and comprehensive way over coming years.</P>
        <P><i>Recommendation No. 12: The OPW should approve and fund all urgent minor flood relief measures identified by local authorities pending the completion of detailed flood risk assessment and management strategies except where there may be legal or other unavoidable reasons for not doing so;</i></P>
        <P>Total funding of &euro;22.5m has so far been approved by the OPW to local authorities under the Minor Flood and Coastal Protection Works Scheme, which commenced in 2009, to enable them to undertake localised flood relief work and studies.</P><Col N="369"/>
        <P>OPW is continuing to receive applications for funding from local authorities under this scheme and these are being assessed under the relevant economic and environmental criteria having regard to the overall funding available.</P>
        <P><i>Recommendation No. 13: The OPW should determine and prepare a national strategy for river drainage and maintenance measures to manage flood risk, and allocate sufficient resources to, and begin, its implementation in conjunction with the local authorities;</i></P>
        <P>As mentioned above, OPW&rsquo;s CFRAM Programme will produce a prioritised plan of measures to address flood risk in each catchment in the country.  Each study will examine a range of possible measures, including drainage of channels where appropriate.  The recommendations of the studies will provide the basis for developing a comprehensive flood risk management strategy and identifying the resources required to implement it, in partnership with local authorities and other relevant stakeholders.</P>
        <P><i>Recommendation No. 14: The OPW should actively engage with and support local authorities in the preparation of detailed flood risk assessment under the major emergency planning framework;</i></P>
        <P>OPW&rsquo;s CFRAM Programme, which will provide the blueprint for dealing with fluvial and coastal flooding countrywide, is being implemented in close co-operation with local authorities.  OPW already participates and will continue to participate actively in national emergency planning with other relevant state bodies.</P>
        <P><i>Recommendation No. 15: Appropriate flood early warning systems should be put in place by the OPW on all major river systems or parts thereof where a substantial ongoing flood risk in known to exist.  Providing some degree of early warning system in such places should not need to await the detailed studies planned under the CFRAMS process;</i></P>
        <P>OPW commissioned consultants to carry out a detailed review of options for Flood Forecasting and Flood Warning in Ireland.  The consultants&rsquo; report has been received and OPW will shortly be consulting with the stakeholders in relation to its recommendations.</P>
        <P><i>Recommendation No. 16: The OPW should update its flood mapping work to reflect localised risks and flooding events that took place in November 2009, and ensure such information is disseminated to and understood by relevant agencies;</i></P>
        <P>All confirmed data supplied/sourced by OPW has been made available via the flooding mapping website <i>www.floodmaps.ie</i>.  This website is available to all local authorities. OPW is continuing to liaise with stakeholders, including local authorities in respect of any data that they make available to us.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works is currently involved in a number of initiatives to alleviate flooding in County Wicklow.</P>
        <P>Bray Town Council, with financial support from the Office of Public Works has designed a flood relief scheme for Bray town.  The Council has also brought it through the planning stage and has completed a procurement process for a civil works contractor.  A decision on the progress of this scheme will depend on the outcome of the current review of Capital Expenditure being conducted by the Government.</P>
        <P>OPW, in partnership with Arklow Town Council is also undertaking a feasibility Study to identify possible mitigation measures for the town.  It is not possible at this point to give a timescale for the implementation of any viable mitigation measures that the study may identify.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above initiatives, the Office of Public Works has provided total funding of &euro;935,000 to Wicklow County Council through the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme for eight projects to alleviate flooding in the county.  Details of the projects funded under the Scheme are set out in the table below.</P>
        <P>The Scheme was introduced in 2009 to provide funds to Local Authorities to undertake minor mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal erosion problems within their administrative areas.  Funding applications are assessed by the OPW, in consultation, as necessary, with the relevant personnel in Wicklow County Council.  This assessment has regard to specific economic, social and environmental criteria and the overall availability of resources.  The commencement and progression of projects funded under the Scheme are a matter for Wicklow County Council.</P>
        <P>As part of the ongoing National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment Programme, the OPW appointed consultants earlier this year to undertake studies of the Eastern and South Eastern River Basin Districts, which cover Co. Wicklow.  These studies will identify and examine in detail the causes of flooding throughout the catchments and produce an integrated plan of specific measures to address the significant flood risk factors in a proactive and comprehensive way.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Office of Public Works (OPW), having secured National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) consents, undertook works to the stretch concerned, which were completed in early 2010, in order to provide immediate flood relief to the area.  In the event of further essential viable works being necessary, the OPW would consider carrying these out subject to the requirements of the NPWS.</P>
        <P>The consideration of flooding matters within the Shannon catchment is being addressed through the Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study, which commenced earlier this year.  This study will identify and examine in detail the causes of flooding throughout the Shannon catchment, and produce an integrated plan of specific measures to address the significant flood risk factors in a pro-active and comprehensive way.  The flood risk management plan for the Shannon catchment will take account of economic, social and environmental factors and will include a range of structural and non-structural measures such as the construction of flood defences, dredging, increased conveyance capacity, the management of water levels and early warning systems.  Responsibility for the various measures in the plan will be clearly outlined.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together. </P>
        <P>The Valuation Act 2001 provides for the valuation of all commercial and industrial property and the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations for rating is his sole prerogative.  Under the 2001 Act, the basis of valuation for all commercial property is net annual value, i.e. the rental value of the property.  To ensure equity and uniformity, the valuations, on revision, for modified or new properties are determined by references to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list.</P>
        <P>Under section 28(4) of the Act, a Revision Officer of the Commissioner may carry out a revision of valuation in relation to a particular property only if a material change of circumstances has occurred such as a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.</P>
        <P>The Act does not allow for a revision of valuation where the change in value may be due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as roads or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property.</P>
        <P>Revaluation is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists and in individual ratepayers&rsquo; rates liabilities.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency to the local authority rating system. Ideally, occupiers of properties of similar value in the same rating area should have a similar rates liability and following revaluation, there will be a much closer relationship between rental value and commercial rates liability and this relationship will thereafter be maintained by means of recurring revaluations provided for in the Act.</P>
        <P>My Department is reviewing various provisions of the Valuation Act 2001, including the appeal procedures, with a view to modernising and streamlining the valuation process in the interests of both the ratepayers and the local authorities.  In conjunction with the Valuation Office and the Attorney General, preliminary Heads of Bill have been drafted which I hope to bring to Government shortly, for approval.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the levying of commercial rates is a matter for local authorities and the amount of rates to be collected is a matter for each local authority to decide.  Commercial rates provide the means by which local authorities can fund the services essential to communities, and therefore business, including roads, water and waste services, fire and emergency, libraries and a range of community, amenity and social activities.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware of the pressures on small and medium-sized businesses and the challenging economic environment in which many property and business owners are operating at the moment.  In this context, the Government is focused on reducing the costs of doing business to support competitiveness and employment in the economy and to protect the interests of communities.  Local authorities have responded positively to requests to exercise restraint in setting commercial rates.  Annual rates on valuation have been reduced by an average of 0.6% in 2010 and by a similar level in 2011.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration.</P>

This underscores the need for radical streamlining of bodies, abolishing those bodies whose remit is no longer essential and amalgamation of other agencies or sharing of services between bodies, so that public services and functions can be delivered more cost-effectively.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The deployment and management of staff are primarily a matter for the head of a Department or other body in the first instance, having regard to its employment control framework (ECF), policy and operational priorities and the budgets available.   Changes in the services provided and their delivery, in the allocation of work and in the use of information technology are taking place on an ongoing basis within the public service, against a background of falling numbers. Significant redeployment of staff and reassignment of work has taken place in that context.  </P>
        <P>The Public Service Agreement 2010-14 (Croke Park Agreement) provides for agreed redeployment arrangements to apply in the Civil Service and in other parts of the public service, and for these arrangements to take precedence over other methods of filling vacancies. I should point out that the agreement applies to the Public Service.  The term publicly funded bodies could include private and voluntary sector bodies which are grant aided but whose employees are not public servants.  In general redeployment opportunities are to be sought in the first instance within each sector (e.g. health, education, local authority, etc.). Redeployment allows staff to be moved from activities which are of lesser priority, or which have been rationalised, reconfigured, or restructured, to areas of greater need. In practical terms these arrangements represent a means of facilitating the targeted reduction in public service numbers in the period to 2014 while sustaining the ongoing delivery of services. The progress made in implementing the provisions of the Croke Park Agreement, including examples of progress on redeploying public servants within and across sectors of the public service, is set out in the website of the Implementation Body at http://implementationbody.gov.ie/progress-and-delivery/  .</P>
        <P>The reorganisation of Ministerial responsibilities earlier this year involved several transfers of functions between Departments which resulted in exchanges of staff and resources, often at multiple locations. This process also included transfers and reassignment of staff to achieve the best organisational fit and, in some cases, redeployment to meet priority needs in other organisations in particular locations. There has also been a substantial redeployment of staff in the context of structural re-organisations or levies, both of which are specifically recognised in the Croke Park Agreement.   For example, in recent years over 500 staff transferred, mainly under levies and trawls, to the Department of Social Protection and to the CSO for Census 2011. A further 2,000 or so HSE and F&Aacute;S staff are transferring to the Department of Social Protection with their functions.  The Public Appointments Service (PAS) has put in place a system of Resource Panels of Civil Service and State Agency staff to support the redeployment processes in those sectors agreed under the Croke Park Agreement. It is a matter for the employer to identify the number and grades of posts to be redeployed in the first instance and to upload the posts onto the PAS panels. Posts to be filled by redeployment are offered in the first instance to the relevant panel or panels.   My Department is working on an ongoing basis with PAS and other stakeholders to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the redeploy<Col N="377"/>ment processes and of the panel system in particular.   Redeployments continue to take place across a range of grades, including promotion grades, across the various parts of the public service.</P>
        <P>Where staff are not available for redeployment in a particular location, the post, if approved for filling by my Department, may be offered to staff who had already indicated an interest in transferring there, whether directly to the Department concerned or through the Central Applications Facility (CAF).   Since 2003, the CAF has also facilitated the wishes of substantial numbers of public servants to transfer to alternative locations under the Decentralisation Programme. However, the possibilities to facilitate requests for such transfers are now more limited due to ongoing reductions in public service numbers and the necessity for redeployment to take precedence.</P>
        <P>The Senior Public Service (SPS) provides mobility opportunities for Assistant Secretaries to move to posts at equivalent level within the civil service.   As the SPS is extended to the wider public service, mobility will be extended on an incremental basis.</P>

        <P>Following the flood event of November 2009, the OPW, on a daily basis, monitors with Waterways Ireland, rainfall levels and the operation of control structures on the Shannon River.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 to 121, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works has provided funding of almost &euro;3.9m to Local Authorities through the Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme for over 60 projects in the areas mentioned. The Scheme was introduced in 2009 to provide funds to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding problems within their administrative areas. Funding up to a maximum of 90% of the total cost of a project is available under <Col N="379"/>the Scheme. Funding applications are assessed having regard to specific economic, social and environmental criteria and the overall availability of resources.</P>
        <P>Details of the projects funded under the Scheme for the areas concerned are set out in the table below.   The commencement and progression of projects funded under the Scheme are matters for the relevant Local Authority, and funding may be drawn down as the projects progress. The OPW is continuing to assess applications from local authorities and it is open to local authorities to submit further applications for funding under the Scheme. With regard to the River Suck, the Deputy will be aware from my reply of 11th   October, 2011 to PQ 28502/11 that responsibility for the maintenance of the River Suck rests with the River Suck Joint Drainage District, which is funded by Galway and Roscommon County Councils.  In addition to the Committee&rsquo;s ongoing annual maintenance activities, the Office of Public Works has provided significant funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme to Galway and Roscommon County Councils for a number of flood mitigation projects on the River Suck, and the surrounding areas.  The Deputy will be also aware that the consideration of flooding issues in the River Shannon and Suck Catchments are currently being addressed via the Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study and my reply to PQ 26920/11 of 4th   October, 2011 outlines the progress to date in this matter.</P>

	<P>A flood relief scheme, which will help alleviate the serious flood risk from the Wad River for the Donnycarney area of Dublin, has been developed by Dublin City Council. The Council is currently finalising agreements with local stakeholders in advance of the works, after which it will seek the approval to commence the scheme. The Office of Public Works (OPW) has already agreed in principle to provide funding for the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance recently addressed the issue of flood insurance in response to a Parliamentary Question. In his reply the Minister indicated that there were no plans to introduce a Government-backed insurance scheme for such householders. As you are aware, the possible introduction of an insurance scheme to protect householders who cannot obtain flood insurance from regular insurance companies was examined in 2010. However the then Government concluded that such an approach was not financially viable. I recently gave an assurance to the house to look again at this decision and to see what, if any, further help may be provided.</P>
        <P>I am continuing to review difficulties, that some householders are having in accessing flood insurance cover, with the Irish Insurance Federation. The focus of these discussions is intended to improve the scope and quality of the information available to the insurance industry to reduce market inertia in some locations where capital works  investment has addressed flood risk and to improve the measurement of the difficulties experienced with regard to flood insurance cover.</P>

	<P>Job creation is central to our economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.  The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place to support enterprise and innovation so that employment opportunities can be grown and maintained.  Strong, balanced regional development and thriving entrepreneurship throughout Ireland are fundamental to the country&rsquo;s economic growth and to job creation.  </P>
        <P>Improvements to our economic infrastructure over the last decade have facilitated the attraction of investors to the regions.  At present, 45% of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s client company employment is outside the key urban centres of Dublin and Cork.  The agency&rsquo;s strategy, &ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo; sets out targets for direct and indirect job creation through foreign direct investment up to 2014.  The IDA&rsquo;s objective is to generate a total of 105,000 additional direct and indirect jobs overall in the economy by 2014.  In implementing this ambitious strategy, the agency has set a specific goal of securing 50% of all its investments in locations outside of Dublin and Cork.  Ultimately, however, the final decision on location is taken by the investor.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland and the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) also provide supports for job creation outside large urban centres. Over 60% of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s clients are located outside the major urban centres. The agency seeks to develop and grow client companies in all locations, with a view to increasing sales and exports and generating employment.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland also facilitates the development of the enterprise environment in local and rural communities through campus incubation facilities and Community Enterprise Centres.</P>
        <P>The CEBs promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship in both urban and rural areas across the country.  The CEBs deliver a series of programmes to underpin this role and provide both financial (grants) and non-financial (advice, training and mentoring &ldquo;soft supports&rdquo;) assistance to project promoters who have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.</P>
        <P>In order to build on the activities of the agencies which are already in place, I have begun the process of preparing a comprehensive Jobs Strategy which will provide an action plan to support the creation of employment across the economy.  As part of the Jobs Strategy, I will be exploring the potential for new measures which can encourage job creation at local level.  My objective is to publish the Jobs Strategy in January.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The enterprise development agencies under the remit of my Department are continuously working to create and sustain employment across the country.  One of the targets set out in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy document &ldquo;<i>Horizon 2020&rdquo;</i>  is the creation of 62,000 direct and 43,000 indirect new jobs in Ireland over the period 2010-2014, with 50% of these investments to be based in locations outside of Dublin and Cork. Central to IDA&rsquo;s strategy is to build on existing regional strengths to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s economic development, while optimising regional spread, in line with the National Spatial Strategy.  At present, there are 2,185 people employed in 18 IDA client com<Col N="383"/>panies in Wicklow, mainly in Bray, Arklow and Greystones. Company expansions on the Dublin/Wicklow border at Cherrywood, Loughlinstown, include Dell and Elavon Financial Services, both of whom have increased their employment levels.</P>
        <P>In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, job creation and retention in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and companies working with third level institutions.Enterprise Ireland has 180 clients in Co. Wicklow employing over 3,240 people.  Since 2010, the agency has made payments of approximately &euro;4.7m to clients in the county.  This funding has helped companies to create and retain employment, to explore new markets for products and services and to build innovative capacity.  Some 76 innovation vouchers to the value of &euro;380,000 have been awarded to companies in Co. Wicklow. The vouchers are designed to assist small Irish firms in accessing innovative solutions in the higher education sector and to give them financial support to get on the first rung of the innovation ladder.</P>
        <P>The role of Wicklow County Enterprise Board (CEB) is to provide support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. Priority is given to manufacturing and internationally traded services, and, subject to eligibility criteria, micro-enterprise businesses, provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability. Job creation and retention are inherent considerations in their activities. To date in 2011, Wicklow CEB has paid out &euro;258,942 in grants to 24 eligible micro-enterprise projects, leading to the creation of 71 jobs. In addition, 34 micro-enterprise clients have availed of Wicklow CEB mentoring services and 487 clients have participated in their training initiatives.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I have begun preparation of a comprehensive Jobs Strategy, at the request of the Taoiseach and Cabinet Committee on Jobs. I have started a rolling process of engagement on the issues and intend to create an action plan that Government can take to address our challenges &mdash; looking at both immediate policy initiatives to promote employment and the development of longer term opportunities.  I have written to a series of experts, in both the public and private sectors, looking for their input on a range of relevant issues.  I have received a number of proposals from various sources in recent months which I will be examining in greater detail as part of this process.</P>

	<P>I understand from IDA Ireland that Merck, Sharpe and Dohme   (MSD), Rathdrum, Co. Wicklow informed its workforce on 19th October last that it was introducing a programme of 40 redundancies at the facility. MSD currently employs 320 people at Rathdrum. Most of the redundancies will take place in 2012, with the redundancy programme to be completed by late 2012.</P>
        <P>The programme is part of MSD&rsquo;s plans to improve cost competitiveness across its manufacturing network. MSD Rathdrum has completed a &euro;55m capital investment programme this year and manufactures Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) for Januvia, a leading Merck drug, and other products.</P><Col N="384"/>
        <P>IDA is in discussion with MSD Rathdrum about a transformation agenda, including an up-skilling programme for the existing workforce, and I have asked that IDA keep me informed of developments in relation to this agenda and the company&rsquo;s redundancy programme.</P>
        <P>County Wicklow forms part of the East Region of Ireland and, as such, benefits from being part of the largest and most successful region in the State. In terms of FDI, the East Region has been a success story with a critical mass of population, skills pool, educational infrastructure, international access connections, existing business activity across all sectors and extensive property solutions for future activity.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for the East Region is to:</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />Market the Region to overseas clients in order to secure new investments;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />Support the growth and development of the Region&rsquo;s existing clients by working with them to transform their business in the region to create additional employment and sustainability;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />Influence the provision of supporting infrastructure to attract foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Globally the outlook for FDI continues to be challenging in 2011 but a continuing focus on improving competitiveness nationally will place Ireland and the East Region in a favourable position to continue to win further significant FDI investment.</P>

	<P>Supporting job creation and tackling unemployment are key objectives for the Government.  Delivering these objectives will require a concerted effort across all Government Departments.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection is responsible for labour market measures which are aimed at increasing the employability of jobs seekers and assisting them to find work.  As part of its particular remit, the Department of Education and Skills provides training, re-skilling and education opportunities for unemployed people to improve their opportunities of re-entering the workforce.</P>
        <P>These two Departments are delivering the additional training, education and upskilling places which were announced as part of the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative last May, through programmes such as Job Bridge (the National Internship scheme), Springboard and T&uacute;s.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government included a commitment to establish a new National Employment and Entitlements Service to streamline and improve the level of services available to those seeking work.  The Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton TD, recently published plans for the development and implementation of the new service which will provide a &lsquo;one stop shop&rsquo; for people who are seeking to establish their benefit entitlements, looking for a job, or seeking advice about their training options.</P><Col N="386"/>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Skills, Ruairi Quinn TD, has also announced the establishment of a new further education and training authority, SOLAS, which will ensure the provision of high-quality further education and training programmes to jobseekers and other learners.  These programmes will be integrated, flexible, and responsive to the needs of learners and the requirements of a changing economy.  SOLAS will link courses more closely with the needs of the individual and the labour market.  There will be an enhanced role for the VECs in upskilling jobseekers under the new arrangements.</P>
        <P>Enhancing the employability of those who are unemployed &mdash; and especially the long-term unemployed &mdash; must be accompanied by the creation of jobs in the economy.  In this context, I am currently working on the development of a Jobs Strategy which will set out a series of clear, actionable measures to support the creation of jobs.  I have sought the views my colleagues in Government on the Jobs Strategy as part of an engagement process that also includes enterprise and wider interests.</P>
        <P>The Jobs Strategy will be published in January.  In the meantime, I will continue to work with my Government colleagues and with my own Department&rsquo;s agencies to develop employment opportunities by improving the competitiveness of the economy, growing indigenous enterprises and attracting inward investment.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding transposing the EU Directive on Temporary Agency Workers 2008 into Irish law; the consultation he has had with interested parties on the matter; his views that the <Col N="387"/>legislation will result in job losses here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU Directive on Temporary Agency Workers (2008/14/EC) is due to be transposed into Irish law by 5 December 2011 and my Department is working to meet this deadline.  A central aim of the Directive is to ensure protection of temporary agency workers by applying the principle of equal treatment in their basic working and employment conditions. </P>
        <P>Government approval for the draft Scheme of a Bill to give effect to the EU Directive in Irish law has recently been obtained and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel is proceeding with urgency to draft the necessary Bill.  I expect that the Bill will be published in the next few weeks.  The preparation of the draft Scheme of Bill was informed by responses obtained from a range of key stakeholders, including employers and union organisations, the recruitment sector as well as other interested parties, to a public consultation conducted by my Department in October 2010.  My Department was engaged also in follow-up discussions with a number of stakeholders following responses to the consultation.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to the Directive, my Department is engaged in discussions with the national social partners, IBEC and ICTU, with the objective of facilitating agreement on the conclusion of a &ldquo;Framework Agreement&rdquo; under the terms of a derogation provided under Article 5.4 of the Directive.  This would allow, for instance, the application of a &ldquo;qualifying period&rdquo; before which the principle of equal treatment would apply to agency workers in Ireland and would place us in a similar situation to that of the UK which has already obtained agreement on a 12-week qualifying period.</P>
        <P>The Government is interested in obtaining agreement on this aspect as it would create a balance between the rights of agency workers on the one hand and, the need for labour market flexibility on the other.  I am aware that certain stakeholders have pointed to the potential for the Directive to negatively impact on employment however, it is the case that, arising from EU commitments, the Directive must be implemented in all Member States of the EU.</P>
        <P>It would be my intention, in bringing forward legislation to meet the State&rsquo;s commitments in this regard, to ensure that while affording the necessary entitlements to agency workers, the Government will also have close regard to the need to retain a necessary level of labour market flexibility to ensure that Ireland continues to provide a pro-business environment in which businesses can grow and develop with a consequent positive knock-on in our ability to retain and grow employment.</P>

        <Quest> if the contracts of the 15 former Airtricity employees, who would be affected by a contract within the terms of a tender recently submitted by a company (details supplied) to provide public lighting to Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo County Councils, are entitled under EU law to transfer current employment conditions to a new subcontractor under the TUPE transfer of undertakings legislation. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32441/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The current Irish law in the area of &ldquo;transfer of undertakings&rdquo; is the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 &mdash; Statutory Instrument (S.I.) No. 131 of 2003.  The Regulations implement the mandatory (i.e mandatory to transpose) provisions of EU Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 which is aimed at safeguarding the rights of employees in the event of a transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business <Col N="388"/>to another employer as a result of a legal transfer (including the assignment or forfeiture of a lease) or merger.  Also, section 21 of the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006 transposed a provision of European Directive 2001/23/EC relating to the information to be provided by the original employer to the new employer.</P>
        <P>In any particular case, it is open to individuals to seek legal advice to determine if the specifics of their particular situation might constitute a Transfer of Undertaking.  In the event of a claim being submitted to the State&rsquo;s employment dispute resolution service, it would be a matter for a Rights Commissioner to determine in law if any particular case does in fact constitute a transfer of undertakings situation.</P>
        <P>While my Department cannot provide legal advice in respect of any specific case, I would point out that the European Commission has issued a guidance document on European Court of Justice (ECJ) rulings in the area of transfer of undertakings and outsourcing or contracting-out.  That document indicates that the ECJ has found that in a situation where a services contract for a labour-intensive service such as office cleaning or security services (as distinct from an assets-based service such as public transport where other ECJ rulings apply) has been outsourced and where the contract subsequently moves to a new contractor, it may be considered a &ldquo;transfer of undertakings&rdquo; for the purposes of the Transfer of Undertakings Directive. This would be predicated on the new employer taking over a major part, in terms of their numbers and skills, of the employees specially assigned by the previous contractor to the provision of the services in question.</P>
        <P>However, as indicated above, the circumstances of each individual case would have to be considered by a Rights Commissioner, in the first instance, in the light of all previous case law, including ECJ case law.  Any such case should be taken within six months of the date on which an employee considers that there has been a contravention of the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations.</P>
        <P>An application to a Rights Commissioner can be made by the employee, or by a representative (including a trade union representative) by contacting the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission, Tom Johnston House, Haddington Road, Dublin 4, or phone 01 6136700.</P>

	<P>The focus of the back to education allowance (BTEA) is to assist those who are most marginalised and distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>The back to education scheme covers a large range of full-time courses of education in approved colleges spanning basic foundation courses to third level courses across all disciplines.  Courses may be pursued up to a higher diploma level in any discipline and to a professional diploma in education hitherto known as a post graduate diploma in education [level 8 in the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)]. BTEA will not usually be approved if a person holds a qualification equivalent to or higher than the qualification for which the application has been received.  Other postgraduate qualifications (level 9 or level 10) are not included.</P>
        <P>However, a small number of cases have arisen where a college has granted an exemption from the requirement to hold a primary degree and has admitted a person to a Master&rsquo;s course, which is level 9 in the NFQ, on the basis of relevant life experience.  In the context of the ongoing monitoring of the operation of the scheme, it has been decided to extend entitlement to the back to education allowance in these instances on an exceptional basis.</P>

        <P>As my Department is responsible for providing income supports for carers, it will of course have a role in developing and implementing a strategy.  However many of the issues of most concern to carers are the responsibility of other Departments, in particular the Department of Health.</P>
        <P>The strategy will have to be developed within existing available resources.  In developing and implementing the strategy, the Government will take account of our IMF and EU commit<Col N="391"/>ments, as well the outcomes of the comprehensive review of expenditure currently being undertaken by each Department.</P>

        <P>Those customers who did not receive an automated payment were required to complete and return an application form to the Department. In all cases a letter issued to applicants informing them of the decision and, where payment has been awarded, when and where they could collect the payment. In the case of refusal of the allowance the procedures for review of the decision was outlined to customers.  The persons concerned were refused BSCFA as their income was in excess of the limit allowed for their family composition. The persons concerned can request a review by contacting the BSCFA review section in Letterkenny. Details on how to request a review are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.welfare.ie</i> or on the refusal letter that has been provided to the applicants.</P>

A key requirement of the programme is that the service provider must generate a significant element of their turnover from traded activity or other non-public sources of income.  The reduction in the rate of employers&rsquo; PRSI resulting from the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative will have a positive effect on some service providers funded by the CSP by reducing their PRSI liability.  </P>

She was refused on two separate grounds, firstly, that one of the care recipients is not so disabled as to require full- time care and attention as prescribed in regulations. In addition, following appropriate investigation, it was decided that, while the person concerned is providing some care and attention, the statutory condition that full time care and attention be provided is not being fulfilled in this case. </P>

        <P>The Department&rsquo;s review of the administrative, policy and legal aspects of the mortgage interest supplement scheme was published in July 2010 in conjunction with the interim report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group. The final report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group was published in November 2010.  These reports set out a number of recommendations which centred on the delivery of customer service improvement by ensuring that State support for those unable to deal with mortgage arrears is better targeted, consistent and easily understood. Allied with the focus on customer service improvements are recommendations that seek to ensure that lending institutions, borrowers and the <Col N="395"/>Exchequer share responsibilities and commitments in a balanced way. The report&rsquo;s recommendation to remove the 30 hour rule was made within the context of the mortgage interest supplement scheme becoming a time bound payment.

        <P>Those customers who did not receive an automated payment were required to complete and return an application form to the Department. In all cases a letter issued to applicants informing them of the decision and, where payment has been awarded, when and where they could collect the payment.  In the case of refusal of the allowance the procedures for review of the decision was outlined to customers.  The person concerned was refused BSCFA as she does not have a qualifying payment. The person concerned can request a review by contacting the BSCFA review section in Letterkenny.  Details on how to request a review are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.welfare.ie</i> or on the refusal letter that has been provided to the applicant.</P>

	<P>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs. </P>
        <P>The BSCFA scheme was introduced in 1990.  This scheme superseded the arrangements which had been in place since 1977 whereby child clothing and footwear payments were made <Col N="399"/>under the exceptional needs provisions of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme.  The SWA clothing and footwear scheme had in turn replaced a previous Public Assistance Footwear scheme that had been introduced in 1944.</P>
        <P>These previous schemes had been targeted at both school and pre-school children from the age of two years up.  When the BSCFA scheme was introduced, the provision to pay the allowance to children from the age of two years up was retained.</P>
        <P>At the end of this year&rsquo;s BSCFA scheme a review will be undertaken of all aspects of the operation of the scheme, including eligibility criteria.  The following tabular statement shows the breakdown of children aged two and three years of age that benefited from the scheme between 2006 and 2010 and the associated cost.</P>

	<P>I am aware that the EU Commission has issued a Reasoned Opinion to the UK, regarding the application of the UK&rsquo;s residence test for certain social welfare payments under UK legislation.    A Reasoned Opinion is an early step in a legal process.  The next step is for UK to respond to the Commission&rsquo;s Opinion, and if there is still disagreement, the matter may be referred to the European Court of Justice.   It would be premature at this stage to assume that the outcome of this process will require a change to Irish legislation.</P>
        <P>There are two different pieces of EU legislation that have an effect in the area of habitual residence:  firstly, in the social security area we have Regulation 883/2004 on the co-ordination of social security systems, and secondly, the question of the right to reside is dealt with in the free movement Directive 2004/38.     The latter gives EU citizens the right to reside in the territory of another Member State for more than three months, provided they have sufficient resources not to become a burden on the social assistance system of the host Member State.   It has recently come to light that at European level there are different interpretations of the interaction of these two legal instruments.   At the formal Council of Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs last June, no fewer than thirteen delegations expressed their view that more discussion was needed in this area, and called on all Member States and the Commission to continue to look into this area as a matter of priority, with a view to considering amendments to the current legislative framework, should these be deemed necessary.</P><Col N="400"/>
        <P>I look forward to the continuing work at EU level to clarify this complex area and will examine any necessary changes to Irish legislation in that context.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case. </P>
        <P>There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.  In the context of dealing with the considerable number of appeals now on hand, the Department made 9 additional appointments to the office earlier this year.</P>
        <P>While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person&rsquo;s oral hearing will be heard, but s/he will be informed when arrangements have been made.</P>

	<P>The community services programmes (CSP) co-funds the services delivered by around 440 community based not-for-profit enterprises across the State.  Some &euro;47.4 million has been allocated to the programme in 2011 directly supporting around 2,800 people in full and part time employment.  A key requirement of the programme is that the service provider must generate a significant element of their turnover from traded activity or other non-public sources of income.  The reduction in the rate <Col N="403"/>of employers&rsquo; PRSI resulting from the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative will have a positive effect on some service providers funded by the CSP by reducing their PRSI liability.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, based on 2010 figures, the average processing time for Domiciliary Allowance dealt with by way of summary decision is 26.8 weeks, while a case which requires an oral hearing takes, on average, 49.1 weeks.    These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.</P>
        <P>No report is available which shows the longest individual waiting times for decided cases and to design such a report would require an enhancement to the suite of reports currently available from this system. I am also advised that such information may in any event, be of little value as the longest awaiting appeals are generally held up by extraordinary circumstances such as court proceedings.</P>
        <P>In an effort to reduce the processing times, the Department appointed 9 additional Appeals Officers in April of this year who augmented the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010 and brought the total number of appeals officers serving in the Office to 29.   In addition, since July 2010, 8 retired appeals officers, equating to a further 3 full-time officers, have been assisting on a strictly part-time basis with the backlogs of appeals and it is intended that they will be employed until the end of the year.</P>
        <P>I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that <Col N="407"/>the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.</P>
        <P>In that regard  some 3,000 cases, registered prior to 31/12/10, have been ring-fenced and a team of 10 of the Office&rsquo;s most experienced appeals officers have been freed from all other work in the Office and will concentrate on clearing this backlog.   This project commenced on July 1st.  Also, some 70% of appeals cases are now decided by way of summary decision which, because of the logistics involved in organising oral hearings, greatly reduces the overall processing times.</P>
        <P>As a result of the various initiatives taken, 18,236 decisions were made by appeals officers in the first nine months of 2011, in comparison to 12,692 for the same period in 2010 and the backlog of cases awaiting determination has reduced from 20,274 at the beginning of the year to 17,651 at 30th September 2011.</P>

	<P>The person concerned was in receipt of illness benefit from 21 March 2011 at the maximum personal rate. On 27 September 2011 she was assessed by a departmental medical assessor who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  Her illness benefit payment was stopped from 12 October 2011. The person concerned has been advised that she may appeal against this decision. However, to date, no appeal has been registered with the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. Since the date her illness benefit was stopped she has been in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit at the same maximum personal rate.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to review the operation of the rent supplement scheme with a view to <Col N="408"/>introducing a code of conduct for rent supplement eligibility similar to that which operates for local authority tenants.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this review is to ensure that tenants who are receiving long term support from the State under the rent supplement scheme are subject to the same type of anti-social behaviour regime as local authority tenants. The most appropriate way for this to happen is for local authorities to take over responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of these individuals. My Department is currently working with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to achieving this goal.</P>

	<P>The social security rights of people moving around the EU are governed by EU Regulations 883/2004 and 987/2009. These Regulations, which have been in existence in one form or another since 1959, are designed to co-ordinate the social security systems of the various Member States so that people and their families are not disadvantaged when they move within the EU.   </P>
        <P>A key principle of the co-ordination system is that persons moving to different Member States are subject to the same obligations and enjoy the same benefits as the nationals of those Member States.  With few exceptions, it is the country of employment which receives the social security contributions and which is generally responsible for the payment of benefits.</P>
        <P>Irish child benefit is classed as a family benefit and there are specific rules governing the payment of these benefits.  EU nationals who come to work in Ireland, and who pay Irish social security contributions, are entitled to receive child benefit in respect of their families, even if the family resides in another EU Member State.  The equality provisions of the Regulations require that these payments are made at the same rates applicable to a person whose family is resident in Ireland.  These provisions are seen as important in an EU context for the role they play in encouraging and facilitating the free movement of EU citizens.</P>
        <P>The cost of paying child benefit in respect of the 4,929 customers with 7,798 children in 2011 to date has been &euro;10.9m.  It is estimated that the full year cost will be &euro;13.1m.</P>

These provisions are seen as important in an EU context for the role they play in encouraging and facilitating the free movement of EU citizens.</P>
        <P>The provisions relating to the payment of child benefit for non-resident children are not part of Irish domestic legislation but are, as already indicated, a feature of EU regulations governing the coordination of social security systems. Accordingly, any change to the system will require a change in EU regulations. Only the EU Commission, and not individual Member States, can propose new legislation. At Council level, the Regulation would require a qualified majority of Member States and it would also require the agreement of the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>As part of its agreed programme, the Government is committed to raising the issue of payment of Child Benefit in respect of non-resident children at EU level, and to seek to have the entitlement modified to reflect the cost of living where a child is resident.</P>
        <P>I raised the possibility of a change to the EU regulations informally with EU Commissioner Andor on his visit to Dublin in June. The Commissioner indicated he would not favour putting forward such a proposal for the foreseeable future, as the Commission views the current arrangements as providing greater equality between citizens of different EU States. However, I am continuing to raise the issue with appropriate Ministers from other EU countries and am considering what further action may be possible.</P>

	<P>There are two main initiatives currently being pursued by the Department to transfer long term rent supplement recipients into housing solutions supported by local authorities. The two initiatives are the Rental Accommodation Scheme and the new Housing Policy Initiative launched in June of this year.</P>
        <P>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, the RAS. Since 2004, over 36,000 households have transferred from rent supplement to a local authority provided housing solution.</P>
        <P>On 16th June 2011, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning published a new housing policy framework statement. This framework statement reflects the content of the Programme for Government and sets out the principles to underpin the development of housing policy into the medium term.  Specifically, it contains the announcement for the transfer of responsibility in providing housing needs for long term rent supplement recipients to housing authorities on a phased basis. The focus of this approach is to achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.</P>
        <P>A multi-agency steering group has been established by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to give effect to this initiative and this group are currently developing proposals and operational protocols for the transfer of responsibility from the Department of Social Protection to housing authorities of persons who have long term housing requirements.</P>

	<P>State pension (transition) is currently paid to people aged 65 who have a minimum yearly average of 24 social insurance contributions and who have retired from work.  Currently it ceases at age 66 when the claimant transfers to State pension (contributory). As a result of legislation introduced this year, the State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin on 1 January 2014 with the abolition of State pension (transition) and the standardisation of State pension age at 66.  This means that anyone who reaches age 65 on or after 1 January 2014 will not receive State pension (transition).  Accordingly, anyone aged 62 in 2011 or later will be affected by the increase in pension age.  State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  It is worth noting that, until the early 1970s, the qualifying age for State pension (contributory) was 70 years of age.  By gradually increasing the qualifying age for State pension, people will be further encouraged to remain in employment beyond 65 years of age.</P>

	<P>Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for the protection of architectural heritage.  The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage, including thatched buildings, by including them on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  My Department does not maintain a record of the number of habitable thatched units.  However, it is the practice of my Department when undertaking county surveys for the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage to accord a regional rating to thatched structures where the roof is intact.  Structures rated regional or higher are subsequently recommended by me, as Minister, to a planning authority, under section 53 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures.  Information on thatched buildings recorded by the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.buildingsofireland.ie</i>.  In 2005, a report and action plan published by my Department on the present and future protection of thatched structures in Ireland identified over 1,500 surviving thatched structures in the country, although many more thatched roofs are known to survive under later coverings such as corrugated metal roofs.</P>
        <P>While the overall number of thatch roofs declined in the second half of the 20th century, increased legislative protection for the architectural heritage and heightened awareness of this part of our national heritage has meant that this decline has stabilised and the future of the surviving thatched buildings is more secure.  The nature of thatch is such that it requires regular maintenance and more frequent renewal in comparison with other types of roofing.  However, some of the costs involved in maintaining thatched properties can be attributed to the use of an incorrect material, issues with the style of thatching and material used, and severe weather conditions.  There are some funding streams which can assist owners of thatched houses in repairing or maintaining their thatched roofs, including my Department&rsquo;s Structures at Risk Fund, the Heritage Council Heritage Management Conservation grants scheme and a grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs administered by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  The issue of insurance for historic buildings, including thatched structures, has been raised by my Department with both the Financial Services Regulator and the Irish Insurance Federation.  As a result, officials within my Department have engaged with local authority architectural conservation officers and other stakeholders in collating specific information regarding historic buildings and insurance with the intention of further examining this issue with both of these bodies, if applicable.</P>

	<P>Funding for capital cultural projects in my Department is primarily from the Cultural Development subhead that has an allocation of &euro;7.8 million in 2011, which is a reduction of over 50% from the 2010 allocation.  All of this funding is fully committed and there is no scope for any funding being provided to defray the costs of any new projects, however worthwhile.  I have met the CEO of the organisation involved on many occasions and I am, of course, willing to meet him again at any mutually convenient time.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that these figures are provisional and subject to verification internally through my Department&rsquo;s financial management systems and, ultimately, by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the reply by the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to Question No. 77 of 20 October 2011 in relation to public access at national monument sites.  My Department&rsquo;s general policy is to acquire rights of access from private landowners to monuments or heritage properties in State care or otherwise, which my Department considers important due to their intrinsic architectural or archaeological heritage value, where such access is not currently available and where it is practicable to enter into suitable arrangements with the landowners concerned.  Given the current economic climate, my Department only considers such acquisitions on behalf of the State in exceptional circumstances.  The designation or pro<Col N="420"/>posed designation of Natural Heritage Areas, Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas or refuges for flora and fauna does not confer any additional rights of access for the general public to such sites.  Many of these sites are largely or completely within private ownership and the designation or proposed designation does not affect the application of general legal provisions regarding public access to privately owned land.</P>

The Better Energy programme has overseen the upgrade of almost 100,000 homes since commencement in May 2009.  To ensure the transparent use and administration of Exchequer funding, SEAI are committed to delivering processes and systems which are clear and efficient and operate in a manner which is fair to all applicants.  The scheme rules explicitly state that the grant offer, once accepted, remains valid for six months from the date of issue of Grant Offer notification<i>.</i>  It is not possible to make exceptions as to do so would be to alter the terms of the scheme and create a precedent for any other parties who have found themselves ineligible. SEAI advises that a letter issued to the Deputy recently to advise him of the status of this application.  Dedicated hotlines for specific queries in relation to applications are available (Better Energy: Warmer Homes hotline &mdash; 1800 250 204 and Better Energy: Homes hotline &mdash; 1850 927 000).  All queries, from scheme applicants and public representatives, on delivery dates for individual households and/or funding arrangements are dealt with immediately.  In addition, the SEAI has recently established a specific email address for queries from Members of the Oireachtas, which is <i>oireachtas@seai.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The allocation of specific numbers in the 116 number range, including the 116000 hotline for missing children, is managed in Ireland by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  The role of ComReg is limited to the assignment of the number to an appropriate service provider.  ComReg has alerted potential service providers, through an advertisement campaign, to the existence of the range of numbers beginning with 116, including the 116000 hotline for missing children.  Suitable applicants have been invited to apply for the setting up of services of social value under the specified numbers.  I am advised by ComReg that no organisation has yet applied for the missing children hotline number 116000.  Once the number has been assigned, it is a matter for the service provider to provide the service.  Neither ComReg nor my Department has any function in providing such services or the remit to require any organisation to provide the service.  My colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has recently advised me of her intention to establish a small project team, comprising officials from her Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and <Col N="421"/>Defence, to establish how best to make the 116000 service operational.  While my Department has no policy function in relation to the provision of such a service, my officials and ComReg will be available to the project team should the project team need clarification on any relevant matter.  In particular, ComReg would be happy to assist on any technical aspects in relation to the assignment of the number.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government decision to introduce pay ceilings for higher posts across the public service and for CEO posts in Commercial State Companies.  In addition, the Government sought voluntary waivers of 15% of salary from current incumbents whose salaries were in excess of the pay ceilings or a lesser amount if the application of the full 15% reduction would bring their salary level below the thresholds.  I have been in contact with the three relevant commercial bodies under the aegis of my Department whose CEO salaries exceed &euro;250,000 &mdash; An Post, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the Electricity Supply Board.  The Chief Executives of these bodies have all agreed to have the 15% waiver applied to their salaries.  My Department is liaising with the bodies regarding the implementation of the salary reductions. In the case of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann only, the voluntary reduction brings the Chief Executive&rsquo;s salary to within the &euro;250,000 salary ceiling.</P>

	<P>The electronic communications market is, and has been since its liberalisation, a commercial competitive market.  Thus, the provision of electronic communications services, is a matter for private sector service providers, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  ComReg recognises the desire by providers of electronic communications services to move their customers to e-billing and understands the potential benefits accruing from increased take-up of e-billing (including cost and environmental benefits).  ComReg also recognises the desire by some consumers of electronic communications services to move to e-billing.  However, any move to e-billing should take full account of, and safeguard the legitimate preferences and interests of consumers and comply fully with licence and other applicable legal requirements.  In this regard, ComReg published a consultation on consumer bills and billing mediums on 28 October 2011 to seek the views of interested stakeholders on a number of proposed measures in relation to consumer bills.  I am advised by ComReg that it notified Vodafone on 25 October 2011 that it had not complied with certain conditions of its licences and certain related statutory obligations with respect to electronic billing.  Under Regulation 16 of the authorisation regulations and Regulation 31 of the Univer<Col N="422"/>sal Services Regulations, Vodafone has two weeks within which to state its views on ComReg&rsquo;s finding, or to remedy its non-compliance.  The regulations also provide that if, at the end of the two-week period, ComReg is of the opinion that Vodafone has not complied with its obligations, it may apply to the High Court for such order as may be appropriate by way of compliance with those obligations.</P>

	<P>SAORVIEW is the replacement digital television network for the current analogue network which is near obsolescence.  Both SAORVIEW and the current analogue network are free to air.  To upgrade to Saorview, TV households will need to purchase a set top box to connect to their existing TV or a new Saorview digital TV.  In some cases, depending on the type of aerial and the orientation and age of the aerial, TV households may also need a new aerial.  To overcome the challenges that digital switchover brings, I recognise that we must assist people with information and practical assistance to ensure that no one is left behind as Ireland goes digital.  I have undertaken to deliver a substantial information campaign providing households with information on the digital switchover and on their options for going digital.  This information campaign will be starting this autumn and I will be announcing details in the coming weeks.  In conjunction with this, my Department is working to address the particular information and assistance needs of vulnerable households as they prepare to go digital.  In this context, the expertise and local knowledge of the many voluntary and charity organisations around the country could be of critical importance in ensuring the success of the switchover process.  I have asked my Department to ensure that, to the greatest possible extent, these organisations play a major part in our information and assistance campaign.</P>

	<P>The Framework for Major Emergency Management (2006) enables the Principal Response Agencies (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health Service Executive and Local Authorities) to prepare for and make a co-ordinated response to major emergencies. Structures are in place at regional and local levels so as to facilitate pre-planning and to ensure a co-ordinated response in the event of an emergency which is at regional or local level. These structures also enable collaboration with other relevant organisations.  At national level, co-ordination of the emergency planning function takes place under the aegis of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, which is chaired by my colleague, the Minister for Defence. My Department, as lead Government Department for the management of severe weather emergencies, has responsibility to co-ordinate and lead the overall response across all Government Departments and agencies under their remit or within their sectors.  This responsibility is discharged by convening and chairing of a National Co-ordination Group, in accordance with the Office for Emergency <Col N="424"/>Planning Guidelines for Co-ordinating a National Level Emergency/ Crisis response.  On the specific issue of the Joint Committee&rsquo;s recommendation relating to the ESB and major emergency management, I understand that, pending the development of a national flood forecasting and warning system which is being progressed by the Office for Public Works, the relevant local authorities have had discussions with the ESB and agreed an interim protocol to improve communications around flood events on rivers which are used by the ESB for hydro-electricity generation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 254 and 255 together.</P>
        <P>The Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 provides that all dog breeding establishments be required to register with the relevant local authority, that they pay a registration fee and that they meet a minimum set of veterinary, welfare and other standards, together with some associated requirements.</P>
        <P>Alongside the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, separate legislation on the related issue of greyhound welfare, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, is currently proceeding through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This legislation &mdash; the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2011 &mdash; will provide for the welfare of greyhounds and the regulation of greyhound breeding establishments.</P>
        <P>The provisions of both these pieces of legislation are complementary and accordingly, it is envisaged that both pieces of legislation will be implemented in tandem. This will give wide ranging protection to all dogs in the State by registering and controlling all breeding establishments.  The Welfare of Greyhounds Bill has passed all stages in the D&aacute;il and is currently before the Seanad; I will be in a position to proceed with the commencement of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act once the Greyhound Bill has been enacted.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257, 258, 268, 269, 292, 294, 295 and 302 together. </P>
        <P>My immediate priority is to finalise a review of national climate policy in the light of existing and anticipated national greenhouse gas mitigation targets up to 2020.  The review will be made available on my Department&rsquo;s website in the coming days and will provide the background for future policy development.</P>
        <P>It is my objective, in line with the Programme for Government, to introduce climate legislation within the lifetime of this Government.  As indicated in the Government legislation programme, published on 14 September 2011, I expect that it will be 2012 at the earliest before any legislation can be published, taking account of the need also to progress the broader climate policy agenda under the aegis of the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and the Green Economy.</P>
        <P>In the overall context of policy development, I will be considering the value of carbon budgeting in the future.  I will also be giving consideration to appropriate mechanisms for recording compliance with the annual emissions reduction trajectory with which Ireland must comply, under EU law, from 2013 onwards.</P>
        <P>In relation to climate finance, the developed country Parties who associated with the Copenhagen Accord (including the EU and all Member States) agreed to provide a fast-start finance package, over the three years 2010 to 2012, to assist developing countries address climate change.</P>
        <P>As part of Ireland&rsquo;s response to that commitment, a contribution of &euro;23 million was made by my Department in 2010 to the Global Climate Change Alliance established and operated by the European Commission.  The contribution was the subject of a supplementary estimate debated at the Select Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 9 December 2010.</P>
        <P>The issue of a further contribution to the fast-start finance package through my Department is under ongoing review having regard to the availability of resources and competing demands.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259, 260, 267 and 270 together.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council is the prescribed authority in relation to the investigation of building control compliance issues at Priory Hall, and will act where necessary and appropriate in line with the standard arrangements in place for the discharge of their statutory functions. There are no proposals under consideration for an independent investigation along the lines suggested to be undertaken.</P>
        <P>It is important to note, however, that a robust system of building control does exist and this is demonstrated by the Priory Hall situation where the local authority is successfully using its powers to make the appropriate party responsible.</P>
        <P>Enforcement of the building regulations is the responsibility of the 37 local building control authorities. The authorities are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, where considered necessary.</P>
        <P>The agreed national inspection target is that each building control authority should inspect a minimum of at least 12% to 15% of buildings covered by valid Commencement Notices served on the authority. My Department understands from statistical returns from building control authorities, that an inspection rate of 23% was achieved across the local authority sector during 2010.</P>
        <P>Failure to comply with the requirements of the Building Regulations where a successful prosecution takes place may result, on summary prosecution, in a maximum fine of &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a period of up to six months or both. A further fine of &euro;500 in respect of each day on which the offence is committed after summary conviction can also be applied.   A successful conviction on indictment may result in a maximum fine of &euro;50,000 or imprisonment for a period of up to two years or both.</P>
        <P>I attach high priority to consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings.  That is why, in July 2011, I announced a number of measures to be advanced by my <Col N="428"/>Department and local authorities with a view to improving compliance with, and oversight of, the requirements of the Building Regulations.</P>
        <P>In broad terms the measures will involve:-</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met;</P>
        <P LI="1">(b) more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective and meaningful oversight of building activity;</P>
        <P LI="1">(c) standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions;</P>
        <P LI="1">(d) better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I believe that mandatory certification and improved inspection arrangements are key reforms which will have the capacity to improve the quality of buildings and will lead to further strengthening of the regulatory regime as early as possible in 2012.</P>

	<P>The provision of fire services in local authority areas, including the establishment and maintenance of fire brigades, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises is a statutory function of the individual fire authorities under the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981. My Department supports the local fire authorities through setting of general policy, training support and issue of guidance on operational and other related matters, and the provision of capital funding.</P>
        <P>Donegal County Council, in partnership with my Department, has made substantial progress in improving its fire service infrastructure and has replaced 12 of the 15 fire stations following investment of some &euro;11 million in the past decade under the Department&rsquo;s fire service capital programme. My Department has supported significant investment by fire authorities over the past decade and as a consequence, Ireland&rsquo;s fire service infrastructure is now acknowledged to be first rate.  Approval issued to Longford County Council in February 2011 to invite tenders in respect of a new fire station in Lanesboro.  I expect that new fire station projects funded by my Department will be opened in Edgeworthstown, Co Longford and Monaghan Town shortly.</P>
        <P>I have already indicated that continued investment in the fire appliance fleet is a key national priority measure. In that context fire authorities are currently inviting tenders in respect of 16 fire appliances in accordance with a national specification.</P>
        <P>Any further investment in fire services in Donegal will be considered within the current constraints on the fire services capital programme and will have regard to the priorities of fire authorities, the extent of previous investment and value offered by the proposals, the spread of existing facilities and the totality of demands from fire authorities countrywide.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce competitive tendering for household waste collection, under which service providers would bid to provide waste collection services in a given area, for a given period of time and to a guaranteed level of service.  This system of market structuring is known as franchise bidding.  A public consultation on the issues involved, designed to inform the policy development process, concluded in September 2011.  All of the responses received, including those from a range of companies within the waste industry and from consumers of waste services, are being examined and I intend to bring policy proposals to Government before the end of the year. </P>
        <P>The number of household waste collection service providers in the market at any point in time is a function of a range of factors.  The number of service providers has not been static in recent years &mdash; local authorities have exited the market and some private sector companies have acquired competitors &mdash; and further change can be expected, whether or not the system of regulation of the market is changed.  In deciding on the future arrangements to govern household waste collection services, a key objective will be to ensure that a competitive environment is fostered so as to support the achievement of economically, and environmentally, efficient outcomes.</P>

	<P>My Department has recently received a copy of the report commissioned by Meath County Council in this matter.  The response to the report is a matter for the Council in the first instance under the Local Government Act 2001.  Nevertheless, my Department wrote to the County Manager seeking an early and full report on his proposals to act on the recommendations in the review.  In response, the County Manager has identified the measures that have been put in place to date to address some of the issues raised and indicated he is developing an implementation plan for the delivery of all 25 recommendations.  This response is currently being considered in my Department.</P>

	<P>Under section 58 of the Housing Act 1966, the management and maintenance of the local authority housing stock, including the compilation and funding of ongoing maintenance programmes, is a matter for individual authorities.</P>
        <P>Funding for such maintenance programmes has normally been provided from the local authority&rsquo;s own internal capital receipts. However, with the decline in internal capital receipts, funding has been provided from my Department for the maintenance and improvement of housing stock, particularly in relation to retrofitting of energy efficiency measures.</P>
        <P>Local authorities may also use their remaining internal capital receipts to direct resources to projects which are deemed most in need of funding, including the installation of insulation, the replacement of windows and doors, and other measures to improve energy efficiency in their stock. It is a matter for Meath County Council, taking into account funding available from both my Department and internal capital receipts, to determine and progress their improvements works programme.</P>

	<P>There are nine such applications on hands in my Department from eight LEADER companies.  Four of these applications were first received in the Department more than two months ago.  The assessment of higher value projects (projects with a grant approval of &euro;150,000 or more) usually involves detailed consultations between my Department and the relevant local action group.  It frequently necessitates the provision of further documentation or clarifications, as was the case for the four projects received more than two months ago.  It may also, in some instances, result in modifications to the project proposed to ensure best value for money and compliance with all the necessary regulations, both national and European, governing the activities funded under the programme.  These assessments also consider whether the project as proposed addresses the needs of the local community in the best possible way and a full and detailed assessment of all projects is essential.  LEADER activities are co-financed by the European Union at a rate of 55% and, accordingly, come within the remit of a strict regulatory regime which requires that each project must be compliant before any funding is awarded by the LEADER companies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already introduced reforms to the electoral system in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2011 which changed the terms of reference for the Constituency Commission to provide for a reduced number of TDs.  Also in that Act the spending and reimbursement limits for Presidential elections were reduced and a six month time limit was placed on the calling of D&aacute;il bye elections.</P>
        <P>On 8 June 2011, I published the General Scheme of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011.  Provision is made for the restriction of corporate donations, a reduction in the amounts that can be received as political donations and a reduction in the thresholds for declaring political donations.  Political parties will also now be required to submit their annual accounts to the Standards in Public Office Commission for publication.</P>
        <P>The new legislation will include a provision that political parties will face a cut of half their State political funding if they do not have at least 30% women and 30% men candidates at the next general election.  This will then rise to 40% after 7 years. Payments made to qualified political parties under Part 3 of the Electoral Act 1997 are linked to performance at a General Election and these new requirements will therefore apply in respect of candidates of political parties at a General Election.  It is also my intention that the measures would have a knock-on effect by providing an incentive to political parties voluntarily to apply similar arrangements at local elections.</P>
        <P>In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reform the way legislation is debated and implemented, I have published the General Scheme and invited public input on its contents.  The Bill is currently being drafted and is to be published during the current D&aacute;il term.</P>

	<P>It is open to any person or household to apply to a housing authority for an assessment of their housing need.  It is a matter solely for the housing authority concerned to determine whether an applicant for social housing support is eligible for and in need of that support.  The authority must make its determination in accordance with the provisions of section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, and regulations made under that section, primarily the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case. Regulation 22 of Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provides that an applicant household for long-term social housing support is ineligible for social housing support if a household member owns alternative accommodation that it could reasonably be expected to use to meet its housing need, either by occupying it or by selling it and using the proceeds to secure suitable accommodation.  For this reason, if either member of a separated couple applies, local authorities require evidence of legal separation or divorce before considering a household&rsquo;s eligibility for long-term social housing support, as the separation agreement will provide certainty regarding ownership of property. </P>

        <P>It is a matter for local authorities, when assessing individual households, to consider whether rents payable are in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s rent scheme.  Therefore, decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual local authority to consider in accordance with their own rent scheme.</P>
        <P>As there is no requirement under current legislation for my Department to approve rent schemes, it does not maintain an up to date register of housing authorities&rsquo; rent schemes.  Details of rent schemes are normally published on the relevant authorities&rsquo; websites.</P>
        <P>Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, when commenced, will replace existing enactments in relation to differential rent schemes.  Regulations and guidelines for housing authorities to give effect to section 31 are currently in preparation in my Department.  When these are made, in the coming months, section 31 will be commenced and authorities will have one year in which to put in place a differential rent scheme under the new provisions.  While it is not the intention to introduce a national standardised differential rent scheme, the regulations to be made will more clearly set out the matters that may be included in a local rents scheme, including &mdash;</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 to 290, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>The Office of Public works has responsibility for flood risk management in Ireland, while the response to flooding incidents is delivered by the Principal Response Agencies, led by the relevant local authorities. The principal response agencies co-ordinate their response to flooding in accordance with the 2006 Framework for Emergency Management, each operating under its own Major Emergency Plan. The co-ordination and response management arrangements may be invoked to manage a flooding incident whether a major emergency is declared or not. The Framework requires local authorities to prepare severe weather plans and flood emergency plans, as sub-plans of their Major Emergency Plan. I understand that all local authorities have Severe Weather Plans in place and, where appropriate in accordance with local risk assessment, have Flood Emergency Plans also.  As lead Government Department for Severe Weather Emergencies, my Department published The Report on the Review of the Response to Exceptional Severe Weather Events of 2009-2010 in August 2011.  The Report, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>, describes the response to the severe weather events of January and December 2010. It describes emergency preparedness in Ireland and draws various conclusions, and makes recommendations to improve preparedness for, and increase resilience to, future severe weather events.  The Government Task Force on Emergency Planning endorsed the Report prior to its publication.  Relevant Government Departments and agencies are in the process of implementing the recommendations for their sectors, with a particular focus on those which need to be in place before the coming winter.  Progress is being reported through the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning.</P>
        <P>The publication of the above-mentioned Report, and the ongoing implementation of the recommendations therein addresses the recommendations of the 2010 Report of the Joint Committee on The Management of Severe Weather Events in Ireland and Related Matters in so far as they relate to my Department.  The Joint Committee made a number of recommendations which are relevant to other Government Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>In relation to the involvement of a multitude of agencies in response to severe weather emergencies and flooding events, it is appropriate that a number of agencies are involved in accordance with their mandates and responsibilities. As outlined above, what is important is that the efforts of all are co-ordinated around common objectives, and the Framework for Major Emergency Management provides for this at the local level. When the scale of events <Col N="438"/>merits national level co-ordination, which is led by my Department, the Guidelines for Co-ordinating a National Level Emergency/Crisis Response published by the Office for Emergency Planning provides a template for multi-agency co-ordination which has been shown to be effective.</P>

	<P>The provision of a fire service, including the provision of fire fighting appliances and emergency equipment, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities as set out in the Fire Services Act, 1981. My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances and equipment. </P>
        <P>Dublin City Council&rsquo;s Fire Brigade manages the procurement process from invitation to tender through to delivery and deployment of appliances.   In 2009 funding to support the acquisition of three fire appliances was allocated to the Dublin Fire Brigade, two of which have since been delivered.  The deployment of fire appliances is an operational matter for the fire authority.</P>

	<P>The EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland commits the Government to the introduction of a property tax for 2012. The Programme reflects the need, in the context of the State&rsquo;s overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services. </P>
        <P>In light of the complex issues involved, a property tax, requiring a comprehensive property valuation system, would take time to introduce and accordingly, to meet the requirements in the EU/IMF Programme, the Government has decided to introduce a household charge in 2012. The household charge is an interim measure and proposals for a full property tax will be considered by the Government in due course.</P>
        <P>The household charge is being set at a modest amount of &euro;100 for 2012 and I will provide for a number of exemptions and waivers to the charge.  In addition, to mitigate the impact on homeowners, provision will be made for the payment of the charge by instalments.</P>
        <P>The legislation to underpin the household charge will contain the precise details of the charge and will be published and brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly.</P>

	<P>The Residential Tenancies Act, 2004 sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants in the private rented residential sector. The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Residential Tenancies Act in September 2004 to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants in the private rented residential sector.</P>
        <P>My Department conducted a review of the Residential Tenancies Act in 2009 with a specific emphasis on whether the Act best supports the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions and on whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector. The outcomes of the review were announced by my predecessor in April 2010. Consideration of the introduction of a certification or rating system to be operated by local authorities did not feature in any of the recommendations arising from the review. The Government approved the preparation of the Heads of a Bill to deliver on the review&rsquo;s recommendations. Full details in relation to the background to the review, the associated terms of <Col N="442"/>reference and the outcomes of the review are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The drafting of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2011 was approved by Government in July 2011. The Bill is currently in preparation by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in collaboration with my Department.</P>
        <P>An EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings, which was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006 &mdash; 2008, introduced a requirement for a Building Energy Rating (BER) system.</P>
        <P>In the case of buildings offered for letting, the Regulations require a landlord to produce a copy of the BER certificate and advisory report in relation to the building to any person who expresses an interest in availing of the letting.</P>
        <P>Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  These Regulations were further amended by the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009, which specify a number of requirements in relation to a range of matters including sanitary facilities, refuse facilities, heating, lighting and ventilation.    All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with the Regulations. Responsibility for enforcement rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.</P>
        <P>The standards are kept under review by my Department and there are no proposals under consideration at present to make amendments to them.</P>

	<P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented residential sector. My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 with a specific emphasis on whether the Act best supports the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions and on whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector. The outcomes of the review were announced by my predecessor in April 2010. The drafting of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2011 was approved by Government in July 2011 and the Bill is currently in preparation by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in collaboration with my Department.</P>
        <P>The Act provides that a landlord must apply to register the tenancy of a dwelling with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  Such registration must be accompanied by a fee, the level of which is dependent on whether the tenancy is registered within one month of its commencement or later than one month after the commencement of the tenancy. There is also a specific fee for the registration of several tenancies within the same property within one month of the commencement of the tenancies. The maximum duration of a tenancy under the Act is four years, after which a new tenancy must be registered with the Board. In the case of a dwelling subject to several different tenancies in a 12 month period, no more than two registration fees are payable.</P>
        <P>The issue as to whether dwellings or tenancies should be the focus of registration was considered by the Commission on the Private Rented Sector, on whose report and recom<Col N="443"/>mendations the Act was modelled. The Commission recommended, in July 2000, the registration of tenancies and I do not propose to revisit this fundamental aspect of the Act at present.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Department provided approval in February 2007 for the inclusion of the project in question in Dublin City Council&rsquo;s PPP Regeneration Programme.   In response to the downturn in the housing market and the prevailing economic climate in 2008, Dublin City Council suspended its PPP programme, which included a proposal for the regeneration of Matt Talbot Court.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council subsequently decided to examine a range of options to progress a programme of redevelopment at Matt Talbot Court outside of the National Regeneration Programme, including alternative sources of funding. These options are currently under consideration by the Council, and have yet to be forwarded to my Department for assessment.</P>

	<P>My Department received preliminary details regarding the proposal in question in January 2009 under the Capital Assistance Scheme. In the case of proposals for new housing projects in the Dublin City Council area such as this, it is a matter for Dublin City Council to submit a prioritised list of projects for inclusion in the programme having regard to the merit of the proposals received and the extent to which they will meet local housing needs. In view of the prevailing funding constraints, and existing commitments, this proposal was not prioritised by the Council and therefore my Department did not issue approval to proceed with the project. </P>
        <P>The Capital Assistance Scheme will continue in 2012, and the level of Exchequer funding for the scheme will be determined following the conclusion of the estimates process.  A decision on whether to issue a call for proposals for new projects will be made once the level of funding for 2012 has been determined and having regard to the level of commitments on existing projects. It will be a matter for Dublin City Council to assess proposals such as this under any new call for proposals and resubmit the proposal to my Department.</P>

	<P>The Government remains fully committed to the regeneration of disadvantaged social housing estates in cities and towns, including O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street. In 2008, with the support of my Department, Dublin City Council established <Col N="444"/>a multi-disciplinary Special Housing Taskforce to examine all options with regard to the future regeneration of its six former PPP projects and in particular to examine the fast-tracking of the relocation of households to facilitate future regeneration. Both the Dominick Street and O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens projects were previously included in Dublin City Council&rsquo;s PPP programme. </P>
        <P>Initial proposals for the redevelopment of O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens recently received planning permission. A planning decision is awaited in relation to proposals for Dominick Street. The next step in this process is to prepare detailed masterplans, building on the work already done by the Council and Regeneration Boards, which will address the social, economic, and physical regeneration needs of the communities there. In the interim and to facilitate the future regeneration construction works, the City Council continues to receive funding for the relocation of households out of these areas and for the demolition of vacant buildings.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have established and am chairing the National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments to oversee implementation of the <i>Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments</i>, together with the Government&rsquo;s response to the recommendations. To date, my Department has made allocations totalling some &euro;2.23 million to nineteen local authorities from the &euro;5 million funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues. The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting, and other works to secure sites. My Department will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed. Planning authorities are also making progress in securing the co-operation of developers, financial institutions and/or bond holders, thereby obviating the need to use Exchequer resources to fund such work.</P>
        <P>Developers and owners of unfinished housing developments (or their receivers, where appointed) have the primary legal obligation in addressing outstanding problems associated with these developments. Any public funds expended under this provision should ultimately be recouped from the developer/receiver. Estates which fall under the direct control of NAMA, or receivers appointed by NAMA, are being managed by them and as a consequence do not fall within this scheme.</P>
        <P>The following table sets out details of the funding sought by Longford County Council for public safety measures to be undertaken on Category 4 developments and funding which has been approved by my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 314 to 316, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>The issue of homelessness is a priority for Government which, despite current challenging economic circumstances, remains fully committed to protecting the most vulnerable and marginalised in our society. The <i>Programme for Government</i> commits to reviewing and updating the current homeless strategy and to adopting a &lsquo;housing led&rsquo; approach to homelessness. Work now underway on updating the strategy will be concluded later this year and will involve the establishment of clear performance targets and associated timelines with a particular emphasis on the delivery of accommodation units for homeless persons. Central to this will be the policy approach outlined in my Housing Policy Statement of June 2011.</P>
        <P>There is no single solution to increasing the level of social housing supply, including for those who are homeless, and maximising delivery will require flexible and diverse approaches. The key elements of these approaches will necessarily include the enhanced role of the private rental and the voluntary/cooperative housing sectors, the leasing programme, RAS, local authority social housing acquisitions and remedial works/upgrading for vacant local authority housing stock. Maximising delivery from these sources will be essential to prevent homelessness and end long term occupation of emergency facilities.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to work closely with voluntary service providers in the delivery of supports for homeless people including those who sleep rough. The funding for running costs of homeless accommodation and related services for 2011 is &euro;53.413 million, which together with 10% provided from local authorities own resources, brings the total funding to &euro;58.75m in 2011.  The HSE has responsibility for funding in relation to health and care services for homeless persons.</P>
        <P>The fostering of a resettlement culture that promotes independent living, with supports if and as appropriate, on an equitable basis for all those in need of social housing supports coupled with ongoing reconfiguration of homeless services is essential in order to move away from an outdated emergency hostel-based approach, where people have remained for long periods, damaging their self esteem and reducing their prospects of progressing to full independent living.</P><Col N="447"/>
        <P>I am determined to tackle homelessness in a more planned and strategic way by adopting a housing led approach and providing long term solutions rather than just managing homelessness. This model of service delivery means a reduction in the amount of temporary accommodation and a move to suitable housing tenancies rather than meeting long term needs through homeless accommodation centres. The main focus in terms of housing supports provided by Government will be on meeting the most acute needs but the financial parameters in which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to very large capital funded construction programmes by local authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In respect of counting numbers of homeless people, the Pathway Accommodation &amp; Support System (PASS) is an accommodation management and inter-agency service user support system which is being developed in accordance with priority actions of the implementation plan set out under the national homeless strategy 2008-2013 The Way Home.  The system commenced in January 2011 and is currently in use by almost all service providers of homeless accommodation and outreach supports in the Dublin region. A staged roll out to the rest of the country will begin shortly once ongoing work to ensure consistency of use and accurate information recording by the service providers, as well as the elimination of duplicate records, validation of data etc., has been completed and Dublin City Council confirm the integrity of the data.  The PASS system will in future provide good quality, timely, data on homelessness nationally as an evidence base for all homeless services.</P>

	<P>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s question to relate to the investigation and/or prosecution of the moneylending offences provided for in Part VIII of the Consumer Credit Act 1995. </P>
        <P>In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that where such offences are reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the matter is the subject of investigation under the direction of local Garda District officers with relevant expert assistance available from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.</P>
        <P>I am further advised that as such offences are not recorded on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na PULSE system under a specific crime type,  it would necessitate a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to conduct an examination of each incident recorded on the system to establish the number of incidents concerning moneylending offences for the period in question.</P>
        <P>With regard to the more general question concerning prosecutions and/or convictions in respect of moneylending offences, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.</P>
        <P>I have therefore requested the CSO to ascertain if such statistics are available and to provide any such data directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling, publishing and responding to queries regarding recorded crime statistics.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 319 and 350 together.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met. As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.</P>
        <P>The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  The National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, has also been requested to independently assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.</P>
        <P>One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation. The Government&rsquo;s Legislation Programme as announced on 14 September 2011, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in early 2012. The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.</P>

	<P>In November, 2009 a contract was concluded for the provision of an outsourced safety camera network to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as excessive or inappropriate speeding is a major factor in road traffic collisions and fatalities. <Col N="449"/> The objective of the safety camera network is to reduce the number of speed related collisions and so save lives and prevent serious injury, not to generate revenue.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that &euro;2.1 million was incurred by them on ICT set up costs relating to the introduction of the network.  The figures provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relate to the monthly cost which is approximately &euro;1.35 million.  Fixed charges and court fines paid by speeding drivers contribute to offsetting the operating costs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 333 and 335 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of recent comments on the composition of juries.  It is important to bear in mind that the current jury system is a fundamental part of our legal framework and any departure from it on the lines suggested is not without some difficulty.</P>
        <P>Of relevance, however, is that in August last, I commenced the provisions of section 57 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 which is designed to assist juries in their consideration of complex cases. The judge may order copies of documents, charts, transcripts, agreed summaries of evidence and other documents be given to a jury to assist in its deliberations.  Where an affidavit sworn by an accountant is to be made available, the person who swore it may be required to explain to the jury any relevant accounting procedure or principles. This will allow jury members to review key aspects of evidence in a simplified manner and enhance their ability to reach just and fair decisions.</P>
        <P>In addition, as the Deputy may be aware, the Law Reform Commission is in the process of a detailed examination of jury service, in particular qualification, eligibility, selection process and related matters and in this context published a consultation paper last year.  This process represents the first wide-ranging analysis of jury service since the introduction of the Juries Act 1976.  I understand that the Commission&rsquo;s report including its recommendations is to be published in the first quarter of next year and I look forward to considering the matter further when that is to hand.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 336 and 337 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the development and growth of the English language education sector in Ireland.  The <i>New Immigration Regime for Full Time non-EEA Students</i> launched in January 2011 and the <i>Education in Ireland</i> brand launched in March 2011 underpins this commitment to attract more international students to study in Ireland and to create new jobs in the sector.  Our target is to double the number of international students studying in Ireland in the Higher Education and English Language Sectors.   To achieve this goal there is regular and productive communication between all of the relevant stakeholders in Government and the Industry.</P>
        <P>The processing of visa applications from prospective students falls under the remit of my Department.  However not all international students are visa required.  Indeed, much of the market for English language providers in Ireland originates from within the EU.  Nonetheless, there is potential for growth through attracting non-EEA national students to high quality education providers.</P>
        <P>The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website advises applicants to allow eight weeks for the applications to be processed, although in practice most applications are processed in a much shorter period.  In my Department&rsquo;s dedicated overseas visa offices most applications are typically processed within 2 to 3 weeks.  These processing times compare favourably with international standards.  English language education providers are fully aware of the processing times and market their services accordingly.  The decision to pursue English language education in any jurisdiction is a careful consideration for a student and is not a spontaneous decision.  These processing times are reasonable in that regard and I have no information which would indicate that this is an issue which is inimical to the industry here.</P>

	<P>A final decision on whether station closures will take place will be taken in the coming weeks when the Commissioner&rsquo;s Policing Plan for 2012 is finalised. That policing plan will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I must stress that as with every other public sector organisation, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is going to have to manage with reduced resources.  The Garda Commissioner is therefore quite properly reviewing all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures. The purpose of the review is to ensure that Garda resources are managed and deployed in the most appropriate manner to meet existing and emerging policing requirements.</P>
        <P>I will very carefully consider the outcome of this review and the Commissioner&rsquo;s policing plan for next year with the objective of ensuring that priority is given to the maintenance of frontline services.</P>

	<P>The wide range of matters raised by the Deputy have been noted in my Department, insofar as they are matters for which I have responsibility. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, family law proceedings in the courts are held in camera.  Under the law as it stands the giving of false evidence in any court proceedings, including family law proceedings, is an offence punishable by imprisonment.  Any person who has knowledge of such false allegations should bring them to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Orders made under the Guardianship of Children Act 1964, as amended, concerning guardianship and custody of, and access to, children, are subject to section 3 of the Act which requires the courts to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  Any proposal requiring automatic changes in custody arrangements in specified circumstances would not respect this very important principle.</P>
        <P>In respect of the provision of legal aid in the family law matters referred to, the Legal Aid Board is the statutory body providing civil legal aid in such matters.  The Board has procedures in place, underpinned by legislation, which allow for the termination of a legal aid certificate <Col N="457"/>where it is deemed warranted by a client&rsquo;s behaviour in the conduct of proceedings.  The Board has informed me that it regularly represents both parents in the family law matters referred to and does not in any way discriminate between fathers and mothers in the granting of legal aid or in the conduct of cases.  The Board completely rejects any notion that its solicitors would be in any way complicit in the making of any such false allegations, and I fully support the Board&rsquo;s stance in that respect.</P>

	<P>There is no automatic entitlement to entry or residence in the State for a non EEA national spouse on the basis of marriage to an Irish national.  Visa required non EEA national spouses are subject to pre-entry clearance before travelling to the State and are required to apply for a visa on the basis of marriage to an Irish national.</P>
        <P>Once in the State, a non EEA national spouse must attend the local Registration Office, Garda National Immigration Bureau to apply for residence status and he/she must be accompanied by their Irish national spouse at that time.  A stamp 4 is normally granted to successful applications and this entitles a non EEA national spouse to reside in the State, work without the requirement of a work permit, operate a business without applying for business permission from my Department or study within the State without the requirement for further permission.  Such permission is not granted automatically and cases which require further investigation are referred to my Department.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position as Minister for Justice and Equality to give legal advice in response to Parliamentary Questions. However, the following is by way of general information.</P>
        <P>Provisions relating to the sale, supply and consumption of intoxicating liquor are set out in the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2011 and the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008. The general position is that premises require a licence from the Revenue Commissioners under the Licensing Acts or, in the case of registered clubs, a certificate of registration from the District Court under the Registration of Clubs Acts, in order to engage in the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor and to permit consumption on the premises. Engaging in the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor without such a licence or certificate of registration, or permitting its consumption on the premises, is an offence.</P>
        <P>As regards the consumption of intoxicating liquor in unlicensed venues, the position is that section 26 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act provides that a person shall not be in or consume intoxicating liquor in unlicensed drinking premises unless the person is an &ldquo;excepted person&rdquo;, i.e. a <i>bona fide</i> occupier of the premises, a member of his or her family, a resident or worker in the premises, or a <i>bona fide</i> guest of any such person. In this context, &ldquo;unlicensed drinking premises&rdquo; is defined as premises to which an on-licence is not attached, or are not the premises of a registered club, which are used or made available for the consumption of intoxicating liquor by persons resorting to them.</P>
        <P>Section 26 of the 1962 Act also provides that the District Court, if satisfied on information given on oath by a member of the Garda&iacute; not below the rank of inspector that there is reasonable ground for supposing that an offence under the section has been, is being or is about to be committed, may issue a search warrant in respect of premises concerned.</P>
        <P>I should add that the Government Legislation Programme provides for publication of the Sale of Alcohol Bill in early 2012. This Bill will modernise the laws relating to the sale, supply and consumption of intoxicating liquor by repealing the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2010, as well as the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008, and replacing them with streamlined and updated provisions.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority (PRA) was established as and from 4 November 2006. The PRA replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions. However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy I have had enquiries made with the Authority.</P>
        <P>I am informed that the digitisation of 2.8 million land parcels was a major undertaking that required careful planning, and the development of a detailed protocol to manage and control the process was essential. Considerable care was taken to ensure that properties were brought over into the digital environment correctly.  As of 28 October, 2011 there were 316,535 registered parcels on the mapping register for County Cork. This equates to somewhere in the region of between 1,250,000 and 1,500,000 registered boundaries.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that one of the benefits of the digitisation has been the identification and elimination of some historical anomalies that existed on the paper maps prior to digitisation. This process is continuing and will result in many development schemes becoming realigned with revised OSI topographical detail, thus ensuring that the Land Registry map is as good a representation of what exists on the ground as is possible within the scale of maps available to the PRA.</P><Col N="461"/>
        <P>An essential element of the Digital Mapping Project has been the development and implementation of extensive quality assurance procedures to ensure the conversion from paper to digital form has been performed correctly.</P>
        <P>As would have been the case in the paper based environment, where a query arises in relation to how a property is represented or easement is registered on the Registry Map, details of the problem are forwarded to the PRA where a dedicated Unit based in the Authority&rsquo;s Waterford office investigates matters with a view to resolution of any difficulties that may arise.</P>
        <P>The Unit will assess the issue by reference to the agreed protocols and by reference to appropriate statutes. A rigorous investigation is undertaken and every effort is made to ensure such enquiries are dealt with expeditiously. However, some cases may be complex and involve more in depth historical research or the service of notice on adjoining parties.</P>
        <P>From the 1 January, 2011 to date, the PRA has received approximately 160 enquiries from customers (both legal and otherwise) regarding mapping issues in County Cork. Not all of these enquiries have shown that there is an error on the digital map and hence no amendment to PRA&rsquo;s map record was required in those cases.</P>

	<P>A final decision on whether station closures will take place, and if so what stations, will be taken in the coming weeks when the Commissioner&rsquo;s Policing Plan for 2012 is finalised. That policing plan will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I must stress that as with every other public sector organisation, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is going to have to manage with reduced resources.  The Garda Commissioner is therefore quite properly reviewing all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures. The purpose of the review is to ensure that Garda resources are managed and deployed in the most appropriate manner to meet existing and emerging policing requirements.</P>
        <P>I will very carefully consider the outcome of this review and the Commissioner&rsquo;s policing plan for next year with the objective of ensuring that priority is given to the maintenance of front-line services.</P>

	<P>I agree with the Deputy that the current practice which requires personal filing is antiquated and unsustainable.  I have therefore agreed to proposals to introduce a dual system, i.e. accepting both postal and personal filing, in the High Court and would hope that, resources permitting, the courts can move towards accepting documents via email where appropriate.</P><Col N="462"/>
        <P>While I am conscious that this initiative may impact on the work traditionally carried out by &lsquo;town agents&rsquo;, I am satisfied it will modernise the filing process in line with other court jurisdictions and make a modest contribution towards the reduction of legal costs.  I await the submission of finalised court rules to introduce the new system which I hope will be in place early next year.</P>

	<P>I attach the highest priority to the full investigation of white collar crime and bringing the perpetrators of such crime to justice.  I have already expressed my unhappiness at the protracted nature of the investigations underway.  This is not a criticism of the investigators and prosecutors, who face tough challenges as a result of the complexities of the matters being investigated.  At the same time, I am anxious to ensure that I do not say anything which might jeopardise any prosecutions.</P>
        <P>Within eight weeks of taking up office, I moved urgently to draft, and seek Government approval to the introduction of, additional legislation.  This new legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 2011, was enacted on 2 August.  The Act is an important step in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackle white collar crime.  Its main purpose is to address delays in the prosecution and investigation of complex white collar crime by improving certain important procedural matters and strengthening Garda investigative powers.  The Act&rsquo;s provisions are based on the experiences of those involved in investigations and prosecutions of white collar crime, and in particular on the experiences of those involved in current investigations into bank fraud and financial irregularities.  It provides new procedures and powers which will speed up both current and future investigations, including investigations into offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment that rogue bankers and all those that misappropriate or embezzle funds are properly pursued for their crimes and that the full rigours of the law will apply to them.  I am determined to see this commitment fulfilled.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigations into Anglo Irish Bank by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) are ongoing, with a full investigation team employed at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  This team continues to conduct necessary follow up enquiries in respect of investigations, as well as investigations into separate complaints received regarding other alleged malpractices.</P>
        <P>All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na allocated to such investigations have previous experience in the investigation of fraud related offences, and the investigations are augmented by experienced investigators from ODCE.  There is close cooperation and ongoing liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ODCE, with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seconded to ODCE.</P>
        <P>I am informed that two comprehensive investigation files were submitted by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation to the Law Officers in December, 2010.  In addition, supplementary investigation files were submitted in May and October.  The files remain under consideration by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and directions are awaited.  It is anticipated that a further supplementary investigation file will shortly be submitted to the DPP.</P><Col N="465"/>

	<P>Section 5 (1) (e) of the Ombudsman Act, 1980 and section 11(1) (e) of the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Act, 2002 provide that either Ombudsman shall not investigate any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of the law relating to, inter alia, asylum.  I should say that, while neither Office currently has the power to investigate asylum related matters, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), including the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), has administrative arrangements in place with both Offices to assist and provide information on matters brought to its attention.  At all events, it should be noted that it was not intended that either Ombudsman would serve as a first instance appellant authority in relation to day to day administrative complaints mechanisms.  It is a requirement that a person who wishes to appeal to the Ombudsman must first try to solve the problem with the public body concerned using formal local appeals mechanism.  </P>
        <P>In relation to the broader issue of complaints by residents of direct provision centres under contract to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, these are dealt with in accordance with the recently published revised RIA House Rules and Procedures which are available in several languages on the RIA website at <i>http://www.ria.gov.ie</i>.  A copy of these rules and procedures is provided to all asylum seekers on arrival at their accommodation centre.</P>
        <P>Experience has shown that, given the nature and the number of such complaints, they are best resolved by informal discussion between residents and management at a local level.  Where more serious complaints arise, residents have the right to lodge a formal written complaint with centre management and, if the issue remains unresolved, residents can take the complaint to RIA. It also allows for direct referral to RIA in certain circumstances.  It is important to note that if a complaint is made in respect of a decision made by a particular RIA official, the appeal is not dealt with by that official. The complaints system contained in these House Rules is considered by RIA to be broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Office of the Ombudsman for internal complaints systems.</P>
        <P>It is important to emphasise that the Rules specifically state that (a) residents should not be afraid to complain when they need to and (b) making a complaint will not affect how other official agencies consider their claims to remain in the State i.e. on asylum, subsidiary protection or general leave to remain grounds.</P>
        <P>These House Rules and procedures were revised arising from a report from a Working Party, the membership of which included the Refugee Information Service and the Irish Refugee Council. The Review Group met 13 times and also met with residents and local NGOs in 4 asylum accommodation centres. During those Working Party discussions the issue of an independent appeals mechanism, on which differing views were held, was fully discussed.  It was RIA&rsquo;s view that no clear model was cited during these discussions as to what an independent complaints mechanism would look like or how it could be implemented without undue cost and bureaucracy. The system of direct provision is <i>sui generis</i> and I am informed that the <Col N="466"/>complaints resolution procedure above is considered to be the only one appropriate to the circumstances which obtain in that system.</P>
        <P>I should add that, in response to concerns expressed by members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in October, 2010 to Departmental officials appearing before it, amendments were made to the House Rules to further encourage use of the complaints mechanism by residents and staff.  Also, RIA will publish shortly on its website aggregated monthly statistics on formal written complaints made under these Rules.</P>

	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the operation of the direct provision system.  As of 23 October 2011, RIA  has contracted to it 39 accommodation centres across the State accommodating 5,481 persons in all of which 4 are in County Galway &mdash;   Details of all centres currently under contract to RIA are available on its website, <i>www.ria.gov.ie.</i></P>
        <P>The direct provision system is a constantly evolving one, taking account of the reducing number of residents in RIA centres. The numbers needing to be accommodated by RIA have declined by 10% in 2011 and this trend is continuing downwards. The 2011 estimates provision for RIA is &euro;67.5 million, down &euro;10 million (13%) from last year. Accordingly, because of a decline in demand, the number of asylum accommodation centres is necessarily falling.  Five centres closed in 2008, six in 2009, eight in 2010 and seven to date in 2011. In addition to centre closures, a number of accommodation centres have reduced their bed space capacity to reflect the decline in demand.</P>
        <P>The number of asylum seekers requiring accommodation now and the likely number in the future is under constant review and it is not possible at this stage to predict what particular accommodation facilities will be required in the short or medium term future.  The general economic constraints, which apply to all public spending, will continue to apply in management of the direct provision budget.</P>

The working arrangements of the Committee are entirely a matter for the committee and the independent Chair.</P>
        <P>I can advise that, separate to the work of the Committee, I have held discussions with the religious congregations regarding their records. They have advised me that it is already the practice that individuals who were in a Magdalen laundry and make a request are given access to records relating to them.  The religious congregations have also indicated their willingness to discuss the general question of long term retention of and access to records.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>First I should emphasise that I am not opposed to greening of the CAP.  Ireland actively promotes sustainable and carbon-efficient agricultural production and this concept is at the heart of our Food Harvest 2020 Strategy.  However, I have considerable difficulty with the Commission proposals as they stand.  The existence of a separate greening measure will complicate our existing Single Payment Scheme.  It will also hasten the movement to flat rates of payment. The flat rate character of the greening proposal poses a major problem for me when taken together with the proposed flattening of the basic payment.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that the CAP already delivers considerable greening, particularly in Ireland.  Our predominantly grass-based production is already contributing significantly to the delivery of environmental objectives through the retention of soil carbon, the retention of grassland habitats and the protection of water quality associated with grassland.  My view is that we need to look at less bureaucratic and simpler means of further greening the CAP, building on what we have already achieved through cross compliance and Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) requirements.</P>
        <P>I also have problems with the individual greening criteria proposed. My initial reaction is that they require a lot more work.  However, I am conscious that these are proposals only that have yet to be clarified and explained and I intend to work constructively with the Commission and other Member States to achieve an outcome that is both practical for farmers and effective in terms of achieving environmental sustainability.</P>

	<P>There are no delays in payments to farmers under either the Single Farm Payment Scheme or the Disadvantaged <Col N="469"/>Areas Scheme. With regard to DAS, payments commenced on target, on 22 September, while the 50% advance payments of the SFP started issuing, on schedule, on 17 October.</P>
        <P>In the case of the SFP, the earliest payment date under the governing EU rules is 1 December, while in respect of DAS there is no regulatory payment date &mdash; however, it is generally recognised and indeed acknowledged in the Farmers&rsquo; Charter, that a payment target of late September of the year in question is the most realistic. In the case of the Single Farm Payment, earlier this year I successfully sought the approval of the Commissioner to have advance payments made as and from 17 October. This is the earliest possible legal date for making payments, it being the start of the new EU financial year.</P>
        <P>Suggestions have been made that the necessity to re-digitise farmers&rsquo; maps is leading to unnecessary delays, resulting in payments being made later than would otherwise be the case. I can assure all concerned of my commitment to allocating such resources as is necessary to ensure that the essential digitisation of applicants&rsquo; maps onto the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS).<i> </i>I must emphasise that any failings or shortcomings in LPIS would leave the Department open to the very real risk of significant fines. I am not prepared to take such a risk, nor will I compromise<i> </i>the value of direct payments to Irish farmers<i>.</i>  Furthermore, sight should not be lost of the fact that the changes which have been recorded onto LPIS in very significant numbers, both throughout last year and again this year, are necessitated by the need to have all ineligible areas mapped; simply put, the position on the ground in any given farm must be accurately reflected on LPIS.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As the Deputy is aware, there are no delays in payments to farmers under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, payments having commenced, on target, on 22 September, with payments issuing to those farmers whose applications had been confirmed eligible for payment at that time. I can confirm that my Department has, in the interim, continued to pay individuals, as their cases became clear, with payment runs taking place twice a week. This is normal practice and will continue on an ongoing basis, as necessary. In this regard, while I am pleased to note that payments worth &euro;191.7 million have issued to date, representing over 85% of applicants, I remain confident that the full budget for the Scheme will have been exhausted by year-end.</P>
        <P>It is not intended to resort to the exceptional, once-off measures adopted in the latter part of 2010, when the decision was taken to make payments at a rate of 75%. It should be recalled that these payments were made on the basis of land confirmed eligible at the time of payment, whereas payments under the 2011 Scheme, in addition to being at a rate of 100%, are made on applicants&rsquo; entire eligible areas following the completion of the validation process for each application.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As is clear, while the timing of all direct aid payments to farmers is crucial, it is the Single Farm Payment that is of most importance to farmers, given that it represents in excess of &euro;1.2 billion of the &euro;1.7 billion that is paid out annually in direct aid. The SFP forms a significant part of the annual income of all farmers in Ireland.  In many cases it is used to subsidise the running costs of the farming enterprise and is, therefore, greater than the net farm income. Earlier this year, mindful of the significance to the wider rural economy of the Single Payment, I successfully sought the approval of the Commissioner to have advance payments made. I am pleased to say that these payments commenced issuing on 17 October, with payments continuing to be made twice weekly on an on-going basis.</P>

	<P>The pier at Coolaghy, Clifden is owned by Galway County Council and the responsibility for its repair and maintenance lies with the local authority in the first instance.  Earlier this year, however, my Department invited coastal local authorities to submit applications in respect of priority harbour development projects for inclusion in its 2011 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme. My Department received an application from Galway County Council for funding for a total of 3 projects, of which Coolaghy pier was identified as the 3rd project in order of priority.</P>
        <P>Having regard to its prioritisation and the fact that the required planning permission was not in place, the project was not selected for funding by the Evaluation Committee.  Any application for funding in future years by Galway County Council will be given consideration subject to available exchequer funding and overall national priorities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 386 and 393 together.  Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002, which sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law, stipulates among other things, that food business operators at all stages of production, processing and distribution within the businesses under their control must ensure that foods satisfy the requirements of food law and that these requirements are met.  In regard to traceability the regulations require that the operator must have systems in place to be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food.  They must also have a system in place to identify the other businesses to which their product has been supplied.</P>
        <P>All products of animal origin for human consumption imported into the European Union from third countries must be inspected at an approved Border Inspection Post. The products undergo documentary, identity and physical examinations to ensure that they comply with relevant EU and national legislation. Imports must be accompanied by health certification provided by the competent authorities of the country of origin. The Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) of the EU conducts audits and reports on production and export controls operated in approved third countries.  The FVO also approves third-country meat processing establishments wishing to export to the EU and audits Member States&rsquo; import controls for products from third countries.</P>
        <P>When all import controls have been satisfied, compliant consignments may then be imported and placed on the single market, where they are treated the same as other compliant products and subject to the EU&rsquo;s Food Hygiene Regulations.  In Department-approved meat establishments in Ireland, the same level of supervision is afforded to both imported and locally produced product. Veterinary inspectors ensure that meat coming into supervised premises must be from an approved source, whether locally produced or imported.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 387 and 388 together.  There is good support from my colleagues in the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers for the Common Agricultural Policy.  Over recent years an alliance of some 14 Member States, including Ireland, has pressed on a continuous basis for a strong CAP and to defend EU agricultural interests in the WTO. Indeed this alliance has been augmented from time to time by support from additional Member States.  It is worth noting that the conclusions drawn up earlier this year by the Hungarian EU Presidency seeking a strong CAP with resources commensurate with its objectives gained the support of twenty Member States.  These Member States also agreed that one of the three main objectives for the <Col N="474"/>future CAP should be to ensure viable food production. They also endorsed the other objectives of sustainable management of natural resources and climate action as well as balanced territorial development.</P>
        <P>As negotiations on the future CAP progress, I intend to maintain and develop the alliances with like-minded Member States to secure the best possible outcome for Ireland.</P>
        <P>As to the WTO Doha Development Round, talks are stalled at present and the prospects for conclusion of an agreement are uncertain at this point in time.  Nevertheless, I will continue to maintain pressure to secure an acceptable outcome from these negotiations that does not undermine the development of European and Irish agriculture.</P>

	<P>The Agri-Food sector has performed exceptionally well in the last 18 months.  Exports from the sector have increased and global prices for our products have remained good.  The sector has responded well to the challenging targets agreed in Food Harvest 2020, which clearly maps out the future growth of the sector.</P>
        <P>There are, nonetheless, major challenges ahead.  Input prices have remained stubbornly high and producer margins are declining.  Changes to the CAP and agreements between the EU and other trading blocs will also present challenges.  I intend to defend the Irish farming model and ensure the most suitable conditions for Irish farmers so that they can continue to provide quality produce for a worldwide market.</P>

        <P>With regard to Government support for the suckler cow herd, it must be remembered that significant funding is already being channelled into the sector. Payments to farmers by my Department under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme amounted to &euro;113.5m since its introduction in January 2008. Approximately &euro;20.5m has been paid through the scheme in respect of animals born in 2010 and, depending on the number of successful applicants, this figure could potentially reach &euro;25m by the end of the year. The Suckler Cow Scheme has undoubtedly helped to improve animal husbandry and management practices as well as stabilise beef cow numbers in the aftermath of decoupling. These supports contribute in no small way to underpinning the output quality and overall viability of the sector at farm level.</P><Col N="476"/>
        <P>Furthermore, my Department and its agencies engage in a range of activities that provide a sound framework for the future development of the beef sector. These include the advisory and research output of Teagasc, Bord Bia&rsquo;s Quality Assurance Scheme and its promotional work in expanding beef sales at home and abroad together with the Beef and Sheepmeat Capital Investment Fund for the processing industry. My Department also makes a significant contribution to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation which plays a critical role in improving genetic quality in the suckler herd. In addition, my Department is continuing its efforts to facilitate market access for Irish beef in a range of third countries that can offer alternative outlets to exporters along with real potential for expansion. All these ongoing investments and services serve to underpin the strength of the suckler cow herd.</P>
        <P>While the 2012 budgetary process will involve difficult but necessary decisions in relation to public expenditure across all sectors, I can assure the Deputy that I intend to make the best possible use of public funding to ensure that the agrifood sector, including suckler farmers, can continue to make the maximum possible contribution to the national economy.</P>
        <P>While producers are currently benefiting from strong prices for all categories of cattle, I recognise that direct supports under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are crucial to the future of the livestock sector and I have repeatedly stated my commitment to protecting the level of supports available to farmers under the CAP post-2013 regime. In this regard, I will use my best endeavours to shield and defend Irish agriculture generally, including suckler cow production, in the forthcoming negotiations on the CAP reform package.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I expect the Irish dairy sector to fully exploit its undoubted potential over the next decade and beyond. The roots of this potential lie in the unrivalled natural advantage we possess in the form of a grass-based production system, which allows us to produce milk and other dairy products of the highest quality in an environmentally friendly manner and on a highly cost efficient basis. These characteristics in turn strengthen our marketing position against the backdrop of very positive forecasts in relation to global population and economic growth over the coming decades. The industry is well-placed to exploit these advantages as it continues to develop and modernise, with new technologies and best practices being applied at producer and at processor level.</P><Col N="477"/>
        <P>In setting out the strategy for the development of the agri-food and fisheries sectors over the next decade, the <i>Food Harvest 2020 </i> report seeks to harness this potential by setting a target of a 50% growth in milk production by 2020 compared to the average for the 2007-2009 period. This is an ambitious but, I believe, an achievable objective. The realisation of this target will be dependent on the achievement of maximum efficiency at production and processing levels, motivated by the belief that we can always do things better.  The report&rsquo;s recommendations focus on changes needed in milk processing, in on-farm competitiveness, in the transfer of technology and knowledge to dairy farmers, and in R&amp;D and marketing. I chair the High Level Implementation Committee, whose function is to drive and co-ordinate the successful implementation of Food Harvest 2020.</P>
        <P>The Dairy Expansion Activation Group has got the implementation ball rolling in the dairy sector. Earlier this year it produced a Road Map setting out 55 actions that are required to achieve the 50% increase in milk production. These are broken into four categories, namely, on-farm production, efficiency in the milk processing sector, the development of market opportunities and general agriculture policy. Dr. Sean Brady, who chaired the Dairy Expansion Activation Group, is continuing to facilitate the process of implementation and to monitor progress. All of the stakeholders are being encouraged to discharge the responsibilities assigned to them and the response is being monitored and reported upon.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that Milestones for Success, the first annual progress report on the implementation of Food Harvest 2020, was published in July. More than 90% of the 215 initiatives have been commenced. I know that a lot of effort has already been made by all stakeholders, and that there is a strong commitment to delivering results. I believe a good start has been made and I am confident that the momentum generated by that good start will be carried forward.</P>

	<P>While the budget is primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance, I have received submissions from farm bodies outlining their views on taxation matters relating to the sector.  I am in regular contact with farm bodies and my officials discuss various proposals with representatives from the sector.  Given the current budgetary constraints it is important to ensure that the tax system encourages practices that will develop the sector and allow farmers to continue providing excellent quality food in a challenging production climate.</P>
        <P>As regards the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, while I have yet to receive formal submissions, I have a Consultative Committee in place, composed of the key stakeholders and a number of academics, to advise me on an ongoing basis during the negotiations.  This committee met most recently on 26 October and provided a first reaction to the formal legal proposals for the future CAP. My intention is that this committee will continue to meet, review developments and provide advice as the negotiations progress.</P><Col N="478"/>
        <P>There is also a consultative committee in place on the WTO Doha Development Round.  However, the reality is that the WTO negotiations are stalled currently and the prospects for an early conclusion of the round are very uncertain.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 395 and 396 together. </P>
	<P Just="Left">I am committed to continuing the path set out in Food Harvest 2020 for the development of the seafood sector in Ireland.  Food Harvest identifies the potential of the seafood industry to increase employment by 3,000 to 14,000 full time equivalent jobs by 2020.  The strategy set out in Food Harvest involves both the processing and aquaculture sectors.</P>
        <P>My Department and its agencies have been working together on a twin-track approach to overcoming existing constraints on the aquaculture sector, firstly through the comprehensive bay by bay environmental impact assessments required by EU Birds and Habitat Directives and secondly through development of the feasibility of locating aquaculture in less sensitive but more challenging conditions offshore.  We are starting to see promising signs of progress in 2011 on the environmental assessments in Natura sites and I believe this will gather pace as the process is bedded-in.  BIM provides support programmes for the sector, including an innovation and technology support scheme and capital grant support for shellfish production.  The latter is available to aquaculture operations outside Natura areas and to those within Natura areas where assessments under the Habitats and Birds Directives demonstrate that aquaculture is compatible with those Directives.  The continuation of these programmes in future years is subject to Budget allocations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to the seafood processing sector, Food Harvest 2020 recognised that the sector was fragmented, lacking in scale, uncompetitive in terms of production costs, too focused on export of commodity products and constrained by inconsistent supply of raw material.  BIM, with Enterprise Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s, is working to address each of these issues.</P>
        <P>Grant aid support under the Seafood Processing Business Investment Scheme was provided in 2011 to improve competitiveness and help the companies concerned develop export markets for high value added products. Twenty nine projects were approved for capital grant aid of &euro;2.5 million, supporting related investment of &euro;10 million. This investment is projected to lead to increased sales of &euro;43 million and 222 additional jobs in the sector by 2014.</P>
        <P>BIM launched a new Seafood Value Adding Scheme earlier this year to support seafood companies with developing added-value products.  The scheme assists with concept development, including business planning, product development and packaging. Fifteen company projects have been approved, covering testing, developing a range of new products, new packaging <Col N="479"/>formats and development of high value by-products from primary processing.  The continuation of these two programmes in future years is subject to Budget allocations.</P>
        <P>BIM initiated contacts with French fishing industry during 2011 to develop a strategic alliance between Irish seafood processors and French fishing vessels operating in Irish waters. The aim of this alliance is to enable French vessels land their catch into Irish ports where it can be more efficiently handled by Irish processors, saving fuel costs and shortening the route to market for the French vessels.  Under the initiative, Irish processors will have the opportunity to access and process more raw material, a key objective of Food Harvest 2020.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</askee>
        <Quest> if he will consider changing the butterfat levels within the milk quota system from its current average of 3.57% to 4% or higher which would be closer to the European average; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32023/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>EU Member States&rsquo; national reference butterfat contents were set at the commencement of the milk quota regime, and were confirmed as recently as 2007 by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1234/2007.  Ireland&rsquo;s national reference butterfat content is 35.81g/kg. </P>
        <P>Individual producers&rsquo; reference butterfat contents have been subject to change over the years on foot of quota transfers, quota allocations from the national reserve and quota purchases through Milk Quota Trading and Restructuring Schemes.  Milk deliveries are adjusted upwards where an individual producer&rsquo;s average (current) butterfat content exceeds his/her reference butterfat content.  Until the CAP Health Check agreement in 2008, this adjustment had the effect, nationally, of increasing deliveries by approximately 4 per cent.  The halving of the butterfat coefficient from 0.18% to 0.09% under the Health Check agreement resulted in the equivalent of an approximately 2% increase in milk quota in Ireland.</P><Col N="483"/>
        <P>In relation to the reference butterfat content, this is established by Council regulation, and there is no prospect of a qualified majority of Member States supporting a proposal to make the significant change to that regulation which would be required to effect a change in the reference content.  However, as part of my ongoing efforts to secure a soft landing ahead of milk quota abolition in 2015, I am seeking to have the butterfat coefficient effectively abolished, which would provide the equivalent of a further 2% quota increase for Ireland.  This proposal potentially offers a solution which is significantly simpler from a procedural perspective.  Notwithstanding this, I am continuing to meet opposition on this issue from the Commission and from other EU Member States, so I would again take the opportunity to remind all milk producers that they must continue to operate within the constraints imposed by the milk quota regime.</P>

	<P>I presume that, since TB reactors are not as a general rule re-tested, the Deputy is referring to re-testing of animals which give an inconclusive reaction to the TB skin test.  The position on this issue is that my Department has not discontinued its practice of using its own veterinary inspectors to test inconclusive reactors.  However, my Department does not have the resources to conduct all ancillary testing and much of this work is outsourced to private veterinary practitioners.  I should point out that, with a view to disease control and cost savings, my Department strategically manages its own veterinary staff resources to conduct as much of this testing as possible.  </P>

	<P>I introduced the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Agriculture) Regulations 2011 to address a European Court of Justice (ECJ) judgement against Ireland in relation to the implementation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. Ireland was facing significant lump sum and daily fines if Regulations were not introduced to fully satisfy the judgement.</P>
        <P>The new Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulations should not be seen as an impediment to development. There is no cost involved to the farmer in the screening application process and I envisage a turn-around time for applications of between four and six weeks. If proposed works do not have a significant adverse effect on the environment, then there is no reason why they cannot proceed. In light of the thresholds set for screening and mandatory environmental impact assessment under the EIA Regulations, I do not anticipate many activities requiring Environmental Impact Statements.</P>
        <P>The Regulations will be underpinned by a comprehensive guidance document. The consultation period for the draft guidance document has now closed. The submissions received will be taken into consideration by my Department, along with the views of the European Commission, before the guidance is finalised.</P>

	<P>An application under the Single Payment Scheme /Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on the 5th   April 2010.</P>
        <P>This application was selected for a ground eligibility/cross compliance inspection.</P>
        <P>During the course of this inspection discrepancies were found that resulted in a claimed area of 23.28ha being reduced to 21.10ha. Under EU Regulations if the total area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held, penalties will be applied per the Terms and Conditions of the scheme. In this case the number entitlements held by the person named is 23.53. As the difference between the area declared and the area found is more than 3%, <Col N="488"/>under EU Regulations, the difference between the area found and the area claimed is doubled and deducted from the area found. As a result the area put forward for payment under the Single Payment Scheme was 16.74ha. The person named was informed of this decision on the 26th   of August 2010 and of his right to seek a review. He was also informed of his right to appeal the outcome of any review to the Independent Agriculture Appeals office. To date, no request for a review has been submitted, however, your question will now be taken as a request for review which will now be carried out. As part of this review any new facts or evidence will have to be supplemented with supporting documentation.</P>

Following an inspection on 22nd   June 2010, a clawback was imposed as a result of a discrepancy in the amount of land drawn down for payment under a particular measure under the scheme which resulted in a delay in processing the payment of the 25% balancing payment for the second year.  </P>

	<P>There are no delays in payments to farmers under either the Single Farm Payment Scheme or the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme. With regard to DAS, payments commenced on target, on 22 September, while the 50% advance payments of the SFP started issuing, on schedule, on 17 October. </P>
        <P>In the case of the SFP, the earliest payment date under the governing EU rules is 1 December, while in respect of DAS there is no regulatory payment date &mdash; however, it is generally recognised and indeed acknowledged in the Farmers&rsquo; Charter, that a payment target of late September of the year in question is the most realistic. In the case of the Single Farm Payment, earlier this year I successfully sought the approval of the Commissioner to have advance payments made as and from 17 October. This is the earliest possible legal date for making payments, it being the start of the new EU financial year.  Suggestions have been made that the necessity to re-digitise farmers&rsquo; maps is leading to unnecessary delays, resulting in payments being made later than would otherwise be the case.  I can assure all concerned of my commitment to allocating such resources as is necessary to ensure that the essential digitisation of applicants&rsquo; maps onto the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). <i> </i>I must emphasise that any failings or shortcomings in LPIS would leave the Department open to the very real risk of significant fines. I am not prepared to take such a risk, nor will I compromise<i> </i>the value of direct payments to Irish farmers<i>.</i></P>
        <P>Furthermore, sight should not be lost of the fact that the changes which have been recorded onto LPIS in very significant numbers, both throughout last year and again this year, are necessitated by the need to have all ineligible areas mapped; simply put, the position on the ground in any given farm must be accurately reflected on LPIS.</P>
        <P>The tabular statements show the present payments position under both schemes at both National level and in respect of Tipperary applicants:</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 446 and 447 together. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The maintenance of the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is a complex matter. All issues relating to the digitising of land parcels and all other features has been carried out by an outside contractor since the system was established in Ireland shortly after the introduction of direct payments. The process also involves the review of aerial ortho-imagery and the resultant digitising of ineligible features. The database is also used for identification of special features, landscape features etc. The maps submitted by applicants are vitally important documents and it is important that they are not mislaid and are digitised. The changes illustrated in the maps must be accurately digitised onto the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System, which must be kept updated, and farmers paid accordingly. These direct payments amount to &euro;1.7 billion annually.</P>
        <P>Mallon Technology Ltd, Cookstown, Co. Tyrone, currently carries out, the digitising work.  This company has played a major role in assisting my Department meet very ambitious payment deadlines since the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme including advance pay<Col N="494"/>ments to the vast majority of farmers in each of the six years when such advance payment was approved by the EU Commission. Mallon Technology Ltd was selected following the conclusion of an open Invitation to Tender Procedure conducted in line with Public Procurement procedures. Tenders have been invited on a three yearly basis with provision for an annual review.  The next Invitation to Tender Procedure will take place in 2012.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied with the speed and efficiency of the work carried out on maps submitted by applicants under the Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and all of the other area-based Schemes and it is carried out with the essential accuracy required and as quickly as possible given the complexity involved.  Ireland is to the forefront in delivering these direct payments at the earliest dates possible under EU regulations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At present, there are over 1.25 million land parcels on the LPIS spatial database. In any one year, the number of parcels that are subjected to alteration generally exceeds 250,000 parcels. There are different requirements for each of the area-based schemes and these are subject to regular changes following amendments to EU Regulations and following the findings of EU auditors. In addition, the technical requirements are set-out by DG Agri and the European Commission&rsquo;s Joint Research Centre is also constantly updated and made more exacting. The quality of the digitising work carried out for my Department by the named company has never been called into question during any of those audits. It is important to note that digitising is a complicated process and requires specially trained staff with related skills to undertake the digitising of land parcels.</P>

	<P>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Almost every pre-school service in the State is participating in the programme ensuring that it is available to children in all areas, and 63,000 children, or 94% of the eligible age cohort, are currently availing of the pre-school year.  </P>
        <P>A capitation payment is provided under the ECCE programme to participating services for each eligible child enrolled for the free pre-school year.  The standard capitation rate is &euro;2,450 per annum and a higher capitation rate of &euro;2,850 per annum is payable to services with more qualified staff.  There are no changes to the capitation rates, and in 2011 the ECCE programme is expected to cost in the region of &euro;166 million.</P>
        <P>Services participating in the ECCE programme are required to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within the Siolta framework for early learning.  They are also encouraged to implement the Aistear curriculum which has been developed for children aged from birth to 6 years.  The ECCE programme is universally available, free of charge, to all pre-school children and I believe this is critical to ensuring equality of access and school readiness.</P>
        <P>My objective is to incrementally develop the ECCE programme over the term of this Government as resources permit.  A key element of this will be to support implementation of the Workforce Development Plan, by the Early Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills, which is co-located within my Department.  The Workforce Development Plan provides a framework for ensuring that personnel working in the ECCE sector have access <Col N="497"/>to accredited training, enabling quality and standards in ECCE services to be continuously improved.</P>
        <P>From May of this year, my Department has been working with two major voluntary childcare organisations to provide subsidised on-line accredited training courses to staff working within ECCE services.  I hope to continue this initiative in 2012, by supporting training modules which have a specific focus on educating children with special needs and children with literacy and numeracy difficulties.  In addition, I will be collaborating closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, in implementing the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy.  Early intervention is crucial and the Strategy provides for a range of actions to support pre-school children and their families, to be undertaken by my Department.</P>

	<P>There are 107 family resource centres throughout the country funded by the Family Support Agency.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit.  The programme emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.  In 2011, funding of &euro;15.897m has been provided to the Family Support Agency for the programme.</P>
        <P>The family resource centres provide a range of services for families and groups at local level.  These include information, education and training opportunities, childcare, breakfast, homework and after school clubs and youth work services.  The family resource centres have an important role to play, in harnessing local community efforts, in support of improved outcomes for children and young people which is a key objective of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Plans for the future development of the Family Resource Centre Programme will be formulated in the context of the arrangements for the new Child and Family Support Agency and in consultation with the Family Support Agency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Programme for Government 2011 states that the Referendum on Children&rsquo;s Rights is a priority, and that the wording of the proposed referendum will be along the lines of that proposed by the All Party Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  When the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children was established by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas in November 2007 it called for submissions from the public and interested groups.  Over 144 submissions were received and these submissions have gone to inform the work of the Committee.  The Committee listed the submissions it received in Appendix C of the Third Report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children which was published in February 2010.  The Committee also received further oral and written presentations during the course of its deliberations. </P>
        <P>   The Referendum on Children is far reaching in its scope.  Both my predecessor and I have, during the course of meetings on a variety of topics, discussed issues relating to the referendum with a wide range of individuals and groups.  Furthermore the issue has been referred to in the context of meetings and submissions on a wide range of issues not necessarily devoted to the issue of the referendum itself.  Therefore it would be difficult to provide an accurate figure of the number of submissions received, and from whom those submissions came.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to assure the Deputy that all submissions, whether specifically related to the proposed Referendum on Children or where issues arose in the context of discussions on other issues, will be taken into account in the ongoing deliberations on the Referendum.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 472 and 473 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy may be aware, there is currently no statutory, independent inspection system in place in relation to residential services for people with disabilities. The legislative framework for the regulation of these services is provided for by the Health Act 2007, which envisages a role for the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) in this regard.</P>
        <P>HIQA has prepared and published standards for this sector, which outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services.  They clearly set out what a quality safe residential service for people with disabilities should be and support the delivery of person-centred care in this sector.  The current Programme for Government includes a specific commitment to put these standards on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA.  As I announced on 16th June last, discussions have now begun between the Department of Health and HIQA to progress this commitment.  Given the complex nature of residential service provision for people with disabilities &mdash; ranging from congregated settings to dispersed housing in the community &mdash; careful consideration is being given to designing the most appropriate regulatory model and this work is ongoing.</P>
        <P>The lack of regulation of this sector is acknowledged as a matter of concern.  I am committed to addressing this issue and ensuring that vulnerable people with disabilities in residential services are safeguarded and protected, and that their quality of life is enhanced.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 475, 476, 492, 510 and 524 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, this Government has an ambitious programme of reform which includes institutional reforms and economic incentives which will make health care providers truly accountable for delivering patient centred care.  I can assure the Deputy that I have the commitment and determination to deliver this agenda.  I do not consider it acceptable that a patient should wait five days in an emergency department (ED) and in order to tackle unacceptably long waiting times in EDs I established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU).  The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  The SDU is focusing initially on EDs and is working to support hospitals in addressing excessive waiting times for admission to hospital.</P>
        <P>Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda is working across a number of levels to reduce the time patients wait on trolleys in the ED and the Clinical Director and Group General Manager are fully engaged with the SDU in this regard.  The SDU has visited emergency departments and conducted a data analysis. It has identified a number of hospitals providing unscheduled care that require support.  Eight of these hospitals require very high support including Our Lady of Lourdes Drogheda.  As part of the process of engagement with the SDU these hospitals have prepared plans setting out measures that could be taken quickly in the hospital and/or closely related community setting that would significantly relieve pressure on the ED by, for example, addressing delayed discharges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following consideration and as part of the overall process of SDU engagement the proposals put forward in relation to Our Lady of Lourdes Drogheda will be supported, with some short-term once off funding in the initial phase.  This funding support is subject to a number of conditions being met including satisfactory implementation of the Acute Medicine Programme.</P>
        <P>The particular incident raised by the Deputy related to a patient who presented to the Emergency Department of Our Lady Of Lourdes with symptoms unrelated to TB.  In all the patient spent five days in the Emergency Department.  During his time in the Emergency Department, the patient was given a chest x-ray and was found to have TB.  Following the discovery of TB appropriate isolation and treatment commenced.  During the period that the patient spent in the ED three patients were identified as potentially having had contact for more than 10 hours with the person concerned.  These patients have been contacted, counselled and offered testing for TB.  All staff with potential contact have been offered counselling and TB testing.  This HSE is satisfied that the incident has been appropriately handled from an infection control, and contact tracing point of view and it is very important that any public concern in this regard be allayed.</P><Col N="503"/>
        <P>Finally, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), as the Deputy will be aware, is currently engaged with Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in relation to the hospital&rsquo;s ED.  Under this arrangement HIQA may make impromptu visits to the hospital. The Authority recently made one such visit to the hospital. I also understand that a meeting was held with HIQA last month at which ED and other issues relating to Our Lady of Lourdes were discussed.</P>

        <Quest> further to his commitments of 21 July 2011 at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, if he will report on the independent review of the medical research into the recommended treatment times for medical emergencies; when the data referenced regarding cardiac treatment at acute hospitals will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The issues raised by the Deputy arose from a discussion at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children on 21 July 2011 in relation to the emergency service changes at Roscommon Hospital.  The HSE plan implementing the changes to the Emergency Department Service at Roscommon County Hospital came into effect in July.  The Urgent Care Centre now in place at Roscommon operates from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week and is provided by Non Consultant Hospital Doctors (NCHDs) with clinical governance provided by an Emergency Medicine Consultant at Galway.  In addition there is a Medical Assessment Unit at the Hospital and an out of hours GP service is in operation. An enhanced ambulance service has been put in place.</P>
        <P>The changes at Roscommon were necessitated by the serious patient safety concerns of the HSE and of the Health Information and Quality Authority in relation to the accident and emergency service at Roscommon following the publication of the Authority&rsquo;s Report on Mallow Hospital in April 2011.  This was compounded because of NCHD recruitment difficulties.  Roscommon County Hospital has a clear future and will continue to provide acute hospital care for the population of the Roscommon area.  It will do this as part of a wider network of acute hospitals across the Western area and it will be supported by the other hospitals in the region.</P>
        <P>While I indicated that I was open to discussing the issue of having evidence such as that referred to by the Deputy reviewed further I was also cognisant, in particular  that the independent statutory role of the Health Information and Quality Authority should not be undermined <Col N="507"/>in any way.  As Minister I have total confidence in the important work that HIQA performs as an independent statutory authority in the context of ensuring improvements in the quality and safety in health and social care.  Although I have doubts about the need for a review I am as I have indicated open to having a discussion with the Deputy in the matter.</P>
        <P>On the other issue raised by the Deputy I can confirm that the CMO&rsquo;s Office of my Department is finalising a report examining the potential of hospital discharge data in measuring the quality of health care.  This includes the measure of recorded 30 day in-hospital mortality rates following heart attack. It is expected that the report will be finalised and published in the near future.</P>

	<P>The Health Information and Quality Authority published &ldquo;Key Performance Indicators for Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Response Times and Quality Standards&rdquo; on 19 January 2011.  The Standards recommended that the National Ambulance Service collate information on response times for different types of emergency calls by different types of resources (i.e. first responder and conveying vehicle),  between January 2011 and June 2011 and January and December 2011 respectively.  This is with a view to establishing a baseline of performance, to inform the development of targets in those indicators where a target was yet to be set.  HIQA also recommended that response time performance for first responders to Clinical Status 1 (Echo and Delta) calls be published for July onwards, as targets had been published for these standards.  The HSE, HIQA and my Department have agreed that this data should be published through the HSE&rsquo;s Performance Monitoring Reporting system and the information has been published on the website: <i>www.hse.ie</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I can confirm that the Health Service Executive has identified Paediatric Rheumatology as a priority service for children&rsquo;s health services and has approved the recruitment of a new Paediatric Rheumatology Consultant for Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin.  The recruitment process for this new post is currently underway.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Paediatric Consultant post already in place in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, will shortly fall vacant due to maternity leave.  A locum position was recently advertised but unfortunately there were no applicants for the post.  The hospital has had discussions with the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street, to identify the level of support they can provide to ensure continued service delivery. As a result of these discussions arrangements are in place for provision of consultant cover.  The hospital is writing to the parents of patients with outpatient appointments to explain the arrangements being put in place.  In addition it is important to remember that the rest of the specialist rheumatology team, including the clinical nurse specialist, will continue to provide services and support, and an additional non-consultant hospital doctor with specialist interest in this area has been assigned to the unit for the duration of the maternity leave.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department has been in contact with the Health Service Executive to emphasise the need to ensure that this important service is maintained.</P>

	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals.  In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

	<P>In order to strengthen the performance of acute hospitals which perform crucial roles within our health service, the HSE has identified a need to have available from time to time Senior Executives, either team-based or individuals, on a short-term basis to strengthen executive teams; lead a project or programme; provide an injection of skills; or assist in the transformation agenda set by Government.</P>
        <P>In June 2011, the HSE invited tenders from potential service providers to compete for appointment to a four-year Framework Agreement for Personnel Placement and Supply Services.  Under the Framework Agreement, service providers can be asked to source and supply either senior interim managers or more long-term senior management candidates.  At present, the HSE is focusing on getting senior interim managers in place.</P>
        <P>Following a tender process, a Framework Agreement, involving five companies, was established in September 2011.  In October 2011, the five companies were invited to participate in a mini-competition to source and propose candidates for an Interim Management Support Structure for HSE West.  The competition has closed and the proposals are being evaluated.  As this process is still under way, it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further on it at this stage.</P>
        <P>Under these arrangements it is planned to recruit a Chief Executive Officer for the Galway University Hospitals Group.  It is also intended to strengthen management capacity in the HSE Mid-Western region by putting in place a similar Interim Management Support Structure.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that existing managers in these locations will benefit from a transfer of knowledge and skills while working alongside these senior interim managers resulting in the further development of the management and service delivery capability.  The information and consultation mechanism used in the context of the planned Interim Management Support Structure for HSE West was in line with the terms of the Public Service Agreement.  The HSE engaged with the relevant staff representative body at both a national and local level.</P>

	<P>In relation to the query on the funding for the Irish Family Planning Association clinic in Tallaght, as the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to a local service issue, I have referred it to the HSE for direct reply.</P>
        <P>In relation to contraceptive services in general, I assume that the Deputy is referring to Recommendation 105.58 of the interactive dialogue during Ireland&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review.  This recommendation, which enjoys the support of the Government, commits it to &ldquo;ensure the national availability and accessibility to contraceptive services and methods ... taking into account prevention of discrimination based on geographic, status, disability or migrant status&rdquo;.  The Government is indeed committed to ensuring that all women have access to information on fertility, contraception and sexual health matters as outlined in the <i>National Women&rsquo;s Strategy 2007-2016</i>.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A wide range of contraceptive medicinal products and devices is available to patients availing of the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme and Drug Payment Scheme.  Under the GMS scheme patients pay a 50c charge per item dispensed, subject to a maximum monthly expenditure per family of &euro;10.  Under the Drug Payment Scheme patients pay no more than &euro;120 per month on prescribed medical products and devices for themselves and their family.  All resi<Col N="512"/>dents of Ireland are eligible to hold either a medical card under the GMS scheme or a Drug Payment scheme card.</P>
        <P>In terms of availability, acceptability and accessibility, contraceptive medicinal products are widely prescribed by general practitioners and dispensed across the country in pharmacies.  Condoms can be purchased without a prescription or consultation with any health care personnel in a variety of settings, including pharmacies, stores, and entertainment venues.</P>
        <P>In relation to information, one of the specific priorities of the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme is to improve access to and information on contraception and contraceptive services &mdash; particularly for groups at risk of crisis pregnancy.  In school settings, relationship and sexuality education, including contraception, is an integral part of the social, personal and health education curriculum.</P>

	<P>Section 57 of the Health Act, 2004 transferred a number of statutory functions previously performed by Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al to the HSE with effect from 1st January 2005. These included regulating the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staff. This regulatory function covers all consultant appointments in the public health service including the HSE, voluntary hospitals and other agencies whether additional, replacement, temporary or locum and irrespective of the extent of the commitment involved or the source of funding of the appointment.</P>
        <P>In addition, a Consultants Applications Advisory Committee (CAAC) was established under the Consultants Contract 2008.  Membership of the CAAC includes senior HSE officials, medical consultants, representatives from patient advocacy groups, a voluntary hospital CEO and representatives of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation.  The purpose of the CAAC is to provide independent and objective advice to the HSE on applications and qualifications for consultant posts.</P><Col N="514"/>
        <P>The process for the approval of a consultant (additional or replacement) post involves the HSE&rsquo;s Consultant Appointment Unit undertaking assessment and processing of applications for consideration by the Consultant Applications Advisory Committee (CAAC).  The advice of the CAAC is submitted to the National Director of Human Resources, to whom responsibility for the regulation of consultant posts has been delegated by the CEO of the HSE. The Regional Director of Operations in submitting an application is confirming that funding is available for a post and this enables it to be considered for approval.  In the absence of confirmation of funding an application will not be considered for approval. When a decision is made to approve a post, a Letter of Approval is issued to the Office of the Regional Director of Operations.  The Letter of Approval includes details relating to the post, such as the title, sub-specialty (if any), location of sessions, and the requisite professional qualifications.</P>
        <P>Currently there are 2,503 approved consultant posts in the public health system.  The current consultant WTE (whole time equivalent) is 2,468.

        <P>Rather the focus is on improving services for those with prostate cancer, and in this regard, Rapid Access Prostate Cancer Diagnostic Clinics are now operational in six of the eight designated cancer centres.  Two further clinics are due to open later this year.  Patients who are judged to be at higher risk of prostate cancer, based on agreed high risk criteria, are fast-tracked directly to these clinics. These patients will have access to a multi-disciplinary specialist cancer consultation regarding appropriate management.

	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

	<P>The National Men&rsquo;s Health Policy was launched in 2008. It made 40 recommendations within the themes specified as follows.   Significant progress has been made in the case of 19 of the recommendations, partial implementation has occurred on 15, while no progress has been reported on 6.    Many of the recommendations are relevant to the whole population and therefore a population-based approach is being taken with regard to their implementation.  </P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Structures: This theme envisaged the development of structures for men&rsquo;s health &mdash; nationally and locally &mdash; to support and monitor implementation of policy; and in this regard the 2 recommendations under this theme have been largely implemented.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Research:   The 2 recommendations here sought to promote an increased focus on men&rsquo;s health research in Ireland.  The first recommendation on the establishment of a centre for research and development in men&rsquo;s health has been implemented and the implementation of the second recommendation on promoting research in the area is ongoing.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Health Promotion: In line with the 4 recommendations under this theme, the following programmes have taken place: A men&rsquo;s health information booklet was produced and a designated web-site developed. Working in partnership with An Post, a men&rsquo;s health booklet &ldquo;Male Minder&rdquo; was produced. Similar initiatives are underway with other employers. New drink-driving limits were recently introduced and my Department is finalising a National Substance Misuse Strategy, which will include measures on alcohol,  all of which will deter  risk-taking behaviour among men and indeed the general population.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Health and Social Services &mdash; including preventative health:   Measures to implement the recommendations under this theme include the development of specialised academic programmes on men&rsquo;s health, the development of a 2-day men&rsquo;s health train the trainers course and measures undertaken aimed at increasing men&rsquo;s participation in the education profession. The National Office for Suicide Prevention is working with other organisations with a view to increasing awareness of mental health. Preparations are continuing for the introduction of a national colorectal cancer screening programme in 2012, and services are being improved for those with prostate cancer with Rapid Access Prostate Cancer Diagnostic Clinics now operational in 6 of the 8 designated cancer centres.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Initiatives in the Home, in Schools and Colleges and in the Workplace:    A wide range of initiatives have been developed to implement the recommendations in these areas including programmes that encourage the development of healthy and positive life behaviours through SPHE, the establishment of links between the home and school <Col N="519"/>through the School Community Liaison Service, the back-to-education programme. A more population-based approach has been taken to the workplace recommendations, with measures taken to make the workplace safer and more family-friendly.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Initiatives Sport and Recreation:   Investment has enabled the increased use of community based resources.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs have an inclusive policy which aims to ensure that the voice of seldom heard young people is included both locally and nationally.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Community: Under this theme measures have been introduced to support men affected by long-term unemployment. A gender main-streaming group was established and men are represented.</P>

	<P>The Employment Control Framework for the health sector exempts certain grades and posts from the moratorium on recruitment, including counsellors.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this exemption, the HSE decided in July of this year to introduce a general recruitment pause to assist with addressing the serious budgetary overrun. This decision must be seen in the context of a possible full year deficit of over &euro;300 million (at its current rate of spending) and the need for the Executive to balance its budget by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>At present almost 40% of the population are covered by the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme.  Any person who is experiencing undue hardship in paying for a medical service may apply to the HSE for a medical card or a GP visit card.  The HSE, in assessing a person&rsquo;s means, takes into account expenditure by the applicant on medical services and medication.</P>
        <P>If the individual in question is experiencing undue hardship in paying for this particular service, it is open to her to submit an application to the HSE for consideration on a discretionary basis.  The Government is embarking on a major reform programme for the health system.  The aim is to deliver a single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance, which will ensure equal access to care based on need, not income.  A fundamental element in the reform process involves significant strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients.  The phased implementation programme will be overseen by both the Minister for Health and myself, as Minister of State for Primary Care.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 539 and 552 together.</P>
        <P>In May of this year the Minister for Health was made aware of a potentially serious shortfall in the 2011 subhead for Long-term Residential Care. In response, the Minister asked for a full examination of the funding situation, to be conducted by the Department of Health and the HSE.</P>
        <P>The examination identified a number of factors that are putting pressure on the overall budget for 2011. These include: an unexpected increase in the average length of stay for nursing home patients; a resultant higher net demand for nursing home places; and an increase in nursing home costs.</P>
        <P>The processing of approvals for financial support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme was suspended while the examination of funding was being carried out. However, the HSE has been issuing funding approvals again since 13 June.  The HSE is continuing to process applications within the funding limits available to the scheme and in accordance with the legislation.  Approvals are being issued to applicants in chronological order by date of determination. This ensures equity nationally. The HSE is operating a national placement list to facilitate this. There are approximately 800 people awaiting funding approval at present.</P>
        <P>Almost 25,200 applications have been received since the scheme commenced. At end-September there were approximately 3,000 applications in progress.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan 2011 sets a target of 4 weeks for complete applications to be processed. The HSE has indicated that this target is being met. However, a significant volume of applications are submitted without the necessary supporting documentation. This can create delays which are outside of the HSE&rsquo;s control.</P>

	<P>This commitment was clearly shown in the Programme for Government which provides that &euro;35 million will be ring-fenced annually from within the overall health budget to develop community mental health services and to ensure early access to more appropriate services for adults and children.  This is currently being considered as part of the Estimates process for 2012 and future years.   <i>A <Col N="523"/>Vision for Change</i> contains some 200 recommendations to be implemented over a 7-10 year timeframe.  While it is accepted that progress on implementation has been slower than originally anticipated, services in many parts of the country are pressing ahead with implementation which includes the phased closure of psychiatric hospitals<i>.</i>  Significant progress has been achieved to date including: shorter episodes of in-patient care, improved child and adolescent mental health services, fewer involuntary admissions and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery. It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that over time access to modern mental health services in the community will be significantly improved and my priority as Minister of State with responsibility for Mental Health will be to further advance the implementation of <i>A Vision for Change.  </i>I have asked the HSE to prepare an implementation plan, which will identify specific areas of <i>A Vision for Change </i>  that can be progressed over the next three years, with timelines, detailed costs, structures and identifiable person(s) responsible for driving the change including delivery on the commitments in our Programme for Government.  Issues related to staffing levels particularly in community mental health teams will be examined in this context. </P>
        <P Just="Left"><i>A Vision for Change </i>  also recognised that all citizens should be treated equally and that access to employment for people with mental health difficulties should be on the same basis as for any other citizen.  We are endeavouring, through housing, education and community based health care, to provide the environment in which employment opportunities can be availed of by all on an equal basis.</P>

	<P>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded under these grants is also a matter for the local authority.  With regard to additional funding for the repair of the road at Ballintlea, Ventry, Co. Kerry, all of the 2011 regional and local road grants <Col N="526"/>have now been fully allocated and there are no further funds available from which an additional allocation could be made.  It is however open to the council to prioritise this project and to include it among its applications for consideration for funding under the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme in 2012.</P>

	<P>Officials from my Department are continuing to work with the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland towards the longer term objective of introducing a mutual recognition of penalty points for driving offences.<i></i>  Unlike the bilateral arrangements between the UK and Ireland, under Article 15.4 of the 1998 EU Convention on driving disqualifications, that came into operation in January 2010, there is no agreed international framework dealing with the recognition of penalty points for driving offences. Accordingly, a significant volume of work will be required, including the provision of an appropriate framework of law and international agreement. </P>
        <P>It is intended that, initially, mutual recognition will be applied to a small number of penalty point offences.</P>

	<P>The primary function of a vehicle number plate is to provide a unique identifier to facilitate administration of vehicle regulation and enforcement. Section 131 of the Finance Act 1992 enables the Revenue Commissioners to assign vehicle identification marks (number plates) to vehicles registered in the State. There are no provisions which enable number plates, once assigned to be changed during the subsequent life of a vehicle.  </P>
        <P>The registration plate arrangements in the current system allows members of the public, car buyers and enforcement agencies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Customs and Excise authorities to readily identify a vehicle during its lifetime.  I have concerns that a move to a system where registration numbers may potentially change following each change of ownership, possibly as many as five to six occasions during the lifetime of a vehicle, could create confusion without providing any real benefits in fulfilling the primary objectives for which  registration plates were created. Indeed, such an approach would make it extremely difficult to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent number plate exchanges.</P>
        <P>In addition, any system where the registration number can be changed with frequency would require the use of an alternative identifier with greater permanency such as the vehicle chassis number (VIN) and this would not be satisfactory from a system transparency perspective. These difficulties are compounded by potential additional problems in the management of the national fleet and the identification of vehicles in connection with road traffic accidents and offences. Substantial monies are collected annually from tolling charges and road traffic penalties and permanent number plates associated with vehicles is an essential component to ensure that these systems are able to function. </P><Col N="527"/>
        <P>As such, unless it could be shown that significant revenues would accrue to the State from the introduction of such a system, I do not see the benefit of allowing inter-county changes of registration.</P>

        <P>Like all Government funded programmes, the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) is being considered in the context of the on-going central review of expenditure which is endeavouring to identify savings.  While no decisions have been taken in the matter, it might be noted that the Programme for Government acknowledges the importance of transport for rural communities and includes a commitment to &lsquo;maintain and extend the Rural Transport Programme with other local transport services as much as is practicable&rsquo;.  Work in that regard is proceeding with decisions on pilot projects yet to be made.</P>
        <P>I have received a copy of a recent Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP which I intend to publish later this year following consideration by Government. I will also publish a pilot study on local integrated transport services and both reports will be considered in plans for the future of the RTP.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 569 to 571, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">EU Regulations regarding motorcycle standards are under discussion in the EU at present. The Road Safety Authority (RSA) represents my Department at these discussions and I am informed that the proposals relate only to vehicle standards, not to the vehicle&rsquo;s use or the driver, and specify the standards to be applied to new motorcycles. The proposals present a legal framework for the type approval and increased market surveillance of mopeds, motorcycles and quads, which will replace and simplify the existing Framework Directive 2002/24/EC. The proposed Regulations are designed to improve the safety of those who belong to a vulnerable road user group and who account, proportionately, for the highest fatality and injury rates among all road users.</P>
        <P>Contrary to suggestions that have been made by various parties, the proposed Regulations do not provide for banning older motorcycles from urban areas or changes to driver licensing.</P>
        <P>The main elements of the proposed Regulations relate to mandatory anti-lock braking systems, prevention of tampering with the powertrain and automatic use of headlamp on. The Regulations are also designed to reduce vehicle emissions for these types of vehicles, which, statistics show, currently are not reducing in line with other road vehicles such as cars, buses and goods vehicles.</P>
        <P>The RSA recently published an information note on the proposals on its website, and invited feedback from stakeholders and the general public. I understand that feedback has been received to date from user groups, motorcycle companies and private individuals, and that the responses vary from full support of the proposals to strong objections, particularly in respect of vehicle modifications. Feedback had been requested by the 29th October last but  I am also informed that responses received after that date will be considered.</P>
        <P>Separately, the RSA&rsquo;s Motorcycle Safety Action Plan provides for the national compulsory wearing of high visibility vests by 2014.  This is based upon research into road traffic collisions involving motorcyclists.  It should be noted that the RSA already encourages the use of high visibility vests and offers them free of charge to motorcyclists.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Previous observation studies conducted by the RSA have reported high visibility clothing wearing rates of approximately 40% by motorcyclists in Ireland. The RSA is carrying out a follow-up study which is due to commence this month.  Once the data from this study are analysed the RSA will release its findings by the end of the year.</P><Col N="531"/>
        <P>In the event that there are high wearing rates by 2014, the Road Safety Authority  will then re-evaluate the need for compulsory wearing of high-visibility vests. </P>

        <Quest> the criteria issued to local authorities in respect of the national sustainable transport initiatives under which local authorities made applications from this fund; if he will outline for each local authority the list of applications submitted and the list of projects for which funding was granted; the amount of funding in each case; when further funding will be available; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative an additional &euro;20 million has been allocated to sustainable transport projects this year.   &euro;10 million was allocated by the NTA to projects in the Greater Dublin Area and in the regional cities. A further &euro;10 million of this funding was allocated by my Department to counties outside the Greater Dublin Area. The scheme is intended to support a switch to sustainable and active travel through the delivery of infrastructure projects and to provide employment in doing so.  </P>
        <P>The funding, available in 2011 only, was used to support labour intensive projects which aimed to address one or more objectives identified in the Smarter Travel policy, especially where such projects would support delivery of the Government&rsquo;s tourism strategy, encourage modal shift away from the car, improve economic competitiveness through reducing traffic congestion, enhance the urban environment for both locals and visitors, and improve safety and accessibility to transport.  </P>
        <P>As this is a one-off funding stream which is strictly limited to the current year,  projects were required to be capable of being completed and all funding drawn down by end November 2011 <Col N="532"/>without any possibility of carry forward of expenditure into 2012.  Another key criterion for projects selected under this initiative was that the prospective employment generation content of the projects submitted was identified.</P>
        <P>Details of all the proposals submitted by local authorities over the three rounds identifying those which received funding will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will recall that in 2008 my predecessor postponed until 2011 making a decision on the separation of Cork and Shannon airports as envisaged under the State Airports Act 2004. It thus falls on me now to consider the future of the airports. I have consulted Dublin, Cork and Shannon airport authorities on this question and their unanimous view is that there is no support for separation, as originally envisaged.</P>
        <P>However, it is clear that the present arrangement, in place since 2004, whereby Cork and Shannon have their own boards but have limited autonomy from the Dublin Airport Authority cannot continue indefinitely. Accordingly, following a tender process I have appointed Booz and Company, who are experts in aviation matters, to provide me with wide ranging advice on all possible options for the future ownership and operation of the airports so that I can propose informed recommendations to Government.      </P>
        <P>I have asked the consultants to consult as widely as possible with stakeholders in Cork and Shannon on sustainable options for the two airports. Their mandate is to report back to me by the end of this month and I hope to bring proposals to Government as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

	<P>Policy in relation to the regional harbours, operating under the Harbours Act 1946, published in the Government&rsquo;s Ports Policy Statement in 2005, is that the continued operation of these harbours under the outdated provisions of the Harbours Act 1946 is unsustainable on the grounds of good governance and that most of these harbours would best achieve their potential through their transfer to local authority ownership. </P>
        <P>The Department administers capital grant payments to these regional harbours in respect of priority remedial works to protect the fabric of the Harbours and to facilitate their transfer to local control.</P>

	<P>Regarding pleasure craft (including personal watercraft and fast powered craft) being operated in Irish waters, the requirements in relation to the wearing of personal flotation devices (PFD) are set out in the Pleasure Craft (Personal Flotation Devices and Operation) (Safety) Regulations 2005 [S.I. No. 921 of 2005]. Under the regulations, a person on a pleasure craft (other than a personal watercraft) of less than 7 metres length overall must wear a suitable PFD while on board an open craft or while on the deck of a decked craft, other than when the craft is made fast to the shore or at anchor.  A person must also wear a PFD while being towed by a pleasure craft (other than a personal watercraft) or on board a vessel or object of any kind which is being towed by the craft.</P>
        <P>A person on a pleasure craft (other than a personal watercraft) of any size who has not reached 16 years of age must wear a suitable PFD while on board an open craft or while on the deck of a decked craft, other than when the craft is made fast to the shore or at anchor. Every person on a personal watercraft must wear a PFD at all times while on board, or being towed in any manner by a personal watercraft. Exceptions arise where the pleasure craft is being used for rescue, emergency or law enforcement purposes, and for rowers in boats which are designed and specifically used for rowing in boat races or other events, as set out in the regulations. In addition, it is recommended that anyone using a boat alone should wear a PFD at all times regardless of weather conditions or the size of the craft.</P>
        <P>Regarding fishing vessels, the requirements in relation to the wearing of personal flotation devices (PFD) are set out in the Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations 2001 [S.I. No 586 of 2001]. Under the regulations, every fishing vessel shall carry a suitable personal flotation device for every person on board.  The personal flotation device shall be worn at all times by the crew of the fishing vessel, when on the exposed deck of the vessel, or, in the case of open un-decked vessels, on board the vessel, whether at sea, in harbour or coming to and from moorings.</P>
        <P>In relation to other types of commercial vessel including passenger ships or passenger boats, any requirements for the passengers or crew to wear PFDs will be stated on the vessel&rsquo;s safety certificate or licence.</P>
