	<P>Before I call the Taoiseach and proceed with the business of the House, I have some announcements to make.  For the information of the House, I received a letter of resignation from Deputy Se&aacute;n Ardagh on Friday 28 January 2011, as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the constituency of Dublin South Central.  In accordance with the provisions of Standing Order 169 the resignation took effect from that date.</P>

	<P>Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; inn&eacute;, n&iacute;l s&eacute; i gceist agam seasamh don D&aacute;il sa toghch&aacute;n at&aacute; ag teacht.  Is le meas agus le bu&iacute;ochas a sheasaim romhaibh inniu, le meas ar an obair a dh&eacute;antar sa D&aacute;il agus orthu si&uacute;d a dh&eacute;anann an obair sin agus le bu&iacute;ochas don taca&iacute;ocht agus cairdeas a tugadh dom le linn mo 27 bliain anseo.  Thosaigh m&eacute; sa D&aacute;il sa bhliain 1984, tar &eacute;is b&aacute;is m&rsquo;athair.  I rith an ama sin, rinne m&eacute; mo mh&iacute;le dh&iacute;cheall ar son phobal na t&iacute;re seo.  Ba mh&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir dom bheith i mo Theachta D&aacute;la ar dt&uacute;s, ansin i m&rsquo;Aire agus ar deireadh thiar mar Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>Fifty years ago, almost to the day, on 30 January 1961, President John F. Kennedy delivered his first state of the union message, noting that the members of the Congress were &ldquo;among [his] oldest friends, and this House is [his] oldest home.&rdquo;  These words resonate with me here today.  I have made many friends in this House and this Parliament and its traditions will always have my deepest respect.</P>
        <P>There are enduring friendships that go beyond politics and any debates or disagreements that we may have had about the issues of the day.  It was for that reason that I decided to come to the House so that the Thirtieth D&aacute;il should conclude in plenary assembly.  It has been a privilege to serve the people of Ireland in our Government.  In every Department that I have served, my overriding objective was to do my best by the Irish people.  Politics is public service and it is an honourable profession.  I say this with sincerity, conviction and from experience.  I have no time for the cynics who talk down or belittle people in public life.</P><Col N="926"/>
        <P>Members will be aware that I announced my decision yesterday not to contest the forthcoming election.  It has been my immense privilege to represent the people of Laois-Offaly in this House for the past 27 years.  I will be forever grateful for their loyalty and support during good days and bad in my political life.  I also want to express my gratitude on this, my last day here, to my late father, who gave me a great grounding in the values of community service and a love of politics.</P>
        <P>I entered this Parliament as a young man of 24.  I have been privileged to learn much since from many fine public representatives on all sides of this Chamber.  I know from those years of experience that the vast majority of the representatives in this House from all sides do their utmost to serve the best interests of the people honestly and unselfishly.</P>
        <P>The time is once again close at hand for the people to decide who to send here to represent them in the next D&aacute;il.  This election will define our economic future and decide whether Ireland moves forward from this recession, prolongs it or succumbs to it.  The choice, in many ways, is that fundamental.  I urge the people to examine the policies being advanced by each of the parties and to cast their vote accordingly.  This election should not be about personalities but serious debate, reflection and the solemn business of democracy.</P>
        <P>I hope that over the course of the campaign we will conduct a mature and responsible debate, where we show respect for each other and the democratic process.  All parties bear a responsibility to be honest with the people about the solutions proposed to continue on the path to recovery.  We all have a duty to give confidence to the people and not talk Ireland down for short-term political gain.  This is especially true as there are still plenty of reasons for confidence in Ireland&rsquo;s future, our potential and what we can achieve over coming years.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s economy retains very significant strengths.  We are the fifth best country in the world, as measured by the United Nations human development index, which ranks 169 nations in terms of health, education and income as a composite measure.  We have the highest proportion of graduates in the European Union among the 25 to 34 years age group.  Our exports are performing better than ever.  United States investment in Ireland is greater than what it has invested in Brazil, Russia, India and China combined.  Ireland&rsquo;s stock of direct inward investment is five times greater than the OECD average.  Our competitiveness has significantly improved and we have clusters of the world&rsquo;s leading international companies, including household names such as IBM, Google, e-Bay, Intel and Facebook.  Ireland is consistently in the world&rsquo;s top ten places in which to open, start and grow a business.  Our investment in science, technology and innovation is increasing productivity across the economy and in our own companies, helping to create the jobs of the future.  These are just a few reasons the real Irish economy, which is an open, flexible, trading economy, will prosper in future if responsible policies continue to be pursued.</P>
        <P>Peace on this island is another foundation on which we can and must build.  The achievement of peace in Ireland has always been a collective, cross-party endeavour in this House and we must continue to work collectively to protect it.  The institutions of the Good Friday Agreement established by all of the people of this island in 1998 are now working as people intended.  The successful conclusion of the Hillsborough Agreement on the devolution of policing and justice, which I was proud to play a part in negotiating, ably assisted on the Government side by Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s new party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, ensured that we will now see the longest ever unbroken period of power-sharing government in Northern Ireland when the Assembly elections are called in May this year.</P>
        <P>I have always said that the genius of the Good Friday Agreement is that we agreed as a people to go on a journey together without predetermining the destination in advance.  We <Col N="927"/>must continue to take this journey together in the new and renewed spirit of friendship, reconciliation and respect that is the essence of the Good Friday Agreement.  Imbued with that spirit, the forthcoming decade of centenary anniversaries will be a time of reflection and renewal across this island, not a time for dwelling on a divisive, internecine past but one for shaping a better future with deepening political co-operation across all major policy areas to our mutual benefit on this island.</P>
        <P>Today is not a day for me to list achievements or engage in contentious debate.  While the past two and a half years since I was elected Taoiseach have been a time of great trials and tests, we have worked hard to correct past failures and secure the future recovery of our country.  I know some of the decisions my Government had to take were not popular but they had to be taken.  In making judgment, people should remember that sometimes it is not just the content of a policy that defines a political decision but its context too.  More than anything, a political decision is defined by the motivation that inspired it.  Politics is about serving the interests of the people first and last.  That was my motivation starting out in public life and I stayed true to it right to the end.  In every decision I took as Taoiseach, I can honestly say the common good was my overriding concern and loyalty to this country and its people informed every choice I made.</P>
        <P>I wish to quote the wise words of a man I came to know through his friendship with my late uncle, an tAthair Andrew.  I refer to the poet and philosopher, John O&rsquo;Donohue, whose book, <i>Benedictus</i>, contains a poem called &ldquo;For a Leader&rdquo;.  I commend it to all in the House and particularly to those who will be in positions of leadership in the Thirty-first D&aacute;il:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">May you have the grace and wisdom to act kindly, learning to distinguish between what is personal and what is not.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">May you be hospitable to criticism.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">May you never put yourself at the centre of things.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">May you act not from arrogance but out of service.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">May you work on yourself, building up and refining the ways of your mind.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">May those who work for you know you see and respect them.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">May you learn to cultivate the art of presence in order to engage with those who meet you.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">May you have a mind that loves frontiers, so that you can evoke the bright fields that lie beyond the view of the regular eye.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">May you have good friends to mirror your blind spots.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">May leadership be for you a true adventure of growth.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">D&aacute; fhad &eacute; an l&aacute;, titeann an o&iacute;che.  I wish to inform the House, as a matter of courtesy, that I will proceed presently to &Aacute;ras an &Uacute;achtar&aacute;in to advise the President, pursuant to Article 13 of the Constitution, to dissolve D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and to summon the incoming D&aacute;il to meet at 12 midday on Wednesday, 9 March 2011.</P>
        <P>As we have witnessed on our television screens in recent weeks, there are people in many countries across the world who still fight for the opportunity to cast their ballot in a democratic election; so I hope the electorate will use the opportunity to cast their vote in the forthcoming general election here.</P><Col N="928"/>
        <P>I wish those Members of the House who are not seeking re-election a very happy and healthy future.  I wish all other Members well in their endeavours to return to this House.</P>
        <P>Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; libh go l&eacute;ir i bhur n-iarrachta&iacute;.  Agus duitse, a Cheann Comhairle, mo mheas agus mo bheannacht.  Mar fhocal scoir, &oacute; pheann Raifteir&iacute;, an file: &ldquo;Anois teacht an earraigh, beidh an l&aacute; ag dul chun s&iacute;neadh, &lsquo;s tar &eacute;is na f&eacute;ile Br&iacute;de, ard&oacute;idh m&eacute; mo sheol.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>Go raibh maith agat a Thaoisigh.  I now call on Deputy Enda Kenny.  I intend to call the Leaders of the various parties in the House for a brief comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad you are calling all the Leaders, a Cheann Comhairle.  It is important that they all contribute in a situation like this.  I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s confirmation that the people of Ireland will finally get to choose a new team and a new direction for our country to get Ireland working again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">T&aacute; a fhios ag gach duine, mar a d&uacute;irt an Taoiseach, gurb &eacute; seo L&aacute; Fh&eacute;ile Br&iacute;de.  Casann an taoide, casann an bhliain, tugtar isteach sp&eacute;is nua agus beatha nua.  Fine Gael wants to bring that same new hope, new possibility and new life to Government, to our people and to our country.</P>
        <P>On a personal level, I wish the Taoiseach, his wife Mary and daughters Sinead and Maedhbh, well as he retires from this House.  Last year, I sat beside little Maedhbh at the national celebration in Kilmainham.  When the Taoiseach came in with a guard of honour, I asked her: &ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo; and she said &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my Daddy&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach has one strong supporter there and rightly so.</P>
        <P>Despite strongly disagreeing with many Government policies that the Taoiseach and his party have pursued, I have no doubt about his integrity as a person or as a politician.</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom aont&uacute; leis an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt an Taoiseach faoi na Teachta&iacute; at&aacute; ag &eacute;ir&iacute; as an bpolait&iacute;ocht agus nach bhfuil ag seasamh don D&aacute;il ar&iacute;s.  Is d&oacute;cha gur f&iacute;or a r&aacute; gur rinne siad an rud is fearr d&oacute;ibh f&eacute;in, thar gach p&aacute;irt&iacute; polait&iacute;ochta, agus gur thug siad seirbh&iacute;s d&aacute; nd&aacute;ilcheantair.  The Taoiseach is retiring after leading what many people consider to have been the worst Government in living memory.  It displayed serious political misjudgment.  His colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il are required to be accountable for their collective governance of this country over the past 13 and a half years.  None of them will be able to dodge responsibility for driving Ireland into the arms of the IMF.</P>
        <P>I have listened to the people of this country over recent years.  I understand the depth of anger felt by people all over Ireland who have lost their jobs, their homes and their loved ones to emigration.  Their anger is real and proper, but it will not get Ireland working again.  In this election, we are offering them a chance to turn their anger into action.  We are asking them to work with us and vote for us because we have a plan to get Ireland working.  Our plan has been worked on for the past three years.  It is sensible, realistic and credible.  It will get people, systems and the Government working.</P>
        <P>Public Ireland is not working at the moment.  People in personal and private Ireland who are lucky enough to have jobs are working harder than ever.  They are putting in the grind and coming up with plans.  Our entrepreneurs have not run out of ideas.  They are full of ideas that are more brilliant than ever.  Our young people are more eager than ever to live and work in their own country.  The trouble is that at a time when Ministers have two or three jobs, the Government is not working.  The systems on which people depend are not working or are not working as well as they should in the interest of the people.  We will change that with our plan <Col N="929"/>to get Ireland working.  Our plan gives clarity, credibility and light to what will be a difficult journey to a better future ahead.</P>
        <P>The first important point is to protect and create jobs and opportunities.  That will give us the best chance to keep our best asset &mdash; our young people &mdash; at home.  We plan to create 20,000 new jobs a year over the next four years.  We will cut employers PRSI and create a welfare system that encourages work.  We will invest an extra &euro;7 billion, gathered from State pension funds and the sale of strategic State assets, in the development of critical infrastructure that will make our economy really competitive for the future.  In that way, by 2016 we will make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business.</P>
        <P>Second, we will introduce fairer budgets and keep taxes low.  We will fix Ireland&rsquo;s budget deficit by prioritising the cutting of waste over the raising of taxes.  I know that high taxes kill jobs.  We will keep taxes, particularly income taxes, down.  No country has ever taxed its way to economic recovery.</P>
        <P>Third, we will change and create a completely new health system.  As a result of the creation of the HSE by the former Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, each year &euro;17 billion is spent on a health system that does not work as it should.  That is going to stop.  Our fair care plan, which is modelled on the reformed and proven Dutch health service, will cut waiting lists and end apartheid in our health service.  With universal health insurance, we will offer equal access to everybody, for once and for all.  There will be more and better community care.  That will mean fewer hospital stays and fewer hospital patients, which, in turn, will lead to lower hospital costs for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Fourth, we will provide for smaller and better governance.  We will ensure the people&rsquo;s money is spent wisely on vital public services.  By streamlining systems, cutting red tape and abolishing quangos, we will reduce public service costs by &euro;5 billion.  In making that system more efficient, we will protect the essential services provided by teachers, nurses, doctors, garda&iacute; and local government workers.  Any redundancies in that package will be voluntary.</P>
        <P>Fifth, we will create a political system that achieves more and costs less, with the Government leading by example.  We will cut the number of politicians by over a third.  We will impose a ceiling on higher public service salaries.  We will introduce car-pooling for Ministers.  We will ensure proper accountability for decisions.  A single chamber parliamentary system with powerful D&aacute;il committees will hold Ministers to greater account.  Under our plan, when cuts are needed, they start at the top; when accountability is needed, it starts at the top.</P>

	<P>Where is the statesmanlike speech?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When sacrifice is needed, it starts at the top and not with the blind, the carers or the poor.  If people give us the most precious possessions they have &mdash; their trust and their votes &mdash; we will have a duty to respond in kind.  With our plan, we will replace old Government cynicism with new Government compassion, and old Government indifference with new Government insights.  We will replace the old dysfunction and disorder at the heart of Government with a Government that holds the hearts and the needs of the people within its own heart &mdash; a Government that will show understanding of the fragile and shattered lives of the many thousands of people out there for whom politics has not worked.  What people need is reassurance that politics can and does work.  What they need now is leadership, to point the direction to a new future with a higher quality of personal and working life.  I know I can offer them that.  What they do not want is more of the same clich&eacute;s, more of the banal, the reported and the tired.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be back to defend this, I am sure.</P>
        <P>That is why leadership in politics is now more critical than ever.  The fundamental job of a politician is to find solutions and make decisions in the best interests of the people.  I know what it takes to revive a disillusioned and demotivated political force and rebuild it to a point at which it can legitimately challenge for the trust of the people.  I know the grind and relentless commitment required to see it through.  That is why I will offer my party and myself to rebuild our country and provide a high-quality future for all our people.</P>
        <P>No incoming Government elected by the people has ever faced the scale of the economic challenge now facing our country.  We have strong and powerful friends in Europe and beyond, and we need them, but it is for us to face this crisis in the first instance.  Our time is analogous to that of the first Government of the State.  That Government built a new young country from the ruins of a country.  The next Government will have to build a new future from the ruins of our economy.</P>
        <P>My words to the Irish people are clear.  I am prepared to offer the people a strong, courageous and fair Government that will implement the proper plan to rectify our problems.  The people now have the influence and power to determine our country&rsquo;s future.  I am happy indeed for my party to put its plans before the people for them to decide upon.  I know I can deliver on what I say I will do, and I will ask for their mandate to deliver on our plan to get Ireland working.</P>
        <P>Maidir leis an rud a d&uacute;irt an Taoiseach faoi Raifteir&iacute; an file, ba cheart d&oacute; lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh le:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">&Oacute; chuir m&eacute; i mo cheann &eacute; n&iacute; stopfaidh me cho&iacute;che, Go seasfaidh m&eacute; th&iacute;os i l&aacute;r Chontae Mhaigh Eo.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the people will have their say in a general election which is long overdue. </P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has announced his retirement from politics.  I wish him, his wife, Mary and his family the very best for the future.  He and I have clashed in robust debate.  He has always stood by his position and I have stood by mine and now the time has come to put our case to the verdict of the people.  We have just over three weeks to decide the future of our country.</P>
        <P>From this point on, the future of Ireland lies in the hands of its people, all of us, together.  On polling day all of us are equal as voters, and each of us has an equal responsibility for the way we mark our ballot paper.  All of us, each and every voter together, have the opportunity now to decide the future of our country.  Ireland is a great country with a great future.  We have grave problems, but we especially should not doubt our capability.  Our abilities are far greater than our problems.</P>
        <P>We can and will get through this recession.  We can and will get the country on the road to recovery, creating jobs and forging opportunities for the future.  We can and we will change the way this country is run and fix the system that is broken.  Our country&rsquo;s best days are still to come.</P>
        <P>It is not enough to wish for a better future.  We must grasp it and work for it and on polling day we have to come together and decide on change.  That is what this election is all about, change for the future and for the kind of Ireland we want to rebuild now, not just for ourselves but for our children.  Change is nothing new for most people in Ireland today.  Most people have already had to change their lives out of necessity; the change from work to no work, change in living standards and changes in everyday living.</P><Col N="931"/>
        <P>Now we have to change our country and its politics and we have to do it together &mdash; to change from being the victims of change to being the drivers of change.  For the first time ever in the 90 year history of this State, we can elect a Government led by neither Fianna F&aacute;il nor Fine Gael.  For the first time people have a choice to elect a Government led by Labour.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This is not simply a choice of party label.  It is a choice about the future direction of our country.  This election is a three-way contest.  Those who want more of the same can vote for the Fianna F&aacute;il party that brought down the country, that tied the State to the sinking and stinking misfortunes of the banks and that sold us out in the deal with the EU and IMF.  People can, if they wish, choose a Government driven by the same old ideas that have already failed us.  It is clear that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are comfortable with each other&rsquo;s policies.  They both voted for the blanket bank guarantee. They are happy to embrace austerity &mdash; to line up behind the EU-IMF deal, whatever the cost in jobs.  It is clear that neither has any wish to break up the Celtic Tory consensus that has brought us to where we are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P Just="Left">Only Labour can lead that change.  I am talking about change of Government, and in the way it works and thinks, a change that brings the real concerns of the people to the heart of Government.  Labour will fight this election on three issues, jobs, reform, and fairness.  Throughout this crisis, Labour has insisted that jobs must be at the heart of what Government is doing.  Labour is the party of work, and a Labour-led Government will have jobs at the top of its agenda.  We will work to provide skills and work experience opportunities for those without work.  We will work to develop new opportunities through trade and innovation, finding new markets, and new goods and services to sell in them and promoting the knowledge economy.  We will work on the basis that every job counts.   Labour is the party of reform.  For generations, in and out of government, Labour has championed progressive change in Ireland.  Now, once again, we are determined to lead a new wave of change and to fix a broken system, a system that has failed the Irish people.  Labour is the party to reform politics because it has the best track record on reform.  Labour is the party to reform our public services because it believes in public services, respects public servants and has the plan to bring about reform.  Labour is the party of fairness.  We have led the way in showing how the two-tier health system is bad for all of us and how it can be fixed.   We have led the way in demanding fair taxation.   Alone among the political parties, we will make literacy, not just a policy objective but a national cause.  Labour&rsquo;s vision is the vision of one Ireland, where we are driven by what unites us, not what divides us.  Our country is too small, and our problems too great, to indulge in divisions, solo runs or sectional interests.  This is not a time for division or the politics of pitting one group of Irish people against another.  This is the moment when we must come together, and move forward together &mdash; le ch&eacute;ile.  Government is not a hospitality tent, roped off for VIPs.  Government is not a big house shielded from the people by high walls.  Government is not the business of the insiders, it is the business of us all.  It is time to roll up the tent and put the concerns of the people at the heart of Government.  That is what Labour is all about.  That is why Connolly and Larkin founded the Labour Party and now its time has come.  One Ireland, public sector and private sector, those with jobs and those looking for work, employers and employees, rural and urban, women and men, gay and straight.  Now is the time to pull down <Col N="932"/>the walls that stand between the people and their Government.  Now is the time for change.  Today, 1 February, let us leave our winter behind.  Anois teacht an earraigh.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join other speakers in wishing the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, the very best for the future.  I wish his wife Mary and his family all the best.  I also wish good health to him and all retiring Members.  Far too many Members are suffering from ill health and this is often overlooked.  The recognition the Taoiseach gave to politicians is one we all must face up to.  Politics have been denigrated for far too long.  Likewise, our civil servants have been denigrated and they have performed admirably.  I pay tribute to the civil servants in my former Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I thank the staff of the House, I thank the Ceann Comhairle and I wish all Members the very best for the future.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach said he did not want to talk about achievements and perhaps he was being modest.  That politics is defined by the economic crisis may mean we overlook these achievements.  I am very proud to have served in a Government that produced civil partnership.  Yesterday, a gay couple came up to me in Ranelagh and thanked me for it.  I am proud we delivered the legislation.  I am proud we delivered rigorous planning legislation for the first time.  We will not revert to the irresponsible over-zoning of land that led, in part, to the property bubble.  I am proud that we have financial reform at long last, with an independent Financial Regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield.  I am proud that we have a new Governor of the Central Bank, a person of independence, Professor Patrick Honohan.  These measures will make a difference.  I am proud that we have investment in renewable energy and insulation.  I am proud that we were part of a Government that produced real political reform.  We reduced the number of Ministers of State for the first time, where previously there were increases.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We reduced ministerial salaries.  We stopped ministerial pensions going to sitting Deputies.  We reduced expenses and the number of civil servants working in Ministers&rsquo; offices.  These are all necessary and such a programme of reform should continue.</P>
        <P>As we leave this House to participate in a general election, we must ask ourselves the fundamental question, &ldquo;What more must be done in terms of political reform?&rdquo;  It is clear that the political and electoral systems have not served the people of this country well.  Let us be honest, when we reflect that young people had to emigrate from this country in 1950s and in the 1980s when I myself had to leave, and now again when we see so many people facing the pain of unemployment and emigration, we must ask ourselves if the political institutions and our electoral system have served the people well and can we do better?  The answer, of course, is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  This time of crisis offers us an opportunity to debate these issues and in the electoral competition which will now take place we have such an opportunity.</P>
        <P>It is time for a new electoral system in this country, where we would have a reduced D&aacute;il of perhaps 120 Members, with 60 being elected from single seat constituencies and 60 being elected from what is called a &ldquo;list system&rdquo;.  That would be the best way froward.  It serves the people of other countries well and it would serve us well.  We could draw on a pool of expertise and we could have more women participating in politics.  That is the way forward.  It is the type of radical reform that is now required as we enter this election.  I hope&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, I welcome the dissolution of the D&aacute;il today.  It is long overdue.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh l&aacute;nscor na D&aacute;la seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar am agus t&aacute; s&eacute; in am don phobal anois cinneadh a dh&eacute;anamh faoi thodhcha&iacute; na t&iacute;re.</P>
        <P>All Deputies receive calls to their D&aacute;il offices from members of the public.  Often the callers are the old, sick and vulnerable.  Yesterday, my office received a call from an elderly man whose blind pension was cut in the budget.  He had one simple message: &ldquo;Give us a voice&rdquo;.  We all must listen to him and to countless others like him.</P>
        <P>On this day when the D&aacute;il is dissolved, the cut to the minimum wage comes into effect.  That is just one of the ways the least well off in society have been forced to pay for what I repeat are the disastrous decisions made by the outgoing Government.</P><Col N="935"/>
        <P>People are being impoverished so the Government can throw money into the banking black hole.  Some &euro;873 million was cut from social welfare in the recent budget,  yet only yesterday Anglo Irish Bank, the zombie bank that is being propped up with Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money, paid out &euro;750 million, which is almost as much, for a maturing bond, despite the fact that the debt is not covered by the State guarantee.</P>
        <P>We in Sinn F&eacute;in are proud of the part we have played in the 30th D&aacute;il in defending people&rsquo;s rights and in holding to account one of the worst Governments ever seen, not only in this country but anywhere.  Sinn F&eacute;in played a key role in finally removing this Government, through exposing the full extent of its contacts with Anglo Irish Bank executives.  We have stood firm against the consensus for cuts.  We have stood for the democratic rights of the people, including those in Donegal South-West, in which constituency we won the by-election.  The election of Deputy Pearse Doherty set in train the events that have resulted in the fall of this Government.</P>
        <P>We have stood against the IMF-EU deal.  I call on all parties in this general election to make clear to the European Union, the IMF and the wider international community that this deal is not acceptable, not affordable and ruinous to the Irish economy and the Irish people.  It was negotiated and imposed by a discredited Government and it must be set aside.  Any parties going before the electorate should make it clear that is their intent if they are to form a Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the start of the Thirtieth D&aacute;il, we stood against the Lisbon treaty and warned that it would reduce economic and political sovereignty.  We were proven right.  The &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; parties in this D&aacute;il urged people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for jobs.  Where are those jobs now? For so many of our young people, they are in Australia and other foreign locations.</P>
        <P>This general election will be about what we and the other parties stand for.  The most critical issue, on which I hope we are, at least, agreed, is employment.  We cannot protect and create jobs without strategic investment to develop infrastructure, foster enterprise and enhance public services.  Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward a plan to do that.</P>
        <P>We need to protect our public services.  They are the people&rsquo;s services &mdash; health, education and, for those dependent on them, social welfare supports.  All of these areas must be defended.  We need to stop the attacks on the incomes of families struggling to survive and we need political reform.  We need politics based on commitment, not careerism.  We need a vision and a strategy for an Ireland of equals and a united Ireland.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in in the days and weeks ahead will be setting out our proposals in detail and we look forward to the debates that will offer.  We are confident that we will return to the Thirty-first D&aacute;il with a greatly strengthened mandate to serve the Irish people.  More important, the Irish people need a new D&aacute;il that will put the people&rsquo;s interests first.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Gormley&rsquo;s contribution, in particular his closing remarks.  He has made a prediction regarding the formulation of Government and who the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste might be.  I have been listening carefully, not only this afternoon but for some considerable time, and I am not so sure his prediction is on solid ground.  As to the notion that we are facing Tweedledum and Tweedledumber, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, I thought that was what was going out the door today.</P>
        <P>At this juncture, I would be remiss if I did not extend my personal thanks and good wishes to my D&aacute;il colleague, Deputy Arthur Morgan, and thank him for his service and his years of colleagueship in this Chamber since 2002.  I wish Arthur and Marion health and happiness for all the years before them.  I take the opportunity sincerely to wish all retiring D&aacute;il Deputies the very best for their respective futures, too.</P><Col N="936"/>
        <P>I extend to the Taoiseach and his wife and children in these last moments of his holding that office my personal best wishes for the future that lies before you all.  Gach beannacht daoibh i gcona&iacute;.</P>
        <P>I will conclude with words from the Democratic Programme for the First D&aacute;il.  D&uacute;irt an Cl&aacute;r Oibre Poblacht&aacute;nach:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Is mian linn an ceart, an saoirse agus cothrom do ch&aacute;ch a bheith mar bhuntaca&iacute; rial&uacute; na t&iacute;re. . .</P>

	<P>Before I adjourn the Thirtieth D&aacute;il, I would like to say a few words.  As parliamentarians, we turn to the final arbiters, those who hold to themselves the right to designate the rulers of the State, namely, the people.</P>
        <P>Some of our number retired during this term, some passed on.  Let us remember them and the good work that they did in the service of our people.  Some here today have signalled their intention not to seek re-election.  I would like to pay tribute to you now and to thank you for your work, some spanning many, many years.  You can be proud of your achievements.</P>
        <P>To those who are seeking re-election, I wish you well.  You will bring to the rulers of this State your policies so that they may decide the national policy according to the requirements of the common good.  It is now for them to decide the path to be followed.  The D&aacute;il now stands adjourned.  T&aacute; an D&aacute;il ar athl&oacute;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Central Statistics Office (CSO) conducts three tourism surveys:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Country of Residence Survey (CRS)</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Passenger Card Inquiry (PCI) and</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Household Travel Survey (HTS).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The data collected is used to meet the national and EU requirements in compiling tourism statistics.</P>
        <P>The CSO estimates the number of overseas visitors to Ireland using passenger numbers supplied by the airport authorities and shipping companies combined with the large scale sample survey conducted in Irish airports and seaports.</P>
        <P>The Country of Residence Survey is a continuous sample survey which interviews incoming and departing passengers. This provides country of residence breakdowns for passengers, which are then applied to the total passenger numbers, giving estimates of overseas visitors to Ireland as well as Irish visits abroad.</P>
        <P>The Passenger Card Inquiry is also a sample survey of selected overseas flights and sailings. Data is collected from travellers through a self completion form. The journey purpose, nights spent away from home, expenditure and other trip details are collected from arriving and departing passengers.</P>
        <P>The Central Statistics Office estimates the number of overnight domestic trips in Ireland using the Household Travel survey. Households are sampled from the electoral register and the data is collected using a self completion postal form.</P><Col N="938"/>
        <P>Data on the purpose and destination of the journey, nights spent, expenditure and other trip details are collected. Data on cross border tourism to Ireland is not currently collected by the CSO.</P>
        <P>The most recently published figures for overseas visitors to Ireland from the CRS relate to quarter 3, 2010. The next release is scheduled for February 2011 and will contain data for October, November and December 2010 as well as 2010 annual data.  Journey purpose is important when determining whether a trip to or from Ireland qualifies as a tourism trip. A Visitor is defined as</P>
<P LI="1" el="5" FLI="0"><i>&lsquo;any person travelling to a place other than that of his/her usual environment for less than twelve months and whose</i> <i>main purpose is other than the exercise of an activity remunerated from within the place visited&rsquo;.</i></P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Where the purpose of journey of a trip can be determined to fall outside of the definition, these trips are then excluded from overall tourism estimates.</P>
        <P>The purpose of journey is also important for expenditure estimates. Trips for holiday and business purposes would often have a higher daily expenditure than trips spent visiting friends and relatives for example.</P>
        <P>Length of stay is closely correlated with purpose of visit and expenditure. For instance business trips often have a shorter average length of stay than holiday trips, while expenditure on trips is closely related to length of stay, with longer trips on average having a lower average daily spend.</P>
        <P>Tourism surveys are also conducted on behalf of F&aacute;ilte Ireland (FI). These include the survey of travellers (SOT), which collects additional detail from overseas visitors to Ireland to that collected in the CSO&rsquo;s PCI survey. FI&rsquo;s Hotel Survey collects information from accommodation establishments on bed nights sold and residency of guests.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that in the past three months my Department concluded two acquisitions in County Cork, the details of these sites are set out below.  Due to commercial sensitivities pertaining to <Col N="939"/>site acquisitions generally it is not the Department&rsquo;s policy to provide details of the purchase cost of sites so recently acquired.  The Deputy might also note that both schools were included in my recent announcement regarding my Department&rsquo;s school building work programme for 2011.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Department launched the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) initiative which brought together a range of programmes and supports aimed at tackling educational disadvantage in some 876 schools throughout the country. Through DEIS an additional&euro;40 million was provided bringing the allocation for disadvantage in schools to in excess of &euro;200 million. In light of this additional investment, a decision was taken in Budget 2009 to discontinue the Children at Risk Fund.</P>
        <P>The project to which the Deputy refers was among a number of projects evaluated by the Evaluation, Support and Research Unit in conjunction with the Inspectorate of the Regional Directorate of this Department in 2009, to assist in determining future funding arrangements and possible mainstreaming of appropriate projects or models of intervention.</P>
        <P>A final allocation of &euro;133,000 was made to this Project in December 2010 to support the project through 2011. A process has commenced to integrate the project with the Kilkenny City School Completion Programme Project. It is expected that the integration of the projects will ensure the efficient delivery of services to children most at risk in Kilkenny. The integration process will also identify any potential overlap or duplication of service.</P>
        <P>The School Completion Programme is a major component of DEIS, the Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. The Programme identifies and supports children who are at risk of early school leaving. The supports are provided through 124 local projects and include interventions on school attendance, literacy/numeracy, after school, homework, holiday time supports as well as social and sporting interventions.</P>
        <P>The National Coordination Team for the School Completion Programme has commenced work on the integration of both projects and a meeting with the project to which the Deputy has referred refers will be arranged shortly.</P>

	<P>Under the gross roll-up regime introduced in Finance Act 2000, investments in life assurance policies may accumulate without the imposition of tax.  However, an exit tax applies to the income or gains arising when a chargeable event occurs, such as the receipt of payments from, or the disposal of investments in a life policy, or the ending of each 8-year period following the acquisition of that policy (i.e. a deemed disposal).   The rate of exit tax applying depends on when the chargeable event, including a deemed disposal, occurs.  The exit tax up to 1 January 2009 was the standard rate of income tax (20%) plus 3% i.e. 23%, which increased to 26% (20% +6%) from January 2009 until 8 April 2009 when the rate was further increased to 28%.  The Finance Bill 2011 provides for a rate of 30% to apply from 1 January 2011.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is unclear from the documentation provided whether the policy in question was encashed before the first guarantee date of 22 February 2009.  However, the above information should be of assistance as regards the exit tax applying on any chargeable event arising.  The Revenue Commissioners have also advised that, on receipt of documentation issued by the insurance company outlining any tax deducted, further clarification will be provided.</P>

	<P>Section 23 of the Finance Bill 2011 as passed provides for the progressive restriction and eventual abolition of the use of accelerated capital allowances under the various property and area-based tax incentive schemes.  This includes the scheme for qualifying residential units associated with registered nursing homes.     At the time of the Budget last December I undertook to have an economic impact assessment carried out on the possible effects of this measure in advance of the final closing-off of all these reliefs by the end of 2014.  During the period between the Budget and the Finance Bill there was a significant level of concern expressed by individuals and groups, in particular regarding the downstream effects of the changes on the economy, and on employment.  In order to take due account of these concerns I proposed that the economic impact assessment should be undertaken in advance of the commencement of the provisions.  Thus, the restrictions in the Bill would now be commenced by Ministerial order not earlier than 60 days after the publication of the results of this economic impact assessment. </P><Col N="944"/>
        <P>It will be a matter for the Minister for Finance of the day to decide whether or not to commence these provisions in whole or in part in the light of the outcome of the impact assessment at that time.</P>

	<P>The previous Minister&rsquo;s offer in December 2010 to provide ex gratia payments was made in good faith with the knowledge that, if not taken up by survivors, the monies would have to revert to the Exchequer by the end of 2010.

The Minister informed the survivors&rsquo; representatives that acceptance of the offer would not preclude survivors from entering into negotiations with any future Government and would not affect any legal strategy they may wish to pursue.

	<P>I have responsibility for the implementation of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which was introduced in January 2010.</P>
        <P>The ECCE scheme is a universal scheme which provides children with a free pre-school year prior to commencing primary school.  There is no entitlement under the scheme to any additional provision.  The scheme does, however, include a number of provisions to take account of children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the scheme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the scheme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that the introduction of the scheme has raised a number of issues in relation to service provision and supports for children with special needs and the need to ensure a coherent approach across both specialist and mainstream settings.  While many children with special needs may require specialist services, others will benefit from attending mainstream services or a mixture of the two.  To achieve these outcomes, earlier this year this Office asked the Office of Disability and Mental Health to set up a Working Group to look at existing services and supports and the allocation of resources for pre-school children with special needs.  This Group is expected to report shortly following which the arrangements for children with special needs under the ECCE scheme will be further considered.</P>
        <P>In the meantime while the scheme as initiated does not provide for any additional provision for children with special needs, a limited number of children with severe disabilities who had availed of the scheme in the introductory short-year period of January to June 2010, were approved on an exceptional basis for re-entry to the scheme in September 2010, the first full year of the scheme.  Each request was examined taking account of the information provided in detailed assessment reports.  In the case referred to by the Deputy, the information provided to my Office did not confirm a diagnosis of severe disability for the child in question and re-entry to the scheme was not approved.</P>

	<P>I have responsibility for the implementation of the free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which was introduced in January 2010.  This is a universal scheme which provides children with a free preschool year prior to commencing primary school. </P>
        <P>Approximately 4,300 preschool services, 95% of those operating in the State, are participating in the ECCE scheme and 63,000 children, or 94% of the eligible cohort, are availing of the preschool year.  Services participating in the scheme are contracted by my Office to provide the preschool year in return for the payment of an annual capitation fee.  The capitation fee is paid to services on a term by term basis in respect of all eligible children enrolled with them at the start of that term.</P>
        <P>Children are normally enrolled for the preschool year in a service in September of each year and, in the vast majority of cases, will complete the year in that service.  However it is recognised that cases will arise where a parent will wish to move their child to another service, during the course of the year.  The scheme accommodates this as far as possible by allowing transfers between services to be made at the start of each term with a consequent transfer in capitation funding.  When account is taken of the fact that the services are required to employ specified numbers of qualified Preschool Leaders and Preschool Assistants, it is considered that this approach provides a reasonable balance for all parties.</P><Col N="949"/>
        <P>To apply for a transfer, the parent in question should request the preschool provider currently being attended to complete and submit a Transfer Form to the Child-care Directorate of my Office, at least three weeks before the end of this term and preferably by 4 March 2011.</P>

	<P>Four European Directives have been introduced since 2004 to ensure that Member States have in place standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components. This legislation ensures that the blood supply throughout Europe meets the standards specified. </P>
        <P>Blood requirements set out in EU Directives 2002/98/EC and 2004/33/EC relating to quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components and certain technical requirements are regulated under SI No. 360 of 2005 (Quality and Safety of Human Blood and Blood Components). These Regulations, which were transposed into Irish law in July 2005, designate the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) as the Competent Authority and require all blood establishments be authorised by the IMB and hospital blood banks to be accredited to ISO 15189 standard.</P>
        <P>EU Directive 2005/61/EC relating to human blood and blood component traceability requirements and notification of serious adverse reactions and events was transposed by SI No. 547 of 2006 and EU Directive 2005/62/EC regarding community standards and specifications relating to a quality system for blood establishments was transposed by SI No. 562 of 2006. The IMB has implemented the legislation and all blood establishments and blood banks comply with the requirements.</P>
        <P>The latest Commission report on the matter dated the 19 January 2010, reported a satisfactory implementation of Directive 2002/98/EC. Member States, including Ireland, had successfully designated and set up their competent authorities, as well as inspection systems, control measures and haemovigilance systems.</P><Col N="950"/>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I can advise the Deputy that the overriding concern in considering applications for temporary release is the safety of the public. The Criminal Justice Act, 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that the Minister may approve the temporary release of any sentenced prisoner, including prisoners of the nature described by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Temporary release arrangements, in accordance with the Criminal Justice Act 1960 as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003, can operate similar to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide.  They are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way.  The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned reintegration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service has also judiciously used temporary release as a means of reducing numbers in times of serious overcrowding.  Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender&rsquo;s Garda Station.  Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda&iacute;.</P>

	<P>There are no specific legislative regulations which apply to the use of batons by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receive training in the use of batons before issue.</P>
        <P>The use of force is regulated by common law and disparate statutory provisions.  At common law any person could use reasonable force in self defence, to effect an arrest or to prevent crime.  The Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 does not confer a power to use force but protects the user of force against criminal liability when reasonable force is used in certain circumstances, namely, self-defence, defence of property, to prevent crime or a breach of the peace and to effect a lawful arrest.</P>
        <P>There are internal Garda regulations governing the use of batons.  The regulations provide that care must be taken to avoid striking anyone deliberately on the head and that the legs and arms should be aimed at, these being parts of the body least likely to suffer serious injury.  They also provide that no more force is used than is necessary to secure the legal object to be achieved.  Garda regulations regarding the use of batons are not available to the public as they are internal operational policy documents.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 12th July, 2006, and was granted permission to remain, on student conditions, until 29th July, 2008. She was subsequently granted permission to remain in the State for a four month period to enable a prospective employer to apply for a Work Permit on her behalf. My Department&rsquo;s records indicate that an application for a Work Permit was lodged with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation but this application was refused. The person concerned was also refused permission by my Department to set up in business in the State.</P>
        <P>An application for permission to remain in the State based on her relationship with an Irish national was received from the person concerned on 7th June, 2010. However, this application was not supported by the necessary documentation and, as such, could not be approved. The <Col N="953"/>permission to remain granted to the person concerned expired on 26th February, 2010 and she has been illegally resident in the State since that date.</P>
        <P>Given that the person concerned had no legal basis to remain in the State beyond 26th February, 2010, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) she was notified, by letter dated 14th January, 2011, of the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her. Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The 15 working day period referred to in my Department&rsquo;s letter of 14th January, 2011 expires on 7th February, 2011. It is open to the person concerned, until that latter date, to submit any further representations she would wish to have considered before a final decision is made in her case. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.  In any event, the case of the person concerned will not be further processed until the 15 working day period referred to has elapsed.</P>

The position with regard to these reports is, as with any other person, that the individual in question, for so long as he may have been here, would have been completely subject to our laws.  Any person who may have information that the individual in any way contravened those laws should make that information available to the appropriate authorities.  Nevertheless, in view of the reports which <Col N="956"/>have appeared, a report has been sought by my Department from the Garda authorities in the matter. When that report is to hand I will consider whether, and what, further action may be necessary.</P>

	<P>Legislation covering the FIS scheme is contained in Part 6 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. </P>
        <P>Section 227 (a) provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;Family&rdquo; means:</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5" FLI="0">where that person is living with or wholly or mainly maintaining his or her spouse, that spouse, and a child or children</P>
  
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This definition only provides for payment of FIS where that person is considered to be part of a family, as defined. Specifically a separated person is required either to have a qualified child residing with him/her or to be <i>&ldquo;wholly or mainly maintaining his or her spouse&rdquo;, </i>  i.e. the adult with whom the child normally resides, to qualify as part of the family for FIS purposes.</P>
        <P>The person concerned applied for FIS in September 2010 and his application was refused as he was deemed not to be wholly maintaining his spouse with whom the children are resident.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was previously in receipt of FIS from September 2008 to September 2009 and was also separated at that time. While there has been no change in the legislation concerning separated couples and FIS, prior to June 2009 the practice was to pay FIS to separated parents who were maintaining their children only. As there was no legislative basis for this practice it was discontinued.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have no plans at present to initiate further research on the impact of the social welfare changes announced in Budget 2011. However, the leading independent economic and social research body in Ireland, the ESRI, has examined, in detail, the impact of tax and welfare changes in recent budgets.</P>
        <P>The Institute highlighted the necessity to get the facts right, so that debate can be based on solid evidence. Their analysis showed broadly similar percentage losses in incomes &mdash; between 2 and 3 per cent &mdash; across both low and high income groups as a consequence of the Budget 2011. When the changes introduced over the period 2009 to 2011 are examined, the ESRI concludes that these have been strongly progressive with reductions in top incomes of close to 10 per cent, middle incomes by about 5 per cent and the poorest groups by 2 to 3 per cent.</P>

	<P>The determination of a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is made in accordance with Section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Subsection (4) specifically directs the deciding officer to &ldquo;take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, including, in particular, the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(c) the nature and pattern of the person&rsquo;s employment;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(d) the person&rsquo;s main centre of interest, and</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These five specified factors have been derived from European Court of Justice case law which examined the concept of habitual residence in the context of social welfare benefits. The Department&rsquo;s guidelines go on to point out that &ldquo;No single factor is conclusive. The evidential weight to be attributed to each factor will depend on the circumstances of each case. It is necessary to weigh up all the information and balance the evidence for and against an applicant satisfying the habitual residence condition&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The current guidelines regarding determination of habitual residence address the issue of returning emigrants very specifically under the heading: Resuming previous residence.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;A person who had previously been habitually resident in the State or within the Common Travel Area and who moved to live and work in another country and then resumes his/her permanent residence in the State may be regarded as being habitually resident immediately on his/her return to the State.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In determining habitual residence in such cases the deciding officer should take account of:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />purpose of return e.g. expiry of foreign residence permit</P><Col N="964"/>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the applicant&rsquo;s stated intentions</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />verified arrangements which have been made in regard to returning on a long-term basis e.g. transfer of financial accounts and any other assets</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />length and continuity of the previous residence in the State</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the record of employment or self employment in another State and</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />whether s/he has maintained links with the previous residence and can be regarded as resuming his/her previous residence rather than starting a new period of residence.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The information sought from an applicant who has returned to the State will therefore include such elements as: how long they were previously resident here, why they left, how long they lived in various countries abroad and why they lived there, why they have returned, and whether they own property in Ireland or abroad.  It is generally found that this information is sufficient to enable the deciding officer to determine whether their present circumstances in Ireland indicate a temporary visit or habitual residence.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 191 together.</P>
        <P>Domiciliary Care Allowance was transferred to the Department from the HSE in 2009.  In that year 11 Domiciliary Care Allowance appeals were processed by the Appeals Office compared to 652 in 2010.   Each appeal is dealt with on its own merits after the Appeals Officer considers all the evidence and, consequently, the Social Welfare Appeals Office is not in a position to advance reasons why the rates for successful appeals rise or fall by comparison of one year with another.</P>
        <P>Overall, the annual intake of appeals has increased from 14,070 in 2007 to 32,432 in 2010, an increase of 18,362 (130.5%) and this has impacted on the length of time to process appeals.   In recognition of these increases, a number of initiatives have been introduced which, while not eliminating the time lags, have significantly increased the number of cases finalised in 2010 (28,166) in comparison to those finalised in 2009 (17,787).  Of these cases, 17,499 were decided by Appeals Officers in 2010, as opposed to 10,027 in 2009.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 facilitated the use of experienced retired former Appeals Officers, on a strictly temporary basis to assist in reducing the backlog of Social Welfare Appeals cases.</P><Col N="965"/>
        <P Just="Left">In conjunction with the provision of extra staff, more emphasis is now placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis so as to increase productivity.  As a result, the number of appeals dealt with by Appeals Officers by way of oral hearing was reduced from 59% in 2009 to 31.5% in 2010.</P>
        <P>A project to improve the business processes in the office was also undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented and significant enhancements have been made to the office&rsquo;s IT and phone systems.</P>
        <P>I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</P>

        <P>Within the current budgetary constraints, the number of places on CE was increased to 23,300 in 2010.

In delivering these places, F&Aacute;S will continue to operate flexibly in the management of this allocation in order to maximise progression to the labour market, while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is very mindful of the impact of price rises in any area but particularly where essential goods and services are concerned.  As the Deputy will appreciate it is not feasible to have the social welfare system respond when prices of particular goods increase, as it is necessary to consider the adequacy of payments in the aggregate.   In that regard, I would like to point out that the annual average rate of inflation for 2010 per the CSO was negative (-1%).  While there have been some increases in inflation in recent months, consumer prices are back at April 2007 levels.  After Budget 2011, most working age rates of payment to those aged between 25 and 66 will be &euro;2.20 higher than in 2007.   </P>
        <P>I would also like to point out that with regard to persons in receipt of household benefits, the electricity allowance is based on units of electricity and not cost and accordingly these people are protected from increased prices for a portion of their usage.</P>
        <P>Over the period from 2004 to 2011, the weekly rates of social welfare payments have increased significantly, as follows;</P><Col N="966"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (aged under 66) has increased by 46.1%.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, Disability Allowance and One Parent Family Payment have increased by 39.5%.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />State Pension Contributory has increased by 37.7%.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />State Pension Non Contributory has increased by 42.2%.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Over the same period, the cost of living has increased by just under 12%.</P>
        <P>This data includes the impact of the reductions in certain payments in the last two budgets. I fully appreciate the changes made are not easy for those affected but believe that if the Government had not taken the steps to reduce overall public expenditure and restore stability to the public finances, we would have run the risk of making the economic and social situation far worse for everyone, including welfare recipients.</P>

	<P>Eligibility for Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is not based primarily on the impairment or disease, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating a degree of substantial extra care and attention. Children with ADHD, or any other condition, do not automatically qualify for a payment under the scheme. Every application is assessed by one of the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors and an individual medical opinion, based on the information submitted by the applicant in support of the claim, is offered in each case. The deciding officer then makes a decision having considered the medical opinion provided and all the other information available.</P>
        <P>In the case in question an application for DCA was refused on the grounds that the child did not satisfy the medical criteria for the scheme. The case was subsequently reviewed by a different medical assessor who supported this opinion.</P>

	<P>In order to clarify the matter for the Deputy, as outlined in responses to Question No. 228 of 4 November 2010 and Question No. 82 of 8 December 2010, it is the overall design and construction of the Corrib Gas terminal that is based on best international engineering practice for gas processing terminals.  Notwithstanding the fact that the terminal is designed to ensure against <Col N="968"/>a leak of gas, the developer has proposed that detection systems are installed.  The proposed systems are standard and involve proven fire and gas detection systems.</P>

	<P>The allocation of specific numbers in the 116 number range of numbers, which are reserved for services of social value, is managed in Ireland by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  In July 2007 ComReg published the range of numbers and the services for which they are available.  In November 2007 ComReg advertised the existence of the range of numbers beginning with 116.  116000 is reserved as a &ldquo;hotline&rdquo; for missing children.  The November 2007 advertisement invited suitable applicants to apply for the setting up of services.  I am advised by ComReg that no organisation has yet applied for the missing children hotline number 116000.  It is important to note that while ComReg has a role, as outlined above, I have no function in the provision of such services of social value.</P>

The Enterprise Ireland and CEB portfolios of indigenous client companies are, of their nature, not very mobile, however, Enterprise Ireland has a remit for visiting itineraries for the food and natural resources sectors.  In 2009, Enterprise Ireland facilitated one site visit to Co. Louth by a company in the food sector.  This company made a decision in 2010 to open a production facility on the Finnabair Business Park, Dundalk.  In 2010, the agency facilitated a site visit from an Irish company that wished to expand.  The company was shown buildings in Cavan, Drogheda and Dundalk but has not yet made a decision as to its preferred location.  In 2010, the agency facilitated a food company interested in locating to Co. Louth.  The company was shown sites and buildings in Drogheda and Dundalk, and is expected to make a decision this month regarding its preferred location.</P>

	<P>My Department processes applications in respect of the different types of employment permits &mdash; Green Cards Permits, Work Permits, Spousal/Dependant Permits and Intra-company Transfer Permits.  All applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the Employment Permits Section wrote to the applicant on 27th January 2011 requesting some additional information in relation to this case.  On receipt of that information a decision will be made on this application.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> if he will ensure that the allowance paid to Permanent Defence Force cadre staff in respect of working in conjunction with the Reserve Defence Force will not be abolished in view of the financial hardship this will cause to many members; if he will ensure that the allowance is retained in view of the fact that it has been in existence for over 40 years; the future plans for the RDF should this allowance be abolished; if the RDF will also be abolished; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The allowance referred to in this question is a matter subject to litigation in the High Court. In those circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to comment on that portion of the question.    A Value for Money review of the reserve is presently underway.  It is expected that the findings of the review will contribute to the development of future plans for the reserve.</P>
