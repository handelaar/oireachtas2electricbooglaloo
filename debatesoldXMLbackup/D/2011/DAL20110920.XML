      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 54 together.</P>
        <P>The latest available figures show that Garda strength stands at just over 14,100, with approximately 2,000 civilian support staff.  There are also 819 members of the Garda Reserve.  As of Friday, 16 September 2011, some 380 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had left or declared their intention to leave the force in 2011.  As members intending to retire must give three months&rsquo; notice, we will know the final figure for this year&rsquo;s retirements by the end of this month.  Similarly, retirements to be taken before the end of February 2012 when pension entitlements will change, should be known by the end of November.  Generally, members of the Garda who have reached 50 years of age and have at least 30 years of service are eligible to retire on a full pension.  Some 1,200 members of the force currently fall into this category.</P>
        <P>While we do not know yet how many Garda members will retire this year, and while no one expects every member who is eligible to retire to do so, it clearly makes sense for the Garda Commissioner to make contingency plans for the maintenance of policing services in the context of reduced Garda numbers.  We have to remember that, under plans agreed by the previous <Col N="702"/>Government as part of its compliance with the terms of the EU-IMF agreement, Garda numbers are due to be reduced to 13,000 by 2014 &mdash; they were expect to be reduced to 13,500 by the end of this year.  As part of this process, the Commissioner will, of course, have to examine every option for increased efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of services.  An example of this is the work currently under way under the Croke Park agreement to agree new Garda rosters to better match Garda deployment with peak policing demands.</P>
        <P>Clearly, an examination of the opening hours and in some cases the viability of Garda stations will form part of this.  The issue of the closure of some Garda stations will be a question the Garda Commissioner will have to consider as an operational matter, and it is part of the process.  He may also have to consider in appropriate cases whether a better policing service could be delivered to a local community by having garda&iacute; out on patrol instead of in a station.</P>
        <P>I look forward to receiving the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals, which will be aimed at maximising the efficiency of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and prioritising the resources available to operational front-line policing services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his reply.  I accept that it was a decision of the previous Government to agree to the reduction of the targets but that was done on the basis of record investment in Garda numbers by that Government over a long number of years, and that was the reason there are 14,100 today.  During the 1980s when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was Minister for Justice, and during the 1990s when the former Deputy, Nora Owen, was Minister, Garda stations were kept open with a force that was considerably lower than even 13,000, which is where we will end up.  I regret that the Minister cannot give us a guarantee that there will be no closures.</P>
        <P>There were reports in yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers that in Donegal alone, 24 stations will close and Deputy McConalogue&rsquo;s constituents want to know what will happen to them.  How can the Minister state that the closure of 24 stations in one county will make for more efficient policing?  Is he expecting the garda&iacute; in the 24 stations to spend all of their time on patrol?  If they do, they will be running into each other often, not catching crime.  The most important deterrent is, I agree, the availability of garda&iacute;, but it is also the visibility of garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister &mdash; I do not expect him to release the report because I understand that involves operational issues &mdash; met with the AGSI or the GRA on this proposal?  Can he give us the broad outlines, without naming specific stations, on a county-by-county basis as to where these stations have been identified or will close?  Does he intend to seek the input of, or some feedback from, the Oireachtas on the Commissioner&rsquo;s report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It is extraordinarily difficult to take the Deputy&rsquo;s questions seriously as he was in this House supporting a Government which signed an agreement to reduce the then Garda numbers of 14,500 to 13,500.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should answer the questions.  He is the one who said the criminals would celebrate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It was also the Deputy&rsquo;s party which, in dealing with the Estimates and the finances for 2011, provided funding to the Department to pay the salaries of 13,500 garda&iacute; as opposed to the 14,500 that were in place.  It was the Deputy&rsquo;s party which entered into an agreement with the IMF and the EU to reduce dramatically by 1,000 the numbers of garda&iacute; this year in circumstances in which they had no idea how they could achieve it, there was no scheme in place to facilitate that, and as a consequence, no planning of any nature took place.</P><Col N="703"/>
        <P>What has happened under my watch is that the Garda Commissioner has conducted a comprehensive review of the manner in which funding is being applied, looking at the maximum efficiencies that can be put in place to guarantee front-line services and to meet community needs.  No decisions, I emphasise, have yet been made on the closure of Garda stations or, indeed, the curtailing of hours.  What the Garda Commissioner is wisely doing is looking at stations right across the country to ascertain whether there are efficiencies that could be put in place which will ensure that trained garda&iacute; are used to the best possible advantage and whether there are savings that can be made, for example, in circumstances in which it may be appropriate that stations close at 9 o&rsquo;clock or 10 o&rsquo;clock at night instead of staying open all night, in circumstances where patrol cars would still be available and where, if there is an emergency, the garda&iacute; would be accessible on a 999 call.  The stations to which the Deputy is referring are part and parcel of the review.  No decision has been made to close 24 stations in County Donegal.  This is alarmist talk&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>He is being alarmist.  He wrote the book on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a tough start to a tough week for the Minister.  While we do not yet have a final figure for the number of proposed retirements from the Garda, we know it will include some chief superintendents and probably superintendents.  I realise that earlier this year the Minister gave permission to the Garda Commissioner to run what are known as promotion competitions in all ranks within the force.  As a result of these competitions, panels were to be established from which future promotions might be made.  It is my understanding that to make any promotions the Minister needs permission to break the ban on promotions within the Garda.  Has he held any conversations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on lifting the bank on promotions within the Garda and, if so, what was their outcome?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I will give the Deputy some statistics in which he might be interested.  To date, 28 garda&iacute; at the rank of superintendent or higher have retired or notified their intention to retire in 2011.  The Government has made six appointments to superintendent or a higher level since it took office.  Additional appointments at these levels will be considered when the situation becomes clearer during the coming weeks on where matters stand with regard to retirements.  As I have noted, a member of the force who has completed 30 years service and is over the age of 50 years may retire.  It is stated in the Garda code that a member must give the Commissioner three months&rsquo; notice of his or her intention to retire.  Therefore, it is not possible at this stage to know what the full picture will be as we move towards the end of this year or head into February.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the level of senior positions, after discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I obtained sanction for the filling of the six Garda posts mentioned.  On 22 March the Government appointed one deputy Commissioner, one assistant Commissioner, one chief superintendent and three superintendents.  While the moratorium on <Col N="704"/>recruitment and promotions in the public service continues to apply to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the situation will be continually kept under review by the Garda Commissioner and further derogations will only be sought when deemed necessary, but the Deputy can be absolutely assured that when we have a clear view of the numbers who will retire, there will be discussions between me and the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on the appropriate and necessary arrangements to ensure we will have in place an appropriate number of garda&iacute; at senior level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>At the end of November the Minister will be in a position to know the full numbers of garda&iacute; retiring by the end of February.   When does he envisage the Commissioner will be in a position to advise on potential closures or the reorganisation of the force?  Will it be in the new year or before then?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, the review the Commissioner is undertaking should be complete within the coming weeks.  I expect to be engaged in a conversation with him arising from that review.  Of course, there will be operational decisions for the Commissioner to make.  In the context of my involvement as Minister for Justice and Equality, it is my obligation to ensure we have at senior level the appropriate and necessary number of garda&iacute; to fulfil fully the necessary tasks that fall on the shoulders of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I have every confidence we will be in a position to do so.  I remind the Deputy that in 2009 under the previous Government more than 700 members of the force retired in one year.  The garda&iacute; have not been found in any way wanting in their capacity to undertake the work in which they have been engaged since.</P>

        <asker> Deputy Catherine Murphy</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice and Equality</askee>
        <Quest> if he considers it necessary to amend the combined terms of section 19 and the Schedule to the Criminal Justice Act 2011 whereby all thefts, as opposed to those in the area of white collar crime, appear to be criminalised by section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001; his views that a change is necessary; the options available to make that change; the way he plans to proceed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24998/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The main purpose of the Criminal Justice Act 2011, as I stated in the D&aacute;il when the legislation was being enacted, is to facilitate the more effective investigation of white collar crime and to reduce associated delays.  The Act is targeted at specified serious and complex offences attracting a penalty of at least five years imprisonment, including offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud, corruption, competition, consumer protection and cyber-crime.  These offences are listed in Schedule 1 to the Act.  The Act also provides that further offences can be specified as relevant offences by ministerial order.</P>
        <P>Section 19 of the Act provides for the offence of withholding information.  The offence will apply to a person who has information which he or she knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission of a relevant offence or in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for such an offence.  A person who fails without reasonable excuse to disclose such information as soon as practicable to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be guilty of an offence.  The offence is punishable by an unlimited fine and imprisonment for up to five years or both.</P>
        <P>I accept that the offence of theft under section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 can be very simple and its investigation may not need the usage of the <Col N="705"/>powers in the Criminal Justice Act 2011.  I do not envisage that these powers will be required in simple cases prosecuted in the District Court.</P>
        <P>Theft can also be complicated, however, and my advice from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with regard to the offence of theft is that in some cases theft investigations can be very complex.  There may be cases where prosecutions may involve multiple allegations of offences, which can include both theft and fraud.  In those circumstances, it is appropriate that the powers under the Criminal Justice Act 2011 are available.  It is in the public interest that they be available to the Garda so there is no artificial difficulty where the investigation involves multiple offences and where these powers are utilised.  It was necessary to take an all-embracing approach to theft and fraud offences in the 2011 Act to ensure that the Act did not create an artificial barrier to an appropriate prosecution being taken on a future occasion.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the section 19 offence, investigations and prosecutions under this section will be subject to the exercise of discretion in the usual way by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to the appropriateness of such investigation and prosecution.  In addition, an important safeguard in regard to section 19 is that a direction by the Director of Public Prosecutions will be required before a prosecution under that section can proceed.  This is the same situation as exists in regard to the similar offence of withholding information under section 9 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 where the power to prosecute under that provision is cautiously used.</P>
        <P>I have no proposals to amend the 2011 Act at this time, particularly when the Act is still at such an early stage of its operation.  I will, of course, keep its operation under review.</P>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>What prompted me to put down this question was an article written by the former Attorney General and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, who is not somebody I would normally quote.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Shatter, saw the article.  Mr. McDowell made some very relevant points, in particular that the offence will clearly apply to all thefts, which, if it is the case, would be a very unintended consequence.</P>
        <P>The Bill generally is one which most people, myself included, support.  Did the Minister consider the particular aspect of a wider application of the reporting of theft than was in fact intended?  What kind of advice did he get when he was putting together the legislation?  If it is a question that it applies much more broadly, then, as Mr. McDowell stated in the article, we could end up with a lot of case law which will possibly have a different result than was intended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am aware of the article to which the Deputy refers.  It is worth stating that in regard to the section 19 offence and the Act in general, investigations and prosecutions will be subject to the exercise of discretion in the usual way by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to the appropriateness of such investigation and prosecution.  In addition, an important safeguard in regard to the usage of the Act in section 19 in particular is that a direction by the Director of Public Prosecutions will be required before a prosecution under that section can proceed.  This is the same situation as exists in regard to the similar offence of withholding information under section 9 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 where the power to prosecute under that provision is used only occasionally and where required.</P>
        <P>I believe the manner in which we dealt with the provisions in this Act and the extensive application open to it in regard to serious offences is of considerable importance.  In the context of dealing with illegal conduct of a criminal nature in the area of what may be either fraud or theft &mdash; there can be a crossover of the boundaries between the two &mdash; unnecessary difficulties <Col N="706"/>could arise both in the conduct of an investigation and in gaining access to important documentation and information, had theft been excluded from the ambit of the Act.  I am satisfied it was necessary to include it and it was the wish of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it be included.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Were this provision to be used in a wider context than was intended, with what mechanism or how quickly would the Minister revisit it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not expect it to be used in a wider context.  I certainly do not expect it to be a section that will be utilised in the context of a simple theft case which gives rise to a possible prosecution in the District Court.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice and Equality</askee>
        <Quest>  his views on discussions his officials have had with the Law Society in relation to fees for the criminal legal aid system; the contingency plans in the event of withdrawal of services by participating barristers and solicitors in the scheme; if he will provide information on any other matter pertaining to this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[24997/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the context for many of the difficult decisions &mdash; I am sorry I must again remind him of this &mdash; which have had to be taken is the obligation to meet the commitments in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 and to meet our obligations to contain public expenditure, as agreed with the IMF and the European Union and as agreed by the previous Government.  Expenditure on criminal legal aid totalled &euro;56 million in 2010 and the plan includes a specific commitment to reduce expenditure to yield savings of &euro;5 million in 2011 and &euro;10 million in a full year.  These targets were agreed by the previous Government prior to the December 2010 budget announcement.  This has meant some hard decisions and regrettably, to try to achieve the targeted reduction of &euro;5 million in the current year, it has been necessary to introduce further reductions to the fees and rates paid under the criminal legal aid scheme.  Therefore, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, I introduced an order with effect from 13 July 2011 imposing a reduction of 10% in the fees payable in the District Court.  The fees payable in the Circuit and higher courts also will be decreased by 10% and the order necessary to effect the reduction is being drafted and will come into force within a number of weeks.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the impact on the legal profession of these most recent reductions coming on top of previous cuts and have been concerned to ensure that legal representation can continue to be provided to those who require it.  While I am aware of recent media reports, I can state categorically that no practitioner has contacted either me or my Department to threaten the withdrawal of services.  I personally met representatives of the Law Society in July and more recently a meeting was arranged with officials.  I understand that, while articulating the deep concern among practitioners regarding the level of the cuts and the financial implications for firms and their employees, the delegation did not suggest to my officials that they intended to withdraw their services.  Indeed, they indicated they wish to consult more closely with my Department and to assist in the ongoing efforts to reduce costs by contributing to the work of the task force I have established which at present is examining the structures and systems of the courts with a view to achieving potential cost savings in the medium to long term.  A further meeting was held earlier this week in this regard.  I greatly appreciate this positive engagement and hope that in consequence, important cost saving reforms will follow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the engagement that has been announced and note the Minister outlined the membership of that task force and when he expects a report.  He some<Col N="707"/>times reminds me of a disc jockey from the 1980s who continually plays the same record, thereby keeping happy the fan base.  There have been reports from an organisation called the Criminal Law Practitioners Association, which appears to have a large representation of criminal lawyers, to the effect they intend to withdraw their services.  The association has nothing to do with the Law Society and these reports have been circulated widely throughout the media.  Has the Department engaged either with the Law Society or with the aforementioned association on an informal basis to ascertain what will happen in the event of the withdrawal of services by a large number of criminal law practitioners?  What contingency services will be available to those who seek to avail of the service in the event of such a withdrawal of services, which no Member would support?  In addition, does the Minister intend to introduce the criminal justice legal aid Bill prepared by the former Minister, Dermot Ahern, or has he carried out work in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It is amazing how many Bills were being prepared by the former Minister that never saw the light of day and on which I have discovered minimal work was done.  There will be a Bill brought forward in regard to the area of legal aid.  I do not anticipate that it will be published until the new year because of the other demands made on my Department. </P>
        <P>The group that the Deputy makes reference to that received some publicity during the summer months, as far as I am aware, has not been in contact with my Department.  There are two representative bodies of the legal profession, the Law Society and the Bar Council.  We are always willing to engage with them on issues of concern when they arise.  I do not anticipate that lawyers, as officers of the court, in the straitened financial circumstances in which the State finds itself will withdraw services.  They will, I am sure, do their duty by their clients and will clearly acknowledge and accept that right across all sectors there have been reductions in income.</P>
        <P>In this context, it is worth noting that the figures on the amount of expenditure incurred by the State, between counsel instructed by the DPP and counsel instructed in criminal legal aid matters, give rise to an interesting disparity.  For example, in 2010 the DPP&rsquo;s fees to counsel came to a total of &euro;14 million and the criminal aid fees paid to counsel were &euro;18,000,369.</P>
        <P>Whilst I said in the context of the EU and IMF agreement it was envisaged that there would be a reduction of &euro;5 million in expenditure in the criminal legal aid area from &euro;56 million to &euro;51 million, for reasons that remain a considerable mystery to me the former Minister, Dermot Ahern, in the context of the justice Estimate and budget that went through in December 2010, only provided for &euro;47 million funding in circumstances in which &euro;56 million was the outturn for 2010.  Effectively, there was a shortfall of &euro;9 million left by the previous Government on the funding available this year for criminal legal aid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister keeps throwing out those little grenades.  He had no difficulty in finding &euro;30 million in his Department for the Garda overtime for the visits of the Queen and President Obama, and we have yet to see from where he found it.  If he wants to look for money, he is able to find it.</P>

It is important to note that section 14 of the Act, which has been commenced, places an obligation on the courts for the first time to take account of a person&rsquo;s financial circumstances before determining that a fine is to be imposed.  This provision means that no person should be sent to prison for default solely because he or she cannot afford to pay a fine.</P>
        <P>Implementation work is continuing on two key sections of Act.  Section 15 provides for the payment of fines by instalment.  There are a number of practical and technical issues required to commence this provision.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the current system of payment allows only for a single payment in respect of each fine to be made within a specified period and this payment is recorded on the court&rsquo;s IT system, the criminal case tracking system or CCTS.</P>
        <P>In order to allow for a fine to be paid by instalments over a year or in certain circumstances for a longer period, it is necessary for the CCTS to be substantially modified to allow for the payment of instalments and to ensure that such instalments are accurately recorded and tracked.  In that regard, I met with the Courts Service management and informed it of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that payment by instalments is introduced as speedily as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Arising from that meeting, the Courts Service has put in place a structure to oversee the implementation of the necessary modifications.  Unfortunately no such structure was put in place by the former Government.  I am informed that, assuming the necessary funding is available, it will take approximately 12 months to complete the administrative and technical modifications required.  I expect to receive a report, including implementation proposals, from the service by the end of next month.</P>
        <P>Section 16 of the 2010 Act will require a judge, consequent on determining the fines be imposed, to make an order appointing an approved person, commonly referred to as a receiver, to recover the fine in the event of default.  The Courts Service has engaged in some preliminary discussions with the Revenue sheriffs, who have relevant experience through their work in the recovery of outstanding tax liabilities on behalf of the State, with a view to sheriffs being nominated as approved persons and I understand this dialogue will resume in the near future.  Some IT enhancements will be necessary in order to allow for the electronic transfer of recovery orders and data exchange with the receivers.  I am informed this work will take approximately six months to complete.  It will be done concurrently with that mentioned.</P>
        <P>It seems likely that some minor amendments will be required to the 2010 Act to address some practical implementation issues, including the need to provide for some form of retainer payment for work undertaken in circumstances where a fine cannot be recovered.  These are the timescales available to me.  The Government is subject to these caveats and committed to implementing the remaining provisions of the Fines Act 2010 as speedily as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to section 14 in saying people who were unable to pay fines should not be going to prison, but, unfortunately, he knows as well as I do that that is not the case.  It is unfortunate that implementation will take so long.  What is the cost of introducing this system?  Section 14 requires judges to take people&rsquo;s financial circumstances into account.  As the Minister said, nobody who is unable to pay a fine should be sent to prison.  That should be the message sent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>A considerable number of outstanding fines precede the coming into force of the Act.  In those circumstances fines would have been imposed, with the alternative of imprisonment if they were not paid.  That creates a particular difficulty because it is important to ensure people pay the fines handed down by the courts and that the integrity of the justice system is not undermined.  In the context of current circumstances where court <Col N="709"/>orders have been made without fines having been paid and there is no other means of recovery, unfortunately, prison remains an option for the time being.  Of course, it is an option none of us wants to see used in unnecessary circumstances.  I am very anxious, therefore, that this new system be put in place.  It is regrettable that during the period when the Fines Bill was before the House, prior to its enactment, it seems the former Minister made no preparations of any description to put in place the necessary IT systems or programmes and that there was no forward planning to implement its provisions.  That is where I found myself when we were elected to government and there was no funding available to me.</P>
        <P>I will answer directly the question the Deputy asked me.  It is estimated that it will cost approximately &euro;400,000 to make the IT changes required.  I hope to be able to secure this funding in 2012 during Government discussions on the Estimates for the new year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Minister said about undermining the justice system, but it also undermines this House when we pass legislation and fail to put in place the finance to implement it.  That is regrettable and should not happen again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s view.  Better forward planning would have ensured, as the legislation was going through the House, the arrangements were made to identify the appropriate IT changes required.  It is unfathomable that the Bill was passed in 2010 and no financial allocation was made in 2011 to facilitate this occurring.</P>

        <Quest>  the number of interns recruited by the Legal Aid Board under the JobBridge scheme; the location of same; and the delays in accessing a civil lawyer via the Legal Aid Board.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[24677/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Legal Aid Board is a statutory, independent body in accordance with the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  The matters raised by the Deputy are ones for the board.  However, in order to be helpful to him, I have had inquiries made with the board.  I had a meeting with its chairman following the announcement of the JobBridge programme to encourage use by the board of the internship scheme in order that many of the qualified solicitors currently unemployed would have an opportunity to gain job and work experience.</P>
        <P>The new F&Aacute;S JobBridge scheme is an important element of the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative designed to facilitate the provision of work experience and training opportunities for the unemployed.  I very much welcome the active participation of the Legal Aid Board in the scheme.  I am advised the board will be offering internships to qualified solicitors in order that they can gain practical experience in the areas of civil law in which the organisation provides services.  I have every confidence that solicitors obtaining internships with the board will receive valuable experience and training that will help them on the road towards paid employment, notwithstanding the current difficult labour market conditions for legal practitioners.  I also anticipate that the interns will make an important contribution to the work of the board during their time with it and that they will be of assistance in tackling the increasing demand it is experiencing for its services.</P>
        <P>The locations in which the board initially offered internships had regard to both the current work demands of the organisation and the capacity of the law centres involved to provide the necessary support and development to interns during their placements.  The locations initially <Col N="710"/>advertised under the scheme were Newbridge, Ennis, Cavan, Cork, where there were two placements, and Nenagh, plus six internships in various locations in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Since advertising with F&Aacute;S the board has received 28 applications from eligible candidates and all these candidates have since been offered interviews.  The board has already placed an intern in Tallaght law centre and is in the process of offering further placements in the locations I detailed.  To date, six additional applicants have been offered and have accepted internships and will be commencing in the coming weeks.  The board also intends to offer some additional placements in the coming days and has recently asked F&Aacute;S to extend the scheme to all its law centres.  This will ensure the board has the maximum flexibility in offering further internships and is a measure that I very much welcome.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P Just="Left">The past three or four years have seen a considerable increase in demand to the board for legal services and this coincides with the downturn in the economy.  In 2007, just over 10,164 persons sought legal services from the board in regard to general civil non-asylum matters.  This figure increased to 17,175 in 2010 and I am informed that the number of applicants in the first six months of this year was almost the same as the total number of applicants in 2007.  Inevitably, this has created huge pressures for the board&rsquo;s law centres and its capacity to deliver legal services within a reasonable period of time.  As of 1 September 2011, the waiting time in 17 of the board&rsquo;s 29 law centres was greater than four months, and in six of those centres the waiting time was greater than six months.  As of 1 September 2011, there were just under 4,500 persons waiting for a first appointment with a solicitor.  This compares with 3,153 on 1 January 2011, 2,335 on 1 January 2010 and 1,681 on 1 January 2009.</P>
        <P>The board is committed to ensuring applicants for legal services receive a substantive appointment with a solicitor within a maximum period of four months.  This is consistent with the view expressed by the High Court in the O&rsquo;Donoghue case.  This has been difficult to achieve in a number of the board&rsquo;s law centres recently.  Certain types of case are deemed by their nature to merit the provision of an immediate or near immediate service.  Priority cases include those where there are allegations of violence, child custody matters and where statutory deadlines are fast approaching when clients make their first contact with law centres.  These comprise 15% of all applications to law centres.  A considerable number of other applications are referred quickly to private practitioners.  Thus, up to 40% of all cases receive a very quick service.  In addition, because the refugee legal service operates to strict statutory deadlines, every asylum case processed by the board is a priority case by reference to the speed of response from the organisation.</P>
        <P>Civil legal aid in Ireland is delivered through the board&rsquo;s 29 law centres and a small number of specialist units.  The service is complemented through the extensive use of private practitioners.  Such use has had to be constrained, however, as a consequence of the increased demand and the extent of the board&rsquo;s financial resources to meet this.  The board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid, which accounts for the majority of its funding, other than in regard to asylum, has fallen from almost &euro;27 million in 2008 to just over &euro;24 million this year.</P>
        <P>Like all public service organisations, the board has also been subject to the public service recruitment embargo and the employee control framework.  While the board had a full staff sanction of 384, the current staffing is in the region of 350.  The board has sought to maintain its front line staffing to the greatest extent possible.</P>
        <P>The board has taken a range of measures with a view to addressing the increasing demand for services in a resource constrained environment. These include increasing the number of cases referred to private solicitors for the purpose of providing a service; an advice-only service <Col N="711"/>which facilitates an earlier brief meeting with a solicitor where applicants are likely to have to wait in excess of four months for a substantive appointment; an integration of the delivery of all services with a view to ensuring the most effective deployment of resources; the recent introduction of a pilot integrated mediation initiative in Dublin involving the board co-locating and co-operating with the Family Mediation Service and the Courts Service, the purpose of which is to offer applicants for legal services alternatives to litigation in the courts as a better and, from the State&rsquo;s point of view, more cost-effective means of resolving family law disputes; the creation of specialist units for medical negligence and child care services; and the current development of a new legal case management system that is likely to improve the efficiency of service delivery, the management of risk in the organisation and provide for online applications.  The board has also made use of a very limited exemption from the moratorium in regard to a small number of temporary front-line service delivery positions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for that information.  This is purely a follow up question to a discussion we had on this matter prior to the summer recess.  There was agreement among everyone concerned that this scheme would be used.  Am I to take it that an intern from JobBridge will be placed in every centre throughout the country at the end of this process?  Will the board consider the making of multiple appointments to centres given that there seems to be a low uptake of the scheme for whatever reason?  Is that something the Minister could discuss with the board or with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton?  Can the Minister outline the average delay, as opposed to the delay in various law centres, in getting an appointment to obtain advice on a civil law case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, the board is independent but I want to encourage it to use the scheme in order that the many young solicitors, in particular, who are currently unemployed will have an opportunity to get work experience and, in doing so, will do a public service by assisting the law centres that are under enormous pressure.  There has been a huge increase in numbers seeking legal help from law centres throughout the country as a consequence of the economic difficulties we are experiencing.</P>
        <P>To give the Deputy an indication of the figures involved, in 2007, just over 10,164 persons sought legal services from the board in regard to what I describe as general civil law matters excluding the asylum area.  The figure increased to 17,175 in 2010 and I am advised that the number of applicants in the first six months of this year was almost the same as the total number for 2007.</P>
        <P>I hope and expect and it may well be the case that JobBridge work experience can be provided in each of the law centres under the aegis of the Legal Aid Board.  I hope that where there are facilities in law centres to do so, that some of the law centres will be able to take on more than one intern.  It is important that the interns get proper job experience and proper supervision in the work they undertake.  The capacity of individual law centres to take on interns will depend on the numbers working within the centre and availability of space.</P>

        <asker> Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice and Equality</askee>
        <Quest>  the recommendations and demands made by Judge Michael Reilly, the Inspector of Prisons in his report on the 30 May 2011 in relation to prison conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[24741/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the inspector&rsquo;s report which I published on 30 May last.  It is a particularly valuable and comprehensive report.  In it, the inspector stated that the Irish Prison Service and local management should be aware by now of what he regards as best <Col N="712"/>practice and that he expects by 1 July that all prisons will comply with this.  However, he also appreciated that prisons will not be able to comply in certain areas in the short term.  In terms of progress, I have been informed by the Irish Prison Service that a number of the inspector&rsquo;s recommendations have been implemented or are being implemented.  Improvements are being made even though this is subject to the availability of resources.</P>
        <P>Areas mentioned by the inspector include the use of special cells, prisoners&rsquo; complaints and the procedure to be followed following deaths of persons in custody.  New procedures have been adopted and will be supported by changes to the prison rules which have been drafted and are being finalised in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  I hope those rules will be finalised very shortly.</P>
        <P>The inspector also referred to minimum standards for prison accommodation and the regimes and services that should be provided.  The Government is committed to the elimination of slopping out in prisons.  The upgrade of more than 100 cells at Mountjoy Prison, including the installation of in-cell sanitation, will be completed by the end of October.  The Irish Prison Service will then consider the feasibility of installing in-cell sanitation in the remaining cells of Mountjoy and to other facilities elsewhere. The completion of the Midlands Prison extension and the provision of 70 extra dormitory style spaces in the D&oacute;chas Centre will mean that 80% of the prisons estate will have in-cell sanitation by mid-2012.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the numbers in prison at the moment do not allow all of the inspector&rsquo;s standards to be met in the short term.  The problem of prison overcrowding remains a challenging issue.  As of 15 September 2011, there were 4,269 prisoners in custody.  In 2000, that figure stood at 2,919 and 400 additional prisoner places will come on stream by mid-2012.</P>
        <P>Having considered the report of the Thornton Hall review group, the Government has decided in principle to proceed with the construction of new prison facilities at Thornton Hall and at Kilworth, County Cork, but on a smaller scale and design from that previously envisaged. The timeframe for these projects will be discussed soon in the context of discussions on capital spending priorities for 2012.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>The Deputy can be assured that I am pursuing alternatives to custody.  The recently enacted Criminal Justice (Community Service)(Amendment) Act 2011 requires the sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered.  Work has also commenced on the development of a pilot scheme under which offenders may be offered earned earlier release in return for community service.  In addition, I intend to give new guidelines to the Parole Board of Ireland for the application of a similar scheme to long-term prisoners and will make a further announcement on this in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that work has started on the procedures and rules relating to investigating deaths in custody.  If the Minister has further information on that work I would appreciate his giving it to the House.  For example, when can we expect those procedures and rules to be implemented?</P>
        <P>One of Judge Reilly&rsquo;s recommendations was that prison governors would, by the end of June last, remedy simple matters such as broken windows, broken and leaking equipment and unpainted areas.  Can I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s answer that these have been remedied?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is my hope that they have been.  I expect to get a full report shortly on the extent to which those aspects of the recommendations of the Inspector of Prisons have been implemented.  I am anxious to implement all of his recommendations.  Judge Reilly has <Col N="713"/>done an extraordinary job.  He is a man of great insight and is now an invaluable part of what I describe as the oversight architecture of the Irish Prison Service.  I have a clear intent to do my level best to ensure we implement recommendations that come from him, put in place proper procedures and introduce an additional important element to investigations where complaints are made.  When the draft prison rules have been finalised by the Attorney General, our intentions in that regard will be made clear to Members of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I endorse the Minister&rsquo;s remarks about Judge Reilly.  Has the Minister performed a similar exercise with the Irish Prison Service, as is under way with the Garda Commissioner, with regard to impending retirements?  What will be the likely impact of those retirements on the service or on the Minister&rsquo;s plans for it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Department is engaged in an overall review of all aspects of the workings of the Department.  The Irish Prison Service is a separate service but is dependent on funding from the Department.  It is not yet clear what the position will be with regard to retirements from the Irish Prison Service or whether there will be a major difference this year from previous years.  I expect to have a clear view in the coming weeks of where matters stand.  It may not be fully clear until the end of November.  The Deputy can be assured that any new arrangements that may need to be put in place arising out of retirements will be put in place and that we will ensure we have all necessary staff to guarantee the proper running of our prisons.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Tackling serious crime, including drug trafficking, remains a key priority both for the Government and for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These priorities are clearly reflected in the Garda policing plan for 2011.  A key action in the plan is the proactive targeting by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of drug trafficking, including low level drug dealing.</P>
        <P>Under the direction of the Assistant Commissioner at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s national support services, the Garda national drugs unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau are pursuing their respective remits.  A strategic partnership has been established between the Garda national drugs unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau in identifying common targets who are then pursued through intelligence-led investigations, in order to maximise the response of law enforcement to organised crime gangs.  In tandem with this, the asset profilers programme has now been rolled out nationwide, with asset profilers based in every Garda division.  These profilers play a key role in tackling those involved in mid-level drug dealing.  The Criminal Assets Bureau utilises the local knowledge supplied by the profilers to target the assets of well known drug dealers in local communities.</P>
        <P>The National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 puts in place a co-ordinated approach across the many Departments and agencies that hold a remit in this area, working with the community and voluntary sectors.  Under our institutional arrangements, the implementation of the strategy is monitored by the oversight forum on drugs.  This forum, which is chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, is made up of representatives of both State and non-governmental bodies, reflecting the ongoing multi-agency and multi-sectoral approach in tackling this issue.</P><Col N="714"/>
        <P>At local level, local and regional drug task forces also bring together representatives from these bodies, including the local authorities, to work with local community and public representatives and so help deliver a better co-ordinated response to the problem as it is experienced in local areas.  In addition, the joint policing committee initiative brings together members of the Oireachtas, elected members and officials of local authorities, officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives of the community and voluntary sectors.  This further enables a collaborative approach to be taken in tackling the problem of drug misuse at local authority level.  Related to this, work is also continuing on the roll out of local policing fora to all local drug task force areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>With the proposed reduction in numbers, this brings into focus the role of the community in tackling drug addiction, drug abuse and drug dealing.  The Minister touched on it when he spoke about the role of the joint policing committees and the local policing forums.  They certainly have the capacity to contribute to a solution, but I think we need to look at their current role and maybe give them some additional powers, tweaking the way they operate.  From my experience at these committees and forums in my own area, there is certainly room for improvement in order to ensure that there is a greater community participation in those structures.  Has the Minister any proposals to look at their role and will he give them additional powers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I will certainly give consideration to what the Deputy is saying.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been very successful in targeting drug gangs and drug criminals in recent months, and in intercepting very substantial amounts of drugs.  As I have the opportunity to do so, I would like to congratulate the Garda on a haul of cannabis yesterday evening with an approximate value of &euro;1.7 million.  It is very important that the Garda targets those at the highest level who are engaged in drug dealing and who are preying on young people.  They would have my absolute support in doing that, as long as we can enhance co-operation between local communities and the Garda, or enhance the interaction at local authority level between councils on the ground and members of the Garda.</P>
        <P>From feedback I have received, some policing committees are working better than others, depending on the local authority.  Some more work needs to be done on that, and I will give it until the end of the year.  At that stage I intend to communicate with local authorities to get some overall national feedback on the number of times per year committees are meeting, and the nature of the engagement that is taking place to ensure that it is constructive and beneficial to the community and to the Garda.  The committees must also be responsive in the sense that when local representatives are able to focus on a particular problem in their area, there is an appropriate response, where possible, to address it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the commitment given by the Minister.  It is important to review how the committees are working because, as the Minister stated, in some areas they are working better than in others.  Will the Minister give a commitment that the so-called dial to stop drug dealing hotline will be funded throughout next year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister on the Garda drug find.  Considerable work is being done in this regard at local level.  I welcome, in particular, the use of asset profiling.  Is the Minister satisfied that legislation to assist the Garda in following up on this type of work is sufficiently strong and favours the Garda rather than those who are being profiled?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I will quickly answer both questions.  While I regard the hotline to which Deputy O&rsquo;Brien refers as very important, I have great difficulty at the moment commit<Col N="715"/>ting funding for anything for next year because were I to do so and having agreed to make a commitment on this issue, the next question I would be asked would be why I would not agree to commit to something else.  Deputy O&rsquo;Brien can be assured that I am very conscious of the hotline&rsquo;s importance.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Calleary&rsquo;s question, I have previously stated that we are reviewing the legislation on the Criminal Assets Bureau to see if there is some tweaking or are some changes that could usefully be made to it that would assist generally in the work that is done and would be of particular relevance to the activity of drug trading and the criminal gangs engaged in it.  If we bring forward amending legislation, I do not expect we will be in a position to do so until early next year.  I am certainly conscious of this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 388, 397 and 398 together.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government indicates that legislation will be introduced to end upward only rent reviews for existing business leases.  Following on from an initial consultation process with the Attorney General, I have forwarded outline proposals to her for further examination and development.  Those proposals have been the subject of preliminary discussion by Government.  The recently published legislative programme indicates the relevant legislation will be published during the current D&aacute;il session.</P>
        <P>It is also my intention to secure the swift enactment of the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009 which is awaiting Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Among the Committee Stage amendments which I will propose to the Bill is a series of amendments relating to the establishment of a public database containing relevant details of letting arrangements and rent reviews in the commercial property market.  It has long been acknowledged that the absence of such a database has contributed to the undoubted information deficit which exists in this area.  When established, the information contained in the database will introduce a welcome degree of transparency into the workings of the commercial property market.  Accurate information about rent levels is a critical element in ensuring a true market rent emerges from the rent review process and I am acutely conscious that the perceived absence of such information has led to a lack of confidence in the current rent review system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister provide a flavour of the outline proposals?  I understand they have been discussed informally with some representative organisations of business, yet the Oireachtas has not had sight of them.  Are the Minister and Attorney General singing from the same hymn sheet on this issue or are there differences of opinion between them, <Col N="716"/>significant or otherwise?  The question was tabled before the legislative schedule was published.  When does the Minister expect the proposed changes to hit the street, as it were?  In other words, when will traders who are suffering at present see the results on their bottom line?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I confirm that I have met different organisations to obtain their views on different approaches that may be taken in the development of the legislation.  I do not normally sing hymns but I assure the Deputy that the Attorney General and I are co-operating very closely in the development of the legislation.  This is a difficult and complicated area to address.  There are various rights issues of which we must be conscious in the manner in which we approach this.  We have yet to bring what I describe as the final form of the Bill to Cabinet.  There has been, however, a preliminary discussion by the Government on the approach we are taking.  While we hope to publish the legislation before the end of this term, I am not in a position to give the Deputy a specific time.  As we continue to develop the Bill and progress through October and into early November, I hope to have a clearer perspective of the exact time.  The legislation is part of the programme for Government and is in the A list of Bills to be published during this session.  I am anxious we meet that commitment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Minister may not sing hymns, he has some good broken records in his collection.  Will he be required to consult the troika on the provisions of the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an interesting question to which I am not sure of the answer.  The legislation is a commitment in the programme for Government in the context of it addressing a very important issue which is impacting on our economy and the viability of otherwise viable businesses.  On the other side of the equation, in the context of its relevance to the operation and functioning of the National Asset Management Agency and the disposal of properties, there are a broad range of issues to be addressed, all of which we are conscious of.  I envisage that we will bring forward a carefully balanced Bill which I hope will meet the needs in this area in a practical and usable manner and will try to ensure the needs of businesses that would otherwise be viable, save for the fact that they may be tied to rental levels that reflect what I describe as the super-rents that seemed to emerge during the boom years, may be addressed.  A number of technical issues need to be addressed in the context of the legislation.  I do not want to pre-empt the final decisions that will be made and hope to bring forward the necessary legislation as soon as possible.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that statistics relating to Garda response times for call-outs in Cork city are not readily available as incidents referred to the Garda control room for Cork city are manually recorded.  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the highest importance is given to emergency calls in Cork city and that they are responded to on a priority basis.  The Garda authorities have also informed me that the system for dealing with emergency calls in Cork city is kept under ongoing review and they are satisfied the current service is effective in delivering efficient arrangements to the community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s response raises two questions.  Given the unavailability of response times, how can one judge whether they are sufficiently quick?  If one does not record response times, how does one determine whether they are improving?</P><Col N="717"/>
        <P>Last night, I attended a successful meeting of my local policing forum attended by approximately 180 people.  I was struck by a comment by the superintendent of the Mayfield district of Cork, in which Cork Prison is located, that a considerable number of Garda resources in the district are used for the transport of prisoners to the courts.  Is the Minister examining the transportation of prisoners with a view to freeing up Garda resources, especially given that Garda numbers are declining?  Is the proposed civilianisation of aspects of policing an option for addressing this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Since my appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality no one has drawn my attention to there being major difficulties with regard to call-out times in Cork.  In circumstances in which a manual system is still operating, there is a difficulty in accessing the information the Deputy is seeking.  If such information were electronically maintained, it would and should be readily available.</P>
        <P>The transport of prisoners is a major security issue.  We cannot have untrained civilians driving prisoners to and from courts.  On a regular basis prisoners coming from the prisons to the courts may be constrained in a particular way and there are particular difficulties.  It is not unusual that the Garda is involved in the transport of prisoners.  However, in the context of using members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the best advantage to the benefit of the public and utilising the expert training they have received, I know the Garda Commissioner is examining all the various functions garda&iacute; perform to see to what extent they may be civilian-based.</P>
      
        <P>I certainly do not envisage untrained civilians driving prisoners to the courts or using handcuffs.  That would be not only inappropriate but dangerous and it is not a policy I would favour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what I was suggesting.  I am suggesting that, when considering the roll-out of the civilianisation process, we give special attention to those Garda districts which contain prisons.  We should consider freeing up as many garda&iacute; as possible in order that we do not compromise either on the transport of prisoners or the service provided for communities in terms of response times.  Can we focus on putting as many people as possible in administrative roles within the districts containing prisons?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I generally support the idea of civilianising basic administrative functions, some of which are currently undertaken by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the issue forms part of the review.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I have an obligation to reduce expenditure.  We must be careful that as garda numbers decrease in line with our EU-IMF commitment, we do not spend almost as much recruiting large numbers of civilians to undertake administrative tasks.  There is a balance to be maintained and operational decisions must be made by the Garda Commissioner.  The Deputy can assume it is my view and that of the Government that garda&iacute; should be placed as frequently as possible in positions in which they can utilise their training and provide the front-line policing services required.  We should not have members of the Garda force unnecessarily working on administrative tasks in a back office if such tasks could well be undertaken by civilians.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice and Equality</askee>
        <Quest>  his plans to increase the efficiency of the garda vetting unit in preparation for a greater workload and remit in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[24743/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda central vetting unit, GCVU, provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations that employ or engage in a voluntary capacity persons to work with children or vulnerable adults.  There are more than 18,000 organisations registered <Col N="718"/>with the GCVU.  In the period 2007 to 2010 the number of vetting applications increased from 187,864 to 291,938.  That is, by any standards, a huge increase in demand.  I am conscious of the need to keep the time required to obtain vetting to the minimum possible.  Since I was appointed Minister, I have take a number of initiatives to reduce this timeframe.  However, it is only right that I praise those employed in the vetting unit who do a substantial amount of work under increasing pressure in terms of the number of applications for vetting.  </P>
        <P>A number of steps have been taken to improve the position.  The sanction of the Department of Finance was obtained to retain the services of ten temporary employees.  Further sanction was obtained to engage an additional ten temporary employees who have recently commenced work in the GCVU.  Other measures aimed at improving turnaround times are also under consideration.  All of this should have a positive impact on processing times.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately ten weeks.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the deployment of Garda personnel is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner, taking into account all the various demands and requirements.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is a total of five garda&iacute;, 76 full-time Garda civilian personnel and 20 temporary civilian personnel assigned to the GCVU.  This represents a significant increase in the number of personnel assigned to the unit which stood at only 13 before the current process of development of Garda vetting began in 2005.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has approved the draft scheme of a national vetting bureau Bill.  The Bill which will establish a statutory basis underpinning vetting procedures for persons who are to work with children and vulnerable adults will be published in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.  The establishment of a national vetting bureau which will take over the work of the GCVU will have resource implications which I will be pursuing with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister mentioned other measures were being considered to improve waiting times.  Can he give us more information on what these are?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope it will be possible to provide, under the new internship scheme, some internship experience for persons currently unemployed.  I had a conversation with the Garda Commissioner when the new JobBridge scheme was announced and it is my understanding the Garda has taken the initial steps necessary to recruit interns to the vetting unit.  Working at the unit will give them important job experience while contributing to a reduction in waiting times for vetting.</P>
        <P>I do not regard ten weeks as an appropriate time for the completion of vetting applications.  I have talked to the Commissioner about this and believe it is a necessary objective to get the timeframe down to an average of about four weeks, save where there are unusual circumstances &mdash; for example, in cases in which information must be sought from abroad.  When we entered government, the waiting time was 14 weeks.  This has been reduced to ten weeks and I hope further progress will be made as we continue through this year and into next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a facility for people who have urgent requests for vetting?  I know of one case in which a guy needed Garda clearance to get a visa.  Can we consider urgent applications on a case-by-case basis?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised with the Garda Commissioner the need for what I described as a fast-track system for special circumstances in which job offers were available for only a short period of time and vetting had to be undertaken with some speed.  The difficulty, of <Col N="719"/>course, is that if everyone sought to use this system, it would undermine its effectiveness.  It has not yet proved possible, because of the number of applications being received, to establish a regular fast-track system.  I am aware that there have been occasions on which there has been genuine, readily identifiable urgency with vetting applications; in such cases those in charge of the facility in Tipperary have co-operated and engaged in vetting with some speed when they had the information necessary to ensure the process was completed properly.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice and Equality</askee>
        <Quest>  if the Garda Commissioner is required to produce service level agreements; if so, the role population figures, existing crime rates and so on play in determining the resource allocation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[24605/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The levels of service to be provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are set out each year in the annual policing plan which is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The annual plan sets out the policing priorities for that year, the key actions to be taken in respect of each priority and the performance indicators by which the outcomes can be measured.  The allocation of Garda personnel is determined by Garda management using a distribution model which takes into account a number of factors, including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each Garda division.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>If that was the case, I certainly would not be asking this question.  I have no confidence whatsoever in the equitable sharing of resources, particularly in view of the blunt instrument that is the public sector recruitment embargo.  Areas that have a disproportionately low number of garda&iacute; relative to their populations do worse in such an environment.  Commuter belt areas that have grown rapidly in recent years are a case in point.  Does the Minister think it fair that a county such as Kildare, with a population of 209,000, has 328 garda&iacute;, while the combined area of Sligo-Leitrim, with a population of less than 100,000, has three garda&iacute; more?  No matter how one looks at it, counties Meath, Kildare, Wicklow or Wexford are the kinds of places which are not getting a fair share.  I believe criminals themselves are reading the numbers because there have been some high profile happenings in recent years that virtually invite the committing of crimes in places known to have a low ratio of garda&iacute;.  One cannot police without adequate numbers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate that these are operational decisions made by the Garda Commissioner.  In that context it is worth bringing to the Deputy&rsquo;s attention that the detailed allocation of Garda resources, including equipment, and the allocation of personnel to various units are a matter for the Garda Commissioner to decide upon on the basis of his identified operational requirements.  These vary from location to location.  The deployment of Garda personnel throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operation of strategy, is continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may not be aware that Garda management is aided by what is known as the Garda establishment re-distribution model.  The Commissioner advises that this model indicates the most effective means to distribute Garda personnel and acts as a guide to Garda management decision making.  It takes into account many different policing variables, including socioeconomic factors, census information, crime trends and the minimum establishment required for each district.  The allocation of Garda personnel is determined by these factors which also take account of the policing requirements of each division.  This very much influences the approach taken by the Garda Commissioner.</P><Col N="720"/>
        <P>As Minister for Justice and Equality, it is not my role to direct the Commissioner as to how many garda&iacute; to allocate to individual districts or Garda stations.  The needs in these areas can vary from time to time, depending on crime levels, instances that occur or special events that may give rise to concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made the point, as have other Deputies in my area, of meeting very senior garda&iacute;, up to the rank of assistant commissioner.  They do not disagree with us.  It appears to be that what one has one holds.  In the context of an embargo, there is no commitment to redeploying people.</P>
        <P>I have been listening to this for years.  I now have an opportunity to ask the question or put the point whereas for many of those years I did not.  I do not accept that the model is working.  It certainly does not work in developing areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The review taking place throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the feedback sought by the Garda Commissioner from his senior officers last June to a document produced to them, give senior officers in every area an opportunity to feed into the process.  In so far as any senior officer is of the belief that his or her station and the needs of the community he or she serves are not being adequately considered, or in so far as he or she believes there should be a redistribution of the resources of the force in the context of manpower, womanpower or patrol cars, those senior officers have a unique opportunity to feed into that process.  Even without it, if senior officers have a complaint to make or a concern to express, they have a direct line to the Garda Commissioner.  I reiterate that it is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>I refer to an earlier question.  The police committees that involve co-operation between senior members of the Garda and members and officials of local authorities provide a very useful forum for local communities to focus on their concerns, or for a senior member of the Garda to raise concerns openly about differences being experienced in any particular station, thereby engaging with local elected representatives.  All of this can feed into ensuring we have a better, more responsive and community-oriented police service.  That was the initial purpose of providing these committees, to encourage that type of interaction between members of the Garda locally, local communities and elected representatives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on the figures in the four year plan produced last year, the Taoiseach made a number of very clear and specific promises to the people.  Before, during and after the general election, he stated there would be no further cuts to welfare rates and pensions and no increases in income tax.  The programme for Government states: &ldquo;The new Government will...maintain the current rates of income tax together with bands and credits.&rdquo;  However, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, stated in early June: &ldquo;I am not going to rule out any tax initiative or any tax increase or any tax reduction&rdquo;.  Seven days later, marking the Government&rsquo;s 100th day in office, the Taoiseach categorically ruled this out by stating there would not be any income tax increase in the budget.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, went further and stated the Government would maintain social welfare rates.  The Minister for Finance now says the public finances are &ldquo;better than on track&rdquo;.  No more money is available than there was when the Taoiseach specifically promised there would be no more cuts in welfare rates or increases in income tax.  When the Taoiseach launched his programme for Government he made a commitment to be open and truthful with the people as we tackle these challenges in the coming years.  Is the Taoiseach in a position today to give a clear <Col N="721"/>commitment that there will be no cuts in the rates of social welfare or pensions, and no increases in income tax next year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin was not very full in his contribution.  In his remarks about what the Minister for Finance said, the Deputy conveniently forgot to say that in the same sentence the Minister also referred to what is stated very clearly in the programme for Government, namely, that it is the intention of the Government to implement the programme.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s Government committed via the memorandum of understanding, MOU, to an extra &euro;215 million in income tax for each of the coming three years.  This must be renegotiated with the troika by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in the same way as a number of other matters have already been renegotiated to the advantage of taxpayers and the people in general.</P>
        <P>This is the programme for Government.  The Minister for Finance referred Deputy Martin to the programme for Government in the contribution to which the latter alluded.  It is our intention to implement the programme in full.  From that point of view and in the context of income tax, this matter must be renegotiated with the troika as a result of the commitment to come up with &euro;250 million for each of the next three years.  The Minister for Social Protection has, on a number of occasions, referred to the Government&rsquo;s interest in keeping headline rates for social welfare intact.  She has also made it perfectly clear that in cases where recipients of social welfare payments who refuse adequate and appropriate offers of retraining, upskilling or employment, their rates of payment can be reduced.  The latter has already occurred and everyone who is unfortunate enough to be unemployed is aware of the position in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach was well aware of the four year plan relating to the EU-IMF agreement when he made his specific commitment.  That has nothing to do with it.  The EU and the IMF are fundamentally concerned about the global or bottom-line figures.  Since he entered office, the Taoiseach has been trumpeting his capacity to make choices and change certain aspects of the agreement.  His response is noteworthy by the lack of clarity and by the absence of a commitment in respect of the specific points I raised.</P>

	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about reports which emerged this morning regarding the entitlement of county managers of local authorities to payments of <Col N="723"/>&euro;74,000 on retirement.  I understand these payments come from the same severance under which the Government gifted &euro;713,000 to Mr. Dermot McCarthy.  I do not need to inform the Taoiseach that the people are suffering real hardship, not just in respect of the outworking of the policies of the previous Administration but also at the hands of his Government.  I want him to give a guarantee to the people and this House that he will end the practice of making these outrageous payments.  I also want him to explain to the House how it is that an outgoing Secretary General has walked away with such a bonanza and how it might be that, on his watch, managers in local authorities are set to do likewise.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is aware of the position with regard to the unemployment figures.  He is also aware that certain children have returned to school without being able to secure the services of special needs assistants and that there are people on hospital trolleys.  However, his Administration, which was supposed to be about change and a new beginning, is standing over the outrage to which I refer.  Will the Taoiseach explain how it is that Mr. McCarthy walked away with that cash and how it is that he proposes to reward the managers of local authorities in a similar fashion under the same scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The terms of reference for the appointment of and the severance package relating to the person to whom the Deputy refers, namely, the former Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach who was also Secretary General to the Government, were set by the previous Administration.  My term of office began this year.  We have made a number of very significant changes already.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is committed to reviewing the terms of appointments for persons appointed to senior positions within the public service.  I give the Deputy a commitment in that regard.  As already stated, the Government has honoured the package put in place for the former Secretary General at my Department which was put in place by the previous Administration.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government is also committed to the introduction of a single pension facility.  Information relating to that matter will be published shortly and that information will contain further details of very significant reforms in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>There the Taoiseach goes again.  It happens on his watch but he is not accountable for it.  He knows as well as I that under the pensions legislation it is at the discretion of Government to sign off on added years of service.  He knows full well that had he wished to stop that payment to the outgoing Secretary General, he could have done so.  The position is the same with regard to the outrageous payments to county and city managers to which I refer.  The only conclusion at which we can arrive is that despite the rhetoric from him and his colleagues in Fine Gael and the Labour Party with regard to reform and change, they are, in fact, not serious about these matters.  They will hammer clerical officers and ordinary working people.  However, like their predecessors, they are unable and unwilling to go after those in the upper echelons of the public and civil service.  They have made that abundantly clear.  Shame on the Taoiseach and the Government &mdash; particularly as they are cooking up massive cutbacks that will hurt ordinary people &mdash; for being so coy and duplicitous in respect of the those in the upper echelons of the public and civil service.  The Taoiseach should make a commitment to the House that no county or city manager will walk away with a payment of &euro;74,000.  He should not sell us that it is Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s fault.  The Taoiseach is in charge now.</P>

	<P>I want to raise a decision of the Government for which the Taoiseach cannot blame Fianna F&aacute;il, despite that party&rsquo;s responsibility for the origins of this crisis.  Last Saturday, the Government abjectly capitulated to the European Central Bank when the Minister for Finance indicated in Poland that the full &euro;3.5 billion that was gambled in Anglo Irish Bank by the holders of unsecured bonds would now be paid.  Just three months ago, the same Minister made world headlines when he said in Washington that the Government would burn the bondholders.  He said &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t think the Irish taxpayer should redeem what has become speculative investment&rdquo;.  Six weeks from tomorrow, the first &euro;1 billion will be paid to speculators in Anglo Irish Bank.  Will he explain why this breathtaking betrayal of the Irish people is taking place when sharks in the financial markets are being protected and rewarded?  Why is the Government prepared to continue the disastrous policy of austerity that is affecting our people?  It is preparing to savage the incomes of low and middle income workers, introduce a new household tax, withdraw the current provision of special needs assistants and cut fuel and electricity allowances from pensioners and the poorest people.  While it has no compunction in hitting ordinary people, it is bottling it when it comes to tackling banking speculators.  What is responsible for this change in policy?  Why did the Government make the promises that it is now failing to live up to?  Why did it raise people&rsquo;s expectations in this way before letting them <Col N="726"/>down?  I will compare the Government&rsquo;s actions in sporting terms to the actions of the heroic Stephen Cluxton last Sunday.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;Deputy Higgins gives him credit for.  Fair play to the Dubs for what they did.  The Government committed to making this situation more tolerable for the Irish people and the Irish taxpayer.  The discussions between the Government and its counterparts about how it can be made more tolerable, particularly at finance ministry level, have brought about final decisions in regard to a number of matters.  Deputy Higgins is aware &mdash; he does not want to recognise it &mdash; that savings of approximately &euro;9 billion will be made over the average period of seven and a half years that was originally envisaged for these loans.  As the Deputy knows, that is the equivalent of approximately 5.7% of the current forecasted level of GDP for 2011.  The saving comprises &euro;4.9 billion on the EFSM funding, &euro;3.5 billion on the EFSF funding and &euro;0.57 billion on the UK bilateral loans.  This is a significant saving.  The Minister for Finance spoke directly to Mr. Trichet, the Commissioners and all his colleagues.  They regard the decisions taken by Ireland, and the position to which Ireland is moving, as very significant in light of the difficulties being experienced by the eurozone countries.  The real situation, which the Minister said he would reflect on, is that when burden-sharing of the kind mentioned by Deputy Higgins was referenced in the Greek case, contagion began to spread immediately to other countries.  The Minister for Finance said he would reflect on his discussions with Mr. Trichet.  He made it clear that another argument would be followed in respect of the promissory note.  When the previous Government signed up to that note, it committed to pay some &euro;30 billion over the next ten years, or &euro;3 billion per year.  It is obvious that if maturities and interest rates were to be applied in that context, further significant savings could be made by the Irish taxpayer and the Irish people.  The Minister for Finance has said he will reflect on this following his discussions with Mr. Trichet and others.  These are matters to be negotiated and agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach did not answer the question.  The Minister for Finance was very vocal in Washington.  He said he would burn the Anglo gamblers.  According to the schedule I have, some &euro;3.5 billion is to be paid to them over the next seven or eight months.  A total of &euro;21.5 billion is to be paid to all the other holders of unsecured and unguaranteed bonds, for which the Irish people have no responsibility.  The Taoiseach needs to deal with that issue, rather than using figures to show that disastrously high interest rates, which should never have been imposed by our so-called partners, are being brought down.  The incredible explanation given by the Minister and the ECB was that what he had said about burning the bondholders &mdash; those are my words, but that was the idea &mdash; was not the way forward if we were to try to encourage the markets.  When the Taoiseach refers to &ldquo;contagion&rdquo;, he means that the sharks in the market would go to Italy and Spain and raise their interest rates.  The Government <Col N="727"/>and the ECB are running in front of these unelected and unaccounted players in the financial markets.  They are sacrificing the livelihoods, jobs and welfare of our people.  I ask the Taoiseach to have some bottle.  There is no responsibility on an Irish Government to repay these tens of billions of euro.  He should stop it now.  The money should be invested in public infrastructure and used to create the tens of thousands of jobs needed by our people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The updated NTMA estimates, which reflect last week&rsquo;s announcements and decisions by the Minister for Finance, refer to a reduction of approximately 2.6% in the EFSF rate and a reduction of just under 3% &mdash; 2.925%, in fact &mdash; in the EFSM rate.  Therefore, the annual interest saving under the EFSF will be &euro;450 million and the savings under the EFSM will be &euro;650 million.  There will also be a saving of approximately &euro;100 million in respect of the bilateral loans.  If the entire &euro;45 billion is drawn down, approximately &euro;1.2 billion will be saved each year, for as long as the amount remains outstanding, as a result of these changes.  In addition, the cost of the IMF loans will reduce as a result of recent and forthcoming increases in Ireland&rsquo;s IMF quota.  The NTMA has calculated that the overall benefit of this interest rate reduction will be some &euro;1.9 billion, of which some &euro;30 million will arise in 2012 and is included in the overall estimate of &euro;900 milllion in interest savings next year which even Deputy Joe Higgins will admit are very substantial.  Based on the estimates for the changes to the EU and IMF elements of the loans, the overall savings, based on the inital lifespan of the programme, which will be extended, would be over &euro;10 billion.  For 2012, the changes to the EU and bilateral loans, combined with the impact of the IMF quota changes, amount to some &euro;900 million.  The average maturity date of the loans will be extended.  This will have the effect, as pointed out by Commissioner Rehn on Friday, of improving our debt sustainability and also the liquidity for Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has pointed out that Ireland will have a pre-paid margin of &euro;600 million in the EFSF returned in 2016.  While it is important to note that this return will be been factored into the interest savings figures once the funding under the programme is drawn down, it gives rise to an upfront capital receipt of &euro;600 million capital in 2016 directly to the Exchequer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 13, inclusive, together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an awful lot of questions being taken together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Most of them are in the name of the Deputy and they all are related.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government states, &ldquo;We will reduce the size of the Department of the Taoiseach, transforming it into the equivalent of a Cabinet Office that oversees the delivery of a new programme for Government&rdquo;.  Since taking office as Taoiseach and in keeping with that commitment, I have instituted a series of radical reforms to the operation of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P><Col N="729"/>
        <P>Responsibility for public service modernisation and related industrial relations issues has been assigned to the new Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As a consequence, 27 staff have transferred to that Department.</P>
        <P>A new integrated European affairs division is being established within the Department of the Taoiseach.  This will involve the transfer of approximately 19 staff from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who will work alongside existing staff from my Department in the new integrated EU division.  The new division will support me in my membership of the European Council, as well as supporting the T&aacute;naiste in his responsibility for overall co-ordination of European policy, together with the Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs and including the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s membership of the General Affairs Council.  It will secure more effective strategic direction and co-ordination across the whole of government in all matters related to the European Union.  I anticipate that the incoming staff will be in place by 3 October and that the new arrangements will be fully operational from that date.</P>
        <P>The Government has also agreed to establish an office of the T&aacute;naiste within the Department of the Taoiseach.  This office will have a small number of support staff and avail of physical and support facilities which will be provided by my Department.  Both the staff and the support costs for the office will be provided at no additional cost from within the existing resources of my Department.  The office will be fully operational in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In parallel with the major restructuring of my Department, the Government has also made significant new management appointments.  As I previously informed the House, it has appointed Ms Geraldine Byrne Nason as Second Secretary General in my Department.  She will have responsibility for the management of an integrated EU co-ordination function, engaging with other Departments, as appropriate, reporting to me and the T&aacute;naiste, as appropriate, in respect of our particular responsibilities at European level, and working with the Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Creighton, in respect of her duties; managing support for the Government Economic Management Council which is chaired by me and reporting to the T&aacute;naiste on matters relating to the council; and also managing the office of the T&aacute;naiste within the Department of the Taoiseach, with responsibility for co-ordinating support for the T&aacute;naiste in his whole-of-government responsibilities.</P>
        <P>On my nomination, the Government appointed Mr. Martin Fraser as the new Secretary General to the Government and Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach with effect from 1 August.  Mr. Fraser is the Accounting Officer for the Department of the Taoiseach.  Both the Secretary General and the Second Secretary General are members of the staff of my Department.  They will work with and, as appropriate, report to me and the T&aacute;naiste, as I have explained.  As Deputies will know from their own experience, this model has worked very successfully in the past, notably in respect of the Northern Ireland peace process and Ireland&rsquo;s last EU Presidency.</P>
        <P>As I outlined to the House previously, the filling of the post of Secretary General to my Department, in accordance with established practice, was a matter for the Government and does not come within the remit of the Top Level Appointments Commission.  Expressions of interest for the post were invited from civil servants and all suitable officers, whether they submitted an expression of interest, were considered before the Government made the appointments.</P>
        <P>Although the details are not yet finalised, there are likely to be two new appointments to vacancies at assistant secretary level in my Department shortly.  These posts will be fully open and advertised in the national newspapers.  The selection will be conducted by the Top Level Appointments Commission which the Government has reformed to include an independent chairperson and a majority of members from outside the Civil Service.</P><Col N="730"/>
        <P Just="Left">The changes I have made, alongside the establishment of the new Government Economic Management Council, serve to strongly reinforce the strategic centre of Government.  I expect that the new management team in the Department will implement a number of further administrative changes in the coming months which will serve to supplement the strategic restructuring I have implemented and ensure the Department is modernised to meet the enormous challenges that the Government faces.  These changes will focus on ensuring modern and effective mechanisms for implementing the programme for Government, the Cabinet Office model, and prioritising work on national priorities.  They will draw on lessons learned from the recent past and international best practice.  Tackling the economic crisis, with a particular focus on unemployment and jobs, will be of paramount importance.  The new approach will be further elaborated on in the Department&rsquo;s new strategy statement and action plan under the organisational review programme.  Both will be published before the end of the year.  Apart from the changes I have outlined, it is not proposed to transfer any funding or other programmes to my Department.</P>
        <P>There are six staff working in my Department who are on secondment from other Departments, while nine staff are on secondment from the Department of the Taoiseach to other public sector bodies.  A number of staff in diplomatic grades in the new EU division will be seconded from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, while the general service staff will formally transfer to my Department.</P>
        <P>The number of whole-time equivalent staff in my Department at the end of 2008 was 212.  At the end of 2009 it was 198, and at the end of 2010 it was 191.  Even following the transfer of significant numbers of staff to the new EU division, I expect that this figure will fall to approximately 187 by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Taoiseach will fully comply with its obligations to make savings under the Croke Park agreement and also play its part in further reducing costs in the context of the decisions to be made by the Government against the background of the comprehensive review of expenditure which is under way and being conducted by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Following completion of the radical changes under way, the Department will be able to fulfil its many important roles more effectively but with a smaller staff complement and budget than in recent years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Of this group of 13 questions, 12 are in my name.  Under Standing Orders, if they were to be asked separately, I would be entitled to speak for approximately 72 minutes.  Obviously, I do not expect this to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know where the Deputy got that idea from because he is not correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are approximately four areas covered by the 12 questions in my name: the Taoiseach&rsquo;s promise concerning the staffing of the Department of the Taoiseach, the new office of the T&aacute;naiste, the new arrangements for co-ordinating EU policy and the procedures for filling the post of Secretary General.  I want to be able to deal with each of these and have enough of time to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy need not worry, I will give him time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  You are in good form because of Sunday&rsquo;s developments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is in better form than last week.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="731"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Actually, I am in very good form.  Deputy Rabbitte has good experience of that kind of thing himself.  The last time we discussed the structure and staffing of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, the Taoiseach failed to inform the House that he would be moving an entire section from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under his control.  In the Taoiseach&rsquo;s pre-election speeches, in the Fine Gael manifesto and in the programme for Government the Taoiseach stated he would dramatically cut the Department of the Taoiseach in size.  In interviews earlier this year the Taoiseach described himself as a straight talker.  Will the Taoiseach now formally confirm that he is abandoning the promise to dramatically slim down the Department of An Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Deputy Martin finished?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We thought there was a hard question coming.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Question No. 4 is from Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  It is to ask the Taoiseach if he is still plans to halve the size of his Department.  If Deputy Martin listened to what I said he would have heard the first sentence of my reply, that is, the programme for Government states we will reduce the size of the Department of the Taoiseach.  Deputy Martin&rsquo;s question relates to something he seems to have heard somewhere to the effect that the Taoiseach still plans to halve the size of his Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should go back over his manifesto.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the 25,000 civil servants?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My job is to implement the programme for Government and that is what we intend to do.  The programme for Government is clear.  It states that we will reduce the size of the Department of the Taoiseach.  Deputy Martin referred to &ldquo;dramatically cutting&rdquo; and his question refers to a reduction in the Department of 50%.  I have not abandoned anything and I do not know what Deputy Martin is blathering on about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us consider the facts that the Taoiseach has just read out.  There were 191 staff at the end of 2010 and now there are 187.  That is a change of four people.  It is about time we had some straight, honest talking here.  We should stop the waffle, fudge and spin.  If the Taoiseach will not be straight or clear about something he has announced himself through the figures, then when will he be clear about anything?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is not clear.  He made all manner of ridiculous commitments during the election and before the election and he has abandoned them.  The Taoiseach should acknowledge that he has abandoned them.  That is all.  There are no specifics in terms of the size of the office of an T&aacute;naiste and how many staff are there and so on.  I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could give us some real figures behind that office.  The Taoiseach used the term &ldquo;a small number of staff&rdquo;.  Will he provide the actual number of staff who will be supporting the T&aacute;naiste in that role?</P>
        <P>In terms of the EU co-ordination the decision to transfer the entire European Union section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s control is rather surprising given that co-ordination between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Taoiseach was and always has been excellent.  Indeed the 2004 EU Presidency was a model Presidency of the council and was described as such by all throughout Europe.  The Taoiseach should explain why he has changed this successful formula.  It seems to be a solution <Col N="732"/>in search of a problem.  I am keen to get the rationale behind the Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision because the EU section has a broader, wider and deeper integration throughout the entire operation of the diplomatic service.  In practice our entire diplomatic service is focused on European matters and the sections in daily contact with our embassies in EU countries remain in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The integration and co-ordination pertaining to Europe within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be significantly undermined by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision to take the specific section dealing with EU matters out of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and land it in splendid isolation in the Department of the Taoiseach.  I do not believe the Taoiseach has given a proper rationale for why he has decided to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Deputy that this is Question Time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Taoiseach to give a clear rationale for that decision.  For some reason, the last time we discussed this even though it was under way then he did not alert the House to such a fundamental and substantial change in respect of that decision.  The Taoiseach will create an extra barrier to an integrated EU approach from Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to Deputy Martin&rsquo;s question is that the Office of the T&aacute;naiste will be supported by a small secretariat of approximately two staff from within the current staff numbers.  I will give Deputy Martin the rationale behind the other change.  Perhaps his view is as someone who was in the Department of Foreign Affairs and did an extensive tour of duty.  The problem is that the matter of the co-ordination in respect of European integration is better handled from the Department of the Taoiseach in the sense of being able to draw the requirements from every Department to ensure that happens.  It is not a taking over of responsibilities from the T&aacute;naiste or from the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  It is merely the co-ordination of the European process which, as Deputy Martin correctly points out, now goes across every Department.  This is why the appointment of the Second Secretary General to the Department of the Taoiseach will manage it from the Department of the Taoiseach in an effective way, working to the T&aacute;naiste in respect of his responsibilities, to the Minister of State in respect of her responsibilities and to me as Head of Government in respect of my responsibilities.  I see this as improving a position which, as Deputy Martin pointed out, during various EU Presidencies did well under challenging circumstances.  I am keen to make it even better.  For this reason we moved the general staff from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade into the section in the Department of the Taoiseach dealing with the co-ordination of European matters.  That is the rationale behind it and I believe it will work effectively.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the transfer of the EU section to his control, why is the Taoiseach still transferring EU questions to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs will have responsibility for answering questions in respect of European issues.  I am not suggesting taking over responsibility for all European matters but for the co-ordination of the way we proceed to deal with European issues.  I find it to be more effective coming from the Department of the Taoiseach as distinct from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in attempting to draw from all Departments the requirements needed.  To put even greater emphasis on this approach the Government agreed to the appointment of a Second Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach with specific responsibility for managing that co-ordination and for dealing with the matters of the economic manage<Col N="733"/>ment council, reporting to the T&aacute;naiste where appropriate and to me in respect of my responsibilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to allow Deputy Higgins in for one moment.  He has a question on the filling of the position of Secretary General.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>This looks suspiciously like a Fine Gael coup with regard to the management of EU affairs by the Government.  Is this the case?  Has the Taoiseach elbowed the T&aacute;naiste out to deal with far flung areas such as North Korea and so on while in essence corralling the critical policy and EU matters among himself as a Fine Gael Taoiseach and a Fine Gael Minister for Finance aided and abetted by a Fine Gael Minister of State for European affairs?  I will repeat the question which the Taoiseach did not really answer.  How are the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to co-ordinate intervention in critical EU matters?  Will the Taoiseach explain this in greater detail and more clearly?</P>
        <P>How many staff in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department and on the public payroll are doing constituency queries or like work?  With regard to the secretary generalship of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, what is the salary level of the new chief of the Department?  In view of how outraged the public has been by the extent of the obscene payments to the predecessor, how does the Taoiseach justify continuing payment of such vast amounts to the tops of the public service when low and middle-income public sector workers are on the one hand struggling but on the other hand being tarred as if they were in the top echelons by the likes of Independent Newspapers and the rest?</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The co-ordination section within the Department of the Taoiseach is not focused just on the Department of Foreign Affairs as the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs retain their responsibilities and this could involve the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  All of these are now concerned directly with decisions that are being taken in Europe and by Europe in respect of directives and regulations and political issues.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>The co-ordination of all of this is, in my view, more effective coming from the Department of the Taoiseach within the responsibilities I have in that regard, rather than having it situated in a specific Department.  It is not a conspiracy, a coup or a takeover but merely a more effective co-ordination of the management of the affairs of Government across all Departments.  That management can be more effective coming from the Department of the Taoiseach while the Ministers retain their responsibilities in so far as European affairs are concerned, in particular matters relevant to their portfolios and their Departments.  The co-ordination of all of that is the reason I made this change.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about the numbers doing constituency office work and their salaries.  That matter is down for written answer today in response to a question from Deputy Ross, or perhaps another Deputy, which will be available to Deputy Higgins.  The Deputy will be glad to know it has reduced from previous times and that, for higher public servants, these salaries have been capped at &euro;200,000, in many cases having being reduced from &euro;285,000, including a further voluntary contribution from &euro;214,000 to &euro;200,000.  Of course, these are now being further reduced with the pension changes being brought in by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is still five times the average industrial wage.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="734"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach was being somewhat disingenuous in saying it is just a co-ordination issue.  Fundamentally, he has taken the entire EU section, which is not just a number of people doing co-ordinating work but is actually the core unit that led for the Department of Foreign Affairs on EU matters and which has now gone to the Department of the Taoiseach.  This has fundamental implications for how the Department of Foreign Affairs works in regard to other international bodies such as the United Nations, the OSCE and a range of other international bodies which have a daily interaction with the EU section.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has not explained how the diplomatic service will fit into this new operation.  It may explain the disquiet from some of his Cabinet colleagues in terms of how quiet the T&aacute;naiste has become at the Cabinet table.  It may be due to the rationale that he is getting less and less to do if various units and sections are being taken from him.</P>

	<P Just="Left">With all due respect to the Deputy, it is my job to try to chair the proceedings fairly on both sides.  I want to ensure Deputies get proper answers.  If they are asking a question and not getting a full answer, I suggest they put down a question to the appropriate Minister.  That is my function.  If the Taoiseach has the information and wants to give it to the Deputy, by all means he may do so.</P>

	<P>I have no problem with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>

	<P>I have already said these are capped at &euro;200,000 and the specific answer to Deputy McDonald&rsquo;s question is in written form because she asked a specific question of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

	<P>The Economic Management Council reports to me, as Taoiseach, and to the T&aacute;naiste in the context of determining the issues with which the council has to deal.  Decisions made at the Economic Management Council will go before Cabinet and, obviously, Cabinet matters and decisions are confidential.  Of course, when Government makes decisions, they become public and Ministers answer for the decisions that are made and will continue to do so.  It is not a case of outlining for the House what is the agenda for any Economic Management Council meeting or any other Cabinet committee.  Once the Government receives reports, proposals or recommendations from any of those meetings or committees and makes decisions on them, they become public and are answerable to this House and to the people by Ministers and the Government as a whole.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
        <P>One request from a Member of the Oireachtas was received in my Department from 9 March 2011 to 31 August.  The answer was issued within the freedom of information timeframe and was part-granted.  The functions relating to freedom of information are carried out in the Department by statutorily designated officials, as envisaged in the Acts, and these officials follow the guidelines set out in the Department of Finance&rsquo;s decision makers manual.  This statutory framework is constructed in such a way as to keep the decision-making process at arm&rsquo;s length from the political head of the Department.  Accordingly, I have no role in respect of the processing of freedom of information requests.  Moreover, there are no plans to change this process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>First, during our last Question Time, the Taoiseach told the House he took no role in seeking the disallowance of questions.  I subsequently made a freedom of information request and discovered the Taoiseach had written to the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office 69 times in six weeks directly asking for Members&rsquo; questions to be disallowed.  In the same period, he transferred 98 questions to other Ministers in order that he would not be obliged to answer them.  While the final decision was not the Taoiseach&rsquo;s, he followed a clear strategy of reducing the areas on which he is obliged to answer questions.  I ask him to withdraw the statement he made in the previous D&aacute;il session that he plays no role in seeking the large-scale disallowance and transfer of questions from Deputies.  He should withdraw formally the statement he put on the record of the House on the previous occasion.</P>
        <P>In addition, although the Taoiseach has been praising himself for six months for saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to President Van Rompuy&rsquo;s text on corporation tax from the Council meeting last March, he has been refusing to show that text to anyone.  In response to a freedom of information request made in August, the Taoiseach again refused to release the Van Rompuy text from the European Council meeting, claiming the rules of the European Council would not allow this.  The problem for the Taoiseach is I also contacted the European Council, which stated it could not supply the text directly but would encourage the national Government to release it.  In this <Col N="738"/>context, will the Taoiseach release the Van Rompuy text?  Will he desist from relying inordinately on freedom of information legislation to avoid putting relevant information before this House on foot of genuine requests from Members?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no intention&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the Taoiseach answers that question, in case anyone gets the impression from Deputy Martin&rsquo;s statement that the Taoiseach wrote to me 68 times, or whatever it was, and in case anyone thinks I am influenced by anyone writing to me, I wish to make it quite clear and to put on record that all Departments regularly, one would hope through the Minister, seek to have questions disallowed.  It goes through a procedure and, in most cases, where possible, we ignore that request.  Consequently, it is wrong to suggest or let the public feel that people lobby me in some way to disallow questions.  This is not true and I do not wish there to be any misunderstanding in this regard.  The only way in which a question is disallowed is if it is not in accordance with Standing Orders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>

	<P>I thank the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It is Deputy Martin who should withdraw his ludicrous charge.  If his questions are placed more accurately in respect of the responsibilities of the Department of the Taoiseach, they will be answered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The clear impression Deputy Martin gave is the Taoiseach was attempting to influence the Ceann Comhairle to transfer questions to other Departments.  The system, as has been outlined by the Ceann Comhairle to the Deputy, has been<i> in situ</i> for a long time, as his own record proves.</P>
        <P>I am unsure what is biting him regarding the secret of Fatima&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>May I explain to the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;in so far as the Van Rompuy text is concerned.  He should at least recognise the interest rate reductions that have been brought about under the EFSF and EFSM are of significant proportions to the Irish people and taxpayers.  While President Van Rompuy made a suggestion regarding a compromise in a difficult situation, it was not in a text that was circulated generally and I have no intention of commenting further on it.  The result has been achieved and is highly significant for the Irish taxpayers and people.  The Deputy should give up from trying to resurrect something that is now of no consequence.</P>

	<P>In the first instance, the fact I read into the record of the House that on foot of a freedom of request, it was revealed the Taoiseach had written 69 times to the Ceann Comhairle should give no one any impression about anything other than this, namely, the reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>What was the purpose of the statement?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="740"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will explain the purpose if the Ceann Comhairle would listen to me.  As I already stated, during the last Question Time, the Taoiseach told the House specifically that he took no role in seeking the disallowance of questions.  This was untrue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not untrue.  Deputy Martin is aware the Taoiseach never even sees them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>He should have stated then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This happens every day of the week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an administrative procedure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I made no inference about influence, lobbying or anything else.  The point is the last time the Taoiseach was in the House, he made a big song and dance to the effect he made no attempt to so do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It happens every single day of the week that questions are disallowed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>He was oblivious to any attempts, giving the impression he is open to answer any question, but he is not.  Since he came to office, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s full track record has been to keep avoiding the answering of questions.  Questions are transferred and healways tries to avoid answering them.  The same is true in respect of freedom of information requests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach does not transfer questions.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;something that is totally and utterly inaccurate.  Every day of the week, I receive a number of requests either to disallow or transfer a question.  This is done strictly in accordance with Standing Orders.  On numerous occasions, questions are being asked of the wrong Minister or of the Taoiseach.  Sometimes, questions are not in accordance with Standing Orders.  This is the only time a question may be disallowed.  One should not allow people to think that questions somehow are being disallowed because people do not wish to answer them.  Every effort is made by me and by my office to ensure a Deputy who asks a question in this House will get an answer.  On many occasions, I request that the Deputy be contacted and a suggestion made to him or her that he or she should transfer the question to someone else in order that he or she may receive a proper answer.</P>

	<P>Deputy Martin has been talking about questions being transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach to other Departments.  Questions Nos. 14 and 15, which are in his name, pertain to freedom of information requests.  I have answered that directly.  A single request was received from the Deputy at my Department between 9 March and 31 August.  It was nothing to do with the transfer of questions.  I have already answered the question on President Van Rompuy who wanted to put forward a view in a difficult situation which was not generally circulated and is now completely and utterly irrelevant in that the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To date the total expenditure by my Department on the visit by President Obama is &euro;125,838.  Of this total spent on catering was &euro;14,483.  The projected cost of the visit of President Obama is approximately &euro;600,000.  The main area of expenditure was the organisation of the large-scale public event in College Green.  To date the total expenditure by my Department on the visit by Queen Elizabeth II is &euro;25,709.  The bulk of this expenditure relates to the catering and transport arrangements for the wreath laying ceremony in the War Memorial Gardens, Islandbridge.  More than 570 guests attended the ceremony.  The total expenditure on catering was &euro;19,709.  These costs must be seen in the context of the historic nature of the visits and the opportunities they presented not only for trade, investment and tourism, but also in enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation and profile at a critical juncture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>What was the total cost?  Members of the Government have referred in previous questions to the overall cost of the visits being in excess of &euro;20 million or &euro;23 million.  The Taoiseach might remind me of the full cost of the two visits.  How much of the total expenditure was spent on food, beverages, entertainment for the various guests and <Col N="743"/>so on?  Does the Taoiseach think it is appropriate that a significant sums of taxpayers&rsquo; money is being spent on wine, alcohol, food and big glitzy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;at the same time as brutal austerity is being imposed on people who are struggling to put food on the table or pay their bills?  It is an aspect of the visit that some of us who were opposed to it are concerned about.  Is it appropriate, given the suffering so many people in the country are going through?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I had to feed the meter at the time which cost me &euro;4.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot believe the Deputy is serious.  The Minister for Justice and Equality indicated the overall cost of the Garda operation arising from the State visits of President Obama and Queen Elizabeth II to be in the region of &euro;36 million.  As the Deputy is well aware, some very unruly characters and dangerous organisations threatened to inflict their agendas on the Irish people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is not associating me with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, in fairness the Deputy told his people to be very peaceful.  I want him to understand that if he wants specific answers with the details of that nature, I am quite sure the Minister for Justice and Equality will answer them in some detail.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question concerned the expenditure by the Department of the Taoiseach and I have outlined the figure to the euro.</P>
        <P>At least &euro;300 million in respect of beneficial coverage for the country was generated.  It emanated from the many thousands of articles and media items given about our people and nation during the course of the two visits, and it will last for many years to come in terms of benefit to the hospitality and tourism sectors, not to mention business and a range of other areas.</P>
        <P>In respect of the cost of the visit to the Department, flowers and wreaths cost &euro;1,182.38; the gift to the Queen of a book on the horseracing industry with particular reference to English racing was &euro;200; coach hire was &euro;2,900; catering was &euro;19,709.44 &mdash; for the rashers, I suppose; printing was &euro;298; and equipment hire was &euro;1,419.  The coaches had to be hired from the evening before the ceremony in order to be security checked which added to the cost.  For security reasons, there was no parking at Islandbridge so guests were transported by coach from the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach and Government should consider the &euro;36 million spent, particularly as it might affect the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the service on our streets.</P>

	<P>I am surprised he would not consider publishing a revised programme for Government, given the fact that he has had several U-turns since the original programme was put in place.  It is a fair point.  The transparent thing to do is to set it down on paper.

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I wager I will never require help from your good self.  In respect of the programme for Government, who pulls the string?  The Taoiseach comes into the Chamber day after day and tells us about the constraints of the EU and IMF or decisions made by the previous Administration.  It seems to be the Taoiseach&rsquo;s catch-all cover on every issue.  Why not have a revised programme for Government?  As the Government has now been <i>in situ</i> for six or seven months and it is very clear that its agenda is essentially that of the previous Administration, why not set this down in clear and transparent terms?  The Taoiseach said he would level with the people.  Would that not be part of the levelling process?</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach says he has no plans to publish a revised programme for Government as the new D&aacute;il session begins.  Why does he have no such plans when it is clear that the programme he borrowed from Fianna F&aacute;il based on austerity is spectacularly failing the people?  There are record numbers on the live register and record numbers of long-term unemployed.  A policy of austerity has been widely discredited by bodies as diverse as UNCTAD, as well as by right-wing economists.  Even defenders of capitalism now realise that austerity has been a disaster, cutting the market and creating massive unemployment by depressing the market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Rather than continuing with these discredited and failed policies, should the Government not introduce a new programme for Government to reverse entirely these disastrous neoliberal policies of slash and burn to pay bondholders?  The Government should take a different course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash; which has the potential to create 6,000 new jobs.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to publish a new programme for Government.  Even Deputy Higgins will have heard some of the soundings from international commentators and some at home who said a few weeks ago the country was going over the edge.  They now see us in a different place from many other countries in Europe.  For the first time there is a growing sense of confidence and our reputation is being restored because Ireland is making progress.</P>

	<P>It is all about reputation in the markets and satisfying them, the sharks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that having 300,000 on the live register who are unemployed is not satisfactory.  I need his help on this and I am sure he will give it.  I am sure those in his constituency will be interested in the legislation dealing with the partial loan guarantee scheme which is to be introduced in coming weeks, the micro-finance system we will introduce, and our efforts to cut red tape, reduce administration, increase competitiveness and employ more people.  While having to deal with the requirements signed off on in terms of numbers, our focus is on getting as many people back to work in the shortest possible time.  This also affects the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency.  As I said, I have no intention of publishing a new programme for Government.  The programme for Government we have in place will restore the country&rsquo;s fortunes and the people&rsquo;s prosperity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>You did not either.  I put it to the Taoiseach that there probably is a need to review the programme.  There are all sorts of commitments coming out about abandoning the Government&rsquo;s commitment to student fees.  In terms of special needs education &mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;there is no need for what is going on there.  A very small amount is needed to sort out that provision.  What is required is a pragmatic response and so on.  Can the Taoiseach indicate whether the comprehensive spending review, in line with the programme for Government, will be published in early October?  There is a need to review it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of the semi-State bodies, the programme for Government is clear that the requirement is to realise &euro;2 billion over the lifetime of the programme for the appropriate sale of non-strategic State assets at a time that the Government considers opportune.  A debate on that during Private Members&rsquo; time will take place this evening and tomorrow.  Deputy McDonald will have all the information that is relevant and on which she can comment during the course of that debate.</P>
        <P>The question Deputy Martin asked does not change my view.  We have a programme for Government; it is a very new and challenging one and we intend to implement it.  The situation in so far as the eurozone is concerned is of very great interest to us and it is being monitored very closely by the Minister for Finance and by the Government in general.  As we prepare for the next visit of the troika, the publication of a fiscal plan for the next three years and the preparation of the Estimates leading to the budget in early December, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will provide opportunities for the House to debate and discuss the decisions we have to take and consider.</P>

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 9 p.m. tonight and shall adjourn not later than 10 p.m.; the proceedings on the Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 14, shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after one hour by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; No. <i>a</i>11 shall be taken immediately upon the conclusion of No. 14 and shall be decided without debate, and the Second Stage of No. 4 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 6.30 p.m. tomorrow and the following arrangements shall apply: the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case, the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case, Members may share time and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five <Col N="751"/>minutes.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed. The implications of this proposed constitutional amendment are very serious.  Very serious concerns have been raised in the course of debate inside and outside this House in respect of natural justice, due process and so on.  The Minister is aware of those concerns and we have put down an amendment in respect of that.  I am concerned that this matter is being rushed.  I understand the wish to put the question to the people on the same day as the Presidential election and the other referenda for efficiency purposes but such is the importance and implications of this measure that the House requires more time to consider this.  An hour to conclude this business is grossly insufficient.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support that view.  This is an issue that should be given as much time as the Members want to deliberate.  Deputy Catherine Murphy has a far-reaching and serious amendment tabled which needs to be discussed and the implications of this also need to be discussed.  Therefore, it is wrong that the Government is starting the second term in the way it carried on in the first with guillotines virtually on a daily basis despite it ranting and raving against Fianna F&aacute;il guillotines for all the years it was in opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to put on record that it is disappointing the degree to which the preparations for this have been so rushed given that it does relate to the amendment to the Constitution.  It is not satisfactory and it flies in the face of all of the rhetoric about D&aacute;il reform and better procedures.  A good deal of time was lost before the summer recess.  We have come back now on a tight time schedule.  I pointed that out in May and June repeatedly.  I seek clarification on when the amendments will be tabled.  It is unsatisfactory that such fundamental issues are being rushed so much.</P>

	<P>The Deputy rushed the meeting today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Public Expenditure wrote to all of the Opposition parties in advance of this and in setting out the position asked for their observations.  This brings to a conclusion the work which was conducted by the then Chairman, for former Deputy Se&aacute;n Ardagh, in respect of an all-party Oireachtas committee dealing with this very matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Three amendments have been tabled: one from Deputy McDonald and two from the Minister.  The first one from the Minister is for a more exact translation of the word &ldquo;inquiry&rdquo; to change it from fiosr&uacute; to imscr&uacute;d&uacute;, which is accurate and should not cause a problem for anybody.  The second amendment from the Minister deals with the amendment which is in the Deputy&rsquo;s own name, while it is implicit in the Government&rsquo;s proposal that there would be adherence to fair procedure in respect of natural justice, what the Minister&rsquo;s amendment does is to make that explicit, it makes it absolutely crystal clear that what is involved is adherence to fair procedure so there should be no reason for any difficulty with any of the three amendments tabled &mdash; two in the Minister&rsquo;s name and his second one deals with the Deputy&rsquo;s own amendment.</P>
        <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. 14 be agreed to,&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
        <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. <i>a</i>11, without debate, be agreed to,&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>

	<P>Subsequent to this, the debate on Committee and Remaining Stages is to be guillotined at 10 p.m.  That allows for approximately two hours to deal with Committee and Remaining Stages.  This seems to be an incredibly short time, given the fundamental importance of the Bill.  I ask the Taoiseach to outline how the Government intends to take Committee and Remaining Stages.  Will it receive or bring forward amendments?  The Fianna F&aacute;il Whip&rsquo;s office received an indication that no amendments would be allowed.  I do not know if other Whips received the same indication.  It would be incredible if that were to be the case.  Before we agree to this proposal, we need to know whether amendments to the European Financial Stability and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2011 are to be accepted.  The Bill deals with fundamental issues across the eurozone.  What signal will it send if the House agrees to guillotine the debate on the Bill after two or three hours tomorrow evening?</P>

	<P>Last June the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, announced that the Government had a plan which he would bring before the House to impose substantial losses on senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  He added that he did not think the taxpayer should have to redeem what had become speculative investment.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether that plan is to be brought before the House or has it been abandoned because European authorities are dead set against it, as the Minister for Finance said on Friday?

	<P>Much of the legislation in this session is on a timeline owing to requirements of the memorandum of understanding with the troika.  Some of these Bills are very comprehensive and quite complex.  I did not want the usual situation where a long list of legislation would be put forward which in reality would not be published.  If there are elements of this that are of concern to Deputies, there are other ways of raising it.  The timescale for what we have to do between now and Christmas is very challenging.  I have said to Ministers that Bills on the A list are those we must get through either owing to the memorandum of understanding or because they are crucial Bills that will be published and can be dealt with.  We cannot deal with the entire list.  That is why the housing Bill is listed for 2012.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Tony McLoughlin &mdash; the need to stimulate job creation measures in the Carrick-on-Shannon area in view of the imminent shedding of jobs at Bank of America; (2) Deputy Joe McHugh &mdash; the closure this autumn of the <i>Irish Post</i> newspaper, which has maintained a link between this island and its 19,000 Irish readers in Britain and between the various Irish groups in Britain; (3) Deputy Robert Troy &mdash; to ask the Minister for Health to outline clearly his future proposals for the existing services at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar; (4) Deputy Michael Lowry &mdash; the decision to close 22 beds in the Community Hospital of the Assumption, Thurles, and six beds in the Dean Maxwell community nursing unit, Roscrea; (5) Deputy Michael McCarthy &mdash; the need to discuss ambulance service cover in the west Cork area, in particular the intention to reduce ambulance services in Skibbereen, the second busiest and occasionally the busiest 999 ambulance station in west Cork, second only to Clonakilty, by withdrawing the ambulance from Skibbereen to Castletownbere from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. and replacing it with a response car which has no patient carrying capability and will be manned by only one paramedic, which would have severe implications and consequences for the west Cork area and which has many local people genuinely fearing that lives will be put at risk; (6) Deputy Mattie McGrath &mdash; the proposed closure of St. Michael&rsquo;s unit; (7) Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan &mdash; the need for the HSE to re-examine the decision to close respite beds in St. Ita&rsquo;s Community Hospital, Newcastle West, and St. Camillus&rsquo;s Hospital, Limerick; (8) Deputy Tom Hayes &mdash; the need for the Minister for Health to outline the impact the closure of St. Michael&rsquo;s psychiatric unit in Clonmel will have on south Tipperary and the health service as a whole in the constituency; (9) Deputy Michael Healy-Rae &mdash; to seek from the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, with regard to the closing down of Meitheal Forbaithe na Gaeltachta, an assurance that he will ensure that local development companies will administer grants at a local level where Meitheal Forbaithe na Gaeltachta left off, given that the most important part of local development is the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; and while the demise of Meitheal Forbaithe na Gaeltachta is regrettable, it is not the title &ldquo;Meitheal Forbaithe na Gaeltachta&rdquo; that made it local but the workforce on the ground delivering the programmes and the services that make it a success, and given also that the most important issue is to maintain the local input to the delivery of both the programmes, whether they are Leader or social inclusion programmes; (10) Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn &mdash; to discuss the impact on community safety of the proposed closure of more than 200 Garda stations, particularly in smaller rural communities such as County Donegal which may lose up to 24 Garda stations according to media reports; (11) Deputy Michelle Mulherin &mdash; the impact of the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Agriculture) Regulations 2011 and whether compensation will be paid to farmers; (12) Deputy Thomas P. Broughan &mdash; the need to secure the safety of residents at Priory Hall, Clongriffin, Dublin 13; (13) Deputy Dessie Ellis &mdash; the pyrite problems facing many home owners and renters; (14) Deputy Catherine Murphy &mdash; the level of qualifications of those teaching mathematics and science; (15) Deputy Michael McNamara &mdash; health care issues in County Clare, in particular, Raheen Hospital; (16) Deputy Dan Neville &mdash; the increase by 4% to 11,966 presentations to hospital due to deliberate self-harm nationally; (17) Deputy Jerry Buttimer &mdash; the roll-out of real time passenger information for bus users outside Dublin; (18) Deputies Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Mick Wallace &mdash; the need to deal with <Col N="760"/>leakages in the water system, particularly in view of the proposed imposition of water charges; and (19) Deputy Timmy Dooley &mdash; the matter of respite beds in Raheen community hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The matters raised by Deputies Catherine Murphy, Michelle Mulherin, Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Mick Wallace, and Thomas P. Broughan have been selected for discussion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>It often comes as a big surprise to parents to discover how the education system works and the manner in which it is structured.  While the Department pays teachers&rsquo; salaries, the latter are not employees of the Department and while the curriculum is decided at national level, responsibility for hiring people competent to deliver it resides with boards of management.  Another issue which arises from the structure of the education system is the absence of common enrolment policies.  The issue I raise is serious because competence in mathematics and science is at question.  Those who have a degree or strong foundation in mathematics or science are most qualified to teach these subjects.  They are, however, the very people who are most likely to find work in industry.  This explains the reason such a high number of such individuals have been enticed from teaching these subjects.  There is not an easy solution to the problem.  We should not learn the lessons that can be learned from countries such as Finland where teachers are held in high respect and recruitment is not a problem across the curriculum.</P>
        <P>The introduction of project maths could attract a significant number of teachers and students to return to the subject of mathematics.  While the project has shown early promise, teachers have expressed concerns that it is being rolled out in a piecemeal manner and that large parts of the syllabus do not fit easily in the curriculum.</P>
        <P>It is highly unsatisfactory that we cannot establish with any degree of certainty the level of competence among science and mathematics teachers.  A survey of only one third of second level schools found that three in every ten teachers did not appear to have attained the standard required to teach mathematics, especially at higher level.  I recall my son telling me about his first day on his engineering course when his lecturer asked half of the students present in the lecture theatre to stand up.  The group was then told that this was the number who would move into second year of the course.  If students do not have a proper foundation in mathematics and science when they start university courses such as engineering, the country loses the potential to bring them through education and into industry.  This loss has serious ramifications for the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising this issue, which provides me with an opportunity to outline some of the ongoing developments in mathematics and science that are most pertinent to the matter she has put forward for debate.  Providing for high quality teaching and learning of mathematics and science is of strategic importance to the State and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue in the House.</P>
        <P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to improve the teaching and learning of mathematics in schools, a number of initiatives have been introduced in recent years.  Deputy Murphy referred to the project maths initiative, the aim of which is to change how mathematics is taught and learned in post-primary schools.  Its purpose is to show how mathematics connects <Col N="761"/>with real life problems and how skills developed in the subject can be used in other subjects, the workplace and at home.  It also aims to change attitudes to mathematics and encourage more students to take the subject at higher level in their examinations and study mathematics and mathematics related subjects in college.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the full roll-out of project maths, which is supported by industry, colleges and universities.  The roll-out of the programme is supported by a comprehensive programme of professional development for all teachers of mathematics.  By the end of 2012, teachers will have been offered six workshops, and a range of supplementary evening courses and teaching resources has been made available.  A bonus points system for mathematics for third level entry has also been introduced on a trial basis.</P>
        <P>The Teaching Council, about which questions have been raised in certain quarters, is an independent body which operates at arm&rsquo;s length to the Department.  The council sets standards for teacher qualifications across the curriculum.  It was established on a statutory basis in March 2006 to promote the professional development of teachers and regulate standards in the profession.</P>
        <P>Under section 38 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, the council shall &ldquo;review the standards of education and training appropriate to a person entering a programme of teacher education and training&rdquo; and &ldquo;review the standards of knowledge, skill and competence required for the practice of teaching and shall advise the Minister&rdquo;.  To be registered as a teacher of mathematics with the Teaching Council, a person is required to have a recognised teaching qualification and degree in which mathematics represents at least 30% of the course over at least three years and which qualifies him or her to teach the syllabus to the highest level.  As part of its ongoing remit, the Teaching Council is reviewing the registration criteria for teaching subjects on the post-primary curriculum, including mathematics and science, and will publish its decisions in this regard as soon as they are finalised.  The appointment and deployment of teachers is a matter for individual schools.  Schools have been directed by my Department, as far as practicable, to appoint only appropriately qualified and registered teachers.</P>
        <P>The Teaching Council recently carried out the survey of post-primary schools to which the Deputy referred to ascertain the qualifications of mathematics teachers.  I acknowledge the rate of response highlighted by the Deputy.  Preliminary results show 68% of teachers teaching mathematics in 258 schools are fully qualified to do so, 29% have undergone some studies in mathematics and only 2% do not have any third level qualifications or studies in mathematics.  The survey findings will help us obtain a clearer picture of what is happening in schools and allow us to plan to meet training needs.  The schools have until 26 September to respond.</P>
        <P>The Department is keen to arrive at a position in which all teachers of mathematics have a qualification in the subject.  It is making arrangements for the provision of a new training programme for mathematics teachers which will provide unqualified mathematics teachers with the opportunity to upskill their knowledge of the subject and study the strategies best suited to the new project maths syllabuses.  Tenders will be invited shortly.</P>

	<P>Will the public service recruitment embargo be an impediment if new recruits are required to address deficiencies in the education system?  Will the embargo be set aside to ensure the level of competency is regularised across the system?</P>
        <P>If one set out to design an education system, one would not design one as fragmented as that which is in place.  We have a disconnect between those who pay teachers and those who employ them.  How did we arrive at a position in which it was considered satisfactory to employ people who did not have the required skill sets?  What strategic changes will be made to the system to ensure this problem does not recur?  While it is fine to have the Teaching Council <Col N="762"/>decide on levels of competence, the boards of management of schools cannot be compelled to employ anyone as they have the freedom to employ whom they wish.  What action will the Department take to address this major difficulty?  This problem could arise again if the disconnect to which I alluded is not addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>We can overcome the challenges facing us notwithstanding the recruitment embargo.  The national centre of excellence in the University of Limerick is doing a great deal of work in the area of continuing professional development to enable teachers to attain the required standard.  In addition, there are conversion courses that can be done.  In this way we can ensure we have a coterie of teachers with the right skill sets to help us to achieve our aims.</P>
        <P>The question of how we got to this point is one that would have to be teased out over a longer time period than the two minutes I have.  However, if we are open to the challenge, which we are, we must find out where we need to go.</P>
        <P>Deputy Murphy raised valid issues about fragmentation, with which I agree.  We must ensure there is standardisation across the board and that the Teaching Council and the individual boards of management are singing from the same hymn sheet in terms of what we need to achieve.  However, I am confident that the Project Maths initiative, in spite of whatever hiccups it may have along the way, will ensure we can help the students currently achieving E, F and NG grades to move up the scale.  I am less concerned about those currently achieving A, B and C grades.  The introduction of bonus points for maths will facilitate those students who choose not to do honours maths because it is time consuming.  They can devote more time to ordinary level maths and still get a reasonable number of points.</P>
        <P>There will be a tender process for training and continuing professional development.  We are engaging with industry and academia in this regard,  but there are challenges.  We will not turn the ship around within the next 12 months.  However, we are engaging with the issue in a deeper fashion than heretofore.  Based on the soundings I have taken outside of the usual advisory groups &mdash; I have delved into academia and sought the views of individual teachers &mdash; there is a sense that if we stay on track with Project Maths, we can tackle the qualitative and quantitative issues involved in getting grades up.</P>

	<P>First, what is the position on the fines ordered against Ireland by the European Court of Justice in November 2008 and what are the legal costs associated with the case and the subsequent proceedings by the European Commission?</P>
        <P>I have sought clarification on the definition of &ldquo;wetlands&rdquo; pursuant to the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Agriculture) Regulations.  The constituency I am from is the largest, geographically, in the country, with large areas of waterways, lakes, rivers and designated land.  The definition of &ldquo;wetlands&rdquo; has a significant impact on counties such as Mayo.  I acknowledge the great work of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, in negotiating with the Commission to allow ordinary reclamation and drainage work on non-designated wetland areas to go ahead, despite the restrictions applied it.</P><Col N="763"/>
        <P>I am asking that the definition of &ldquo;wetlands&rdquo; be kept as restricted as possible because farmers on marginal lands will be affected by this.  We should bear in mind that we are trying to achieve targets under Food Harvest 2020 which would see primary food production increase by over one third, and farmers must be allowed to farm.  It is difficult for anybody not involved in farming or, to qualify it even further, anybody who does not know about marginal land to understand the restrictions on farmers living in designated areas such as SACs, NHAs, Natura 2000 scheme lands and now wetlands.  They cannot build homes or wind farms on their holdings, among other things.  Now, the only thing they were allowed to do &mdash; farming &mdash; has also been restricted.</P>
        <P>In recent years the National Parks and Wildlife Service has placed restrictions on hill farmers on designated lands to avoid overgrazing by sheep.  Now we find that this was totally the wrong tack, as evidenced by the fires that occurred in counties Donegal and Mayo throughout the summer.  The grasslands in question had grown so thickly that they burned easily, and this did more damage than any sheep would ever do on highlands and hills.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service has suggested more sheep be put on the hills that they were taken off before, but this is not an easy thing to do, as they have never been so expensive.</P>
        <P>I suggest the Minister, Deputy Coveney, talk to farmers rather than the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Farmers and their families before them have farmed hills and mountains for centuries.  They know how to farm them and the appropriate numbers of sheep to graze on them, while those from the National Parks and Wildlife Service have spent their lives in carpet up to their noses.  Farmers know how to get the best from the land in terms of productivity and are not out to do damage to the landscape.  In addition, now that the grass has grown so tough, the sheep cannot even eat it; therefore, we could have starving sheep on the sides of mountains.</P>
        <P>The situation at which we have arrived is ridiculous and shows the disconnect between practical farmers and those who sit in offices.  Farmers are not being listened to and are highly frustrated as a result.  It is appropriate that those who are carrying the burden of making sure our environment, ecology and natural heritage remain intact be compensated.  Where they are being restricted in their farming while trying to eke out a living, they should also be appropriately compensated.  This may be a joint effort between the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, but there must be recognition of what farmers are doing.  It is said bureaucracy is ridiculous; this is a case in point.  As politicians, we must listen to those with practical experience and proceed from there.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, is on official business and not in the D&aacute;il today, I have been asked to take this important matter on his behalf.  I thank the Deputy for raising it.</P>
        <P>In its judgment in case C-66/06, delivered in November 2010, the European Court of Justice found that Ireland&rsquo;s system of environmental impact assessment screening for certain categories of agriculture related projects was over-reliant on size thresholds and did not take into account other relevant criteria such as cumulative impacts of development and location relative to sensitive sites.  The case has now been referred back to the court to seek fines for continued non-compliance.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the EIA directive were transposed into Irish legislation by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  Schedule 5 of the 2001 regulations specifies relevant development for the purposes of Part X of the Act which deals with EIAs.  The activities affected by the judgment are the restructuring of rural land holdings, the use of uncultivated land or semi-natural areas for intensive agriculture, and water management projects for agriculture, including irrigation and land drainage.</P><Col N="764"/>
        <P>The European Court of Justice decision necessitated a major reduction in the thresholds for mandatory EIAs and for EIA screening for projects under the mandatory thresholds.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have worked together, in consultation with the European Commission, to fully address the court&rsquo;s findings and ensure Ireland&rsquo;s legislative system and procedures are fully compliant with the directive.  It was agreed that it was more efficient and appropriate to transfer responsibility for most of the activities covered by the judgment such as the restructuring of fields and removal of hedgerows and boundaries, the use of uncultivated land or semi-natural areas for intensive agriculture and normal field drainage works to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as part of its wider management responsibilities for overseeing agricultural activities and integrating environmental considerations into relevant schemes.  It was agreed that it is more efficient and appropriate to transfer responsibility for most of the activities covered by the judgment, such as the re-structuring of fields and removal of hedgerows and boundaries, the use of uncultivated land or semi-natural areas for intensive agriculture and normal field drainage works to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as part of its wider management responsibilities for overseeing agricultural activities and integrating environmental considerations into relevant schemes.  The only element of the judgment retained within the planning system is on-farm development activity that impacts on the drainage or reclamation of wetlands, which are regarded as highly environmentally sensitive areas.</P>
        <P>Following approval by the Oireachtas of the draft regulations, on 8 September 2011 the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government signed the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2011, which introduce a number of amendments to address the ECJ findings in this case.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food also signed, on 8 September, new European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Agriculture) Regulations 2011 which provide for a new system of screening for environmental impact above certain thresholds for different types of agricultural activity, and the requirement for the Minister&rsquo;s consent to be sought and mandatory environmental impact assessment, EIA, to be carried out on such projects at a higher threshold level.</P>

      <sTitle>Water Charges</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="AodhanORiordan"><NameTxt>Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to discuss the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on water leakage.  I am sharing time with Deputy Mick Wallace.</P><Col N="765"/>
        <P>I do not intend to spend much time on this.  In effect, the report suggested that in regard to water leakage, Ireland appears to have twice the OECD average of unaccounted-for water.  It stated that overall the average percentage of unaccounted-for water was approximately 41.48% in 2009, a marginal increase on the 2008 figure of 41.2%.</P>
        <P>I am a great believer in the levering of local charges and believe that local authorities should have the authority so to do.  I am a tax and spend kind of guy.  If one believes in public services, as I do, someone has to pay for them.  I have no issue with the water charge <i>per se</i>.  However, it would be very difficult for us as Deputies working in local areas or as national politicians to convince the public that a water levy or charge or water metering can be justified when the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report indicates such a level of unaccounted-for water.</P>
        <P>Various regions have issues with their water supply.  We are well aware, as will be the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, about the issues in Galway city.  Deputy Michael McNamara assures me that issues relating to the water supply in Ennis are as bad as they ever were.  In my constituency there have been ongoing water pressure issues in the Killester-Donnycarney area.</P>
        <P>It is imperative for us to convince those who will be charged this levy that finances accrued from it will be put back into the water system in order that they may have confidence in it.  I do not find it reasonable that anyone should expect we can front-load that investment before such a levy is in place, but we must ensure the public sees the connection between the charge and the improvement in the service.  If one lives in an area where, as has happened in recent years, there have been annual major water shortages because of the poor water infrastructure in the city, or if one lives in an area where cryptosporidium dances through one&rsquo;s tap on a regular basis, or there is discoloration or whatever, it is very difficult for a public representative to make that connection, especially when people see figures such as these.  We must convince the public that we can ring-fence these moneys for the improvement of the water service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The notion that 40% of the water supply is leaking into the ground is damning and the notion of bringing water from the River Shannon, at a cost of &euro;450 million, only to have almost half of it leaking into the ground in Dublin and places like it, is outrageous.  From building on the streets of Dublin over the years, I know that a great number of the pipes which are old and made of corroded steel must be replaced.  When we were paving the streets, we came across many such pipes but were not allowed to replace them because that was not on the schedule at the time.  At times we could actually see water coming up through the ground.  Even though it would have been part of our work as civil engineering contractors, we were not allowed to change the pipes.  It was a terrible waste.</P>
        <P>If the Government is to do anything about water, surely controlling the level of waste must be a top priority.  I agree with the Government tackling different elements of waste in the system throughout society, but I also believe there must be a greater emphasis on investment in the water infrastructure, tackling the problem of leakage and, at the same time, creating major employment.  Replacing these pipes will be a very labour intensive project, with at least 80% of the cost going for labour and 20% for materials.  It would be a very good move by the Government to get involved in this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for their comments.  As the report yesterday by the Comptroller and Auditor General shows, there is a real problem in Ireland with unaccounted-for water, with losses in 2009 ranging from in excess of 21% to in excess of 58% across counties, a slight increase on the position reported for 2008.  I agree with both Deputies that these levels of leakage are far too high and that progress in addressing the problem has been far too slow.  Tackling this problem was one of the key motivations behind the Government&rsquo;s decision to establish Irish Water.</P><Col N="766"/>
        <P>A significant proportion of unaccounted-for water is due to leaks in the water supply system.  Such leaks can occur in both the mains distribution network and on the customer side of the connections.  Water conservation has been identified as a key priority under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2010 to 2012.  The programme provides for the commencement of water conservation contracts to the value of &euro;321 million over the programme period, subject to the overall budgetary position.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of water conservation is to reduce water loss and leakage in the distribution networks to an economic level and to address high levels of unaccounted-for water.  Reducing leakage to zero would be extremely difficult and prohibitively expensive.  The aim is to achieve an economic level of leakage whereby it costs more to make further reductions in water loss than to produce additional water.</P>
        <P>In the past ten years, &euro;168 million was invested in water conservation.  Most of the effort to date has been focused on putting in  water management systems to allow for active leakage control and better planning of mains rehabilitation.  At this stage, most local authorities have prepared water mains rehabilitation strategies which have allowed a significant acceleration in the approval of mains rehabilitation contracts and works this year.</P>
        <P>Ireland is unique among OECD countries in not charging households for water.  The programme for Government provides for the introduction of water charges based on a new and fair funding model and this is also a requirement of the agreement between Ireland and the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.  The programme for Government proposes that water meters will be installed in households connected to public water supplies and that a new charging system will be introduced with water charges based on usage.</P>
        <P>Experience from the metering of the non-domestic sector and from metering of some group water supplies would suggest that customer side leakage levels are a significant factor in overall unaccounted-for water.  Installing water meters encourages households to reduce consumption, use water efficiently and fix leaks where these are identified.  Metered charges are also the fairest way to charge for water.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is preparing a strategy to implement the new charging regime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AodhanORiordan"><NameTxt>Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I will comment only briefly because I took up so much of Deputy Wallace&rsquo;s time.  I thank the Minister of State for his reply but I still maintain that a large-scale engagement with the public is needed to make the connection between the charge and the investment necessary for solving the displacement problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>In the current economic climate, given the effect of austerity measures on the ordinary people of this country and given that any money raised from water metering is unlikely to come back into the system and help to improve it, we should concentrate on fixing the pipes, introducing more cost-effective measures and more environmentally friendly ways of providing water supplies for households.  The latter would also help to create a great deal of employment.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> contains an article by Paul Krugman in which he discusses austerity measures and emphasises the need for growth-oriented policies.  I am of the view that a major investment on the part of the Government in dealing with water wastage would represent money well spent in both the short and long term.  Everyone states that it will cost too much to deal with this problem.  Everything costs too much now but, in the long term, an investment of the nature I have outlined would be money well spent.</P>

	<P>I agree with what the Deputies have said.  In my capacity as Minister of State, I visited the counties with the highest levels of unaccounted for water.  I have already visited areas in Roscommon, south Tipperary, Kilkenny and Galway and I intend to travel to other counties.</P>
        <P>It is essential that this matter be addressed.  I agree that if we can attract buy-in from the public in respect of this process, it must be based on a programme of significant and planned reductions in the levels of unaccounted for water over a period of years.  I have discussed this matter with a number of local authorities and I have been informed that it may take more than a couple of years to bring about such reductions.  This is due to the fact that when one water main is repaired, another will burst and so on.  The Deputies are correct that a better and more progressive system which is fairer and efficient must be put in place.</P>
        <P>I wish to point out to Deputy Wallace that I have been informed that much of the infrastructure relating to newer builds is quite bad.  I know the Deputy, in the context of any construction projects with which he is or was involved, is not culpable in this regard.  However, many of the materials used by certain builders have proven to be substandard and this will give rise to significant problems when we begin to introduce water metering.  When the Government receives and discusses the report it commissioned in respect of Irish Water, the relevant committee will engage in a full debate on it in order that any and all issues of concern to Members might be listened to and, if possible, acted upon.</P>

	<P>I attended a packed meeting of very anxious and upset Priory Hall residents in the Hilton Airport Hotel on the Malahide Road on Thursday night last.  Priory Hall is a relatively new residential apartment complex of 187 units &mdash; it was built by the Coalport Building Company Limited &mdash; in the huge new North Fringe district in the constituency of Dublin North East and included among its residents are owner-occupiers, private tenants, Dublin City Council and RAS tenants and citizens who bought their homes through affordable housing schemes.  Within months of the first residents moving in, serious complaints were made about defects and safety issues at Priory Hall.  The Dublin city fire safety chief described the north and south blocks of the complex as &ldquo;potentially dangerous&rdquo; and stated that remedial works were urgently required to address the appalling safety deficit that exists.</P>
        <P>In December 2009, Dublin City Council moved its tenants and clients out of Priory Hall on safety grounds and commissioned a report by Hayes Higgins Partnership on the alleged serious fire safety defects in the residential units in the complex, which Dublin City Council owns.  On 27 July last, the city council&rsquo;s housing and planning departments made a presentation on the Hayes Higgins report to me, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny, Councillor Brian McDowell and other local representatives.  To say that we left the meeting profoundly shocked and stunned would be an understatement.  We all undertook to have residents immediately informed of the appalling litany of structural, electrical and gas safety defects in the Dublin City Council units of the complex and we urged the council to immediately inform private owners and renters of the position and, if necessary, to evacuate the buildings.</P>
        <P>At the meeting I attended on Thursday last, senior housing officials from Dublin City Council, including housing and assistant city manager, Mr. Dick Brady, outlined key findings of the report.  Residents asked that the report be published immediately.  A number of residents who were present at the meeting inquired directly of the council&rsquo;s officials whether it was safe <Col N="768"/>for them and their families to spend one more night in the complex.  I wish to direct the same question to the Minister of State on their behalf.  The residents also want to be informed about the action being taken in respect of the architects that worked on the project, the entire self-certification process and the people who allegedly signed off on safety standards in the complex.  This is an urgent and profoundly serious matter and I hope the Minister of State will be able to provide us with some support in respect of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for the immediate release of the report commissioned by Dublin City Council from Hayes Higgins Partnership &mdash; Consultant Engineers, to all apartment owners in Priory Hall.  To date, Dublin City Council has refused to provide this based on legal advice it received.  I request that the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, and Dublin City Council, advise owners and, in particular, owner occupiers who are obliged to honour monthly mortgage commitments whether suitable alternative accommodation will be provided for them if further defects are identified when the final report is received.  It must be borne in mind that residents who may be obliged, on foot of the findings in the final report, to vacate their homes in the event of an emergency will require immediate accommodation.  Taking a place on the housing list will really not be an option for them.</P>
        <P>I call on Dublin City Council to take a civil action against the Coalport Building Company Limited., and-or the architect who certified the development in accordance with the building regulations.  This action should be taken solely with a view to protecting the council&rsquo;s interests.  From a cost point of view, it would make better sense if homeowners who, due to their current circumstances, are not in a position to obtain legal advice could join the city council in taking the action to which I refer.  Who, if anyone, will undertake the repairs necessary to the buildings in the complex &mdash; if they are deemed to be repairable &mdash; in a scenario where the Coalport Building Company Limited has not and, it appears, will not attend to those repairs?</P>
        <P>The residents of Priory Hall are at crisis point and the dilemma in which they find themselves is whether to default on their mortgages &mdash; thereby rendering themselves unable to obtain credit in respect of crucial items, such as another family home, for the remainder of their lives &mdash; or to continue to live in buildings which are unsafe as a result of non-compliance with fire safety regulations, faulty gas and electric installations and defective construction.  Many of the owner-occupiers are struggling financially and are unable to obtain comprehensive legal advice.  While some residents have received preliminary legal advice, most of them cannot afford to instruct a solicitor.  Some solicitors who have been approached are unwilling to take a case against the Coalport Building Company Limited, and-or Thomas McFeely because in previous litigations Mr. McFeely has not paid compensation to plaintiffs and has a number of judgments against him personally, most notably one relating to the ACC Bank for the sum of &euro;6.2million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Penrose, who is currently in the Seanad.  I thank Deputies Broughan and Se&aacute;n Kenny for their contributions.  I will bring to the attention of the Minister of State their deep concerns and those of their constituents.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, Dublin City Council has initiated legal proceedings regarding compliance with planning permission and fire safety regulations in respect of the development at Priory Hall.  The enforcement proceedings are still before the courts.  The building regulations set out the legal requirements for the design and construction of new buildings, including houses, extensions and material alterations and certain changes of use of existing buildings.  The related technical guidance documents provide guidance on how to comply with the regulations.  Compliance with the regulations is the responsibility of the owner or builder of a building.  Enforcement of the regulations is the responsibility of the 37 local building control authorities. <Col N="769"/> In the case of Priory Hall, responsibility rests with Dublin City Council which is empowered to carry out inspections and to initiate enforcement proceedings where it is considered necessary.  It is understood that Dublin City Council is continuing to actively investigate possible non-compliance with the requirements of the Building Control Acts in respect of this development.  Where building defects occur, their remediation is a matter for the parties concerned &mdash; namely, the building owner, the relevant developer and the builder&rsquo;s insurers &mdash; in line with any contractual arrangements agreed between the parties.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council, as a property owner in Priory Hall, commissioned a building survey in conjunction with a number of other property owners in the complex who agreed to participate in the survey on a fee-paying basis.  The report has been recently submitted to the council and copies have been forwarded to those owners who participated in the survey.  The question of further publication or dissemination of the report does not, therefore, arise.  Any further action in respect of the issues which have arisen in regard to this development would be a matter for Dublin City Council to deal with, as appropriate, in line with the standard arrangements in place for the discharge of its statutory functions.  The Minister of State has no specific function with regard to the investigation or prosecution of offences under the Building Control Acts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The residents and the 200 families in question feel deeply let down by the regulatory, planning, building control and fire safety systems, which allowed people to self-certify buildings that were grossly badly constructed and may be dangerous, frankly.  We need to reassure them.  I will come back to the original question I posed.  Is the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government concerned that people in these buildings could be in danger tonight and from now on?  Can necessary actions be taken as a matter of urgency?  Can buildings that are unfit for purpose be condemned?  I commend the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on the establishment of a working group on buildings infected by pyrites.  It was a good move.  It was the start of something for which I have been calling since the crisis started five or six years ago.  Could something similar be done in the case of Priory Hall?  I suggest that the Department could assist Dublin City Council to lead a set of actions that would make the building safe, reassure these citizens and rehouse them if necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Priory Hall case demonstrates that certain aspects of the building control regulations, particularly the self-certification process, are clearly not working.  This became clear during the building boom when light touch regulation was favoured.  We are now seeing the effects of the failure to comply with basic safety regulations.  I refer, for example, to the requirement that an isolation handle, which allows one to switch off the gas in the event of a fire, be provided when a gas connection is being installed.  Similarly, many electrical installations were not earthed in the manner that is required.  That could have serious consequences in the event of a fire.  All of the building control regulations should be put on a statutory basis, as provided for in the legislation that established them.  It is clear that self-certification, which was initially provided after difficulties arose, does not work.  We have seen that in other fields.  We should consider putting the regulations on a proper statutory basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Deputies Broughan and Kenny that I take what they have said very seriously.  I will bring their remarks to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose.  He will be deeply concerned about the manner in which things have been done in this estate.  As I indicated earlier, the remediation of defects of this kind is a matter to be dealt with by the parties concerned &mdash; the owner of the building in question, the relevant developer and the builder&rsquo;s insurer &mdash; in line with any contractual arrangements.  It is appropriate that Dublin City Council be allowed to deal with the prosecution of alleged non-compliance with <Col N="770"/>planning permission, fire safety regulations and building regulations in line with the standard arrangements for the discharge of its statutory functions.  Since he took up office, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has clearly signalled that consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings is a priority matter.  He has taken a number of steps to strengthen the situation.  Mandatory certificates of compliance for builders and designers of buildings, demonstrating that the statutory requirements of the building regulations have been met, have been introduced.  Provision has been made for more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective and meaningful oversight of building activity.  Standardised approaches and common protocols have been put in place to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions.  There also have been measures relating to the support and further development of building control functions nationwide.  The Minister is determined to strengthen the building control system to ensure problems like those that have arisen at Priory Hall do not visit home owners again.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I am not a great believer in putting a whole lot of things into the Constitution.  Having said that, if we are going to have these things in the Constitution, safeguards have to be in place.  If primary legislation were to be used to describe and set the rules in this regard, it could be changed.  I have concerns about some of the things we are doing in this respect.  I am attempting to address some of those concerns in this amendment.  The phrase &ldquo;having regard to the provisions of this Constitution&rdquo; is a key one in this amendment.  In the absence of such a wording, there is no safeguard to ensure that any use of Oireachtas inquiries must have due &ldquo;regard&rdquo; to other rights enshrined in the Constitution as a whole.  I have real concerns about that.</P>
        <P>We need to give clear directions to the Judiciary.  Our job is to make legislation and the job of the Judiciary is to interpret it.  We have to provide clear instructions.  The ability of the Houses of the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries does not over-ride any provision in the Constitution.  We need a wording that ensures the protection of the Constitution can be invoked if any portion of the new powers being bestowed on the Oireachtas is applied in a manner that is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.</P><Col N="773"/>
        <P>It is important to make it clear that we respect the constitutional rights of the citizens of this country.  We are not in dispute about the fact that this is being done in the common good &mdash; we are considering what the Bill actually says.  When this amendment to the Constitution is put before the people and passed by them, 20 years might pass before the need to use it arises.  It will not necessarily be used by this Government, which has a large majority.  That is part of the reason I am proposing that any inquiry be approved by 90% of Members.  Any reference to the Oireachtas should mean precisely that &mdash; it should not mean that the Executive more or less decides the terms of reference of an inquiry.</P>
        <P>I will give an example.  There were terrible abuses in the planning system some years ago.  Material contraventions would be passed by one part of a county and all that kind of stuff.  It was essentially decided that two thirds of councillors had to vote in favour of a material contravention.  I think that has worked very well.  It has got broad agreement.  That is really what we should be trying to achieve.</P>
        <P>There should not be a presumption that the Opposition will oppose something that may be in the national interest.  The inquiry system should not be used frivolously.  It should be used occasionally and in a thought-out manner.  If it is over-used, its value may well be reduced.  That is why I have provided for a number.  I was trying to achieve a degree of inclusiveness within the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I have referred to the key line, &ldquo;having regard to the provisions of this Constitution&rdquo;.  A number of sections of the Constitution, including Articles 43.1, 43.2, 34 and 39, need to be read side by side with this.  However, it is not at all clear that is what is intended.  I am not satisfied the legislation is sufficient, separate from the Constitution, from that point of view.</P>
      
        <P>On the intention not to impose criminal sanctions, it should be explicitly stated that there is a limit to the consequences of the findings that any inquiry can make.  It is important that we make it clear that we do not cross the line between civil and criminal sanctions.  That is something that could be open to interpretation and I also have concerns about that.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>It is vital that the right to appeal, even a judicial review of something, is enshrined in the Constitution.  What was intended, if I recall the briefing correctly, is that the only matter on which the courts could adjudicate was the issue of natural justice.  I accept that in the briefing we were told it was intended this would have to be an issue of serious importance.  It is about ensuring that there is trust among the citizens of this country and certainty about the laws we pass, particularly when they relate to matters we ask the people to put in the Constitution.  We must then provide the laws around which to make the rules.  The people must have certainty.  After all, the Constitution is the cornerstone of the legal system.  We have an obligation to put safeguards into the wording, if it is to give the kind of certainty the citizens of this country deserve.</P>
        <P>That, more or less, is a broad brush stroke of what I intended in framing this amendment.  I have difficulty with the Bill outside of that and I have made that clear throughout the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for the amendment and for the clear exposition of her position.</P>
        <P>I regret that I did not have a chance to respond to Second Stage, the way it fell last week.  I want to say a few words about the genesis of this proposal.  Anybody who knows me over time will be aware that I am interested in the development of Parliament and the re-balancing of the powers of Parliament and of the Executive.  The Executive has dominated Parliament for too long in this country.</P>
        <P>One of the roles of this Parliament, both Houses, is to hold the Executive to account.  It seems that in the past, parties in Opposition have always wanted to strengthen the hand of <Col N="774"/>Parliament and to weaken the relative power of the Executive and as soon as they get into power they abandon that principle. It is to hold true to that principle that this proposal and many more come from this side of the House.</P>
        <P>The genesis of this is that I believe in the right of Parliament to make inquiries.  I was involved in several inquiries in this House.  I was also involved in the Abbeylara committee that was struck down.  One can have views on whether it was appropriate to have an inquiry into that instance, but the Oireachtas said, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, and we set it up.  What happened as a result is that the very power of the Oireachtas to hold any inquiries, basically, the intrinsic inherent power of Parliament to hold inquiries, was questioned by the courts and, in fact, found to be wanting because there was no implicit power in the Constitution to hold inquiries.  That made it virtually unique among parliaments.</P>
        <P>All parliaments have to hold Ministers to account and have to hold inquiries into matters of public importance, and we need to restore that.  The crafting, the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of that, was subject to a year&rsquo;s debate within the previous D&aacute;il on the Joint Committee on the Constitution chaired by former Deputy Ardagh.  That involved a thoughtful process, with all parties involved and bringing in legal experts.</P>
        <P>We did not want to replicate a tribunal system in the House which would take years, that could be frustrated and that needed a re-balancing of the public interest against the private interest of individuals who, if they had access to enough lawyers, could frustrate for ever the culmination of an inquiry.  That is a careful balance to strike because one does not want to have an oppressive system.  The words that we crafted carefully, I believe, achieve that balance.</P>
        <P>Later we will deal with Deputy McDonald&rsquo;s thoughtful amendment, about which I have been thinking since I read the Second Stage contributions and much of the learned opinion about it, and I want to set out my case in that regard.</P>
        <P>To deal with the amendment before us directly, I commend Deputy Murphy on a fine attempt.  It is not an easy matter to craft a constitutional amendment.  I have the help of the Attorney General and the legal officers of the State in my efforts to do it. Honestly, I do not believe what she has produced will do anything to allow us to hold inquiries.  For a start, I understand what she means when she states that it should not be a simple majority of the House that would determine it, but the notion that one needs 90%, in other words, a blocking minority of one tenth of the membership, means that one would never have an inquiry.  A blocking minority could be directly involved in the inquiry.</P>
        <P>Parliament would not work on that basis.  We elect the Taoiseach by simple majority.  The highest hurdle in the Constitution currently is the process to impeach the President.  It requires only a two-thirds majority to impeach a President, which is an overthrowing of the vote of all of the people of the country.  That is the highest hurdle by far.  We can dismiss judges of the superior courts with a simple majority.  That is the way parliament works in virtually every jurisdiction &mdash; there are exceptions in some jurisdiction for good reason.  To do as Deputy Murphy suggests would frustrate any form of inquiry.</P>
        <P>Deputy Murphy made a number of specific points.  On the point that it should not impose criminal sanction, it is out of the question for any committee of this House or this House to impose criminal sanctions.  The separation of powers is crystal clear in the Constitution and that would not arise in any event.</P>
        <P>Clause 5&deg; of her proposal, on having the right of appeal, is implicit in the Constitution.  She was correct to mention other articles of the Constitution which enumerate all citizens&rsquo; rights, many of which have been the subject of very careful analysis by the courts over decades.  They will not be dislodged in any iota by the proposals we are inserting.  The fundamental principle <Col N="775"/>of constitutional justice is that this new section must be read, to use not a legal term but the term lawyer&rsquo;s use, harmoniously with other enactments.  For example, the well established clear rights to due process and fair procedures given under the Constitution in Article 40.3 are implicit in this process, are not dislodged in any way by it.  Anybody can go &mdash; not at the end of the process but at any time in the process, beginning, middle or end &mdash; to have his or her good name vindicated in the courts, to have it checked.</P>
        <P>We have sought to have in that mix, when that adjudication is taking place, that the public interest be weighed into the balance as opposed to the exclusive notion of the rights of an individual &mdash; sometimes the rights of the individual might run counter to the public interest &mdash; only in this narrow way to ensure effective inquiry.  It is a very limited re-balancing of procedural rights that would flow from our proposals.</P>
        <P>This constitutional amendment, in its totality, does a few simple things.  It gives explicit right to the Houses of the Oireachtas, either individually or collectively, to hold an inquiry into a matter of stated public importance.  It addresses the issue of specific authority and objective bias.  It allows individuals to be investigated in such a matter or their conduct to be investigated in such inquiries, and it allows conclusions to be drawn.  All of that, in terms of the rights of individuals, is subject to their inalienable rights, not only under the Constitution but under international law to which we are subject as well.  In fairness, on the argument that this pushes too much the way of the Oireachtas, my fear is that at the end of the day it will not be far enough in the way of the Oireachtas.  It is an important start to allow for proper inquiries here such as those which take place in virtually every other jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>The Deputy made several other points, including one on procedures.  This matter was raised on a television programme last night with regard to the terms of reference.  The Government &mdash; we are collectively agreed on this &mdash; is keen to strengthen the arm and the hand of Parliament.  Contrary to what was said by some people externally, the terms of reference of any inquiry will not be determined by the Government.  I understand my officials will brief the oversight committee tomorrow on the process and procedures to be followed.  I have gone before it and explained the draft heads of the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let me explain the process.  A committee of the House, whether of an individual House or both Houses, will determine that a matter is of such public importance that it must be investigated.  For example, it could be an issue to do with the health service or something else and the relevant health committee would make its case to the oversight committee.  Then it would be exclusively a matter for the oversight committee to determine whether the case had been validly made and whether the issue merited an inquiry.  I agree fundamentally with the Deputy.  This would not be a regular occurrence.  The oversight committee would set the terms of reference.  The committee is chaired by a member of Deputy McDonald&rsquo;s party.  I indicated last week that it should not operate a Whip on the basis of this important work.  There would be no veto or inputs from the Government; it would be a matter for the Houses to determine the matter.  That committee would set the parameters in respect of expenditure, lawyers and costs in terms of what could be paid to lawyers and so on.  Eventually the matter would be presented to the House which would make a final determination.  In a case where the oversight committee said &ldquo;No&rdquo;, that would be the end of the matter and there would be no appeal beyond this, as I explained last week.  The process is very much in the domain of the Houses for the first time and it will work out well.</P>
        <P>The heads of the Bill are carefully crafted in all its steps to achieve this end.  The words in the Schedule under debate are to the effect that each House shall have the power to conduct an inquiry or an inquiry with the other House in the manner provided for by law into any matter stated by the House or Houses concerned to be of general public importance and that <Col N="776"/>in the course of any such inquiry the conduct of any person, whether a Member of the House, may be investigated.  These are the issues which arose during the Abbeylara judgment, as well as whether the authority was explicit to inquire into people who were not Members of either House.  We are putting the matter beyond doubt.  This may be investigated and the Houses concerned may make findings in respect of the conduct of the person concerned concerning the matter to which the inquiry relates.  The only issues it may examine or the only findings it may make relate to the conduct related to the issues under investigation.</P>
        <P>The final area I propose to amend for the avoidance of doubt outlines that it is implicit in due process that fair procedures must be applied.  All legal advice I have suggests as much.  However to be explicit I will recommend to the House that we include it in the Constitution.  The words are to the effect that it will be for the House or Houses concerned to determine the appropriate balance between the rights of the person and the public interest for the purpose of ensuring an effective inquiry into the matter to which subsection (2) applies.  The balancing between individual rights and the public interest carried out by the House relates only to ensuring there is an effective inquiry into the matter.  It is a narrow balancing that must be carried out.  It will be an important advance for the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I am keen to allow sufficient time to deal with the other amendments because they are important and I have no wish for there to be any confusion in the public domain after this debate.  For reasons I will explain I do not propose to accept Deputy Murphy&rsquo;s amendment.  I do not believe objectively it meets the requirement to have a robust inquiry system.  It would ensure simply that the system would not work.</P>
        <P>This new avenue of inquiry which, please God, will be available should the House in the first instance and the people in the second instance vote for it will be only one means of public inquiry.  There could still be a formal tribunal or an investigation under the 2004 Commissions of Investigation Act which was used for the Murphy tribunal or it could be this model.  It will be a matter for the Houses to decide which is the best vehicle to serve the public need for inquiry.</P>
        <P>By way of completeness, the process will involve a private investigation of facts and fact-finding in the first instance.  It will be analogous to what happened during the DIRT inquiry when the Comptroller and Auditor General gathered the information objectively and in private and that was the basis for the inquiry.  It would be up to the oversight committee to appoint or recommend the appointment to the House of an investigator which could be the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Ombudsman, who may have something to say about several matters, as we have seen.  Her conclusions could be the basis for an investigation.  It could be one of her routine reports.  I have held discussions with the Ombudsman on this matter.  Depending on the area involved, it could be a medical or legal expert who would carry out the fact-finding and that could be the basis for objectively presenting the evidence that would form the core briefing document or the body of evidence that could be the basis of the inquiry.  This should be a reasonable and fair process.  It is carefully balanced and I hope the Deputy will be convinced not to pursue her amendment and that the merits of the amendment I have asked the House to support are clear.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>The point about the 90% figure and the process to which the Minister referred is helpful.  I recall being at a Whips meeting some weeks ago at which I argued against something.  I was told this was the way it was going to be, that the Government had the numbers and that that was the way it worked.  The problem is that it is a numbers game.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have specifically designed this in order that it cannot be a numbers game.  However, we cannot have the tyranny of the minority either.  The tyranny of the majority is one thing, but the notion that a 10% minority could overrule a 90% majority is worse because it would be a negation of fundamental democracy.</P>
        <P>The construct of this inquiry system is taking away from the Government.  I remember trying to craft the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal which, remarkably, examined my conduct as a Member and that of the then Deputy Jim Higgins but which excluded the conduct of the then Minister for Justice.  It is to get away from such occurrences that I propose that it should not be the Executive that would make the decision but a committee of the House in a public forum.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make one final point on the explicit use of the term &ldquo;having regard to the other provisions of the Constitution&rdquo;.  I am concerned that in the absence of stating as much an interpretation is possible that it is exclusive to this rather than looking at the totality.  This is a serious concern for me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me deal with that issue front-up because it is a simple matter.  It is an absolute established convention that all articles of the Constitution must be read harmoniously.  It is the same in law with the Interpretation Act.  This determines how law is interpreted across potentially conflicting statutes.  The Constitution must be read harmoniously.  There is no doubt that the established rights under Article 43 of the Constitution on fair procedures must be vindicated.  Equally, there is no doubt that every citizen has the right of access to the courts to have the point tested.  I am proposing an amendment which I am legally advised is unnecessary but which I propose to make for the sake of absolute clarity and to address an issue fairly made by Deputy McDonald.  The amendment will write the clause on fair procedures into the constitutional amendment itself.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This is a technical amendment which relates to the Irish translation of subsection 3&deg; of the Schedule.  In this subsection, the term &ldquo;fiosr&uacute;&rdquo; is used to translate the word &ldquo;investigate&rdquo;.  This is likely to cause confusion as &ldquo;fiosr&uacute;&rdquo;  is also the Irish term used to translate the word &ldquo;inquiry&rdquo; in the same subsection.  To avoid any such confusion, it is now proposed by the translation <Col N="778"/>service, and I propose it here, that the Irish word &ldquo;imscr&uacute;d&uacute;&rdquo; be inserted for the word &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; in subsection 3&deg;.  I am advised the term &ldquo;imscr&uacute;d&uacute;&rdquo; is the official Irish term for &ldquo;investigation&rdquo;.  The use of the clearly defined legal term &ldquo;imscr&uacute;d&uacute;&rdquo;, namely, the word for &ldquo;investigation&rdquo;, would greatly enhance the resilience of the amendment in regard to possible legal challenges.

        <P LI="1">In Part 2, page 6, line 26, after &ldquo;determine&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, with due regard to the principles of fair procedures,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of the proposed amendment is to make explicit that the balancing rights between the persons and the public interest in full parliamentary inquiries must be consistent with the constitutional principles of fair procedures.  As I said, I was advised strongly that this was implicit in the proposed wording of the referendum Bill that was disseminated because they are rights that are guaranteed under Article 40.3 of the Constitution.  By explicitly stating that the House is determining the appropriate balance and will in that determination have due regard to the principles of fair procedures, we are ensuring there is no question mark or doubt over the fact that fair procedures and the rules of natural justice must be respected in any form of inquiry that puts good name or reputation at risk or in the balance in any shape or form.</P>
        <P>This amendment also highlights the basis on which any judicial review on the balancing exercise would rest and, in so doing, addresses the first question, given that some people were of the view that somehow that subsection ousted the courts from their overview.  My very strong advice from the Attorney General and all legal advice is that this could not be the case.  However, to insert this wording gives a clear, explicit basis for such oversight, although it is implicit in any event.  It was never the intention nor could it ever have been the result of the original wording to exclude any role for the courts in that process.</P>
        <P>I have stated on many occasions that it has always been our intention that the manner in which the Oireachtas strikes the balance between the rights of the person and the public interest is reviewable by the courts.  It will be a difficult process, as I said to the chair of the oversight committee when I appeared before it.  I told him that, in all likelihood, in the years to come <Col N="779"/>the chair of that committee would be making the odd trip down to the Four Courts to justify the balancing exercises or determinations that are required.</P>
        <P>Clearly, it was never the objective to create what might be called an exclusion zone for the courts, nor could it be.  However, it is to put into the weighing scales, so to speak, the public interest argument so that in determining the balance in the first instance, the matter must be given to the committee.  This is why the notion the courts would somehow make real-time decisions on a daily basis when there are matters like this to be determined is incorrect.  As the tribunals operate, it must be for the committee, which has devolved power from this House, the other House or both Houses, to make that real-time decision.  Where that is in question, it will be a matter for the courts to ensure it is done in a constitutional fashion.  That is where we are coming from.</P>
        <P>I am very aware of the points raised by Deputy McDonald and many of her colleagues during the Second Stage debate in regard to the balance between the rights of the person and the public interest contained in the published constitutional amendment.  This is why I have reflected on what she has said and on what has been written subsequently.  Some legal purists say one should not do what is unnecessary, and if it is implicit, one should not make it explicit.  As the Ceann Comhairle knows too well, constitutional lawyers weigh words in the Constitution like precious metals, and if one was to insert extra words, one would have to make a convincing argument for them because every word has a value.  I believe that to give comfort to the electorate, what is being done here is to preserve absolutely the full constitutional rights of individuals and to ensure clear procedures will be an intrinsic form of the balancing act that will fall to the Oireachtas in determining the balance between individual rights and the common good in so far as the narrow issue of conducting an inquiry in an effective manner arises.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate this issue is dealt with by the amendment I suggest.  I have asked the legal service to look particularly at Deputy McDonald&rsquo;s amendment and the legal service very strongly advised me that the wording I now suggest is the correct and constitutionally better way of achieving what I believe is the desired objective of Deputy McDonald.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>We are entirely supportive of the Government&rsquo;s effort to ensure the Oireachtas can conduct investigations and inquiries in a timely and productive fashion.  There is no question that the Abbeylara judgment had to be addressed and I believe the Government is doing the right thing in seeking to address it.  None the less, I share many of Deputy Catherine Murphy&rsquo;s concerns that there would be any attempt to create something that could be described as a Star Chamber or that would trample on the rights of individuals to fair procedures and natural justice.</P>
        <P>We are discussing the content of a constitutional amendment and, for the purposes of our discussion, it is important we stay on that terrain.  Obviously, the legislation as proposed will have to be gone through with a fine-tooth comb to address the types of issues the Deputy has raised in terms of the internal process and the inclusion of Members of the Oireachtas and so on.  I very much welcome the fact the Minister, in a very upfront way, indicates a balance will be struck and that there will be inclusion in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware that my concern from the get-go has been that in circumstances where the Oireachtas takes to itself a power to balance the public interest and the private interest, this must not just be stated implicitly.  I accept the arguments around Articles 34 and 40, and I understand equally there was never an attempt to sideline the judicial process.  None the less, it is essential it is stated explicitly in the Constitution that in carrying out this balancing exercise, the Oireachtas is constitutionally obliged to have to the foremost the provisions around fair procedure.  It is welcome that the Minister has listened to Members&rsquo; concerns and tabled this amendment.  Were I to be egocentric about it, I might argue the point and state my wording is <Col N="780"/>better than that of the Minister.  However, I accept he has available to him the advice of the Attorney General and other expertise.  The critical point is that the matter of fair procedure is addressed.  This goes to the heart of many concerns the public will have in this regard.  While Members wish to see the public interest well served and seek an Oireachtas that has teeth and powers, that can compel witnesses and make findings, equally the public needs an absolute reassurance the rights of individuals will be upheld and vindicated and that there will be a brake on the new Oireachtas power to engage in that balancing exercise.  I am satisfied the Minister has achieved this aim in his proposed amendment.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by noting a point raised both during the Order of Business and in previous debates on this issue on how careful one must be when amending the Constitution and how it should not be a rushed matter.  Even as Members debate this issue on this Stage, I still consider it to have been rushed.  I accept it has had a long history, but in this current phase and for new Members such as me, I consider the process to have been rushed.  For as long as the rights of the individual are vindicated, implicitly understood and explicitly stated, I welcome and support the Government proposal to put this matter to the people who I hope will support it.</P>

	<P>I do not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the opportunity to make a few brief comments on this matter because Members discussed it well on Second Stage and it is a relatively short amendment.  The essence of what has been proposed is the inclusion of the phrase, &ldquo;with due regard to the principles of fair procedures&rdquo;.  The amendment is all about fair procedures and I take on board fully the observation made by Deputy McDonald that Members are not debating the enabling Bill&rsquo;s contents.  However, I note there will be no opportunity to debate that Bill&rsquo;s contents prior to polling.  While I understand the Minister intends to publish the enabling legislation, it cannot be enacted before polling day.  It will be in the public arena in order that the public will have an opportunity to examine it and after the referendum which I hope will be passed, the aforementioned legislation will come before the House for detailed discussion.  However, one should be clear it will be extremely difficult to change its contents after it has been in the public arena, having formed the basis on which people were reassured as to how they might vote.  The issue is it will not be like normal legislation when it returns to the House.  Members may wish to table amendments on Committee and Remaining Stages and in normal circumstances, the Minister might be inclined to accept them.  However, at that point he will be obliged to be mindful that the legislation has been in the public arena.  The people will have been given an opportunity to read, study and digest it to understand how the constitutional amendment would be given effect.  Consequently, it will be extremely difficult at that point to unravel legislation which had been placed in the public arena.  While normal procedures will be followed in this House for Committee and Report Stage amendments, my impression is an additional barrier will placed against the Government&rsquo;s ability to accept amendments on those Stages.  I wish to make clear that point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister should deal with a couple of aspects of the subject of fair procedure that Members may not have had a full opportunity to explore on Second Stage.  I refer specifically to the precise wording under discussion in the Minister&rsquo;s proposed amendment.  I can understand the reason he employed the phrase &ldquo;observe fair procedure&rdquo; because that phraseology is included in the proposed legislation.  I can discern consistency between the proposed legislation the Minister intends to publish &mdash; he might provide Members with a publication date at the conclusion of this debate on the amendment &mdash; and the wording in the constitutional <Col N="781"/>amendment.  The Minister should elaborate on what are the fair procedures.  It is important that the people should know this, because if the amendment is passed, it is proposed that the investigator or the inquiry committee will define the powers to establish fair procedures relating to evidence and submission.  There will be no requirement in what has been proposed by the Minister to publish these to enable those who are the subject of such an inquiry or investigation to know what are the guidelines for what is being conducted.  If one is dealing with the Revenue Commissioners, one is entitled to know what are the procedures being followed in the interests of the public and hidden procedures are not permitted.  My point is that a hidden procedure is not a fair procedure.</P>
        <P>As for fair procedures with regard to individuals or their conduct being examined or inquired into, there is a wide raft of exemptions pertaining to Government meetings and matters that could be prejudicial to proceedings before the court or in respect of international relations.  I note exemptions may be signed in this regard by the Secretary General to the Government.  Consequently, a committee might be carrying out an investigation into an issue, only half of which could be examined by way of evidence regarding the conduct of an individual.  However, this evidence could be fundamental to what happened at a Government meeting and yet can be exempted.  I understand the concept of Cabinet confidentiality, but fair procedure must apply to everyone.  A person&rsquo;s fair procedures might be compromised were someone else simply able to send a letter of exemption to the effect the matter was not covered by the inquiry.</P>
        <P>Another point concerns the relationship between fair procedures and a person&rsquo;s good name.  This is all about the good name and character of those who are being inquired into and I acknowledge it will be an offence to disclose the contents of any reports or drafts thereof before their publication.  However, in the interests of fair procedures for those who are being inquired into, it should be an offence to publish any of these documents.  In previous tribunals, leaks were provided for the media which published them.  I note <i>The Irish Times </i>published such leaks and then shredded the evidence.  While I forget the details, no offence had taken place and that newspaper got off the hook, even though it had published the leaked information.  It is somewhat akin to it being an offence to sell alcohol to those who are under 18 years but not an offence for them to buy it.  My point is that both sides of the equation must be covered and fair procedures must apply if someone is divulging information.  However, the person who chooses to publish it also should be covered because he or she can damage a person&rsquo;s character and good name.  I ask for fair procedures in this regard.  The Minister should expound on the question of leaks which are a feature of life.  While they should not take place, they occur and people&rsquo;s names become damaged after which it is difficult for them to clear their names.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by stating Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes this proposal.  I note the Minister is adopting a belt-and-braces approach in respect of making this explicit.  The next time a constitutional amendment is proposed and the point is made that something is implied in the Constitution, the response will be that as matters were made explicit the last time, it must be done again.  Be that as it may, it will be a problem for someone else to deal with later, but the Minister is being highly specific.  If for no other reason, this may take some heat out of the public argument because people can get caught up in such issues during a debate.  The Minister&rsquo;s move to include the issue of fair procedures will give comfort to the public and the many people who have been making this argument.  Overall, I support the Minister&rsquo;s amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Members opposite for their thoughtful contributions and addressing this issue.  It is an important advance for the Oireachtas to deal with these matters.  I will deal with Deputy McDonald&rsquo;s points and thank her for the amendment she tabled.  She can claim ownership because her amendment certainly formed part of the persuas<Col N="782"/>ive argument to make explicit what I considered to be implicit.  There is no harm in so doing, even if, as Deputy Fleming has observed, it has consequences for the future.</P>
        <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the balancing of rights, but the problem for the past 20 years has been that the public interest was never really included in the balance and lost out in the balancing of rights.  It has taken decades to get to the truth of matters.  I note that had people appeared before a committee or inquiry and simply told the truth &mdash; this is such an amazing thing to ask &mdash; we would not have had years of tribunals at phenomenal cost to the State.  Moreover, such tribunals often had findings which were beyond relevance by the time they came to conclusions and people had forgotten what they had been asked to do in the first instance.  We must have a system that is more robust than that and that is what we are aiming to do.</P>
        <P>We can talk ourselves into protecting the rights of the individual to such an extent that we cannot have an inquiry into anything.  Someone who does something fundamentally wrong should have his or her good name tarnished in terms of adducing convincing evidence objectively as long as fair procedures are applied.  A person should be furnished with a full copy of the evidence which could reflect on his or her good name.  He or she should be allowed to cross-examine any witnesses that give evidence.  He or she should be allowed to rebut any evidence given and permitted to address any inquiry in any way he or she wants.  These are understandable rights that would flow from Deputy Fleming&rsquo;s question on what constitutes fair procedure.</P>
        <P>We published very detailed heads of the Bill, which are much more detailed than is normally the case at this stage of the discussion.  Deputy Fleming is correct in that they will form the backdrop in terms of reassurance for people about what processes will be involved.  I would not be quite as sanguine as he is in terms of his comments that the Bill cannot be amended.  It will be, as long as the principles are understood.</P>
        <P>I would welcome any suggestions from the other side of the House in advance of finalising the Bill, as I said last week to the oversight committee.  If there are any significant ideas to amend the heads I published, I would welcome them in order that when the Bill is published for the guidance of the electorate in advance of the referendum, it encompasses, as far as possible, the views of the Opposition.</P>
        <P>When we come to do a detailed scrutiny of the Bill, assuming the electorate supports it, I have an open mind to get this right.  As I said to the committee, I do not think this will be the end of the matter.  We will come across practical difficulties when we start the process and should be open to making further amendments when we learn about them.  I do not have a date for publication but it will be in advance of the referendum.</P>
        <P>In terms of exclusions, there cannot be an investigation into matters that are subject to criminal investigation or a breaking of the constitutional prohibition on the collective deliberations of Cabinet.  Other constitutional provisions allow the State to function and all the recitals in the draft heads simply cover things that are normal.</P>
        <P>In regard to leaks, in which Deputy Fleming is interested, draft head No. 34 of the Bill states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A person who receives a draft report from a relevant body under <i>section (31)</i> shall not disclose its contents or divulge in any way that the draft report has been sent to that person except ... with the prior consent in writing of the body [and] to the extent necessary for the purposes of an application to the Court [for any legal proceedings].</P>
        <P FLI="0">The heads state a person who contravenes that subsection shall be guilty of an offence.  It will be an offence to leak information, unless it is in accordance with the normal procedures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We will consider that.  It is a fair point.  As the Deputy knows, there is extensive constitutional and human rights legislation on the freedom of the press and I cannot make any commitment in this forum to trample on that because freedom of the press has been carefully protected in cases in the European Court of Human Rights.

    <Title>European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2011: Second Stage</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I thank the House for agreeing to discuss the European Financial Stability Facility and the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2011 today at short notice.  The Bill is needed urgently to allow Ireland ratify the changes to the European Financial Stability Facility and Greek Loan Facility as agreed by the Heads of State or Government on 21 July 2011.  It is essential for ensuring financial stability within the euro area.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, euro area member states agreed in May 2010 to create a European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, in order to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area and to financially support euro area member states which are in difficulties caused by exceptional circumstances beyond their control.  The EFSF was incorporated on 7 June 2010 for the purpose of providing stability support to euro area member states in the form of guaranteed loans of up to &euro;440 billion within a limited period of time.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure a triple A rating, which provides access to low cost funds, the EFSF adopted complex structures &mdash; involving over guarantee of bonds issued and credit enhancement measures such as cash buffers and prepaid margins on loans.  These measures reduced its effective lending capacity to some &euro;250 billion, and increased the effective cost of borrowing for borrowers.</P>
        <P>Under the EU-IMF financial support programme agreed on 28 November 2010, Ireland accessed one loan of &euro;4.2 billion from the EFSF maturing in July 2016.  The total amount available to Ireland from the EFSF under the programme is &euro;17.7 billion.</P>
        <P>On 30 June 2011, euro area Ministers for Finance signed an amendment to the European Financial Stability Facility Framework Agreement, subject to the completion of national parliamentary procedures.  The main purpose of the June 2011 amendment agreement is to increase the effective lending capacity of the EFSF back up to its headline volume of &euro;440 billion by increasing the over-guarantee percentage to 165% of the amount raised by the facility.  The amendments include specification of the margin applying to loans to future programme countries, changes to the pricing structure including the introduction of a new advance margin, a specific reference to Ireland becoming a stepping out guarantor, which occurred on entering the EU-IMF programme, and the potential transfer of EFSF rights, obligations and-or liabilities to the ESM.</P>
        <P>On 21 July 2011, the Heads of State or Government announced further measures to ensure the financial stability of the euro area and to stem risk of contagion.  These measures include a new programme of assistance for Greece and increasing the flexibility of the EFSF and the ESM by allowing them to act on the basis of a precautionary programme, to finance recapitalisation of financial institutions through loans to governments and to intervene in primary and secondary sovereign bond markets on the basis of ECB analysis.  The Heads of State or Government agreed to reduce the interest rate on EFSF loans to Ireland, Greece and Portugal to <Col N="788"/>lending rates equivalent to those of the balance of payments facility, close to, without going below, the EFSF funding cost as well as lengthening the loan maturities.</P>
        <P>We discussed this further in Poland this week.  The proposals from the European Commission on the EFSM have yet to be decided by ECOFIN and are likely to be decided on 4 October.  Some details of the EFSF also need to be finalised.</P>
        <P>It is now calculated that the overall savings from the reductions in the margins applying to the EU related programme funding is about &euro;9 billion over the average life of seven and a half years as originally envisaged for the loans.  This saving of about &euro;9 billion represents 5.7% of the current forecasted level of GDP in 2011.  In terms of 2012 the NTMA now calculate that the savings on the EU funds will be about &euro;900 million.</P>
        <P>Legislation is required to enable Ireland ratify both the June amendments to the EFSF framework agreement and those arising from the decision of 21 July 2011 in the form of amendments to the European Financial Stability Facility Act 2010.  As the June amendments had not yet been ratified by most countries, a consolidated set of amendments was agreed and these are set out in Schedule 1 to the Bill before us today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Deputies will be aware, the delay in implementing the 21 July Head of State or Government decisions in relation to the EFSF is adding to market uncertainty.  Also Ireland, Portugal and Greece cannot benefit from the reduced interest rate and increased flexibility until the revised EFSF is implemented.  It is for these reasons that ratification of the EFSF and the revised Greek loan facility agreement are now an urgent priority.    At the informal eurogroup meeting in Poland last weekend all euro area countries confirmed they would work to ratify the amendments to the EFSF as quickly as possible.  Many countries have already provided confirmation that they have ratified it.  Ireland, as a recipient of assistance from the EFSF, should not delay the ratification of the amendments to the EFSF.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s EFSF loan facility agreement will be revised to give effect to the cost reductions from the reduced interest rate and longer maturities agreed by the Heads of State and Government.  This will require the unanimous agreement of the loan guarantors.</P>
        <P>The decision of the euro area Heads of State and Government on 21 July also has consequences for the ESM treaty in that the treaty signed by euro area Finance Ministers in July, subject to the necessary parliamentary procedures, will now require amendment.  Discussions are continuing at a technical level on the text of the amendments.  The revised ESM treaty, incorporating the amendments, will be dealt with in separate legislation later this year or early next year.  The ESM is due to come into force and take over from the EFSF during 2013, subject to ratification by all euro area member states.</P>
        <P>Arising from the serious budgetary and economic problems affecting Greece and its inability to secure international funding at sustainable rates and in the context of safeguarding the financial stability of the European Union and the euro area, it was agreed on foot of an intergovernmental agreement in May 2010 to provide bilateral loans totalling &euro;80 billion for Greece from the euro area member states in conjunction with IMF assistance of &euro;30 billion over a three year period to mid-2013.</P>
        <P>In June Finance Ministers agreed at eurogroup level to revise the Greek loan facility to allow for the extension of the grace period between draw-down and the commencement of repayment from three to 4.5 years, the extension of the maturity period for loans from five to ten years and a change in the calculation of the margin relating to loans to Greece to give it a lower interest rate.  The Commission signed the loan facility agreement for Greece on behalf of euro <Col N="789"/>area member states on 14 June, pending ratification by the individual euro area member states.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this means the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010 requires amendment.  The Bill provides for the ratification of these amendments to the Greek loan facility agreement.</P>
        <P>In line with the Heads of State and Government decision of 21 July on a new programme of assistance for Greece, a second amendment to the Greek loan facility is being finalised to allow for a longer grace period and a lengthening of the loan maturity to 15 years.  Once finalised, the Commission will sign the second amendment on behalf of the euro area member states.</P>
        <P>The European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2011, as brought before the House today, does not provide for the second amendment to the Greek loan facility as the second amendment had not been signed in time.  As soon as it is signed, we will have to bring forward separate legislation to ratify it.  Given the importance of the amendment to the EFSF framework agreement to Ireland in securing an interest rate reduction and the pressure being put on euro area member states to ratify the amendments to the EFSF and the first amendment to the Greek loan facility, we cannot delay the Bill any longer waiting for the second amendment to the Greek loan facility to be agreed and signed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Turning to the Bill, as I have mentioned, it provides for amendments to the European Financial Stability Facility Act 2010 and the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010.  The Bill has three sections, with the amendment to the EFSF framework agreement set out in Schedule 1 and the amendment to the Greek loan facility agreement of 14 June set out in Schedule 2<i>.</i></P>
        <P Just="Left">The first section of the Bill provides that the references to the EFSF framework agreement in the European Financial Stability Facility Act 2010 shall include the amendment to the EFSF framework agreement.  It also increases the amount that may be paid from the Central Fund to &euro;12.5 billion from &euro;7.5 billion in line with the increase in the notional guarantee ceiling for Ireland as set out in Annexe 1 to the amendment.  It is notional because the amendment agreement specifically notes that Ireland and Portugal have become stepping out guarantors.  Despite this point, the figure is being amended for reasons of consistency.</P>
        <P>Section 2 provides that the references to the loan facility agreement in the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010 shall include the amendment to it of 14 June.  Section 3 sets out the Short Title.</P>
        <P>The EFSF amendment agreement is set out in Schedule 1.  The main changes to the EFSF framework agreement are set out in the amendments to the preamble in the framework agreement.  These are: Article 1.(1) provides for Estonia to become a party to the framework agreement &mdash; this was a requirement of it joining the euro at the start of 2011; Article 1.(4) sets out the changes arising from the decision of the Heads of State and Government in July to expand the financial assistance that the EFSF can provide in the future beyond the loan facilities it is limited to by the framework agreement.</P>
        <P>The changes include: (1) the provision of loans, precautionary facilities and loans for governments of euro area member states, including non-programme member states, to finance the recapitalisation of banks; (2) the purchase of bonds in the secondary bond markets on the basis of an ECB analysis recognising the existence of exceptional financial circumstances and risks to financial stability; (3) the purchase of euro area bonds in the primary market; (4) increasing the effective capacity of the EFSF to its headline &euro;440 billion figure by increasing the level of over-guarantee from &euro;440 billion, 120%, to &euro;780 billion, 165%; (5) amending the pricing structure to cost of funds plus a margin of 200 basis points for the first three years for each financial assistance and 300 basis points thereafter &mdash; however, in line with the 21 July decision, the preamble will also be amended to note that Greece is to receive loans at lending rates equivalent to those of the balance of payments without going below the cost of funds and that these <Col N="790"/>lending rates will also be applied for Ireland and Portugal; (6) providing that the maturities for Greece are to be a minimum of 15 years and up to 30 years and these should also apply for Ireland and Portugal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The remaining paragraphs of Article 1, from paragraph (9) to paragraph (60), amend the articles of the framework agreement to provide for the changes listed above.  Many of the amendments are technical or text changes such as changing &ldquo;Loan Facility Agreement&rdquo; in a number of articles to read &ldquo;Financial Assistance Facility Agreement&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Annexe 1, containing the guarantee commitments for each euro area member state, has been amended because of the increase in the level of total guarantees to &euro;780 billion.  Ireland&rsquo;s figure is increasing from just over &euro;7 billion to just under &euro;12.4 billion. However, the annexe has also been amended to make it clear that Ireland, Greece and Portugal have become stepping-out guarantors, thereby bringing the effect level of total guarantees down to &euro;726 billion, which is 165% of &euro;440 billion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Annexe 2 which sets out the contribution key based on the ECB capital subscription has also been amended because of Estonia joining the euro and the EFSF.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution decreases from 1.5915% to 1.5874%.</P>
        <P>Schedule 2 to the Bill sets out the amendment agreement to the Greek loan facility agreement.  The changes are: the grace period at the start of each loan during which principal is not payable is increased to 4.5 years from three years; the maximum term of a loan is increased to ten years from five, and the margin applicable to loans from this facility is to be reduced by 100 basis points.  The amount available to Greece under this facility is unchanged because future loans will come from the EFSF.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a constructive debate on the Bill.  Now is a time for unity among euro area countries to ensure financial stability within the euro area.  The revised EFSF forms part of the measures to ensure that stability and Ireland must play its part, as it is in the interests of this country and the eurozone to do so.  Therefore, I urge Deputies to agree to ratify the changes to the EFSF and the Greek loan facility.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for bringing forward this Bill and his Second Stage contribution.  I welcome the publication of the European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill which, essentially, gives effect to the decisions taken in June at the euro area Ministers for Finance meeting and at the July meeting of the eurozone Heads of State and Government.  It is indicative of the extent to which the crisis in the eurozone dominated events over the summer that it was necessary to revisit the decisions taken in June just a few weeks later, with further measures aimed at reassuring markets as to the sustainability of public finances across the eurozone.  It underlines the inability of the European Union to get ahead of the ongoing debt crisis.  The European institutions and political leadership have singularly failed to get to grips with the crisis which rumbles on before our eyes, with the downgrade today of the rating for Italy by Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>The collective failure of the European political leadership was underlined by the decision to go on holidays after the 21 July summit.  The effect was to immediately create a vacuum.  While the decisions were made in principle by the leaders, there was no definitive date as to when they were to be implemented and the procedure for their implementation was somewhat open to question.  The decision not to follow through immediately and recall parliaments across the European Union, especially across the eurozone, created a vacuum which was subsequently filled by market turbulence.  The fear and uncertainty led to huge turbulence, with billions of <Col N="791"/>euro being written off stock markets.  It has crystallised in a sharp way the incapacity of the institutions and the political leadership in Europe to deal with the crisis in a comprehensive way.</P>
        <P>In recent days the European Commission published its proposals on eurobonds, but within days the head of the most powerful member state in the eurozone publicly dismissed the idea.  It all creates a sense of a European Union that is not acting as a unit, that is not cohesive and that does not have unity of purpose as to how it will set out to resolve the issues involved.</P>
        <P>As I said at the time of the eurozone summit in July, I welcome the decision of our EU partners to reduce the interest rate charged to Ireland in respect of the EFSF assistance programme.  This is a clear recognition that an essential precondition for Ireland returning to the bond markets is demonstrating that the public finances are on a sustainable path.  The saving from the interest rate reduction helps us to achieve this goal.  This has been assisted further by the recent announcement of a reduction in the interest rate charged to Ireland on funds drawn down from the separate EFSM.  It is particularly welcome that these rate reductions apply to the funds already drawn down from both funds, despite the initial indications to the contrary.</P>
         <P>The question that people at home will want to have answered is how will they feel the difference and how will Ireland make the best possible use of the very significant saving achieved.  The Minister has confirmed that the saving in 2012 will be &euro;900 million, which provides significant scope in the preparation of budget 2012.  The bottom line is that we must achieve a deficit figure of 8.6%.  This additional &euro;900 million saving which was not expected a few months ago gives the Government scope to make political choices.  Perhaps the Minister might refer to the particular primary balance targets we must achieve, excluding the interest payments we must make next year.  While we are committed to achieving the 8.6% target, are we committed to achieving a particular primary balance also, which does not take account of the saving on the interest rate?  The Minister has gone on record recently as saying the budget will be about two thirds as difficult as last year&rsquo;s.  With the &euro;900 million saving, it need only be less than half as difficult as last year&rsquo;s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are some downsides that we have not yet seen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure there are.  I fully acknowledge that the major risk the economy faces is related to the issue of growth and the global economic picture.  We received the updated outlook from the IMF today which was quite pessimistic, and that certainly is a downside that will feed into the Government&rsquo;s pre-budget outlook and new multi-year plan which we look forward to seeing next month.</P>
        <P>We would like to receive further information on other issues related to the 21 July eurozone summit decisions such as the purchase of debt on secondary markets by the EFSF, following the<i> imprimatur</i> of the ECB.  Will Ireland be in a position to avail of this?  Will it be availing of the extension of the maturities?  There was a reference in the <i>communique</i> to a commitment to provide ongoing funding for programme countries that continued to meet the commitments into which they had entered.  When Mr. John Corrigan appeared before the Oireachtas finance committee recently, he was of the view that if Ireland was not in a position to get back into the markets in the second half of 2013, we would be looking at drawing down funds from the new ESM fund which comes into being in the middle of that year.  We would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments in that regard.</P>
        <P>Given the seriousness of the situation, it is somewhat frustrating that the Bill at this stage is only able to deal with the first of the two amendments agreed to on the Greek loan facility.  I note the Minister&rsquo;s comment that this issue may have to be revisited in separate legislation. <Col N="792"/> The uncertainty over a second bailout for Greece needs to be brought to an end as soon as possible, as it is giving rise to fears of a domino effect across the European banking system.</P>
        <P>The high profile pan-European stress test of bank balance sheets notably failed to allay investor fears about their ability to withstand a Greek default, the reasons for which are all too apparent.  Many eurozone banks, particularly French banks, hold large amounts of Greek Government debt and are significantly exposed as a result.  The fear of an imminent Greek default is causing investors to sell shares in such banks.  The leading French banks, BNP Paribas and Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, have seen their share prices tumble in recent times.  In turn, this increases the cost of capital for such banks, making them more vulnerable.  The contagion effect is clearly seen when other banks, which see falling bank share prices and widening credit-default spreads, react by refusing to provide the vulnerable banks with interbank liquidity.  There is a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> from 2008 when the liquidity markets seized up.  This breakdown in the interbank market leads to a breakdown of the credit circuit which can have very damaging implications for the eurozone economy, including the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>The economist Daniel Gros recently warned that a failure to avert a breakdown of the normal functioning of the credit markets would lead to a repeat of the &ldquo;immediate recession&rdquo; experienced after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.  The consequences for Ireland of such a scenario would be to choke off recovery in the economy.  The central point is that our interest in the negotiations at European level to deal with the crisis did not end with the securing of a reduction in our bailout interest rate.  We must be active participants in the design and implementation of measures to deal comprehensively with the related problems of sovereign finances and bank liquidity and solvency.</P>
        <P>The creation of the EFSF and its successor, the European Stability Mechanism which will be launched in mid-2013 was designed to prevent such a disastrous chain of events from taking place.  Unfortunately, the EU authorities have not always acted quickly enough to take measures to stabilise the situation.  How often have we heard the phrase that the euro is back from the brink?  The decisions taken during the summer certainly brought a temporary improvement to the situation in relaxing the terms of the current bailout arrangements for Greece, Portugal and Ireland and providing for private sector involvement in the proposed second bailout for Greece.  This is not being extended to Portugal and Ireland &mdash; nor was it sought, as the Minister indicated previously.  However, even at this short remove, there are considerable concerns that there will sooner or later be a need to revisit the operation and size of the EFSF.  That is a fundamental issue at the heart of the uncertainty in the financial markets.  There is a lack of credibility to the fund which clearly is not big enough to bail out large economies such as Italy and Spain.</P>

        <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises that the ESB is self-financing, has paid &euro;1.2 billion in dividends over the last nine years and contributed &euro;2.2 billion to the Irish economy through purchases from Irish suppliers, taxes, rates, wages and dividends in 2010;</P><Col N="793"/>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />further recognises that the ESB is of long-term strategic importance to the State&rsquo;s energy supply, in providing skilled employment, training opportunities and a variety of energy and  telecommunications services and could play an extended role in the area of telecommunications by using its existing networks to address the State&rsquo;s broadband deficit;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges that throughout the current economic and financial crisis the ESB&rsquo;s investment in infrastructure has remained high, unlike Eircom, which continues to be dogged by a decade of under-investment following privatisation resulting in the State remaining below the EU15 and OECD average of broadband penetration <i>per capita</i>;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />notes that Ireland is lagging at least three to five years behind competitor countries in terms of rolling out infrastructure capable of high speed next generation broadband;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />welcomes the Government&rsquo;s decision to accept the recommendations of the Cahill-Frontier report, entitled Transmission Asset Analysis, against unbundling the ESB&rsquo;s transmission and distribution assets;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />asserts that the programme for Government commitment to target up to &euro;2 billion in sales of so-called &ldquo;non-strategic&rdquo; State assets drawing from the recommendations of the McCarthy Review Group is an unnecessary and damaging fiscal measure driven by a privatisation agenda;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />believes that commercial semi-State companies should not be privatised in part or in whole;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />asserts that semi-State companies can play a vital role in delivering employment activation measures and training;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />affirms that, as a small open economy, State control of strategic State assets and service provision, including but not exclusive to public transport, aviation, ports, forestry, water supply, broadcasting, postal services, energy supply, telecommunications, is central to the future security, prosperity of the economy and society, and environmental protection of the island;</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Beidh m&eacute; ag roinnt mo chuid ama le mo chomhghleacaithe, Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Ellis, &Oacute; Snodaigh agus Ferris.  Molaim an r&uacute;n at&aacute; os comhair na D&aacute;la anocht i dtaobh an Bord Sol&aacute;thair an Leictreachais at&aacute; th&iacute;os in ainm Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la Shinn F&eacute;in.</P>
        <P>Last week the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, announced the Government&rsquo;s plan to part privatise the ESB.  Despite decades of rhetorical support for this valuable State asset and pre-election pledges to keep the company in public ownership, the Minister came forth to announce a key plank in the Fine Gael Party&rsquo;s pre-election proposals.  The discomfort among Labour Party backbench Deputies must have been considerable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was something deeply dishonest in the way the Government justified the decision to sell off a portion of one of the most successful semi-State companies in the history of the State.  We are told that selling a minority stake does not represent a significant loss to the State and that proceeds from the sale of this share will be invested in economic recovery.  As all of us know, both claims are untrue.  The part privatisation of the ESB will be a disaster in the long <Col N="794"/>term and bad for consumers and ESB workers.  There is no rationale for the decision other than that the Government is being pressurised by the International Monetary Fund and the European Union to sell off State assets to service the debt.  Clearly, this pressure is too great for the Labour Party to resist.  None of this should come as a surprise because Fine Gael made it crystal clear during the election campaign that it wanted to part privatise the ESB.  The programme for Government more than hinted that the party had got its way when it promised to &ldquo;target up to &euro;2 billion in sales of non-strategic state assets drawing from the recommendations of the McCarthy Review Group on State Assets when available.&rdquo;  What is surprising, however, is the speed with which the Labour Party capitulated to Fine Gael&rsquo;s demand, backed by pressure from the European Union and the IMF.</P>
        <P>We need to remind ourselves of what the Labour Party stated only a few short months ago.  Its election manifesto stated the party was committed to the &ldquo;concept of public enterprise, and is determined to ensure that semi-state companies play a full role in the recovery of the Irish economy&rdquo;.  It also stated clearly that &ldquo;Labour is opposed to short-termist privatisation of key state assets, such as Coillte or the energy networks&rdquo;.  Within a matter of months, however, it has made a U-turn of massive proportions and announced what is undoubtedly the thin end of the privatisation wedge.  This decision could well result in the eventual break-up of the ESB and loss of control by the State and the taxpayer.  Unfortunately, this is just the latest in the growing list of broken promises and U-turns by the Labour Party since taking office in March.  On social welfare, protecting the low-paid, local hospital services, natural resources and jobs, the gap between what the party promised the electorate and what it is delivering is growing by the day.</P>
        <P>The arguments against the part privatisation of the ESB are compelling.  The company is self-financing and has paid &euro;1.2 billion to the State in dividends in the past nine years.  In 2010 alone it contributed &euro;2.2 billion to the State through purchases from Irish suppliers, taxes, rates, wages and dividends.  The company is not only of long-term strategic importance to the State&rsquo;s energy supply, it is also a driver of substantial economic investment and employment.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the Government is not being driven by long-term or strategic considerations but by an EU-IMF austerity programme that insists on selling off valuable State assets to service toxic private banking debt.  It is also being driven by a right-wing Fine Gael agenda which is anti-public sector and intent on dismantling semi-State companies.  The Government will argue that it has no choice and its hands are tied.  It will claim that under the terms of the EU-IMF austerity deal, it must raise at least &euro;2 billion through the sale of State assets.  As all of us know, in politics there are always choices, if one wishes to explore them.  The Government has other options available to it to raise this revenue.  For example, it could introduce a wealth tax on individual liquid assets with a value of more than &euro;1 million, raising an additional &euro;1 billion per annum for the Exchequer.  Alternatively, it could negotiate a loss-sharing agreement with the ECB on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note, saving the Exchequer billions of euro, or refuse to pay the &euro;703 million senior, unguaranteed, unsecured bond due to mature in Anglo Irish Bank on 2 November.</P>
        <P>What is clear is that if a portion of the ESB is sold, it will be gone for good and, with it, the many benefits that accrue to the taxpayer.  If the Government needs confirmation that this is the case, it need only consider the privatisation of Eircom in the mid to late 1990s.  The legacy of that sale can be clearly seen in the significant decline of Eircom landline penetration from 82% to 69% and the lack of adequate broadband coverage across the State.</P>
        <P>What is most galling and truly remarkable is that a Labour Party Minister is fronting this right-wing rip-off, although given the Minister&rsquo;s history of ideological transformation, this is perhaps not surprising.  The question many of us are asking is what Labour Party backbench <Col N="795"/>Deputies will do when faced with a clear choice between their pre-election promises and the right-wing policies of the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and Fine Gael.  To the Labour Party Deputies who may be listening to this debate in their offices and members of the party who are genuine social democrats concerned with the interests of taxpayers and public sector workers, I want to make a direct appeal.  Do not let the party sell off this vital State asset to pay down the debts foisted on the State by a failed Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  Do not let the party undermine decades of hard work and investment by exposing the vital strategic asset we have to the uncertainties of the private market.  Do not let the party trade what is meant to be one of its core principles &mdash; public ownership &mdash; to bail out banks and bondholders.  For its part, Sinn F&eacute;in is steadfastly opposed to the sale of any part of the ESB because to do so would be bad energy policy and bad economic policy and detrimental to Irish consumers, taxpayers and workers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is one of the most important motions to be put before the D&aacute;il in recent years.  The decision to sell off a stake in the ESB is totally wrong and I warrant that the Minister knows that this is the case.  It is the first step towards privatisation of this and other key strategic State assets at the diktat of the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.  The disastrous IMF-ECB deal so cravenly accepted by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party is now the equivalent of the old British regime at Dublin Castle, warping the economy and impoverishing the people for the benefit of outside interests.</P>
        <P>It cannot be said often enough that the most recent general election saw one of the greatest frauds ever perpetrated against the people who rejected the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party wreckers of the economy and gave a strong mandate to Fine Gael and the Labour Party, both of which had been highly critical of the IMF-ECB deal.  That deal was clearly rejected by the people and armed with that mandate the new Fine Gael-Labour Party Government should have gone back to the IMF and the ECB and told them we could not and would not pay, the austerity regime was not working and we had to invest in job creation and growth instead of paying off bank bondholders.  Instead, Fine Gael and the Party Labour bowed the knee to the IMF and the ECB, took up the axe left down by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, and continued with those savage cuts.  T&aacute; na pairtithe sa Rialtas seo tar &eacute;is dallamull&oacute;g a chur ar an bpobal.

        <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Deenihan, has proposed to take over the Bank of Ireland building in College Green, which was the old Irish Parliament building.  This is ironic, given the fact that the members of that Ascendancy Parliament sold it out in return for bribes from the British Government, just as the political establishment in this State sold what was left of our economic sovereignty to the IMF and the ECB, surely the greatest sell-out since the Act of Union itself.  Now State companies are up for grabs, with large chunks to be sold off.  It is the worst kind of short-sighted policy and will come back to haunt our society and our economy in the years ahead.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wonder what joker came up with the name &ldquo;NewERA&rdquo; for the body to be set up to act as an agent for the sale of State assets.  It started as a Fine Gael policy document in November 2009 which promised that 105,000 new jobs would be created.  What has happened to that promise?  At least Fine Gael stated clearly in that plan its intention to sell off State assets.  It was otherwise with the Labour Party, which before the general election said it was committed to State enterprises and pledged that it would use commercial State companies as a key part of economic recovery.  It said, and has said continually over the years, that it was opposed to privatisation.  Now this Fine Gael and Labour Party Government is to set up NewERA as a non-statutory body within the NTMA which will take responsibility for the management and disposal of commercial semi-State companies from Departments.  NewERA will also decide on <Col N="796"/>dividends paid out to the State, pay levels and pension fund policies.  The Government claims any moneys raised will be used for investment and job creation, but we know very well that the EU and IMF want the moneys to be used to pay down the debt.</P>
        <P>As our motion states, the ESB is self-financing, has paid &euro;1.2 billion in dividends in the past nine years and, in 2010 alone, contributed &euro;2.2 billion to the economy through purchases from Irish suppliers, taxes, rates, wages and dividends.  The company is of long-term strategic importance in providing the State&rsquo;s energy supply, skilled employment, training opportunities and a variety of energy and telecommunications services.  In addition, it could play an extended role in the area of telecommunications by using its existing networks to address the State&rsquo;s broadband deficit.</P>
        <P>We reject the Government&rsquo;s decision to sell off a stake in the company to private interests.  Let it not be forgotten that the ESB, like other strategic State companies, was built up when wealthy private interests were unwilling to invest in the building and development of infrastructure in the State.  They preferred to invest their money abroad, just as the Government is now sending billions of euro out of the country to pay the gambling debts of bank bondholders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">After the achievement of self-government for 26 of the 32 counties, successive Governments built up strong State-owned companies.  That must be acknowledged, and the parties responsible merit praise for their initiative.  The ESB, Aer Lingus, our telecommunications infrastructure, Bord na M&oacute;na and others were strategic pillars of the economy.  Of course, these companies must be equipped to adapt to change, but what is not acceptable is the ideology which dictates that the people of this State, through the Government, cannot retain any of these in public ownership and cannot even assist them out of public funds.</P>
        <P>The sound investment made when the ESB was established and developed has paid off handsomely over the decades.  Throughout the current economic and financial crisis the ESB&rsquo;s investment in infrastructure has remained high, unlike that of Eircom, which continues to be dogged by under-investment following its privatisation.  We know who benefited from the fiasco that was the Eircom privatisation: the likes of Tony O&rsquo;Reilly and other privateers who creamed off profits and dividends.  We are still paying that cost.  The State, which should be a world leader in communications infrastructure, now lags behind other EU and OECD states in terms of broadband availability <i>per capita</i>.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government is committed to obtaining up to &euro;2 billion from sales of so-called non-strategic State assets, drawing from the recommendations of the McCarthy review group.  This is not based on any sound economic strategy.  On the contrary, it represents another step in the downgrading of the economy and a further limiting of the potential of the State to help create jobs and bring about economic growth and recovery.  These semi-State companies should not be privatised in part or in whole because they can play a vital role in delivering employment activation measures and training.</P>
        <P>In the past ten years the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is alone have paid out nearly &euro;2 billion in dividends.  It is economic madness to start selling off these vital national assets in whole or in part.  The Government defends this by asserting that it is only a partial sale of a stake in the ESB, but once the rot begins where will it end?  We have ample evidence of what happens.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DessieEllis"><NameTxt>Deputy Dessie Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>No one is under any illusion.  Regardless of our political perspective, we all accept that at this moment the numbers do not add up.  The State is not taking in enough <Col N="797"/>to pay its way, much less pay the debt it has completely and illogically taken on at the behest of the European banking system.  We are now borrowing at high rates and most of that money is doing little or nothing to change the situation.  Government policy is simply deflating the economy and taking money out of the pockets of struggling people who spend every penny of their income in the local economy.</P>
        <P>With this in mind, we accept that revenue must be generated and new sources of funding tapped.  What we completely and utterly reject is the short-sighted, ideologically driven strategy of selling off the family silver, represented by bodies such as the ESB, CIE and Aer Lingus.  A move such as this flies in the face of a strategy to encourage growth and job creation.  These are bodies and companies that offer essential services to the people, the State and their mutual interests.  They are not inherently wasteful, inefficient or poor quality service providers.</P>
        <P>It is certain that savings could be made by many of these bodies, which are almost wholly under State control.  One possible step, which I ask Ministers to consider as an option for themselves also, is to cut the wages of the top earners in these bodies and establish measures to ensure the obscene pensions that have been awarded to such people are consigned to history.  This might not yield the billions required, but it would certainly be a gesture to indicate the Government is serious about getting value for money.  There are choices.  Blind belief in the market or the orders of the troika is not good enough.</P>
        <P>Until recently, the Labour Party was opposed to the current Government direction of privatising State enterprises for short-term superficial gain.  It was right to take this position.  It was right in believing that it was the responsibility of the State to provide many of these services to citizens and that breaking up these companies would not be beneficial to anyone other than narrow private interests.  Unfortunately, the Labour Party seems to have, in deed if not in word, become completely subservient to the senior Government party.  I ask Labour Party backbenchers to think about their core constituency, the ordinary working families who depend on these services.  They should consider how these families will be affected by privatisation and how little this policy will really do to ease their weekly struggle to make ends meet.  It is all the more worrying that these plans, cooked up by Fine Gael in its NewERA programme and accepted by the Labour Party in the programme for Government, are following almost to the letter the recommendations of Mr. Colm McCarthy.  This is the man who drew up the plan to destroy the entire State, devastate communities and treat tens of thousands of people as if they were simply numbers in an accountancy exercise.  He did all this for a rather tidy sum, given the useless product of his questionable effort.</P>
        <P>One of the companies in which the State is considering selling its stake is Aer Lingus.  This company saw large State investment of time, work and money in order to ensure its commercial viability into this century.  It has been allowed to slip partly into the hands of Ryanair which is set on creating a monopoly situation in Irish air travel.  If the remaining shares in State control are sold, Aer Lingus is as good as finished and a brand which has always been looked on positively throughout the world as our national carrier will become another low fare airline.  Merging of services will cause job losses and, most likely, protracted industrial action.  One would think Aer Lingus was failing.  The Government would have us believe that Aer Lingus is costing us great amounts of money but this is simply not true.  According to the airline&rsquo;s spokespeople, last month was a continuation of the &ldquo;positive trend&rdquo; in the company&rsquo;s figures and August saw profits before tax rise 124% on the previous year&rsquo;s figures.  Short-sightedness must be becoming contagious because it is rampant across this Chamber.</P>
        <P>The Government also seeks to sell off part of the ESB.  Given the experience of struggling families in recent years in regard to disconnections and inability to keep up with bills, how can the Government fail to see this is a recipe for disaster?  The private industry has no potential <Col N="798"/>for tolerating the difficulties faced by people in this economic basketcase.  People and representatives had to fight to end the practice of shutting electricity off from those people who fell behind on their bills.  If the ESB is lost to private hands, disconnections will be a massive problem and we will once again face the real possibility of people being without power and heat in their homes.  Neither the electorate nor any person who is honest with himself or herself would say that in this day and age electricity should be a luxury.  This move has the potential to create that situation, which is very worrying.  The policy also disregards the fact that the ESB is self-financing and has been a good thing for the people both socially and economically since its foundation.</P>
        <P>The ESB, Aer Lingus and other bodies are not millstones around the necks of the people but are very real assets.  If they were not, who would be willing to buy them?  The Government must abandon this grubby plan of privatisation.  Its conviction that the market should rule all failed us in the past 15 years.  The people learned that but obviously the political class has not.  If Fine Gael succeeds in this plan, it will bring more hardship, worse service and job losses to this State as well as decreases its year-on-year revenue intake.  It is blatantly wrong and I ask all Members to support this opposing motion.</P>

        <P>Public control of strategic assets is about much more than our economic recovery in the short term.  It is about the very survival of an island nation into the future.  As the European financial crisis deepens, the European Union is becoming an increasingly hostile and merciless place for small outlying member states.  The larger members obviously seek to protect their own interests first and foremost and we will suffer the consequence.  Already we are witnessing unilateral moves by the likes of France and Germany at our expense.  These continental players are acting to protect their own banks which recklessly lent to Irish ones during boom times.  That is not to say Irish banks were not also guilty.  Likewise, Finland&rsquo;s insistence that Greece honour its debt to Finland over and above its debt to Ireland or to other member states is another example of larger states making unilateral moves at the expense of the small outlying nations or nations like us that are struggling.</P>
        <P>As an island nation, Ireland is different from other European nations.  We have no international land borders and therefore have no choice but to be more self-reliant than others.  We must now protect and bolster our capacity to be self-reliant in case the need arises.</P>

        <P>We are losing foreign direct investment not only to India and other countries, but to our European neighbours.  We have seen a haemorrhage of jobs in recent years.  During such times <Col N="799"/>of crisis, economic or otherwise, our sea, air, rail and road transport and our communications and energy infrastructure are the last line of defence for the economy.  Their privatisation, whether in part or in whole, would expose us to attack in an increasingly competitive and cut-throat global environment and undermine our ability to protect our industries, infrastructure and jobs.  We need only think of State jobs in State companies that have been partly or wholly privatised.</P>

	<P>I will speak until 8.05 pm, if that is all right with the Acting Chairman.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need only look at SR Technics, previously Team Aer Lingus.  Where is it now?  The same applies to B &amp; I, Eircom, Si&uacute;cra &Eacute;ireann and Irish Steel, which was sold for &pound;1.  We should have these companies in State ownership now and with them we would have been able to resurrect the economy, protect jobs and help plan for the future of Ireland.  They are not there, however, and we have no control over them.  Some of them have gone in total &mdash; it is not only that the jobs are gone but the actual companies have disappeared,  in some cases because of the property bubble.</P>
        <P>Free market competitors can be savage and merciless in their actions.  We must defend and hold what we have in terms of strategic assets.  Anybody who recklessly disposes of our strategic infrastructure is acting treacherously and against the interests of the Irish people, North and South.</P>
        <P>In terms of energy, Bord na M&oacute;na, Bord G&aacute;is and the ESB are profitable and are also of undeniable strategic importance.  Even a partial sale would be the first step towards full privatisation &mdash; that is the way it has happened in the past.  In many instances, the privatisation of critical infrastructure, in Ireland and abroad, has been an unmitigated disaster for the public.   In Britain, for example, the Royal Mail had to be bought back by the state such was the scale of the disaster and the experience of that privatisation.  The privatisation of British Rail also came at enormous cost and because it was done so poorly, in some cases, it literally cost lives.  There was no proper consequent maintenance of the railway lines.  Companies came in to asset strip, not to invest.  The same is true of what happened in Eircom.  There was no investment, only continuous asset stripping.</P>
      
        <P>These were assets which were formerly Irish-owned and for which we never obtained full value.  We will not obtain full value for anything sold in the current climate.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>Critical infrastructure, when in public hands, can be deployed strategically in order to grow the economy.  Owing to the fact that under a public owner, profit is not necessarily the bottom line, it can also be used to serve a diversity of public interests.  As Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s spokesperson on social protection, I actively opposed the Government&rsquo;s recent decision to cut pensioners&rsquo; fuel and energy allowances.  It made a decision to achieve savings by cutting fuel allowances under the household benefits package rather than by securing a bulk purchaser discount from energy providers.  In many cases, the latter are State energy providers, which makes what is happening even more ridiculous.  We must start insisting that our public services serve the public.  We need to cut waste and the outrageous pay and conditions at the top in both public and private companies.  We must also extract the very best for the public.  The assets to which I refer are only non-strategic if, as is the case with the Government, there is a failure to use them strategically.  It is not good enough to sit back and do nothing.</P><Col N="800"/>

	<P>When the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, announced in a reply to me last week that the Government had been obliged to make a decision to sell an as yet unknown stake in the ESB, I had no doubt he was genuine in stating that this was not something he would have chosen to do.  I am certain that is the case.  I am also certain that there are many of his colleagues for whom this is an extremely painful and embarrassing departure from the principles on which the Labour Party claims to stand.  The Minister has said &mdash; it will be repeated many times during this debate &mdash; that the Government has no choice in the matter.  We will be told that this sale and the sale of other State assets is necessary in order to pay off some of the massive debt taken up as a consequence of the bank bailout and the virtual surrender of economic sovereignty to the European Union and the IMF.  It is correct to say there is no choice in that context.  That is why my party and others are opposed to what is happening and why we are arguing that the State should pull out of the EU-IMF programme before we are forced further down the road of debt slavery, austerity and the destruction of vast areas of public and social provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Then what?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>Not only does the programme to which I refer narrow the options available, it also means that, in effect, the IMF and the European Union can call the shots on key areas of Government policy &mdash; which they are doing &mdash; including the vital issue of the sale of State assets.  The Government has already abandoned its promise not to sell off strategic assets.  However, the scale of the sale is in question.  The programme for Government states &euro;2 billion worth of State assets will be sold off.  Is that still the case?  What is proposed would be bad enough, but I wonder whether the Government has succumbed to pressure to sell off even more assets.  The IMF has publicly demanded that &euro;5 billion worth of State assets be sold.  The proceeds from such a sale would be spent not, as promised in the programme for Government, on job creation but on servicing the debt.</P>
        <P>Similar pressure has been exerted on the Greek Government.  Is the Minister or any of his colleagues willing to state publicly in this House that they will not bow to such pressure?  Will he <Col N="801"/>or any of his colleagues state that whatever proceeds accrue &mdash; as stated, we are opposed to any such sale &mdash; they will be invested in job creation programmes?  I suspect they are not in a position to provide such a guarantee.  We await with interest to discover the actual scale of the sell-off.  It will also be interesting to see how the Government deals with the pressure from the European Union and the IMF.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in does not accept that there is any logic in selling parts of or shares in State companies and then reinvesting the proceeds through new public programmes or a new State company, as has been proposed in the context of the NewERA project.  We believe, as the motion states, that the existing public companies and their dividends must be used more proactively in order to stimulate growth and employment.  That would be a far more sensible and productive use of the State sector, rather than a once-off sale which would lead to diminishing services, job losses and higher costs.  I appeal to Labour Party Deputies, in particular, to consider what we are proposing as an alternative to what the Government is planning to do.</P>
        <P>In recent years we witnessed the sale of Irish Sugar by Greencore and the consequences this had for the agricultural community and beet producers in the south east and Munster.  We were informed at the time &mdash; the Acting Chairman will be able to verify this &mdash; that the golden share would protect the interests of both the workers and the producers.  What actually happened was that an industry that had been in State ownership for a long period was given away to Greencore which gained massively as a result.  I encourage everyone present  in the Chamber to vote with his or her conscience in order to protect the State assets that have served us well in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in for sharing time.  I acknowledge what the Minister stated last week and fully appreciate the difficulties he faces and the difficult position in which he finds himself.</P>
        <P>It is vitally important that we maintain the security of the supply of energy on this island.  The ESB is a net contributor to the Exchequer.  It is a world renowned company which could be the catalyst for further development in this country.  State assets and the potential earnings which might accrue to them must remain in the hands of the people.  I ask the Minister to compare the ESB, as it is now, to Eircom and the position it occupied in the past.  It is only 11 short years since our telecommunications network was in an excellent condition.  Massive improvements had been made to it, particularly the part of it located in rural areas.  People were provided with a great service.  After 11 years of profiteering, asset stripping and plundering, however, Eircom is now &euro;3.7 billion in debt and the network is crumbling.  If one travels through rural areas, one will see telephone poles leaning over.  The service is almost non-existent, which is ridiculous.  All of this occurred as a result of privatisation.  It is good to make a comparison between the ESB and Eircom.</P>
        <P>I am extremely uncomfortable with regard to what has been termed a &ldquo;fire sale&rdquo;.  I am becoming very nervous.  Should we not just inform the European Union and the IMF that we cannot pay back the money we have been loaned?  If we do not retain our indigenous assets, we will no longer be the masters of our own country.  Ireland will become a country ripped up and stripped apart by the European Union.  We will be left with nothing.</P>
        <P>State companies were established because private companies would not venture outside towns and cities where business was highly lucrative.  We all know how private companies dealt with the roll-out of broadband.  The country&rsquo;s communications and energy infrastructure &mdash; namely, roads, the rail network, fibre-optic and copper networks, electricity and gas networks, etc. &mdash; should remain in State ownership.  The current suggestion that 25% of the ESB be sold is all wrong.  It would open the door to a future sale of the whole company, including its networks.  I remind the Minister of what would have happened if a company like the ESB had been in private ownership in the past.  Does he really think a proper electricity supply would have been provided to places like Lambs Head, Valentia Island and the Black Valley?  It would have been completely cost-<Col N="802"/>prohibitive for families to set up an electricity supply when building their homes and keeping rural Ireland alive and vibrant.  They would not have had any electricity because they could not have afforded to connect their houses to the network.  We have seen the good the ESB and its workers have done in the past.  I compliment the ESB&rsquo;s excellent workers and acknowledge the great work they have done in bad weather and the worst of conditions.</P>
        <P>We have to learn from the mistakes of the past.  We know what the closure of our sugar beet factories, which has already been mentioned, meant to the people.  We closed vital parts of our rail network over the years.  If such infrastructure were still in place, it would be invaluable.  We have to realise that there is a time to sell and there is a time not to sell.  Now is not the time to strip down the ESB or any of our other State companies.  We should hold on to what we have and what took so much hard work to build.  If privatisation takes place, customers and consumers who rely on a quality service at an affordable price will lose out.  I ask the Minister to take all of this into account.  I appreciate and readily acknowledge the terribly difficult position the Minister and all his Cabinet colleagues are in.  I want to work with the Government to ensure the right decisions are taken.  I ask the Minister not to throw the baby out with the bath water.  That is all I am asking.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;commends the Government for:</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />ts commitment to delivering on energy policy priorities, including ongoing investment in energy infrastructure, ambitious targets for renewable energy, a substantive increase in energy efficiency, and the continued opening up of gas and electricity markets to competition, with resultant benefits to business and domestic consumers;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />its commitment to the major investments in critical transmission and distribution infrastructure being undertaken or planned by the ESB in electricity networks, in both this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland, by EirGrid in electricity interconnection and the roll-out of vital transmission infrastructure through Grid 25, and by Bord G&aacute;is Energy (BGE) in gas transportation networks, all of which are designed to ensure security of energy supply, enhance the delivery of renewable energy and underpin economic growth; and</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />its decision to retain the ESB as a strong, integrated utility in order to underpin and expedite the least-cost delivery of this critical energy infrastructure, while ensuring the ring-fencing of ESB businesses as necessary to continue to contribute towards increasing competition and efficiency in the all-island electricity market and in line with EU law and requirements;</P>
        <P LI="2">notes the improved broadband landscape where commercial operators have been investing over &euro;400 million per annum in rolling out critical communications infrastructure in Ireland over the last number of years and that the State continues to intervene where market failure has been identified;</P><Col N="803"/>
        <P LI="2">acknowledges that as a result of these investments Ireland will meet the EU target of a basic broadband service available everywhere by 2013, and that speeds of 100 mbps are already available to approximately 500,000 homes, and that private sector investment in high speed broadband services is continuing across a range of platforms;</P>
        <P LI="2">looks forward to the outcome of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, which is chaired by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and which seeks to accelerate the roll-out of high speed broadband across Ireland, through industry and public sector collaboration, in line with the objectives of the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government;</P>
        <P LI="2">further notes that:</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />under the EU/IMF Agreement with Ireland substantial funding is being provided to Ireland to meet the provision of public services and restore the banking system;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />this Agreement places binding obligations on Ireland to reduce its deficit to sustainable levels and that this requires implementation of necessary measures on both expenditure and revenue; and</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />the sale of State assets, as provided for in the Programme for Government, provides a potential source of funding for both debt reduction and for sustainable investment notably in the areas referred to under the NewERA heading of the Programme for Government;</P>
        <P LI="2">and, in this context, supports the Government decision to sell a minority stake in the ESB on the basis that:</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />the ESB will remain an integrated commercial energy company with strong majority State shareholding;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />a group has been established to report to Government by end of November next on the best way to approach this transaction, including size of stake for sale, timing of sale and implications for wider energy policy; and</P>
       <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />the group will be co-chaired by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">Certain elements of the Private Members&rsquo; motion before the House have some resonance with my own thinking, and I will come back to them later in these remarks.  My fundamental position, however, is that the motion is misguided and based on a completely false premise.  It indicates an unwillingness to face reality.  When I listened to Deputy Doherty, in particular, it became clear that making mischief was a large part of the impulse behind this motion.  In effect, the motion asks the House to reject any sale of State assets, which is totally unrealistic given where we find ourselves, and in particular to reject last week&rsquo;s Government decision to sell a minority stake in the ESB.  I cannot accept this motion, clearly, and, accordingly, I propose the amendment before the House.</P>
        <P>I will leave the ESB issue aside for the moment because it is important that the parameters of this debate be set out.  The simple fact of the matter is that, at present, Ireland depends totally on the funding arrangements that were put in place under the EU-IMF deal to pay for public services and to restore the banking system.  This year, we will borrow billions of euro to help to fund social welfare payments, the health and education sectors, and public service pay and pensions.  All of these borrowed funds are being provided by the European Union and the IMF.  Ireland has no other borrowing avenues available to it.  The central point is that Ireland is wholly dependent on <Col N="804"/>the EU-IMF deal to fund the services to which I referred and to which I assume the Deputies opposite attach some importance.</P>
        <P>The paymasters are not making these funds available unconditionally.  They rightly want to ensure Ireland has a credible programme in place to ensure financial sustainability.  The conditionality is set out in a memorandum of understanding between Ireland, as a sovereign state, and the European Union, the IMF and ECB troika.  The revised memorandum commits the State, at the insistence of the troika, to an ambitious programme of asset disposal.  We cannot unilaterally discard this as the motion would have us do.  Sinn F&eacute;in pretends to believe the Government can walk away from the memorandum without devastating consequences.  In terms of value, the obligation imposed on us by the memorandum has inevitably led to a particular focus on the State energy companies, especially the ESB.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, will address the broader issues concerning the memorandum of understanding with the troika, the fiscal backdrop and the Government&rsquo;s tempered and graduated approach to the consideration of any sale of State assets.</P>
        <P>I would like to focus my contribution on energy matters, with particular reference to the importance of the State energy companies in the context of contributions made by Deputies on the other side of the House.  I accept the tenor of the motion with regard to the major contribution the ESB, as a State-owned energy company, has made to economic and social development.  It is equally correct to record that the ESB has been a commercial success over the years, particularly in the increasingly competitive generation and supply environment of recent years, which I welcome.</P>
        <P>It is important to place the achievements and contributions of the ESB on record.  It has contributed close to &euro;400 million in dividends to the Exchequer in the past four years.  This included a special dividend of &euro;176 million on foot of its profit on divestment of some of its generation assets.  A customer rebate of &euro;300 million was provided by the ESB to keep costs down for all customers.  The ESB pays a substantial element of the carbon windfall levy.  This levy was put in place by statute of this House in 2010 to last until the end of 2012.  The special dividend and levy proceeds have been used to mitigate the electricity costs of large energy users that are crucial to employment and exports.</P>
        <P>The ESB has provided for capital investment of approximately &euro;10 billion in the past decade or so.  The vast bulk of this has been in the transmission and distribution network, particularly the latter.  This follows earlier years of neglect of capital investment.  This investment, which was funded by the company in partnership with EirGrid as transmission system operator, has delivered a hugely improved network infrastructure.  It has been pivotal to the excellent security of electricity supply Ireland has enjoyed in recent years, which has already been mentioned by Deputies on all sides.</P>
        <P>The ESB recently commissioned a modern gas-fired generation plant in Aghada in Cork.  I note that Bord G&aacute;is has commissioned a similar plant in nearby Whitegate.  The cumulative impact is that almost 1,000 MW of additional modern generating plant has been put in place by profitable State companies at no cost to the taxpayer.  The ESB has been to the fore in investing in renewable energy and smart technologies.  It holds a strong portfolio of wind generating assets and is involved in research in wave and tidal energy.  The company is in the process of putting in place an extensive network to underpin the use of electric vehicles.  This continues the hallmark of the ESB, which has been evident since the initial Ardnacrusha investment of the 1920s, as being to the forefront of innovation and effective delivery.</P>
        <P>It is important to record the distinctive contribution the ESB has made to our telecommunications infrastructure.  Through its subsidiary, ESB Telecoms, the company has put in place an extensive fibre-based backhaul broadband investment.  This has provided important competition to Eircom and has facilitated the roll-out of faster broadband to more places.  The ESB is investigating <Col N="805"/>the feasibility of using its extensive distribution network to facilitate a deeper penetration of fibre-based broadband throughout the country.  The delivery of key energy infrastructure &mdash; gas and electricity &mdash; is critical to enable us to tackle our reliance on a single source of gas supply and limited electricity interconnection.  Energy projects of national importance are absolutely vital to ensure secure supplies of energy.</P>
        <P>The importance of the electricity and gas infrastructure and supply chain to economic and social development cannot be emphasised strongly enough.  It is encapsulated in the oft quoted expression, &ldquo;keeping the lights on&rdquo;.  Electricity and gas are the lifeblood of economic production, whether in the high-tech ICT sector, the employment intensive services sector or indigenous sectors such as farming.  They are also fundamental to key social services.</P>
        <P>Because Ireland has such a reliable and modern electricity and gas infrastructure, we almost take it for granted.  However, we must always remember that the creation of modern and reliable energy network systems did not happen by accident.  It arose from extensive and well executed investment by State-owned companies, notably the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is, and now, more recently, by EirGrid.</P>
        <P>The Government fully endorses the strategic national importance of investing in Ireland&rsquo;s electricity transmission infrastructure.  EirGrid&rsquo;s national grid development strategy, GRID 25, is of key importance.  Development of the high-voltage electricity grid is critical to economic recovery, security of supply, competitiveness and the realisation of our renewable electricity targets, as well as regional balance in our recovery.</P>
        <P>No doubt EirGrid&rsquo;s strong professional independent management and operation of the transmission network, as well as good regulation, has further contributed to our excellent networks infrastructure and its reliability.  It has also assisted in the introduction of strong competition in the generation and supply business. In turn, strong competition in generation, underpinned by the single electricity market, SEM, exerts downward pressure on wholesale prices, which is good for competitiveness.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another key project, EirGrid&rsquo;s east-west electricity interconnector between Ireland and the UK will be completed by the end of next year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has been argued elsewhere that the severe step down in economic activity ought to result in the reining in of investment in this area.  It is true that the contraction of the economy has been dramatic but energy investment is for the long term.  Therefore, the current economic downturn does not in any way diminish the need to complete the Grid 25 strategy and other necessary investments while extracting best value in the new environment.</P>
        <P>I reject the assertion in the motion that Ireland is three to five years behind competitor countries in terms of rolling out high speed broadband.  International comparisons of retail broadband services are conducted periodically.  The ComReg statistical report for end 2010 noted the latest OECD broadband data ranked Ireland 13th of 19 EU states surveyed for fixed-line broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants.  Indeed, Ireland ranked third of 18 EU states surveyed for wireless broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants.  Our leadership position on wireless and mobile broadband is an example of how the market has responded to demand for broadband from people in sparsely populated rural areas.</P>
        <P>A wider report on broadband services in 72 countries, published in 2010 by the University of Oxford and the University of Oviedo, Spain, concluded that the broadband services currently available in Ireland are capable of meeting the requirements of today&rsquo;s broadband applications and overall, in terms of broadband quality and penetration, ranks Ireland 13th of the 72 countries studied.</P>
        <P>The fact is that Ireland has made significant progress on broadband penetration, speeds and competition.  Commercial operators have been investing steadily in rolling out critical communi<Col N="806"/>cations infrastructure in Ireland over the last number of years.  That investment has been of the order of &euro;400 million to &euro;500 million per annum.</P>
        <P>In terms of next generation broadband, speeds of up to 100 mbps are already available to 500,000 households and industry investment is set to continue in the upgrading of services available.  The Government is fully committed to supporting and driving the accelerated roll-out of high speed broadband.  Under the NewERA proposals in the programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial semi-State sector to accelerate the roll-out of high speed broadband.  This means higher speeds, to more places, quicker.  Last week, I convened the latest meeting of the next generation broadband, NGB, task force.  Its purpose is to report on the optimal policy framework and to identify a roadmap for the speedy delivery of high speed broadband availability throughout Ireland.  The NGB taskforce, which I chair, will report by year end and it is my intention to quickly proceed to implementation.</P>
        <P>The State has also invested, where the commercial sector has not delivered.  Initiatives such as the metropolitan area networks, the national broadband scheme and major international interconnectivity projects are delivering important infrastructure and services to areas of Ireland which could not be served commercially.  As a result of the combined efforts of Government and the private sector, a basic broadband service will be available to all citizens across Ireland well ahead of the EU target date of 2013.</P>
        <P>Reverting to energy issues, one of the fundamental objectives of energy policy is competitiveness of energy supply for the economy and society.</P>
        <P>Irish electricity prices were for many years above the EU average.  This was primarily due to our high dependence on imported fossil fuels, particularly gas.</P>
        <P>The Government remains firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting ongoing downward pressure on gas and electricity prices.  Moving to greater use of renewables will also reduce the impact of sudden surges in international gas prices on Irish prices.  While other measures to mitigate the cost of energy have been put in place in recent years, the drive for more, and better, competition in electricity and gas markets has had significant effects.  Customers are availing of the benefits of value and choice by shopping around for alternative suppliers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Analysis by the SEAI of official EUROSTAT electricity and gas prices shows continued convergence in Irish electricity and gas prices towards the EU average in the two years to end 2010.  This is a welcome development.</P>
        <P>However, in recent months, global wholesale gas prices have been trending significantly upwards.  This has implications for both our electricity and gas prices in view of our high dependence on gas for power generation.  This reinforces the arguments for continued investment in the electricity transmission infrastructure to achieve greater security and energy diversity, in particular, through renewables.</P>
        <P>I must emphasise that the days of an ESB monopoly in the power generation and electricity supply sectors are long gone.  There is strong competition in the power generation, due to the all-island single electricity market, underpinned by effective regulation and the independent transmission system operators, North and South.  There is ever more vigorous competition in the electricity supply sector.  This is to be welcomed.  Greater competition is good for the consumer.</P>
        <P>Of course, I accept that the ESB must be constantly vigilant in the promotion of cost efficiency in everything it does.  I acknowledge the fact that the ESB has achieved what it has in the past decade while implementing a significant reduction in numbers employed.  I also very much welcome the recent and groundbreaking deal agreed between the company and the unions on pensions.  This will have major long-term benefits for the company.  However, the focus on cost containment must <Col N="807"/>continue.  Therefore, I welcome the current negotiations between the company and the unions which are aimed at securing the delivery of the performance improvement programme of &euro;280 million per annum by 2015.</P>
        <P>The networks remain in ESB ownership and this was recently confirmed by a Government decision taken in the context of the transposition of the EU third directive on energy liberalisation.  Under this arrangement, EirGrid continues to be the transmission system operator as an independent State company.  In this sense, the ESB remains a vertically integrated energy utility, but with a strong and independent transmission system operator, and it is in this format that a minority stake in the company will be offered.  The inclusion of these regulated network assets, North and South, in the minority offering should increase the attractiveness of the stake.</P>
        <P>The importance of the electricity and gas sectors to economic and social development places the sectors in a unique position in the context of public policy and the national interest.  It is my view, given the importance of the sector to the very economic and social functioning of the State, that we must continue to have a strong and direct presence in generation, networks and supply.  This must be done in a way that protects overall economic competitiveness and does not deter private sector involvement in generation and supply.  However, I have no wish to see a scenario in which Ireland would be unduly dependent on foreign-owned energy companies in a situation where it would be a small component of a larger European market.  This approach does not preclude extracting value from the strong and profitable State companies we have built.  The process of extracting such value and the implementation of any other structural change within the State energy sector must meet, however, the simple test that they are in the public interest in the widest sense.</P>
        <P>I am strongly of the view that the sale of a minority stake in the ESB can be structured in a way that passes this test.  As Deputies are aware, a group co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been mandated by the Government to report back by the end of November on the best approach to the proposed sale of a minority stake.  Subject to a positive decision by the Government after consideration of the report of this group, I envisage the specific transaction being progressed throughout 2012.</P>
        <P>It is incorrect to assert that the decision to sell a minority stake will inevitably lead to the State losing its majority ownership.  I have already stated and the amendment emphasises that the State will continue to have a strong majority shareholding in the ESB.  This will ensure the company, while continuing to have a strong commercial focus and remaining profit-making, will retain the key role that it has in the electricity market.  It will be the task of the group to which I referred to assess the level of stake that might be offered, taking account of energy policy parameters, including regulation, and the objective of maximising yield.  The overall objective is a transaction that produces a compatible minority partner for the ESB.</P>
        <P>I have no wish to be in the position where outside forces are dictating macro fiscal policy.  I would much prefer to have been in government when the country was awash with money.  However, Ireland is on the way back.  Sinn F&eacute;in economic policy would send Ireland the way of Greece.  We have a strong underlying economy worth protecting.  We are keen to grow that economy within the constraints on us.  We can find a compatible investor that will not diminish the role played by the ESB.  We are not dependent on a golden share, as has been stated.  We are retaining majority control.  This is not a first step towards privatisation.  We must raise funds under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, at least some of which can be used for re-investment purposes.  The Government did not drive the economy onto the rocks, but we are determined to refloat it and regain sovereignty over our own affairs.  I, therefore, commend the amendment to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
     <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, has addressed energy policy and related <Col N="808"/>issues associated with the Government&rsquo;s decision to sell a minority stake in the ESB.  I will explain the broader policy context in which it has taken that decision.</P>
        <P>Like my ministerial colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, I acknowledge the important role State agencies and the ESB, in particular, have played in the economic development of the country through the provision of key infrastructure such as energy and transport infrastructure and the commercialisation of resource-based industries, including agriculture.  However, as we are aware, the country is in a desperate fiscal position, notwithstanding the fact that the public finances have stabilised.  We are dependent on the financial assistance provided under the EU-IMF programme for the continued day-to-day operation of the State.  That is an inescapable fact; one cannot wish it away.  The overwhelming public need is to bring sustainability to the public finances and foster economic growth.  That is what we are about.</P>
        <P>The point has been made by Deputies opposite that the sale of State assets is not a traditional policy of the Labour Party and it is one I accept.  In normal times we would probably not be proposing the sale of State assets, but these are not normal times.  The Labour Party remains a key advocate of State involvement in the economy.  For example, the programme for Government contains a commitment to the establishment of a public water company.  The case for State involvement in areas of market failure remains as strong as ever.  We could have had a more speedy and successful broadband roll-out in the initial stages had it been State driven, but the whole purpose of State supported economic activity is to support national development and it is entirely appropriate that the fate of any State company is subservient to this overall national goal.  To suggest anything else amounts to ideological blindness.</P>
        <P>To put the matter in context, this year the gap between the revenues and spending of the Exchequer will be of the order of &euro;15 billion, excluding the costs associated with repairing the banking system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It also includes the figure of &euro;4 billion for recapitalisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fact completely denied by the Deputies opposite who maintain that we can walk away from the EU-IMF deal and somehow restore the lost resource by magic.  The truth is that if we walk away from the deal and instruct the only funder available to the State to take a hike, as some of the Deputies opposite suggest, we would have to find that &euro;15 billion immediately or shut down services.  We would not be discussing minor cuts then, rather we would be discussing wholesale closures and sackings.  It is not a sustainable position and it is clear that the gap between the revenues and expenditure of the State must be closed.</P>

	<P>It was done by the previous Government.  Money was committed solemnly by the State.  Sometimes the Deputies opposite pay regard to the institutions of the State, but a solemn agreement was entered into by an elected Government and voted on by the Parliament.  That is not something from which one can walk away without consequences.</P>

	<P>Is that the case, even if it is economic treason?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="809"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry.  We are talking about the disposal of State assets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  It would collapse the economy.  I realise there is an anarchic trend in some of the Deputies opposite which would welcome this, but let us tell the people the truth.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to release value from the State&rsquo;s portfolio of assets, with the intention of using the proceeds to fund investment in the productive capacity of the economy.  The programme specifies a target of up to &euro;2 billion in asset sales, drawing from the recommendations of the review group on State assets and liabilities, the so-called McCarthy group.  As the House is aware, the review group reported in April and I have been consulting my ministerial colleagues on its findings and other related matters since.  The report stresses how economic recovery must be the central concern of economic policy, including, in particular, the generation of sufficient economic growth to expand employment as a key driver of economic sustainability.  It points out that the realisation of proceeds from State assets can assist in the fiscal adjustment and the generation of capacity to invest in future job creation.  However, the group cautions against a rushed sale process because this would inhibit the attainment of proper and fair value and, in many cases, it would not be prudent or even possible, given the requirement for revised regulatory procedures and complex legislation.</P>
        <P>None of this will be done speedily.  In this regard, I have stated an informed view must be taken of what is strategic and essential to the national interest.  It can be argued that the ownership and control of electricity, gas and other utility transmission networks such as water are strategic.  However, it cannot be argued that outright 100% State ownership must be retained in all cases.  The policy choice is to determine which assets to sell and in what circumstances.  Any decision on State assets must also have regard to the agreement we have made with our funding partners.  The latest EU-IMF memorandum of understanding includes a commitment to asset disposal as an essential contribution to the adjustment process in which we are engaged.</P>
        <P>The Government believes releasing value from State assets can provide funds for reinvestment in the economy, as well as reducing the State&rsquo;s debt burden.  Funds released for reinvestment in this way also have the potential to help leverage further private sector investment to grow what the original State companies did and create the next generation of State jobs since there is no private money to leverage them now.  In this way, the proceeds from the sale of State assets offer the potential to create new employment and to generate additional economic activity.  This is the policy objective we are setting about.  To this end, the Government has mandated the Minister for Finance and me to engage with our counterparts in the European Union, the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF during the forthcoming October mission to discuss a potential programme of asset disposals and, in particular, how those disposals should be applied as between retiring debt and funding productive investment in the economy to help stimulate jobs and growth.</P>
        <P>We have already broken new ground in the last two tranches of negotiations with the EU-IMF-ECB troika to indicate that we want to break away from the commitment given by the previous Government that any sale of assets would be used to retire debt.  We want to use it for job creation and growth.  In order to progress these objectives, a group co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has been established to consider the best approach in achieving such a sale, including, as the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, said, energy policy and regulatory, legal, financial and economic considerations.  All of those will be carefully balanced before we come to a final conclusion.</P>
        <P>The policy of releasing value from State assets for productive investment in the economy and for debt reduction is an appropriate response to the horrendous fiscal and economic challenges faced by the economy, the people and the Government which we inherited from our predecessors.  It will contribute to bringing sustainability to the public finances and, most of all, to fostering economic growth and job creation.  This is the task we have set about.  Objectively, in the first six <Col N="810"/>months of office we have come a long distance from teetering on the abyss of economic disaster to giving ourselves some space as we move away and give hope to people that there is an economic future for investment in this country.</P>
        <P>On that basis, I cannot accept or support the motion tabled by the Deputies opposite.  I strongly recommend the Government amendment to the House.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt do Shinn F&eacute;in as ucht an r&uacute;n seo a chur s&iacute;os.  Taca&iacute;m go m&oacute;r leis an r&uacute;n.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir nach nd&eacute;anaim sin ar son na c&uacute;iseanna a bhfuil Sinn F&eacute;in &aacute; chur ar aghaidh, ach taca&iacute;m go m&oacute;r leis go bun&uacute;sach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Government for having the courage to do a total about-turn and to implement the policies the previous Government was implementing to ensure the fiscal stability of the State and to ensure services to our people continue.</P>
        <P>I have already expressed my opposition to the proposal that has been put before us in regard to the ESB.  Our position is based on both experience and an analysis of the issues that are at stake.  I do not have a principled objection to the State selling assets.  I have always believed, as the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, knows, that where &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta owned factories and achieved value for those in order to build another factory, which would tie the factory owner to the location as he had then made a big investment and it was not easy to move, it was a gain-gain situation.  Each case has to be examined on its merits.  However, I believe the approach in this case is utterly flawed and wrong.</P>
        <P>We must analyse the issue carefully.  We had made a decision in government that we would not sell either the high voltage lines, which are the transmission lines, or the low voltage lines, which are the network of lines connecting to all houses, because they were a fundamental strategic national asset.  To sell them to private interests would shift something that had been fundamental to the development of the State right back to at least the time when Fianna F&aacute;il came into power in the 1930s.  It is very interesting that one of the constant aims of Fianna F&aacute;il was to promote the dispersal of energy so that industries could be developed throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The Government owns a company in which the State interest is the only interest because 95.5% of the shares are owned by the State and the other shares are owned by the workers, who are working for the State.  If there is a sale of a minority stake of anything up to 49%, the board immediately changes, and in that boardroom for the first time ever there will be people whose only interest is financial return.  The long-term strategic interest of the State will be to them secondary and, as they are obliged under law, return for the shareholder will be the primary interest.  What happens in that boardroom when there is a conflict between the return to the State in the national interest and the return to the shareholder in terms of a quick buck and dividend for the investor?  It will create a chaotic incompatibility and will also lead to the danger of under-investment in the grid.</P>
        <P>There is a tremendous investment programme taking place at present, and the EirGrid electricity investment project, Grid 25, is of vital importance.  Let us spell out what we are talking about.  The first thing we need this for is to reach our target of 40% of renewables by 2020.  Unless we keep investing in the grid to bring it to where the wind is, it will not be possible to reach that target.</P>
        <P>I am not suggesting that investment will give a direct repayment back to the ESB, which might make more short-term profit by not making that investment.  However, on many strategic fronts, the State would lose because we would not reach our Kyoto targets and the more ambitious targets we have set.  It would lose because we would be over-dependent on oil and what might happen in the event of any oil or gas shortage or crisis, or simply rising prices due to peak oil.  It would lose because we would be exporting money from the country to buy oil when we could keep that money <Col N="811"/>in the country for other purposes by having our own, indigenous energy sources.  In other words, wind energy would become to Ireland what the bogs and turf energy were in previous decades in terms of our not having to export money to buy the raw materials for energy generation.</P>
        <P>The second issue that will arise at board level is the reversal of a policy adopted immediately after the war by Fianna F&aacute;il, namely, that of ensuring everybody living in the State would have access to electricity at a fair price.  I do not know how much the Government knows about how the ESB prices lines into a domestic dwelling.  The reality is that we have had a social and economic development policy which stated that electricity is the right of every citizen and focused, for example, on keeping the small schools of Ireland open.  What will the shareholder whose only interest is the return on his capital want except the charging of the full economic price?  They are a bit sore in Kerry this week, which was a hard week for them, but I will use the county as an example.  If an electricity line to the back end of a Kerry has to be upgraded, the person concerned with economic return will say: &ldquo;If there are new industries in west Kerry, let them pay for the upgrade of the line because I want a return on my shares&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is interesting that we still face huge challenges in regard to investment.  I am advised that Dublin is the only place in the country with a sufficiently robust electricity supply to host major data centres.  While this may not be important to the financial investor in the ESB, it is incredibly important for balanced regional development in which we continue to invest in order that the location of such major industries must not necessarily be centralised in a single place.  In other words, my point is that the minute one brings in a private shareholder, the decisions of the board, which heretofore had been determined ultimately by the national interest, will henceforth be determined by a significant part of that board, who will have an absolute obligation to their shareholders to try to maximise the return in respect of pure profit.  I became a great believer in the semi-State sector when I saw what it could do.  I acknowledge semi-State companies do things which perhaps they should not be doing but in respect of things the private sector would not do, where it would not invest sufficiently or where there is a strategic national interest, one should not allow in the private sector.</P>
        <P>The motion before Members refers to broadband and I note the Minister has a limited vision with regard to broadband.  He thinks people like me who believe fibre should be available throughout this tiny island are living in a dream world.  However, for as long as the Government owns the ESB, it is terribly easy technically to wrap fibre around the ESB lines.  As there is an ESB line into every house in the country, by owning those lines outright the State can take a decision to use the ESB to be both the electricity and fibre carrier.  Moreover, the associated technology is becoming increasingly cheap and increasingly easy to implement.  As one literally uses existing lines, one is not obliged to erect poles or anything else but simply wraps the fibre along the lines.  Ultimately, by selling off a part-share in the lines that extend to each house in the country, the Government potentially is both doing huge damage to investment policy in this basic infrastructure and is closing down a new avenue that has opened up to resolve the issue of broadband in Ireland.</P>
        <P>There has been talk of the agreement with the EU-IMF and I have heard many contradictions from the Ministers opposite.  As the latter are so careful to point out to Members, the European Union and the IMF really are only concerned about the bottom line.  They have made this clear both to the Government and to my party as long as the targets are achieved.  Moreover, these targets are absolutely necessary anyway and even in the absence of the EU-IMF deal, we would be obliged to reduce the deficit as one cannot continue borrowing money for the current account forever.  Even if there was no EU-IMF agreement and even if the money was available, it would be imprudent for this country to continue with the type of deficit we have.  However, within that, there is room for manoeuvre.  I was fascinated to hear the Minister, Deputy Howlin, state a few minutes ago that there is no problem with the EU-IMF because while they wanted the proceeds to be put into debt retirement, the Government intends to put it into new investment.  Conse<Col N="812"/>quently, the idea that the spectre of the EU-IMF is driving the Government to this crazy proposal is absolutely belied by the Government&rsquo;s own words.  If it intends to put this money into new infrastructure, and I concur new infrastructure should be built, it should not do so by this particular route.  The really crucial infrastructure required here is physical infrastructure such as roads, broadband, electricity and gas.  The aim should be to hold on to the basic networks for all these things.  Although the electricity network could be the network for both broadband and electricity, the Government intends to sell a stake in order to be able to do what it could do much more easily by holding onto that stake.  Therefore, it is a complete contradiction in terms.</P>
        <P>I am aware the Fine Gael Party contains those who have never been believers in State companies.  They could never recognise the fantastic achievements of Bord na M&oacute;na and never realised the State companies have created profitable industries where no one in the private sector ever would.  Such people have an illogical hang-up about the disposal of State assets, which poses a huge challenge for the Labour Party.  On the other hand, I am disappointed by the reaction of some unions.  The threat of strike only feeds the paranoia of those right-wing people who believe the solution to all problems is to privatise everything and in the god of competition.  I ask the unions to fight this bizarre decision by the Government and have no difficulty with them so doing in the national interest, although they should do so in a mature and reasonable manner.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I believe that holding the country to ransom in the manner proposed would only add steel and some validity to the argument that somehow there is a problem with State monopolies.  I have never believed that those who work in State monopolies should be allowed to use muscle for their own personal gain.  I believed those assets truly exist for the good of the nation and that people in such entities were entitled to good terms of employment.  However, they were not entitled to either bad work practices or terms of employment that were far in excess of anything in comparative industries.  I believe they should be efficient and should be models of good practice.  I hope the vast majority of workers in the State companies, who share my view of what a State company should be, will not follow a leadership who will be completely destructive of the national interest in this case by making the case for the privateers who wish to begin disposing of these assets.</P>
        <P>If the Government sells a 30% or 40% stake, it will set up a board on which two wings exist from the outset.  There will be a wing that considers the national interest in investment decisions and another that considers the shareholder interest and the profit interest while making decisions.</P>

	<P>These interests are incompatible and I believe in such circumstances, slowly but surely, step by step, the argument then would be put forward to privatise the entire entity.  Consequently, one will wake up some day to find that when electricity is needed or wires to connect to important natural resources in wind and wave energy are needed, or wires to facilitate industrial policies or wires to bring basic services to households throughout the State are needed, we will be told their provision does not stack up on a profit and loss basis and the national interest cannot be served as it is now purely a private company.</P>

	<P>One has been told constantly that Governments cannot create jobs.  However, past Governments did create jobs in companies such as Bord na M&oacute;na, the ESB, Aer Lingus, Bord G&aacute;is and Eircom, all of which contributed handsomely to the State.  Moreover, such employment was of a high quality.  If one compares the fate of Eircom with the ESB in the past <Col N="813"/>ten to 15 years after the former was sold off, it is evident how Eircom was stripped of its assets and the only dominant concern was how much the shareholders would make.  At the same time, the lack of investment meant the country went backwards because it did not have this key infrastructure.  It demonstrates how important a strategic asset really is.  Members have been told a decision has been made to sell a minority share but they have no idea what that means as it could be 5% or 49%.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
        <P>We are going to have a dual interest in the boardroom of the ESB in the future which will comprise public and private interests.  Private interest is about protecting shareholders.  There could be all kinds of conflicts in that regard.</P>
        <P>The ESB is being eyed up as it is a very valuable asset which has enormous potential into the future because energy will be a huge issue.  Wind and wave energy will become more important when no more holes can be bored to get oil and gas.  It is the asset in which we need to invest, rather than sell off.  I have no doubt that people will be queueing up for it because of its potential.  It could deliver a dividend in the future which would help to pay our way out of some of our current problems.  I have serious concerns about interfering with the ESB in this way.</P>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It is shameful that any Government, particularly one which includes the Labour Party, would consider selling any part of a vital strategic public asset like the ESB, Bord na M&oacute;na or Coillte.  It is even more shameful that it is being done under the diktat of the European Union and the IMF to pay off the private debts of bondholders, speculators and vultures of the financial market. </P>
        <P>It is extraordinary that because of the greed of people in the private banking system who crashed the European economy, the response demanded by the European Union and the IMF, and implemented by the Government, is to take another vital area of the economy and hand it over to the same privateers and profit and greed driven people who crashed the financial system.  It beggars belief.</P>
        <P>It is the definition of betrayal, sell-out and economic treason that any Government would consider giving away even a part of something as important as the ESB.  It is a slippery slope to begin privatising the ESB.  The State was transformed from being a Third World country to a modern state primarily as a result of a public enterprise, the ESB, assisted by other publicly owned enterprises such as Bord na M&oacute;na.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Now, when the vultures of the private market have failed us, is the time we need such enterprises most.  We need to invest in them to put people back to work and put our economy on a rational and sound footing.  We need to invest in the things our society needs.  We should aim for energy security, infrastructure and the provision of jobs for the people.  I challenge the Government to tell me if it or the European Union and the IMF can put forward any justification why in a so-called rescue package it is a good idea for us to sell our vital State assets.  How does that help economic recovery?</P>

    <Title>European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2011: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Prior to the adjournment of the debate I spoke about the size of the EFSF.  One issue which is causing concern among the markets is credibility.  The size of the fund does not have the capacity to deal with the functions that have now been assigned to it.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks as the issue of contagion has begun to affect larger economies such as Italy and Spain, the issue of credibility crystallised all the more. It is important, especially in the context of the potential, through the EFSF, of recapitalising Europe&rsquo;s banks.  The head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, speaking at the August annual meeting of central bankers in Wyoming in the US suggested there was a need for the urgent recapitalisation of Europe&rsquo;s weakest lenders and shoring up the banking system was the key to cutting the chain of contagion across the Continent.</P>
        <P>In its global economic outlook, the IMF today reiterated the point that many of Europe&rsquo;s banks need additional capital.  While the cost of recapitalising the Irish banks has been horrendous, we are further down the road than many of our European counterparts at getting to the bottom of the black hole in our banking system.  While the measures agreed give governments the opportunity to borrow from the EFSF to recapitalise their banks, Christine Lagarde was, in essence, suggesting it could be used to recapitalise banks by force.</P>
        <P>The results of last July&rsquo;s stress tests revealed that nine of the 91 banks tested failed, with a core tier 1 capital ratio of less than 5%.  While national regulators are due to report in October on progress made on forcing recapitalisation of banks that failed or nearly failed the stress tests, the question arises as to how long this process will take.  Decisive action by policy makers to accelerate the rollout of the EFSF and cover the write-down of Greek exposures by the banks is urgently needed.</P>
        <P>In addition to stabilising Italy and Spain, the euro area should make it clear that it will do whatever it takes to quell what is increasingly becoming a self fulfilling debt crisis.  Put simply, the EFSF may not have enough funds to undertake the massive bond purchases that may ultimately be required to stabilise the market.</P>
        <P>The Minister and his eurozone colleagues should give consideration to it obtaining a line of credit from the ECB in addition to the funds it can raise to the issuing of bonds.  A scheme of this sort could give it at least &euro;2,000 billion euro in firepower, perhaps significantly more.  The US Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, is reported as having alluded to this possibility during recent discussions in Poland and it is something that needs to be given serious consideration.</P>
        <P>In addition to addressing the size of the fund, the potential for it to be used for imaginative solutions to assist member states needs to be examined.  I note the Minister is currently giving consideration to changes in the operation of the promissory notes provided as part of the recapitalisation work done in Anglo Irish Bank.  The suggestion from Karl Whelan of involving the EFSF in this regard is worthy of close consideration because we would all welcome a restructuring of the arrangement and whether a reduction in the overall bill could be achieved.</P>
        <P>Under that proposal, the EFSF would provide a 30 year loan to Anglo Irish Bank to pay off the emergency funding from the ECB for which it currently uses the promissory note as collateral.  The note could then be restructured as a 30 year bond to be repaid in full at the end of the period.</P><Col N="815"/>
        <P Just="Left">I find it very difficult to understand the attitude of the ECB to the efforts of the Government to secure some burden sharing among the remaining unsecured unguaranteed bondholders at Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  These institutions are being wound down, their deposits have been transferred and they no longer issue any new loans.  They are in a completely different scenario from AIB and Bank of Ireland, the two pillar banks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In concluding this debate, the Minister should give us the bottom line from the ECB in terms of what it is saying to us, its objection and what it would do if the Government decided to proceed with imposing losses on the bondholders.  It is important that we know this.  I welcome the Bill, which we will support.  I look forward to continuing this debate with the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>With every day that passes the euro crisis gets deeper.  Last night Italy was again in the spotlight as Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s cut its credit rating by one notch from A+ to A.  Meanwhile the world&rsquo;s financial media is camped out in Athens waiting for what many people believe is the inevitable Greek default.  All the while the financial markets circle the eurozone like a wake of vultures, drooling over the prospect of yet another currency carcase to devour.</P>
        <P>In response to this escalating crisis, the Governments of Germany, France and Greece hold endless emergency conference calls, followed by resolute words but very little action.  On the sidelines, the rest of Europe&rsquo;s governments sit passively, watching on and hoping that somebody else does something about the crisis which they were partly responsible for creating.</P>
        <P>In truth the actions and inactions of leaders across Europe are making the crisis worse.  Endless EU summitry, ambiguous summit conclusions and the inevitable post-summit disagreements are wasting valuable time and energy.  All the while the ordinary people of Greece, Ireland and Portugal are paying a very real human price as endless rounds of austerity push hundreds of thousands if not millions of families further into poverty and financial hardship.</P>
        <P>At the core of this failure of political leadership across Europe is the simple fact that our governments do not understand the causes of the crisis in the eurozone.  This is not a debt crisis.  This is not a crisis of overspending or bad economic management in the periphery of the eurozone.  This is not a crisis that can be solved by forcing countries to bleed their economies and societies dry in return for meeting EU and IMF-imposed deficit reduction targets.  The crisis of the eurozone is first and foremost a banking crisis.  Years of reckless lending and borrowing within the European banking system created a financial bubble of enormous proportions.  When that bubble burst the result was a drought of investment and a slowdown of consumer spending.  In turn unemployment rose, tax revenues fell and borrowing increased.</P>
        <P>Some countries, such as Ireland, added fuel to the recessionary fire.  A reliance on property-based tax reliefs and other fair weather taxes hollowed out the tax base.  When the bubble burst they went even further by excessively guaranteeing the toxic debts of bad banks such as Anglo Irish Bank and underwriting loans from the ECB to repay these debts.  Is it any wonder that the deficit spiralled out of control?  The end result was an ever-growing mountain of sovereign debt bloated with extra toxic banking debt coupled with spiralling unemployment.  Under this dual strain of debt and unemployment the euro started to crack.  Inherent design flaws and clear mismanagement exposed the fact that the single currency was not designed to handle a crisis on this scale.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, European political leaders appear even less equipped to handle this social and economic strain.  Rather than dealing directly with the growing levels of debt and the drought of investment, the EU institutions, supported willingly by member state governments, tried to treat the symptoms of the crisis rather than the cause.  Their response was to deal with a banking crisis by bailing out the banks and to impose the cost of these bailouts on ordinary working people through crippling EU-IMF austerity programmes.  Somehow this magic formula was supposed to <Col N="816"/>reduce the governments&rsquo; deficits and reassure the markets to lend to the indebted states at lower interest rates.</P>
        <P>The European Financial Stability Facility was a key element of this policy.  Using guarantees from all EU member states it borrowed money from the financial markets to lend back to member states that were blocked out of the international markets.  This money was and is being loaned to Ireland, Portugal and Greece, on condition that the EU-IMF policies of bank bailouts and crippling austerity were adhered to.  The proposition was as simple as it was illogical.  Seeking to resolve a debt mountain by heaping more debt on member states is absurd.  It is not possible to stimulate economic recovery by wrenching billions of euro from the domestic economy and from the pockets of those who spend in the local economy.</P>
        <P>More than 18 months has passed since the EU agreed the first austerity programme with Greece.  Has the policy prescription meted out by the European Union and the IMF cured the Greek patient?  Clearly it has not.  If anything it has made the Greek economy weaker and the suffering of the Greek people greater.  It gives me no pleasure at all to say that former Deputy, Arthur Morgan, predicted this when he opposed the original Euro Area Loan Facility Bill in May 2010.  He said then that the EU facility and the loans it would provide to Greece were not an act of solidarity to assist a beleaguered fellow member state.  He told this House that it was a massive bailout for toxic banks the cost of which would be paid by taxpayers across Europe.  Unfortunately the recent news from Greece confirms beyond any doubt that Arthur Morgan&rsquo;s and Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s analysis at that time was right.  Greece is probably soon to receive its second bailout.  Its government bond yields have hit historical highs of 23% and almost every economist and commentator in the world believes that it is only a matter of time before Greece defaults.</P>
        <P>Clearly aware of the fact that their dual approach of bank bailout and crippling austerity was not working EU leaders gathered in June and July this year in Brussels.  We were told that these summits would be different.  We were told that our governments finally understood the scale of the crisis and decisive action would follow, yet when the dust had settled after the summits, a very different picture emerged.  While some form of burden sharing on toxic private banking debt was to be allowed for Greece, albeit of a voluntary nature, all other member states, including ours, agreed to &ldquo;solemnly reaffirm their inflexible determination to honour fully their own individual sovereign signature&rdquo;.  This is Euro-speak for a cast iron commitment to bailing out toxic banks irrespective of the cost to the taxpayer.  However, worse was to come.  The summit conclusions also included a guarantee from each government to meet &ldquo;commitments to sustainable fiscal conditions and structural reforms&rdquo;.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case this is a commitment to fully implement the EU-IMF austerity programme agreed by Fianna F&aacute;il in 2010.</P>
        <P>Greece, weighed down by bank bailouts and crippling austerity, was brought to the brink of financial collapse, a collapse that contained the potential to destroy the euro.  In response the governments of the eurozone, including this Fine Gael and Labour Party Government, signed a commitment to follow exactly the same policies, and to blindly follow in Greece&rsquo;s footsteps, led ably by the IMF and the European Union.</P>
        <P>The summit also agreed to further centralisation of fiscal and macroeconomic decision making at an EU level, further undermining the ability of individual member states to respond with the flexibility required to meet each state&rsquo;s individual economic and social needs.  The stupidity of all of this is truly breathtaking.  Even more breathtaking was the spin placed on this agreement by the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government when its delegation returned from Brussels.  We were told this was a major achievement in that the Government secured an interest rate reduction and in addition the State would have an option of extending the maturities on that debt from 7.5 years to 15 years at a minimum.  There were other changes of which the State could avail at a later stage, <Col N="817"/>including accessing EFSF moneys to further recapitalise the banks and facilitating the ECB to buy back government bonds on the secondary market at a potentially reduced rate.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s response to these measures was very clear at the time.  Of course, we welcomed any reduction in the interest rate &mdash; we called for it &mdash; and any other measure which would assist in making the State&rsquo;s sovereign debt more sustainable.  However, crucially the package of measures outlined in the 21 July eurozone summit conclusions completely ignored the central problems facing the peripheral eurozone economies and the eurozone as a whole.  It completely failed to address the overall level of debt held by those eurozone countries most at risk from default, including Ireland.  It did nothing to address the urgent need for investment in job creation and economic and social recovery.  The so-called positives at the 21 July summit are nothing more than a sideshow when compared to the tsunami of debt currently engulfing the State.  The much lauded July deal was nothing more than a sticking plaster on a wound so great that only amputation would halt the loss of blood and keep the patient alive.</P>
        <P>Two months have passed since the leaders of the eurozone economies agreed to this package of measures.  Have the markets calmed since?  Have the Government bond yields of Greece, Portugal and Ireland fallen sufficiently?  Has the prospect of a Greek default receded?  The answer to each of these questions is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Once again European leaders, including Fine Gael and the Labour Party, are failing.  They are failing their own citizens, the citizens of their neighbouring countries and the eurozone.</P>
        <P>On this basis Sinn F&eacute;in is not in a position to support this Bill.  While it contains some elements that without doubt are positive, particularly the interest rate reduction, it cannot be presented as anything close to the kind of comprehensive solution to the crisis gripping the eurozone.  Worse still, it introduces, in the most underhand way, the permanent European Stability Mechanism which contains greater risk to Ireland and the European Union as a whole.  Sinn F&eacute;in is already on record calling for a referendum on the ESM, and for the Government to introduce this measure under the cover of the EFSF legislation is downright dishonest.</P>
        <P>Stabilising the euro will only be achieved when the policies of bank bailout and crippling austerity are abandoned.  In their place the Government and its eurozone counterparts need to force significant burden-sharing on toxic debt from the European Central Bank such as the infamous Anglo Irish Bank promissory note.  As the overall toxic debt burden is lifted, governments across Europe must start to invest in social and economic recovery.  Anything short of this will drive the eurozone, and the economy, deeper into crisis.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in is against bank bailouts, austerity and making ordinary working people and those on low incomes pay for the reckless behaviour of banks and governments.  Sinn F&eacute;in is for banks shouldering their fair share of the burden of the crisis and investment in jobs, services, communities and people.  We are for a new deal for Europe that puts economic recovery first.  On that basis we will oppose this Bill and continue to argue for a more comprehensive and sustainable solution to the crisis across the eurozone.</P>

	<P>We are aware that while we can table any number of amendments to this legislation, the one thing that is certain is that none of them will be accepted.  That seems to be the message, and that is deeply troubling.  Most Members would be unhappy with that kind of arrangement.</P>
        <P>A question that keeps going through my head is what will happen in 2013.  We are supposed to return to the markets by then, yet we will have to come up with our share of this new fund.  There are many questions in my mind about that.</P><Col N="818"/>
        <P>We are buying into something at a time when there is deep political uncertainty.  There is a lack of leadership at European level.  It is not that long ago that Chancellor Merkel reminded us that she wanted to be the Chancellor of Germany.  Nor is it that long ago since President Sarkozy used the argument of his concerns about our corporate tax rate for his own purposes for internal consumption within France.  That lack of solidarity is a backdrop to this legislation and this mechanism.  It is not clear from where the required leadership will come but the one thing that is certain is that it is required.</P>
        <P>We saw today the downgrading of the credit rating of Italy, a country we are told is too big to bail out, yet the provisions in this legislation allow for a stepping-out of guarantors and a sharing of the amount that must be contributed to the fund.  What happens if a very large country steps out?  That would put incredible pressure on the other countries.</P>
        <P>I was no fan of the Maastricht treaty.  I knocked on doors during the campaign for it because I thought it was being sold as a measure under which we would get &euro;6 billion or &euro;8 million.  It was not fairly sold on the merits of what was being proposed.  If something was going to go belly-up, the people who would pay the price if we could not meet the criteria would be poor people and our public services.  It did not take much to figure that out.  We were sold the treaty on the basis that we would get &euro;6 billion or &euro;8 billion and we are paying an awful price for the hoodwinking of the electorate.  We saw the convincing that needed to be done in regard to the Lisbon and Nice treaties as a consequence of this.</P>
        <P>What will be the governance arrangements around this mechanism?  Are we moving towards a federal Europe?  In the same way as we were mis-sold the Maastricht treaty, are we being mis-sold this measure in that we are moving towards a federal model?  If we are, we should know about it.  We should decide we will do it if we think it is good for us or decide we will not do it if we think it is bad for us.  This is not benign.</P>
        <P>The Minister said, as was stated in some of the background material to this measure, that it will give us access to a triple A rating.  The agencies that decided our credit rating, Moody&rsquo;s and Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, are the ones that decided to assign a tripe A rating to Anglo Irish Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland.  I do not place a great deal of confidence on their credit rating being some sort of a guarantee for the future when they got it so wrong in the past, and it is not that long ago since they assigned those ratings.</P>
        <P>I wish to quote a few extracts from a discussion paper prepared by TASC on the debt and banking crisis.  The paper states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The design of the Euro zone&rsquo;s permanent loan facility, the European Stabilisation Mechanism (ESM), is flawed for a number of reasons.  The reasons are as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">First of all, the interest rates charged under the ESM will be ... unsustainable high levels.  Second, the preferred creditor status taken by the official lenders is a disincentive for investors to purchase member state bonds.  This exacerbates the difficulty for member states wishing to access the bond market at sustainable rates.  Third, the proposed collective action clauses (the creditor bail-ins) on bonds issued after 2013 will increase the difficulty for member states trying to access the bond markets at sustainable interest rates in the future.  Finally, the conditionality of extreme austerity imposed on members states wishing to obtain access to the EFSF and/or the ESM reduces the ability of the members state to grow out its crisis.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Our domestic economy is very depressed.  The austerity measures particularly hit that part of the economy that accounts for 60% of it.  In all the discussion on this prior to the general election it was stated that we would not be able to cut or tax our way out of this but that we would have to have some element of growing our way out of it.  Essentially, we have moved on from that now.  It <Col N="819"/>is a question of us being able to reduce the amount we owe if we are going to be able to solve our problems.</P>
        <P>The TASC discussion document describes Ireland as an emerging economy.  It states that in the case of emerging economies, an 80% to 90% debt to GDP ratio is the danger zone, yet Ireland&rsquo;s debt to GDP level will be approximately 120% by 2013.  In this document they themselves say there is no silver bullet, and I accept this.  However, we should consider issues other than the simple ability to borrow from a lender of last resort.  Governance issues are not being stated.  We are moving blindly towards something instead of confronting the possibility that we are opting into a federal Europe.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak on this important legislation, the European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2011.  It deeply saddens me to see where the country is.  Our economic sovereignty is gone and we all want it back.  Politicians, bankers and developers have brought us to where we are and it is depressing to see some of them, such as Michael McDowell on television last night, sticking their heads up again and talking about our Constitution and our Presidency while they were the ones, with their free market housing and mad stamp duty policies, who wrecked the country.</P>

	<P>I am not afraid to say I look forward to the day when we get out of this mess.  In doing so, we should never penalise the unemployed, the old, the sick or the disabled.  Sadly, that is what the Government is doing.  Punishing people for the sins of others should never be an option.  There is another way and I would like to outline it in this debate.  We all have a duty to work together on this huge financial matter.  All members of the Oireachtas have a duty to come up with ideas to resolve this crisis.  During the past five or six months, Members from the Independent group have put forward relevant proposals to resolve the crisis.  I commend my colleagues in the Independent-Technical group on some of their positive and constructive proposals.</P>

	<P>Deputy McGrath was there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In May 2010 the euro area member states agreed to create a European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, to financially support the euro area member states that were in difficulties caused by the exceptional circumstances beyond their control.  The EFSF was incorporated on 7 June 2010 for the purpose of providing stability and support to the euro area member states in the form of guaranteed loans of up to &euro;440 billion within a limited period.  To ensure a AAA rating, which provides access to low cost funds, the EFSF adopted complex structures involving over-guarantee of lending and credit enhancement measures such as cash buffers and prepaid margins on loans.  These measures reduced its effective lending capacity to some &euro;250 billion and also increased the effective cost of borrowing for borrowers.</P>
        <P>Under the EU-IMF financial assistance programme agreed on 28 November 2010, Ireland has accessed a loan from the EFSF of &euro;4.2 billion, maturing in July 2016.  The amount available to <Col N="820"/>Ireland from the EFSF under the programme is &euro;17.7 billion.  That is what is at the heart of the legislation.  This is what we are talking about.</P>
        <P>We also need to change our mindset in the House and in the country with regard to dealing with proposals for solving our economic crisis.  It is important we do not dismiss those who say we should look at the taxation issue.  We should not walk away from the T word as we debate ways of getting out of our current situation.</P>
        <P>I wonder if the Minister and other Deputies are following the debate in the United States where a multi-billionaire, Warren Buffett, says the mega-rich should pay more tax.  This idea should be taken up in Ireland.  This wealthy billionaire is advocating a policy of taxing the rich rather than lower and middle income people.  Ever since the Thatcher and Reagan era of the 1980s, there has been a steady transfer of wealth to the very rich, which has accelerated in recent years as hard-working people have taken the cuts in income to bail out super wealthy bankers.  Not only is this socially unjust, it is also economic insanity. Those on low and middle incomes reinvest practically all their money in their local economies, keeping more people in work.  On the other hand, the mega-rich hoard much of their wealth, buy gold and silver and high end luxury imports or speculate on money markets, which is causing so much turmoil in the European Union.  All of this generates fewer jobs.  If money is given to lower and middle income people, they will spend it in their localities and employment will be created.</P>
        <P>I say to Deputy Durkan and the Minister that it is time the Government stopped implementing the failed policies of the past ten years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will Deputy McGrath accept his share of the responsibility for the problem?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Do not tell me there is another one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>My second proposal is that the Minister should look at another taxation system which has been floating around Europe during the summer.  This would see 0.5% of every euro spent on business related financial transactions, or merely 50 cent in every &euro;1,000, levied on those involved in the transaction.  This is not a tax on banks, which are prone to making losses, but on the transactions themselves, such as financial speculation and other purchases.  Globally, it is estimated that this mechanism could raise &euro;500 billion a year, money that could be used to tackle poverty and climate change issues at home and abroad and lessen the cuts to the poor, the disabled and special needs assistants.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s apology.  I would like the Minister to consider another proposal as he prepares the budget.  It relates to the cigarette industry.  Extra Government revenue of &euro;758 million is possible.  The Government will earn &euro;10.4 billion from tobacco excise duty in the next ten years assuming there is no change in the excise structure, no excise increases and no industry price increase, and assuming a decline in duty due to lower consumption and the growth of the value sector at the expense of the premium sector.  Tobacco is not politically correct, but I am interested in raising money for the Government.  The tobacco industry contributes &euro;1.6 billion in excise or 24% of total excise receipts.  Changing the excise structure protects Government revenue and discourages price wars.  Moderate and predictable increases maximise Government revenues.  Sharp increases in excise threaten Government revenues and strengthen the illicit cigarette trade.</P>
        <P>I have put forward three sensible solutions to raise a few bob for the State.  I welcome the debate and I hope some of my ideas and proposals on the economy will help us get out of this very difficult situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair  play to Deputy McGrath.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>I will start from the point where I hope to finish, that is to say, I will be supporting the European Financial Stability Facility and the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2011.  However, this debate requires some serious consideration of important aspects, many of which have already been made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Italy&rsquo;s credit grading has been reduced.  Europe&rsquo;s banks and the European economies are on the most fragile ground ever since the European project got under way.  The yield on Greek one year bonds &mdash; forget about ten year bonds &mdash; was at 147% the other day.  That means they have been written down by 50%, certainly.  That is the mathematical expression,  yet the meeting on 21 July looked at a write down of only 21%-22%.  Deutsche Bank, which represents about 60% of the entire German economy, with &euro;1.6 trillion on its balance sheet, has leverage of 52:1.  Cr&eacute;dit Agricole in France has leverage of 74:1.  These are just expressions of how fragile is the banking system.  When it entered the troika agreement in November 2010, Ireland was stretched to its limit.  It remains stretched to its limit, notwithstanding the reliefs of the cups of water in interest rate reductions in recent months.  The actual size of the debts in our banking system, together with national debt, are crushing the economy.  One of the most important aspects of the Wyoming meeting of central bankers at the end of August looked at the whole question of debt as a proportion of GDP in 18 of the OECD countries.  I am currently trying to get the figures that would apply to Ireland if it had been included in that table.  Japan led that table and we know that growth in the Japanese economy has been pretty well smothered for the past few years.</P>
        <P>This was alluded to by Deputy Doherty and I want to be fair to all the contributors in the House, because the expressions are honest expressions of homework well done and proposals well made.  This Parliament, as a member of the eurozone, in passing the Bill before us, can send a very strong caution and message to Europe, which is that the debt burden on the country should be reviewed.  There are ways of doing this, such as re-examining the promissory notes in Anglo Irish Bank, which arose as a result of the failure to write down the amounts owing to bondholders.</P>
        <P>I would like to remind the larger countries in the eurozone, particularly Germany, as they debate and dither on what kind of firm action is needed, that they should remember the 1953 London Debt Agreement, where large levels of loans were written down, following which the German <Col N="822"/>economy began to grow and recover.  That proposal on revisiting the pro-note liability has been put forward by Karl Whelan.  I have had conversations with him on that subject going back nearly a year, and I would commend it on the consideration and support of this House.</P>
        <P>The crisis is severe and Europe&rsquo;s leaders have not stepped up to their responsibilities.  I encourage the Minister for Finance to keep explaining to the people of Europe and to the ECB the provenance of our indebtedness to the ECB.  It was a result of us redeeming bondholders in full, when the previous Government did not acknowledge the level of losses in the banks.  It behoves us to get that message across and it behoves the Europeans to pay attention to it.  They must recognise the truth of the situation and recognise it tangibly.</P>
        <P>I want to respond to a couple of points made by Deputy Finian McGrath.  We all have to come together to work through this crisis.  My country is dear to me.  That is why I put my name forward to become a public representative.  There are people who should consider their positions, such as very wealthy non-resident and high earning citizens of this country.  There is a crisis and they should consider Warren Buffet&rsquo;s suggestion that they can contribute by way of taxation.  They can also consider the justification for a special levy for four years on incomes above, say, &euro;200,000 per annum.  Just because they live abroad does not mean they do not benefit from their families remaining here.  If they have a fire in their homes in Dublin, it is not the Monte Carlo or Swiss fire brigade that will put out that fire.  They should remember this.</P>
        <P>In every meeting with the European Commission or the ECB, we should remind them that we have justification in persisting to seek a loan write down to relieve the overall burden of debt in this economy, in order that it can be passed and transferred back to businesses and households that need it.  We spoke two weeks ago about mortgage debt write down, which was called forgiveness.  It is actually about writing down to collectable amounts.</P>
        <P>I call on the political leaders of Europe to commit and to cease the words, words and words.  There has been an interminable amount of words and a lack of action and commitment.  About &euro;75 billion needs to be written down in our banking system.  In Portugal, it is about &euro;65 billion.  In Greece, it is at least &euro;175-200 billion, and not the &euro;50 billion that was discussed on 21 July.  Italy and Spain need write downs equivalent to about &euro;200 billion.  If we tot it all up and make a cushion provision, we are approaching &euro;2 trillion.  That needs to be done sooner rather than later.  A limp along and unsynchronised progression of legislation in the 17 eurozone countries is a dangerous cocktail.  We need to keep getting that message across and not detract from it for one moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak this evening on the European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2011.  That title is a bit of a mouthful.  This Bill will essentially implement the decision agreed by the EU member states on 21 July 2011.  The Bill will increase the effective lending capacity of the EFSF to &euro;440 billion, and will increase the flexibility of the EFSF and ESM by allowing them to act on the basis of a precautionary programme.</P>
        <P>The euro member states agreed in May to create a European financial stability facility to support financially eurozone member states that are in difficulties caused by exceptional circumstances beyond their control.  This is part of the essence of why we are all here today.  We are going to be here next year and the following year, because I do not believe that some of what we are dealing with is beyond the control of the respective member states.  It is essentially as a result of decisions by governments and states, and perhaps the population of Europe at large, to run a deficit and to spend money we do not have.  We have a financial problem and not a political problem.</P>
        <P>Ireland was the first beneficiary from this and Portugal followed shortly afterwards.  On 30 June 2011, the euro area Ministers of Finance signed the European financial stability facility framework agreement, subject to the completion of national parliamentary procedures.  The purpose of this discussion is to allow the Oireachtas to complete this procedure.  Ireland, Portugal and Greece cannot benefit from reduced interest rates, an issue to which I will return, and increased flexibility <Col N="823"/>until the agreement is fully implemented.  Hence, legislation on the agreement must pass through all relevant national parliaments, including that of Greece.</P>
        <P>The cost of bailing out bankrupt banks has been a particular problem in Ireland.  However, the cost of the budget deficit is a much larger problem in Ireland and at European level generally.  Most European countries, including France and Germany, are running deficits, as is the United States.  A few years ago, one used figures of thousands.  We subsequently spoke of millions and later billions.  The word &ldquo;trillions&rdquo; now hangs in the air and the US debt of between &euro;16 trillion and &euro;17 trillion is beginning to give us an indication of where we are.  Japan has been running a deficit for some time and has some of the highest borrowing levels in the world.  I concur with Deputy Mathews that its growth rates have been muted.  How could they be other than muted when the country has such a large debt?  As with any household, one cannot spend and invest when one has a large overhang of debt.</P>
        <P>Where is all this leading?  China is essentially financing the overspending of western democracies, which used to borrow for capital investment programmes and repay the borrowing over a period.  How many western countries are running current deficits with the result that their citizens have lifestyles that are not based on the income they are generating?  This cost must be paid and essentially people are asking future generations to pay for their lifestyle.  That may sound a little harsh but it goes to the heart of this debate.</P>
        <P>The agreement refers to reduced interest rates and increasing the flexibility of and extending the repayment schedule.  I have a simple view on this matter.  While a person with a bank loan or mortgage who extends the loan will succeed in having his or her monthly payment reduced, he or she will pay more interest in the long term because the life of the loan is being extended.  For this reason, I ask responsible journalists to give a complete picture when they are reporting on these matters.  I noticed a headline in a reputable paper the other day stating that the changes to our loan facility will deliver savings of &euro;10 billion.  This reminds me of a person who, having bought an item in a sale which has been marked down from &euro;100 to &euro;90, returns home and when asked how the Saturday shopping trip went, says he or she saved &euro;10.  This is a nonsensical concept and I am surprised that a responsible journalist would put such a headline on an article.  The person returning from the shop does not tell us how much he or she spent in the first place.  In fact, he or she may not have saved anything because we do not know whether the item in question ever cost &euro;100 as it may have been marked up before being marked down.  The same applies to the extension of the loan period for our loan.</P>
        <P>When representatives of the National Treasury Management Agency appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Service and Reform recently, they could not pin down the actual savings being made on our loan.  I would like to know what will be the savings over the original agreement based on the interest rate we paid.  The NTMA should be able to compute a figure on the actual accumulated interest Ireland will pay based on a matrix of using the loan facility to its maximum and rescheduling repayments at the reduced interest rate.  The overall interest payment will increase.  To put the matter in simple English, the country is living on hire purchase which it is repeatedly extending.</P>
        <P>This returns me to my basic position.  The crisis at European level is not political but financial.  I have been saying for months, although I am not sure if anyone has been listening, that the problem will persist because it is one to which there is no political solution.  It is a financial problem for which a financial solution must be found.  People give out about the reaction of the markets and ratings agencies such as Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s and Moody&rsquo;s.  The markets react in a logical fashion when they see a band aid of an agreement.  While I support the legislation, it is only a band aid or patch up job to get us over the next few months, at which point another band aid will be applied.  We will be back at this point<i> ad infinitum</i> or until western countries are in a position to get their debt under control.  By continuing to borrow more money that one does not have, one passes on the debt to one&rsquo;s children.  This is unfair.  In Japan and some other countries, people have two generation mortgages.  Ireland will have a two or three generational national debt unless we start <Col N="824"/>getting it under control.  The Minister will argue that my party added to the problem.  I will not engage in party politics and will admit that we did so, but the problem is continuing and must be addressed.</P>
        <P>Eurobonds are the latest trick proposed by some people.  If I was a German, I would tell those proposing eurobonds to take a hike because the concept is essentially one of asking Germany to open up its bank accounts and allow all other countries to be joint signatories to them.   This is daft and Germany and France are correct to tell the rest of Europe to take a hike.  The current problem stems from the failure to introduce a proper infrastructure to back up the euro when it was introduced.  We had money in our pocket and the euro worked well within a few days of the changeover.  While we did the public relations, front-of-house job, we did not establish the infrastructure or back office facilities to back up the euro.  There should be one central bank in Europe managing one currency.  The concept of having a Mickey Mouse central bank in each of the 27 countries printing its own little currency with its own little pictures on it is a nonsense.  While I am not praising or criticising Germany and France, it is utterly financially logical that they would not have anything to do with a eurobond when they do not have any control over how other countries are spending money.</P>
        <P>The IMF, in the growth projections it published today, stated that financial sovereignty is needed in Europe.  We will rear up to this proposal and it will not be realised because it would require a referendum in this country and there is no chance that Irish people would pass a referendum in the foreseeable future to give Europe more powers over our financial affairs.  People resent the level of intrusion into our affairs at present and would not go further down that road.  We will have to address this issue.</P>
        <P>Seven or eight years ago I used to ask that the debt of some of the heavily indebted sub-Saharan countries be written off.  Ireland has come full circle and become a heavily indebted country.  Until western democracies start to live within their means, we will continue to borrow and wonder every so often why the financial markets have a problem with political solutions to what are essentially financial problems.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the legislation, it is a sticking plaster and we will, unfortunately, be back discussing this issue again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This will not be the longest speech I have ever made.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government on their efforts.  I do not wish to apportion political blame but they have found themselves in a very difficult position and have stuck to their task valiantly.  They have nudged away successfully to the point where gains have been made and every little gain is welcome.  Much more needs to be done and I have no doubt the Government is committed to doing much more.</P>
        <P>I concur with many of the views expressed by Deputy Fleming on the need for the country to live within its means.  Annual growth rates of 10% or 11% are not necessary to believe the country is one of the most powerful in the world.  In fact, it is a very dangerous position to be in, as we now know.</P>

	<P>Irish charities may take a number of legal forms.  For example, some charities are companies limited by guarantee while other charities are trusts.  They are, therefore, governed by the relevant legislative or other provisions governing such entities.  Incorporated charities, for example, are subject to the provisions of company law and are generally required to provide information to the Companies Registration Office under the Companies Acts, which can be accessed by the public. Such charities would also be subject to scrutiny by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Charities that take the form of a trust are subject to the provisions of trust law. And, of course, any business entity is subject to general criminal and fraud legislation.</P>
        <P>In addition, many Irish charities, approximately 8,000, have been approved by the Revenue Commissioners for charitable tax exemptions under the Taxes Consolidation Act(s).  A list of these &ldquo;Approved Bodies&rdquo; is available to the public on <i>www.revenue.ie</i>. The Revenue Commissioners have a wide range of powers, and these are mainly contained in sections 899 to 912 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, including powers to request information and to carry out inspections in relation to any tax matter.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Charities Act 2009 provides for an integrated system of mandatory registration and proportionate regulation and supervision of the charities sector in Ireland.  The various sections of the Charities Act are subject to implementation through commencement orders.  A number of sections of the Act have already been commenced.  Those sections providing for mandatory registration have not yet been commenced.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be aware that responsibility for the Charities Act transferred to my Department in May 2011.  Full implementation of the Act on a statutory basis, which would require the establishment of a new regulatory authority, would of course have new cost implications for the Exchequer.  This is a matter which I am considering in the context of the review of expenditure currently being undertaken in my Department and, indeed, in all Government Departments and Agencies.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the growing and on-going public concern arising from increasing levels of anti-social behaviour in many areas throughout the country culminating in some instances of families being forced to leave their homes; if action can be taken to curtail this menace which is of increasing concern to older persons and parents of young children; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very aware of the distress that anti-social behaviour and low level crime can cause to communities. </P>
        <P>There are strong legislative provisions in place to combat anti-social behaviour in communities.  These include provisions to deal with alcohol abuse, its effect on public order and late night street violence.</P>
        <P>In its Policing Plan for 2011, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has prioritised actions to achieve the maximum levels of safety for local communities and to provide a community policing service which meets the demands of the public. The Plan identifies a range of strategies which may be deployed to counter anti-social activities, including targeted operations; high visibility patrols; deployment of appropriate resources to identified public order hotspots in respect of alcohol and drug related behaviour and youth crime; and the full utilisation of existing legislation.</P>
        <P>Any instances of families being forced to leave their homes would be taken extremely seriously by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and such serious criminal behaviour will be tackled resolutely.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to attach a higher priority to community policing and that, within available resources, there is a higher Garda visibility in the local neighbourhoods worst affected.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates a new model of Community Policing which aims at building upon and enhancing good community policing practice.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies such as Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert.</P>
        <P>One of the key actions in the Garda Policing Plan is an improved understanding of and responsiveness to community needs.  Garda&iacute;  play an essential role in the operation of Joint Policing Committees and other local fora, which provide important channels for engagement between the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities and community representatives.  In this way there is clearer communication about local concerns and Garda strategies employed to address them.  This Government is committed to building on such existing partnerships and fora, and my Department has commenced work, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, on bringing this about.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question concerns the disclosure, to parents, of information relating to persons on the sex offenders&rsquo; register.</P>
        <P>In exceptional circumstances, the provision of appropriate information to the public is already possible. This includes the disclosure of such information to parents. Currently, this is done on an administrative basis but, subject to Government approval, I intend to put these arrangements on a statutory footing.</P><Col N="827"/>
        <P>Our primary objective has to be to minimise the risk posed to the public. The High Level Group which produced and published a discussion document on sex offenders was of the view that, if the Garda&iacute; have reason to believe a particular high risk convicted sex offender poses a real and immediate danger, they should be free to tell individuals who need to know. Disclosure in such circumstances is perfectly reasonable.</P>
        <P>However, giving the general public unrestricted access to names and addresses on the sex offenders&rsquo; register would be likely to be counter-productive. That kind of access would drive offenders underground and make it more difficult to monitor and supervise them. This was the universal view of those who responded to the discussion document and participated in the public forum on the management of sex offenders.</P>
        <P>General access to the register would also raise issues concerning the rights of persons who have completed their sentences and pose no future threat to society.</P>
        <P>My Department has been conducting a wide-ranging examination of the law on sexual offences. Arising from this review, legislative proposals, including amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to provide a statutory basis for necessary disclosure, are at an advanced stage of preparation. The review is close to completion and I expect to bring legislative proposals to Government in the coming months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The system of restorative justice in this jurisdiction is already part and parcel of the justice system.  In the case of juveniles, restorative justice was introduced on a statutory basis for the first time in the Children Act 2001.  There are two restorative justice initiatives provided for in the Act: A restorative conference or restorative caution included in the Garda Diversion Programme and a court-ordered restorative justice family conference delivered through the Probation Service. </P>
        <P>The Programme for Government gives a commitment to tackle youth crime on a number of different fronts including giving a special emphasis to alternative programmes for young offenders through extensions to the Juvenile Liaison Officer Scheme and the Diversion Programme and the extended use of Restorative Justice.  I wish to inform the Deputy that I will continue to maintain responsibility for the diversion and community aspects of the work of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS), while my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will take responsibility for the rest of IYJS, including the Children Detention Schools in Oberstown.  I will be consulting closely with my Ministerial colleague and with the Garda Commissioner in the continuing development of programmes to tackle youth crime.</P>
        <P>As regards adult offenders, the Probation Service has introduced a pilot scheme to test a range of restorative interventions based on the recommendations contained in the report of the National Commission on Restorative Justice.  This will enable my Department to evaluate what role such interventions as recommended in the report might play having regard to overall effectiveness, potential and value for money considerations.  The scheme involves an expansion of the two existing adult projects which operate in Tallaght and Nenagh.  The Probation Service will monitor the implementation of the scheme and provide a report on its effectiveness after a 12 month operational period. I look forward to reviewing their report in due course.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>There are currently around 2,100 full-time-equivalent civilian support staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>These staff provide vital support services in a wide range of areas, such as human resources, training &amp; development, IT and telecommunications, finance and procurement, internal audit, research and analysis, accommodation and fleet management, scene-of-crime support and medical services.</P><Col N="829"/>
        <P>However, while the current number of civilian support staff is an increase on previous years, more needs to be done.  The fact is that the level of civilian support staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is still significantly lower than in many comparable police forces.</P>
        <P>That is why the Programme for Government commits to ensuring that administrative duties are carried out by civilian staff in order to free up highly trained Garda&iacute; for preventing and detecting crime.  It makes no sense to have highly &mdash; and expensively &mdash; trained Garda&iacute; engaged in administrative work.  The Government&rsquo;s objective is supported by the findings and recommendations of the 2009 Garda Inspectorate report on Resource Allocation, which called for the numbers of Garda&iacute; available for operational duty to be maximised through a structured programme of civilianisation.</P>
        <P>It is also worth saying that the Garda Commissioner and Garda management very much recognise the contribution made by civilian support staff both in releasing Garda&iacute; for operational duties and in bringing skills and expertise into the Force.  Of course, in seeking to increase the number of civilian support staff, we must face the reality of the need to reduce overall numbers in the public service.  The answer may lie in the more effective use of resources across the public service, including in particular more flexibility in redeployment of staff to priority areas.  Indeed, the Garda reform agenda under the Croke Park Agreement contains a specific commitment, agreed by Garda management and the Garda Associations, to augment civilian support staff in the Force through appropriate redeployment of staff from elsewhere in the public service.</P>
        <P>I will remain in ongoing consultation with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the implementation of this Government commitment.</P>

	<P>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s question to relate to the Garda resources that are made available to the combatting of drug misuse. </P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policing Plan, 2011 sets out the commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in organised criminal activities including drug trafficking.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a multi-agency approach has been, and continues to be used, whereby National Units from National Support Service work together to combat serious crime, including those involved in the trafficking, importation, sale and supply of illegal drugs.</P>
        <P>These Units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda Technical Bureau are also supported by the Security and Intelligence Section who assist with intelligence briefings and timely information.</P>
        <P>In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to develop and implement operations and strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks.</P>
        <P>This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources as well as using all available criminal legislation to its fullest extent. Operations in this area continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure their effectiveness.</P><Col N="830"/>
        <P>The allocation of resources is monitored by Local Garda Management in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place at District, Divisional and Regional level, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources.</P>
        <P>I am informed that Senior Garda Management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service continues to be delivered and that current structures in place meet the requirement to deliver an effective and efficient policing service to the community.</P>
        <P>It is also worth noting that the National Drug Strategy, of which the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a key element, provides an overarching national response to the drug problem. The National Drug Strategy, to which significant resources continue to be allocated, puts in place a co-ordinated and integrated approach tackling the issue under pillar headings of drugs supply reduction, education and prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the allocation of resources in tackling drug misuse is kept under ongoing review having regard to the priority that has been afforded to the problem through the National Drug Strategy and the policing priorities of An Garda S&iacute;&oacute;ch&aacute;na.</P>

        <Quest> his plans to ensure the rollout across the State of the undertakings in relation to the interaction between members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and victims of crime contained in the Victims Charter and guide to the Criminal Justice System, which was launched in July 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24740/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Shortly after I was appointed Minister I told the Victims of Crime Consultative Forum that I wanted to see the Victims Charter implemented in full by all bodies contributing to the charter. The current edition of the Charter, <Col N="832"/>which was published in July 2010, has been certified as being written in plain English to increase its accessibility. It is available online in Irish and six other languages. In the Charter, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commits itself to the provision of information and a range of other supports to victims of crime. </P>
        <P>In determining policing priorities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the then Minister included support, protection and information for victims of crime as one of seven priorities for 2011.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has shown its commitment to implementing the Charter in a number of ways. I understand that Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are trained to be courteous, helpful, respectful and professional. In circumstances where a victim is upset about a crime or other traumatic incident, members will respond in a caring and sensitive manner. When a victim reports a crime, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is tasked with investigating the circumstances and gathering all of the evidence surrounding the incident in a fair, honest and impartial manner to bring those responsible to justice.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is of that view that the welfare and support of victims are central to the partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and community groups, statutory agencies and voluntary organisations.</P>
        <P>I understand that in recognition of the special relationship that exists between victims of crime and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda Victims Liaison Office was established to liaise with government funded victim support organisations, to formulate Garda policy and to support the implementation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Victims Charter.</P>
        <P>I have been informed that in furtherance of the partnership with victims organisations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has hosted three National Victims Support Fora at Garda Headquarters at which the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime and victims organisations were advised of the initiatives and improvements in Garda services to victims of crime. The latest of these meetings took place earlier this month, with earlier meetings in March and November, 2010.</P>
        <P>I understand An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was also represented at senior level at the meeting of the Victims of Crime Consultative Forum, to discuss implementation of the Victims Charter with victims group. That meeting of the Consultative Forum, which took place in September, 2010, had a single theme: &ldquo;Making the Victims Charter Work&rdquo;. It was organised by the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime, an independent group operating under the aegis of my Department.</P>
        <P>I understand that as part of the response capability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with victims of serious crime, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been selected to undergo training as specialist interviewers of victims of sexual crime, crimes of violence or trafficking, who are under 14 years of age and persons with intellectual disabilities who are victims of those crimes. A number of dedicated interview suites designed to provide appropriate facilities for interviewing these victims are in operation at strategic locations throughout the country.  The interview suites have the capacity to video-record witness statements in line with the provisions of section 16(1)(b) of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992.  This video evidence may be submitted to court when a trial occurs.</P>
        <P>I am informed that posters and booklets of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Victims Charter were designed, published and distributed to Garda Stations. This increased the awareness amongst members of the force of the Victims Charter and Garda responsibilities contained therein.</P>
        <P>I understand that a working group was established at Garda Headquarters to oversee the standardising of the provision of relevant, timely information to Victims of Crime.</P><Col N="833"/>
        <P>I am informed that the PULSE Garda computer system provides information letters for issue to victims of crime. In addition, PULSE now generates management reports on the number of automated PULSE generated letters. This has assisted local Garda managers identify gaps and has led to significant improvement in the number of PULSE letters issued to victims of crime.</P>
        <P>I understand that specialised training, including for Family and Ethnic Liaison Officers, ensures vulnerable witnesses and victims of crime continue to receive a professional, empathetic response from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

	<P>I am aware that family members of the deceased person referred to by the Deputy have made a number of complaints regarding the Garda investigation of that person&rsquo;s death.  </P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the original Garda investigation in 2002 concluded that foul play was not suspected and the jury at the inquest held in 2004 found in accordance with the medical evidence.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that following contacts with the family a Superintendent from outside the District where the death took place was appointed in 2006 to re-examine the investigation into the incident.  An investigation file was submitted to the Law Officers who directed no action against any third party.  During the course of the examination, certain shortcomings were identified and, while they did not affect the outcome of the original investigation, steps were taken to rectify these issues and ensure adherence to best practice in the future.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances I have not been made aware of any grounds which would warrant further action on my part.</P>

        <Quest> if the free legal aid board is availing of the national internship scheme; if so are experienced solicitors rather than newly qualified persons being recruited; the role they will play; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Legal Aid Board is a statutory, independent body in accordance with the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995. The matters raised by the Deputy are a matter for the Board.  However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy I have had enquiries made with the Board.</P>
        <P>The new F&Aacute;S &ldquo;Jobbridge&rdquo; scheme is an important element of the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative that is designed to facilitate the provision of work experience and training opportunities for the unemployed. I can confirm that the Legal Aid Board is actively participating in the scheme and this is a development that I very much welcome. The Board will be offering internships to qualified solicitors so that they can gain practical experience in the areas of civil law in which the organisation provides services. I have every confidence that solicitors obtaining internships with the Board will receive very valuable work experience and training that will help them on the road towards paid employment, notwithstanding the difficult labour market <Col N="834"/>conditions for legal practitioners that currently prevail. I also anticipate that the interns will make an important contribution to the work of the Board during their time with the organisation.</P>
        <P>The locations in which the Board initially offered internships had regard to both the current work demands of the organisation and the capacity of the law centres involved to provide the necessary support and development to Interns during their placements.  The locations initially advertised under the scheme were, Newbridge, Ennis, Cavan, Cork (2 placements), Nenagh plus 6 internships in various locations in Dublin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since advertising with F&Aacute;S the Board has received 28 applications from eligible candidates and all of these candidates have since been offered interviews.  The Board has already placed an Intern in Tallaght Law Centre and is currently in the process of offering further placements in the locations above.  To date 6 additional applicants have been offered and have accepted Internships and will be commencing in the coming weeks. The Board also intends to offer some additional placements in the next few days and has recently asked F&Aacute;S to extend the scheme to all of its law centres. This will ensure that the Board has the maximum flexibility in offering further internships.</P>
        <P>I have been advised by the Board that the applicants, to date, have a mix of experience and not all are newly qualified solicitors. However, most of the applicants have limited experience of family law which is the Board&rsquo;s main area of work. For this reason, the Board is currently putting in place arrangements to ensure that interns are supported and trained in family law and other civil law areas. I have every confidence in the Board&rsquo;s capacity to manage this process well and to ensure that each intern gets a meaningful role within the organisation which is both challenging and stimulating. I am also convinced that the valuable experience gained by the interns will stand to them in their future careers as legal practitioners and will, in the short-term, improve their employability in what is currently a very difficult labour market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The functions and powers of Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) are set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides for a Committee in each local authority area.  They provide the framework for a partnership process involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and elected members and officials of the local authority, which are the two organisations which make the most significant contribution to preventing crime in an area, with the participation of members of the Oireachtas and of the community and voluntary sector.  The Act provides that JPCs operate under guidelines issued by the Minister for Justice and Equality after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Garda Commissioner has appointed Garda representatives to each of the JPCs in accordance with the guidelines.</P>
        <P>Members of the public and community representatives and groups can interact with their JPC by communicating with the Committee directly or by communicating with any member of the Committee, including the appointed Garda representatives.  All JPC meetings are as a rule open to the public, and all documents are available.  Any person may submit questions in writing in advance of each JPC meeting.  Each Committee is also required to hold regular public meetings, at which those attending have the right to make their views known and ask questions in accordance with the guidelines.  These committees can also establish fora in areas to bring <Col N="835"/>about greater focus on finding solutions to specific issues thus facilitating greater community interaction and participation with the Garda&iacute; and other committee members.  Such fora are being established in the 14 Local Drugs Task Force areas.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government makes a commitment to build on existing community policing partnerships and forums to enhance trust between local communities and their Garda&iacute;.  Accordingly, my Department has commenced a review of how the Committees have operated since their establishment, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities.  The review is taking place in the context of the commitments in the Programme for Government to reform local government, work on which is being led by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department has been engaged in a major consultative exercise leading to the production of a White Paper on crime.  One of the issues addressed in this exercise has been the role of the JPCs.  The White Paper will set out a policy framework for future strategies to combat and prevent crime.  The intention is that this process will lead ultimately to a national anti-crime strategy, in which the JPCs will have a role to play.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that twenty six complaints were made since the commencement of works in 2005 to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to personnel employed by the company referred to by the Deputy or employees of companies contracted by that company. These complaints relate to alleged assaults and alleged breaches of the Road Traffic Acts and the Private Security Services Act. To date, there have been no arrests made against such persons.</P>
        <P>Every complaint to the Garda&iacute; is the subject of a thorough investigation. Investigations against employees of the company or employees of its contractors have resulted in files for directions being submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions in six cases. In one of these cases the DPP directed a prosecution. The case was subsequently dismissed by the District Court. Files are being prepared in relation to three cases at present and investigations are still ongoing in two further cases.</P>

	<P>Below-cost selling of alcohol was one of the areas examined by the Government Alcohol Advisory Group (GAAG) in 2008. Due to the complexity of the pricing structures and incentives in operation in this area, the Group was unable within the time available to it to establish any standard costs for the purpose of prohibiting below-cost sales of alcohol products. However, I understand that a Steering Group, which is currently operating under the aegis of the Department of Health, is developing proposals on alcohol for inclusion in the National Substance Misuse Strategy. The Group has been examining a range of issues relating to alcohol availability and pricing and is due to submit its Report, which will include policy recommendations, to Government later this year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 408 and 409 together.</P>
        <P>I attach the highest priority to the full investigation of white collar crime and bringing the perpetrators of such crime to justice to the greatest extent possible.  I have expressed, both before and since my appointment as Minister, my unhappiness with the protracted nature of the investigations.  I do not intend this as any criticism of investigators and prosecutors, who face tough challenges as a result of the complexities of the matters being investigated.  At the same time, I am concerned to ensure that I do not say anything that could prejudice any possible prosecutions or any court hearing.  It is imperative that such investigations are conducted in a thorough, methodical and comprehensive manner, so as to ensure that account is taken of all pertinent matters.  If this is not done, there is a risk that any prosecutions that may proceed would be jeopardised.</P>
        <P>It was in the light of my concerns that I gave priority to the passage through the Oireachtas of the Criminal Justice Act 2011, which was enacted on 2 August and most of which was commenced on 9 August.  This new legislation is intended to speed up investigations and prosecutions in relation to white collar crimes, both future investigations and those currently underway, by improving a number of important procedural matters and strengthening Garda investigative powers.  It also provides for offences committed by persons who are unwilling or reluctant to assist with an investigation.</P>
        <P>On becoming Minister, I sought and received assurances that there were sufficient resources available to the investigations.  I can assure the Deputy that this Government will continue to provide sustained support for the investigation in terms of resources, as well as the necessary  legislative and administrative supports, and that if those involved in the investigations believe at any stage that additional resources are required that will be responded to.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, following the submission by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation of two substantial investigation files relating to matters in Anglo Irish Bank to the Director of Public Prosecutions last December, a supplementary investigation file was submitted in May.  The files remain under consideration by the DPP, and his directions are awaited.</P>
        <P>The investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is ongoing in respect of both these investigations and of other complaints.  I understand that it is intended to submit further files to the DPP in the near future.</P>
        <P>The decision to seek the extradition of a person charged with a criminal offence rests with the DPP and only arises where the Director has decided that a person should be prosecuted in the first instance.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Director is independent in the exercise of <Col N="840"/>his functions and, as Minister, I have no function in deciding whether a person should be charged with an offence or whether a person&rsquo;s extradition should be sought.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is responsible for compliance with and enforcement of the Companies Acts and is under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the proposal to hold a Constitutional Referendum on judicial remuneration is a commitment in the Programme for Government.  In keeping with that undertaking, the Government approved the Twenty-Ninth Amendment of the Constitution (Judges&rsquo; Remuneration) Bill 2011 and it was published on 4 August 2011.  Its publication well ahead of the scheduled debates was with a view to providing adequate opportunity for persons to consider the amendment in advance of its process through the Oireachtas. </P>
        <P>On 5 September 2011 I wrote to all members of the Oireachtas briefing them on the objectives of the Bill.  I also included a copy of the draft Implementation Bill outlining the legislative provisions which would be introduced by the Government if the proposed Referendum is approved by the People, together with an information sheet setting out the financial ramifications of the proposed amendments.  Finally, all members of the Oireachtas were invited to make contact with my office if they had any queries in relation to the Bill.  I should add that following publication of the Bill, my office contacted the Opposition spokespersons directly to advise that a briefing on the Bill would be arranged should they wish to avail of it.  This initial contact was followed up by telephone by my officials.  However, in the event this offer was not taken up.</P>

        <P>The use of official credit cards is closely monitored by the Department&rsquo;s Finance Unit.  Expenditure must generally be supported by receipts submitted by card holders each month as part of the approval process for the associated expenditure.  The allocation and use of official credit cards are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to minimising the number of cards allocated, and credit limits are assigned in line with requirements for official use on a case by case basis.</P>

	<P>My Department is acutely aware of the need to obtain value for money at all times and is fully committed to effective and efficient resource allocation and service provision.  There is a continuing focus on achieving more efficiencies in IT spend and contracts coming up for renewal are reviewed with a view to consolidation wherever possible.  Centrally negotiated framework agreements are also utilised wherever possible.</P>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Development Office (NESDO) is the only agency under the aegis of my Department.  NESDO receive a grant-in-aid allocation from my Department.  They provided for &euro;10,000 from their budget in 2010 and &euro;12,870 from their budget in 2011 for the purchasing of IT equipment.</P>
        <P>Procurement of IT equipment by my Department and by NESDO  is carried out under procedures recommended by the National Public Procurement Policy Unit in the Department of Finance which is responsible for procurement policy, national procurement guidelines and the application of EU directives.</P>
        <P>These procedures are designed to ensure that appropriate competitive processes are in place to select the providers of goods and services which represent best value to the Department, taking account of a number of important criteria including cost and suitability for purpose.</P>

	<P>An application for a passport for the child in question was made in March, 2011.  This was done under the provisions of the Passports Act, 2008, which provides, that this Department must be satisfied that an applicant is an Irish citizen before issuing him/her a passport.    In this particular case the child was born in England.  Her mother was born in South Africa and even though she is an Irish passport holder since 2004, this does not confer automatic Irish citizenship entitlement to any children that she may have that were born abroad.</P>
        <P>Accordingly the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship is based on an Irish-born maternal grandparent.  In such cases, a person must apply for Irish citizenship through the Foreign Births Registration process to the Consular Section in my Department.  Successful applicants are issued with certificates of registration which are required for the purposes of passport applications.</P><Col N="860"/>
        <P>No such certificate or any other acceptable evidence of the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship was presented with the passport application and accordingly, the application could not be approved.  The Passport Service wrote to the applicant&rsquo;s parents on 14 April, 2011 to advise of the position and requested specific additional documentary evidence to demonstrate the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship.  While no reply has been received in the interim the application remains open.</P>
        <P>In order to finalise the application to passport issue, the child in question must first be registered in the Foreign Births Register.  Once this is done, the parents must submit the certificate of registration to the Passport Service where it will be associated with the current application form.</P>
        <P>The Consular Division of the Department received an application for Foreign Births registration on 19th May 2011 and has been in contact with the applicant in relation to outstanding documentation as recently as 6th   September last.  When this documentation is received the application for Foreign Birth Registration can be fully considered.</P>

	<P>There are no State boards operating under the responsibility of my Department.  However, there are currently four bodies which operate under its aegis.  The four bodies in question consist of </P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />one Education Commission: The Ireland &mdash; United States Commission for Educational Exchange, also known as the Fulbright Commission; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />three Advisory Committees, namely (a) the Government Emigrant Services Advisory Committee; (b) the Development Education Advisory Committee and (c)   the Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Ireland &mdash; United States (Fulbright) Commission for Educational Exchange, while not a State body, was established on a statutory basis in 1991.  I have certain specific statutory responsibilities in respect of the Commission, including the appointment of four of eight members to its Board for a two-year period. In October 2010, my predecessor appointed three members to the Board. The fourth board member&rsquo;s term has expired.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Services Advisory Committee (previously known as the D&iacute;on Committee) was set up in 1984 to advise the Government on the welfare of the Irish community in Britain. The Committee&rsquo;s primary role is to advise on the distribution of Government support to voluntary agencies providing front line services and community care to Irish people in Britain. The Committee currently has a membership of thirteen persons. The Chair and Secretary are both officers of the Embassy in London, while other Committee members serve in a voluntary capacity.</P>
        <P>Following the expiration of the term of the previous Committee on 31 December 2010, I appointed eleven voluntary members to the Committee on 11 April 2011, in consultation with Embassy London and the Irish Abroad Unit in my Department. The Development Education Advisory Committee (DEAC) was established by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2003 following the recommendations of the Ireland Aid Review Committee. It has ten members, eight of whom I appoint directly and two who are appointed on the nomination of the Department of Education and Skills and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). Its purpose is to advise on policy regarding development education. The current committee was appointed by my predecessor in April 2010 for a two-year term. Membership is drawn from the voluntary sector and relevant educational institutions. The Department of Education and Skills and the NCCA nominees serve in a representative capacity while all other committee members serve in an individual capacity.</P>
        <P>The Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group (IAEAG) was established in 2010 acting on a recommendation contained in the Irish Aid Management Review adopted by the Government in 2009. The Group consists of seven members, six of whom I appoint directly and one on the nomination of the Department of Finance. The role of the Group is to offer independent expert advice on the strategic direction of the aid programme. Members of the Advisory Group were appointed by my predecessor in June 2010 for a three year term.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, that there is no internationally recognised method for precisely determining the amount of tax lost as a result of the illicit trade in cigarettes. However, on the basis of a 2009 &amp; 2010 survey carried out independently on behalf of Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control, Revenue estimates that approximately 20% of cigarettes consumed in the State had not been taxed in this jurisdiction. It is important to emphasise that this estimate includes both illicit cigarettes and legal cross-border purchases brought into the State for personal consumption. Revenue would further tentatively estimate that this figure of 20% comprises 14% illicit product and 6% legal cross-border purchases. In 2010 Revenue&rsquo;s strategy resulted in the seizure of a total of 178m cigarettes with a retail value of approximately &euro;75m and 3,342kg of tobacco with a retail value of approximately &euro;1.2m.  For the period January to August 2011, a total of 77.9m cigarettes with a retail value of approximately &euro;32.8m and 6,683 kg of tobacco with a retail value of approximately &euro;2.4m have been seized.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners regard the tackling of the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products to be a high priority area.  They have established a high level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level, to examine the risks related to tobacco products tax and to oversee and optimise the detection of counterfeit and contraband tobacco products. This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco. These include adoption of a comprehensive tobacco strategy and action plan.</P>
        <P>This strategy employed by Revenue to tackle this illicit trade is multi-faceted.  It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and deployment of detection technologies, optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and internally to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.</P>
        <P>Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Revenue also carries out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations and in checks at inland markets.</P>
        <P>In July 2010, Revenue launched a series of nationwide tobacco &lsquo;blitz&rsquo; type operations, which concentrated additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at various inland retail points, including markets for the purpose of identifying illicit tobacco products.  To date, Revenue has conducted seven tobacco blitz operations that have resulted in the seizure of in excess of 33.2m cigarettes.  Another two large-scale nationwide operations are scheduled to take place during the last quarter of 2011.</P>

	<P>The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code requires entities regulated by the Central Bank to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers.  Regulated entities must not recklessly, negligently or deliberately mislead a customer as to the real or perceived advantages or disadvantages of any particular product or service.  In accordance with common rule 12 of the Code, regulated entities have to ensure that all relevant information, and in particular, key information is provided to a consumer in a clear manner.  The operation of any agreement between a regulated entity and a consumer must be in accordance with the terms and conditions applying to that agreement.   In August 2010, the Central Bank published the findings of an examination of switching practices related to tracker mortgages by lenders and relevant customer communications in relation to products.  A number of concerns were identified during the examination about the level of disclosure and transparency when consumers moved from tracker rate mortgages to other forms of mortgages.</P>
        <P>As a result of this finding, mortgage lenders were requested to disclose fully, with immediate effect, the impact of any switch from a tracker mortgage rate in all customer communications. Customers must be notified that switching from a tracker rate may mean they will lose the ability to avail of a tracker rate mortgage in the future, where this is the case.</P>
        <P>Mortgage lenders have been advised to include new information in all customer communications regarding switching from tracker rate mortgages, for any reason, with immediate effect. This information should include:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />indicative comparisons of the cost of monthly repayments of the customer&rsquo;s current tracker rate mortgage and the rates being offered,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />details of the advantages and disadvantages of  the tracker mortgage rate compared to the other rates being offered.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The examination did not find  evidence that customers were being offered incentives to move off tracker rate mortgages. Mortgage lenders have been instructed, by the Central Bank, to give careful consideration before offering any incentives to customers to move from tracker rate mortgages and to notify the Central Bank in advance of any such proposals.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Central Bank that, where banks and other lending agencies made errors in removing persons from tracker rate mortgages, the Bank expects that such customers have been or will be compensated by the agency in question. The Central Bank will not comment on press reports that certain amounts of compensation have been paid by certain lending agencies.</P>

	<P>The Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy.  The USC is a more sustainable charge than the Income Levy and Health Levy.  It is applied at a low rate on a wide <Col N="864"/>base.  The USC is designed to apply across income levels in a smoother progression and to address the irregularities caused by &lsquo;step effects&rsquo; in the previous system of levies.    There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to carry out a review of the USC.  This review has commenced. </P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that based on annual incomes below &euro;17,500 per annum on Revenue income tax records, as returned by or on behalf of income earners for the income tax year 2009, the latest year for which the necessary detailed data is available, the cost to the Exchequer of making the main personal and PAYE tax credits refundable when they are unused by these income earners is estimated to be of the order of &euro;1.4 billion per annum.  This estimate relates only to the cost of extending refundable tax credits to all those on the Revenue&rsquo;s tax files. If a refundable tax credit system were to be introduced, one would have to consider those who are not on the tax files, for example, those who are of employable age but not working, including those on social welfare. If such categories were eligible this would increase the cost significantly. </P>
        <P>The estimate of cost takes into account all income earners, both employees and self-employed, whose total gross income from all sources is below &euro;17,500 per annum.  This is composed of income from employment and self-employment as well as all other sources of tax liable income such as pensions, benefits, dividends and investments.</P>
        <P>In addition to the issue of cost, there would be a range of other policy and practical issues arising in introducing such a system.</P>

        <P>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under the VAT Directive Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive.  I understand that the major sectors within the Irish craft industry are pottery, glass, jewellery, textiles and furniture.  Annex III does not provide for a reduced rate of VAT to be applied to these goods, which are consequentially subject to the standard VAT rate of 21%.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) is a withholding tax mechanism for contractors carrying out relevant operations in the construction, forestry and meat processing sectors. The governing legislation obliges a person (the principal contractor) to retain 35% of the amount payable to subcontractors in the absence of a Revenue authorisation (C2) and a related Payments Card.  Where tax is deducted, the principal contractor gives the subcontractor a Form RCTDC, which the subcontractor uses to claim credit for, or repayment of, the tax withheld. A subcontractor makes a claim for repayment of RCT by submitting one or more Form(s) RCTDC in respect of an income tax month or any number of income tax months.  As a withholding tax, the tax deducted by the principal contractor is available for offset against the subcontractor&rsquo;s tax liab<Col N="867"/>ility, primarily Income Tax and Corporation Tax, but also against other taxes such as Value Added Tax and employers&rsquo; PAYE/PRSI.  Once these liabilities have been satisfied, any balance of tax in credit may be refunded to the subcontractor.   </P>

	<P>There are a number of measures in place to assist people who are having genuine difficulties in meeting their mortgage repayments.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (the Code) applies to mortgage lending activities with consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State.  Compliance with the Code is mandatory on all mortgage lenders registered with the Central Bank.   The Code came into effect on 1 January 2011.  With effect from 30 June 2011, lenders must have in place the required systems and trained staff necessary to support the implementation of the Code.  The Code sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers who are in arrears or are in pre-arrears.  For the purposes of the Code a &ldquo;pre-arrears&rdquo; case arises when the borrower contacts the lender stating that he or she is in danger of getting into financial difficulties and/or is concerned about getting into mortgage arrears.  The Code can be accessed at <i>www.centralbank.ie</i>. </P>
        <P>The main provisions of the code are as set out as follows:</P>
        <P>(1)  Lenders must establish a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process know as &ldquo;MARP&rdquo; and use this framework when dealing with consumers who are in arrears or in pre-arrears situations.</P>
        <P>(2)  The lender must not apply to the courts to commence legal action for repossession of the borrower&rsquo;s primary residence until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative arrangement with the borrower or his/her nominated representative.</P>
        <P>(3)  Where a borrower co-operates with the lender, the lender must wait at least 12 months from the date the borrower is classified as a MARP case (i.e. 31 days from the date the arrears first arose) before applying to the courts to commence legal action for repossession of a borrower&rsquo;s primary residence.</P>
        <P>(4)  Where a borrower is in mortgage arrears, a lender may commence legal action for repossession of the property without the 12 month period applying, only in the following circumstances:-</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />where a borrower does not co-operate with the lender,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />in the case of fraud perpetrated on the lender by the borrower, or</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />in the case of a breach of contract by the borrower other than the existence of arrears.</P>
        <P>(5)  A lender must not require a borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type as part of an alternative arrangement offered to the borrower in arrears or in pre-arrears.</P>
        <P>(6)  Lenders must establish an Appeals Support Unit which must be adequately staffed, to manage cases under the MARP.</P>
        <P>(7)  Borrowers can make an appeal in relation to the decision of the Arrears Support Unit and the lender&rsquo;s treatment of the borrowers under the MARP, to an internal Appeals Board which lenders are required to establish.  The Central Bank has produced, with input from the National Consumer Agency, a consumer guide to assist consumers in understanding the new <Col N="868"/>process under the revised Code that they should expect from lenders.  The guide together, with a number of questions and answers, are available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website   <i>www.centralbank.ie.</i></P>
        <P>Financial assistance is available to eligible claimants under the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme.</P>
        <P>People in debt or in danger of getting into debt can avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  This is a national, free, confidential, and independent service.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that a Working Group has been established under the Economic Management Council to consider the state of implementation of the main recommendations in the report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Group. This Group has also been asked to consider and develop further necessary actions to alleviate the increasing mortgage over-indebtedness problem.  I expect that the Group will complete its work in the very near future.</P>

	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Group (Cooney Report) which was published in November 2010.  One of the recommendations of the Group was that lenders should offer a Deferred Interest Scheme (DIS) to borrowers. Under this Scheme, subject to certain criteria being satisfied, borrowers are allowed to pay at least 66% of their mortgage interest but less than 100%.  Payment of the balance may be deferred for up to 5 years. Lenders representing the majority of the market have already implemented (or indicated their willingness to implement) the Group&rsquo;s proposals for a DIS or a variation of it. While the Scheme is voluntary for all lenders, those who have signed up in support of the Scheme will be monitored by the Central Bank to ensure compliance.</P>
        <P>Since the publication of the Group&rsquo;s Report, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) has been revised by the Central Bank to reflect many of the Group&rsquo;s recommendations, including key recommendations relating to the introduction by all lenders regulated by the Central Bank of a standardised Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).

        <P><Miles com="bull66" />penalty interest charges may not be imposed on borrowers in arrears who co-operate with the MARP,</P>

        <P FLI="0">The revised CCMA came into effect on 1 January 2011 and can be accessed at <i>www.centralbank.ie</i>. Lenders are required to comply with the CCMA as a matter of law. With effect from 30 June 2011, lenders must have in place the requisite systems and trained staff necessary to support the implementation of the MARP.</P>
        <P>A new Working Group has been established under the Economic Management Council. Its remit is to consider the state of implementation of the main recommendations of the Cooney Report and to develop further necessary actions to alleviate the mortgage over indebtedness problem. The Government will consider what further action is warranted once the Group has concluded its deliberations and reported to the Economic Management Council. I expect that the Group will complete its work in the very near future. </P>

        <Quest> if, with reference to the confirmation of the Chief Economist of the International Energy Agency in April 2011 that global crude oil production peaked in 2006 and that oil prices internationally are likely to inflate significantly over the long term and having regard to Ireland&rsquo;s dependance on imported fossil fuels, he has undertaken any detailed economic risk modelling of the potential impact on the economy here of permanently higher or volatile oil prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland is an oil-importer.  Thus, any rise in the price of oil reduces domestic disposable income levels, meaning that less income is available to spend on domestically produced good and services.  All other things being equal, this will have a negative impact on GDP growth.  In terms of quantifying the potential impact, model simulations suggest that each 10 euro per barrel increase in the price of oil reduces the GDP growth rate by around &frac14; &mdash; &frac12; per cent in a full year. A number of caveats apply to this estimate however, as the transmission of higher oil prices to the real economy depends on a number of factors. These include the nature of the oil price shock (whether it is a demand or supply-side shock), the perception of households and firms as to the duration of the price increase and the policy response.  </P>
        <P>It is also important to note that structural changes in the economy in recent decades mean that Ireland is now much less dependent on oil as an input to the production process than in the past. For example, there has been a sectoral shift from manufacturing to services, with the latter (on average) being less energy-intensive.  In addition, there has been an intra-sectoral shift from heavy manufacturing to knowledge-intensive manufacturing. This has reduced the exposure of the manufacturing sector (on average) to oil price developments.</P>
        <P>Moreover, I would point out that while the price of oil has been on an upward trend over the past year &mdash; primarily reflecting supply-side issues, particularly the geo-political crisis in the Middle East &mdash; futures markets are currently pricing in lower oil prices for 2012 and 2013.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 to 134, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>These questions relate to the flexible options on retirement first introduced in Finance Act 1999. Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension under a defined contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract was required to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot  after drawing down the appropriate tax-free lump sum.  Finance Act 1999 introduced significant changes which gave a considerable degree of control, flexibility and personal choice to certain categories of individuals in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans.  These choices include the options to purchase an annuity, to receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions.</P>
        <P>Access to these flexible options was extended to all main benefits from retirement benefit schemes (other than Defined Benefit arrangements) in Finance Act 2011.  The changes made in Finance Act 2011 have particular relevance for ordinary members of occupational DC pension schemes in respect of the main benefits from such schemes, as up to the passing of the Act, the only option available to them in respect of those benefits had been the purchase of a retirement annuity after taking the tax-free lump sum.  These individuals now have the choices referred to above depending on their particular circumstances. It should be borne in mind, however, that the option to invest in an ARF or AMRF as opposed to purchasing an annuity may not be appropriate for everyone.</P>
        <P>Under the regime the options to</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />invest in an ARF, or</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate) are subject to conditions.  The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (specified income) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised.  Finance Act 2011 increased the guaranteed level of pension income required from the previous fixed amount of &euro;12,700 introduced in 1999, to a variable amount equal to 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) bringing the &ldquo;specified income&rdquo; limit to &euro;18,000 per annum at present.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of the specified income limit is to ensure, before an individual has unfettered access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF for example, that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed income throughout their retirement.  It is not the purpose of the limit, or the increase in the limit, to secure additional revenues for the Exchequer.  The change <Col N="872"/>to the specified income limit introduced in Finance Act 2011 was strongly signalled in the National Pensions Framework published in March 2010.</P>
        <P>Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an AMRF must be chosen into which a &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount must be invested from the pension fund equal to 10 times the maximum annual rate of State Pension (Contributory) &mdash;  &euro;119,800 at present &mdash; or the remainder of the pension fund, after taking the tax-free lump sum, if less. Prior to Finance Act 2011, the &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount was fixed at the first &euro;63,500 of the pension fund or the remainder of the fund after the tax-free lump sum, if less than that amount.  The purpose of an AMRF is to ensure a capital or income &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; for individuals with pension income below the specified income limit throughout the period of their retirement.  The funds in an AMRF can be used by the owner at any time to purchase an annuity.  On death of the  AMRF owner, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF and any remaining funds may be passed on in a tax efficient way to a surviving spouse and/or children.</P>
        <P>Prior to Finance Act 2011, if the minimum specified income test was not met at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option was exercised and the individual placed a &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount in an AMRF, that capital sum was effectively &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; and could not be accessed by the individual, other than to purchase an annuity, until he or she reached 75 years of age (at which point the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF) though any income generated by the fund could be drawn down subject to tax.  This was the position even if the minimum specified income test was met after retirement. Finance Act 2011 changed this rule so that where the minimum specified income test is met at any time after retirement and before age 75, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF with full access to the funds.</P>
        <P>As a transitional measure, Finance Act 2011 allows the previous lower guaranteed income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum to continue to apply for a period of 3 years from the date that Act was signed into law (6 February 2011)&mdash;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />for individuals who had retired before that date and who already had an AMRF, and</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />for individuals who availed of the deferred annuity purchase option*, had exercised the ARF (or cash) option within one month of the date of passing of  Finance Act 2011 and who in exercising that option had transferred the requisite amount to an AMRF within that one month period.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This means that if such individuals satisfy the guaranteed income requirement of &euro;12,700 within that three-year period their AMRF becomes an ARF.  After this three-year period expires, the new higher guaranteed income test will have to be satisfied before the AMRF can become an ARF. The amount of guaranteed income required to meet the test will change in line with any future change in the maximum annual rate of State Pension (Contributory).</P>
        <P>I have no information on the number of individuals who would have been in a position to avail of the ARF option if the rules relating to the minimum income test, in particular, had not been changed.  However, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there have been very few representations made to them in that regard.  Where individuals do not meet the new specified income test and choose not to take the AMRF option, they can of course purchase an annuity. Depending on the particular scheme rules, the annuity can be designed to include features that best suit the individual&rsquo;s particular needs, in terms of how long the annuity payments may be guaranteed after death, whether they revert to a dependant after death and whether they remain at the same level or increase during payment.</P>
        <P>The Budget and Finance Act 2011 changes seek to ensure that those in pension arrangements to whom the flexible ARF options on retirement have been extended will have choices which <Col N="873"/>best suit their particular circumstances. In making the changes, however, there was also a concern to ensure that the parameters and rules governing the extension are set in a way that avoids an increase in the risk of income poverty in old age.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />The deferred annuity purchase option was introduced with effect from 4 December 2008 for members of defined contribution occupational pension schemes and allowed them to defer the purchase of an annuity for an initial period of 2 years, in light of the fact that pension funds had been adversely affected by the falls in equity markets and the more general falls in assets values. The deferral option was operated administratively by the Revenue Commissioners.  The period of deferral was subsequently extended to 6 March 2011 i.e. one month beyond the passing into law of the Finance Act 2011.</P>

	<P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s contention that there are delays in the business plan review process, I understand from NAMA that significant progress has been made over recent months and that, as of end-August 2011, NAMA had completed its review of the plans of 113 of the 180 debtors whose loans it is managing directly. These 113 debtors account for some 75% of the total nominal value of debts outstanding to NAMA.  In addition to the reviews conducted directly by NAMA, reviews have also been completed of the plans of another 60 debtors whose debts are being managed by the participating institutions under delegated authority from NAMA.  NAMA has also observed that, in any event, the ongoing review of debtor business plans does not hold up credit decisions. In fact, some 400 credit decisions, including sales approvals, are currently being processed every month.  I understand that, generally speaking, once a credit application comes into NAMA, a decision is made within one week.  If the Deputy has details of specific cases of delay, such information should be sent to the CEO of NAMA who will investigate the matter and revert to him directly.</P>
        <P>It should also be pointed out that not all offers made by potential purchasers will match what NAMA considers to be an acceptable price for the property concerned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not measure the amount of tax lost to the Exchequer due to tax evasion. There is no one internationally recognised and agreed measure. The results from the many different measures must be treated with a great deal of caution. The international response by other tax authorities to tax evasion is to focus on deterrence while at the same time facilitating compliance. This is precisely the approach adopted by the Revenue Commissioners.  The main focus of Revenue continues to be on selecting cases for intervention based on the presence of various risk indicators and other information available. This is the type of targeted intervention that <Col N="874"/>gets best results and that is most likely to change the behaviour of the taxpayer into the future. The targeted approach is greatly enhanced by the computerised Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling System (REAP) developed by Revenue. Cases may also be selected on the basis of external/further information provided to Revenue.</P>
        <P>Revenue fully recognises the need to tackle tax evasion in all its forms, and consequently has an increased focus on sectors which have the potential to operate using cash.</P>
        <P>Last year auditors carried out 11,008 audits resulting in a yield of &euro;434.7 million. A total of 454,796 assurance checks, a less intrusive form of intervention, produced a yield of &euro;58 million.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by Revenue that an unfortunate mistake was made in this case.  Revenue has now taken steps to rectify the matter and to apologise to the taxpayer.  In May 2011 the taxpayer informed them that she was in receipt of widow&rsquo;s pension from the Department of Social Protection since 2006.  As a result, an adjustment of her tax credits was needed, to remove the married person&rsquo;s tax credit to which she was no longer entitled, and to replace it with credits appropriate to her new status.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, only the first part of this process was carried out, and the result was an apparent underpayment of tax for the years 2007 to 2010.  A statement of underpayment was issued in early August.  Revenue has now however corrected the situation by adding the credits to which she is entitled, and the result is that no additional tax is due.</P>
        <P>Revenue deeply regret the distress caused to the taxpayer by the erroneous assessment of her tax liability, and have written directly to apologise.</P>

	<P>As I stated to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 1 September 2011, the issue of mortgage indebtedness is a complex one and it is clear that there is no magic solution to solve all problems.  There have been many contributions to the debate, including suggestions for the granting of debt forgiveness.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this is simply not a realistic option. Solutions must be found on a case by case basis through open and meaningful engagement between the borrower and the lender. The planned reform of the bankruptcy and debt settlement arrangements by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality and Defence, are also key elements in any consideration of potential policy options.</P>
        <P>However, a new Working Group has been established under the Economic Management Council. Its remit is to consider the state of implementation of the main recommendations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt (which reported in November 2010) and to consider and develop further necessary actions to alleviate the mortgage over indebtedness problem. The Government will consider what further action is warranted once the Group has concluded its deliberations and reported to the Economic Management Council. I expect that the Group will complete its work in the very near future.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> the cost of centrally buying books for use by all primary and secondary schools and distributing them. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24405/11]</QRef>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available to my Department, however one estimate from publishers&rsquo; sources suggests that the Irish school book market is worth approximately &euro;60 million per annum. At present, my Department contributes approximately &euro;15 million of the total spend in this market through the provision of the school book grant to schools. Given the scale of the overall challenge facing the public finances, it is regrettable that increased spending in this area cannot be considered at this point.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, I share the concern expressed by many parents and organisations in relation to the high cost of school textbooks and the frequent rate of revisions made by book publishers.</P><Col N="879"/>
        <P>I have adopted a number of approaches to this issue. As the Deputy will be aware, I recently met with educational book publishers, representatives of parents&rsquo; organisations and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul regarding the cost of school textbooks. Subsequently, the publishers devised a voluntary Code of Practice and, while I welcome the Code as a significant step in the right direction, I believe that more should be done to reduce the price of textbooks.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, I have proposed to the representatives of the textbook publishers: that the cover price of the most popular textbooks should be reduced; that a significant discount should be given to schools which purchase textbooks in bulk, in line with the discounts given to retailers of textbooks; that the practice of combining a conventional textbook and workbook in a single volume should be ended to allow students to re-use a textbook; and that support materials should be provided to teachers online, to minimise ancillary printing costs.</P>
        <P>I am also keen to examine if there are ways to encourage schools, via the book grant scheme, to establish or maintain book rental schemes as I believe this to be one of the most effective ways of lowering the burden of the cost of school books. I have invited the National Parents Councils at primary and post-primary levels to provide me with examples of good practice of book rental schemes. Drawing on these and other examples, I intend to publish advice to schools on how best to establish and maintain textbook rental schemes in schools well in advance of the beginning of the next school year.</P>

	<P>It is the policy of my Department that only a teacher registered with the Teaching Council, and who has qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which he or she is proposed, should be employed in a school.</P>
        <P>The Teaching Council considers applications to be registered as Post Primary school teachers under Regulation 4 of the Teaching Council Registration Regulations, which were approved in November 2009.  For the purpose of registration under regulation 4 up to 1 April 2013, the Council requires that an applicant have a primary degree or equivalent which is considered suitable and a suitable qualification in post primary teacher education.  Teachers employed in the vocational education sector are not required, at this time, to have a H.Dip qualification in order to be considered qualified.  The provision related to a post-primary teacher qualification does not generally apply to a person applying to register as a teacher in a VEC school until <Col N="880"/>after 1 April 2013. Regulation 4 also provides for the acceptance of qualifications, which in the opinion of the Council are of an equivalent standard to the above and sufficient for registration.</P>

	<P>Any decision to employ a retired teacher is a local decision made by the school authorities and not my Department.  Circular 0031/2011 is aimed at ensuring that boards of management and principals only resort to employing a retired teacher in very limited circumstances.  It requires a school principal to keep a record as to why a retired teacher had to be employed to cover a short-term absence.  The principal must also report to the school&rsquo;s board of management on the instances where this arises.</P>
        <P>Abatement of pension is applied to retired teachers where the amount of pay together with the pension being received is greater than the pay on which the pension is based. The effect of this is to reduce or sometimes stop pension where a retiree returns to teaching.  In addition, from 1 January 2011, teachers who are in receipt of an occupational pension and who return to teach are remunerated at the first point of the reduced salary scales instead of their pre-retirement personal rate of pay.  These provide significant disincentives to teachers on pension from returning to teach after their retirement.</P>

        <P>The compulsory school starting age is 6 years of age and a child must be at least 4 years of age before she/he may be enrolled in a primary school.</P><Col N="980"/>
        <P>A proposal to raise the school starting age to 5 years and the abolition of transition year were among a range of budgetary savings options that were put forward to the previous government as a means of reducing teacher payroll costs. These measures were not implemented.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that within the context of the parameters of the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland, it is not possible to give commitments about any future measures that may be required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department&rsquo;s home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.</P>
        <P>Allocation of home tuition for the school year is subject to applicants meeting the eligibility criteria. My Department has no record of receiving home tuition applications for the children mentioned.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs. In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services. The SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs. Another specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs and SENOs are a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the study by the National Back Pain Association in the UK which states that the current design of Irish school chairs is not conductive to good posture and back safety; if he will consider phasing out these chairs as part of the natural furniture replacement; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Schools should be satisfied before placing an order that the items tendered are of an acceptable quality and finish. Health and safety is, in the first instance, a matter for each Board of Management and this includes ensuring that school furniture complies with the appropriate standards.</P>
        <P>Where the provision of furniture at schools is being grant-aided in whole or in part by my Department, schools must comply with my Department&rsquo;s specifications.  These are based on standards set by the National Standard Authority of Ireland or equivalent.  In relation to school chairs my Department&rsquo;s specifications require that the chair conform to the Irish (and <Col N="981"/>European) Standard which is I.S. EN 1729 Furniture, Tables and Chairs for Educational Institutions.  This is a recent standard dating from 2006.</P>

	<P>Having considered all of the applications for SNA support which have been received from mainstream primary and post primary schools, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has now advised all mainstream schools of their SNA allocations for the 2011/12 school year, taking into account the number of valid applications for SNA support and the assessed care needs of the children concerned.</P>
        <P>In relation to special schools, the existing levels of SNA support in special schools has been maintained in the first instance, in order to assist and protect the most vulnerable children, with a review to take place in the first term of the school year. SNA provision in special schools is currently being reviewed.</P>
        <P>As not all applications for SNA support can be made in advance of the school year, in order to prudently manage this valuable but limited resource, the NCSE and my Department decided that 475 of the 10,575 posts should be retained in order to allocate them over the coming school year in cases such as emergency, appeals, acquired injuries or new school entrants with special needs care.</P>
        <P>The NCSE will now begin the process of allocating these 475 posts in the coming period in a measured and prioritised manner taking account of the existing levels of SNA support already available in the schools. Accordingly, it is expected that schools, before requesting any review of their SNA provision, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special <Col N="982"/>Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</P>
        <P>The NCSE issued a circular to all schools earlier this year advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme is to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools. This circular also set out that in the case of new applications for SNA support, where the professional report has identified the care needs as being related specifically to behaviour, including such applications for junior infants, in general it will not be possible to consider access to SNA support until the school has set out the specific strategies that have been employed and that have been implemented to minimise the pupil&rsquo;s difficulties and to promote more adaptive behaviours.</P>
        <P>In instances where applications have been made for SNA support for junior infants, for care needs such as medical or toileting needs, as opposed to for behavioural reasons, access to SNA support has been allocated for such qualifying infants. Whereas there is no prescriptive timeframe before which a review may take place, it will be expected that schools, before requesting any such review, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage pupil behaviour and also to manage any SNA allocation that has already been made to their school to best effect.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Free Fee Scheme the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees in respect of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study which are a minimum of two years duration in an approved higher education institution. The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for <Col N="983"/>at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.  I understand that the student referred to by the Deputy is a US national and therefore does not meet the nationality requirement of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Where undergraduate students, such as non-EU students, do not meet the eligibility criteria of the free fees schemes, it is the higher education institution concerned that determines, in accordance with its criteria, the appropriate tuition fee payable by such students. I also understand, that in this case the student, by virtue of his education and residency in the EU, has been approved by the third level institution concerned as being liable to pay the &lsquo;EU rate of fees&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended by Section 11 of the Finance Act 2011, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U.

All registered apprentices who are scheduled to attend off-the-job training in a F&Aacute;S Training Centre or Institute of Technology or College of Further Education are paid a F&Aacute;S training allowance which is calculated with reference to the gross Industry Wage Norm for the different trade sectors.</P>

	<P>The NCCA has been asked to review the junior certificate and advise on the scope for reform designed to strengthen literacy and numeracy, embed key skills, promote active learning and enhanced creativity and innovation, and ensure appropriate ways of generating evidence of learning.  Concerns have also been raised about curriculum overload, and rote learning.</P>
        <P>The Council has completed a public consultation process and has published a report of the consultation findings on its website <i>www.ncca.ie</i>.  The Council is currently finalising its advice to me on the direction of reform, in consultation with the partners in education.  I expect to receive the advice shortly.</P>
        <P>I am aware that teachers of history and geography have raised concerns that their subjects will no longer be compulsory.  The requirement to study history and geography in a secondary school but to have different options in vocational schools is a historical anomaly which is no longer appropriate.  I believe that students should have as wide a choice as is feasible in their schools given the overall level of student demand and interest, the teaching resources available, and the qualifications profile of staff.  They should also acquire a range of knowledge, essential skills and values which will contribute to lifelong learning, and effective social and economic participation.  The importance of history and geography in promoting critical analysis skills, interculturalism, an understanding of human development, democracy, past and current world issues, and the skills for an environmentally sustainable life are fully appreciated.  I will be guided by the NCCA&rsquo;s advice in this matter.</P>

	<P>Apprenticeship is the recognised means by which people are trained to become craftspeople in Ireland.  F&Aacute;S has the statutory responsibility for the organisation and control of designated apprenticeship.  F&Aacute;S does this in co-operation with my Department, the Institutes of Technology, employers and unions.</P>
        <P>The significant reduction in construction activity in Ireland over the last few years has raised difficult issues in relation to the future recruitment of apprentices.  It has resulted in a situation where the recruitment of apprentices to the construction industry has declined by roughly 90% since 2007.</P>
        <P>It is to be expected that the recruitment of apprentices will rise as the construction industry gradually recovers.  However, it is anticipated that the level of annual recruitment will not reach the levels which prevailed during the construction boom &mdash; even in the long-term.</P>
        <P>It is important that those who have responsibility for planning the intake of apprentices in the future, namely F&Aacute;S and the Institutes of Technology, have access to information on what the future levels of apprentice intake are likely to be.</P>
        <P>A skills shortage could arise if the demand for apprentices in the future was significantly under-estimated; in contrast, an over-estimation of the future levels of demand for apprentices could result in the State retaining more resources than is required for the training of apprentices.</P>
        <P>The Institutes of Technology, F&Aacute;S, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and the Department of Enterprise, Innovation and Jobs as well as my Department are all represented on an Interdepartmental Study Group on Apprentice Forecasting set-up by my Department in 2009.  These forecasts can provide an objective, rational basis for planning the future level of apprentice intake.   F&Aacute;S and the HEA, based on the forecast of apprenticeship intake, monitor the apprenticeship training capacity requirements on a regular basis and, within the relevant budget allocations, make the necessary adjustment to capacity to meet the demand.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs.

        <P>10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts are being provided for SNA support for the coming school year.  This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number.</P>
        <P>It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.</P>
        <P>The NCSE issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year.  A key feature of the amended scheme is to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.</P>
        <P>The NCSE has now advised all mainstream schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy in Palmerstown, Dublin 20, of their SNA allocation for the current school year, taking into account the care needs of qualifying pupils attending the school.</P>
        <P>I wish to clarify that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</P>
        <P>The NCSE will advise schools early in the new school year of any review process to review allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that they comply with my Department&rsquo;s policy.  The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism.</P>
        <P>It will be expected that schools, before requesting a review, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.</P>

	<P>In recent years, my Department has given some consideration to consolidating and updating the departmental circulars which deal with exemptions from the study of Irish in recognised primary (12/96) and post-primary schools (M10/94).  All aspects of the current arrangements are under consideration including issues in respect of students with special educational needs.  The intention is to consider the matter on a comprehensive basis rather than isolate any one aspect of the existing arrangements.  Therefore a revised circular is unlikely to issue until consideration is complete including consideration of students with special educational needs.</P>

        <P>Additionally, the equivalent pay rates for Secretary General Level II are &euro;226,937 (Personal Pension Contribution rate) and &euro;215,590 (Non Personal Pension Contribution rate), and for Secretary General Level I -- &euro;240,286 (Personal Pension Contribution rate) and &euro;228,466 (Non Personal Pension Contribution rate).  I should point out that, following the introduction by the Government in June last of a pay ceiling of &euro;200,000 p.a. for senior Public Service posts, all <Col N="991"/>current incumbents of Secretary General Level I and II posts voluntarily waived their entitlement to any salary in excess of &euro;200,000 p.a.

        <P>At present, pension terms for Civil Servants are normally based on their service and final salary, subject to certain conditions.

	<P>The 2009 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) includes an audit of property management under the decentralisation programme.  This report identified capital expenditure on the Programme of 289.4 million Euro on property and recurring costs (leases) of 7 million Euro (as at April 2010).  Dublin property disposals were 356m Euro and leases with an annual value of 10m Euro over the same period were surrendered.  Non-property costs in the order of 30m Euro were incurred, including the costs of decentralising offices and the OPW&rsquo;s spend on dedicated staffing for the programme.  The expenditure figures have not been updated since April 2010 as there has been very little activity on the Programme since then, due to the deferral for budgetary reasons in October 2008 of the implementation of the elements of the programme remaining to be completed at that time.</P>
        <P>My Department has commenced work on a review of the Programme, and I hope to report to Government in relation to that review later in the year.</P>

	<P>The Valuation Act 2001 provides for the valuation of all commercial and industrial property and the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations for rating is his sole prerogative.</P>
        <P>Under section 28(4) of the Act, a Revision Officer of the Commissioner may carry out a revision of valuation in relation to a particular property only if a material change of circumstances (MCC)  has occurred since the property was last revised. MCC is defined in section 3 of the Act as a change of circumstances, which consist of a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.  The definition does not allow for a revision of valuation where the change in value is due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as roads or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property.</P><Col N="992"/>
        <P>It is acknowledged that all commercial property owners/occupiers are currently facing economic challenges and the only means, under statute, by which external influences on individual property values can be adequately addressed by the Commissioner, is through the national revaluation programme which is currently underway.</P>
        <P>My Department is considering proposals to amend the Valuation Act to modernise and streamline the valuation process in the interests of both the ratepayers and the local authorities.</P>

	<P>Under the current legislative arrangements, the President of Ireland is entitled to a full pension of half pay on leaving office.  I will before the end of this month introduce the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011 which will propose a career averaged rather than final salary pension for a President who is a member of the new Single Scheme.  The pension that such a President may accrue will also be subject to a cap of 50% of the pay of the office, to cater for a two-term President.  In addition, the Bill provides that abatement will apply for a public service pensioner who takes up a public service position, including the Presidency.  Finally, it provides for a reduction in the pay of the President, as well as new members of the judiciary, whose pay rates are determined in legislation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Following a public tendering process, a contract is expected to be placed shortly for the first phase of the works on the restoration of Killarney House, County Kerry. The initial package of works will consist of essential repair works, mainly to the external fabric of the building, including repairs of the roof, chimneystacks, flues, gutters, downpipes, windows and drains.  The contractor appointed to carry out the works will be responsible for the engagement of workers for the project.</P>

Age is not one of the eligibility criteria used in the selection process in promotion competitions.

	<P>I met with the Irish Insurance Industry Federation in July to review the interchange of information between OPW and the IIF. In this regard, OPW has provided extensive data to the IIF, detailing areas of the country which have benefitted from flood protection measures put in place over several decades. In addition, the recently published Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA), as part of the CFRAM Programme, has been forwarded to the IIF for its information. This interchange of data contributes to providing opportunities for the insurance industry to make informed decisions in relation to flood risk cover.</P>
        <P>Similarly, when complete, the details of the capital protection works in the Lisheenavalla/Caherlea area, will be issued to the IIF to better inform consideration by its members of flood risk cover in that area. It is hoped that the advance phase of these works will be complete before the end of the year, subject to favourable weather conditions.  Details of these works have been given to residents in the Clare River area and it is open to them to present this information in support of any application for flood insurance cover.</P>
        <P>It has not been possible to respond fully to all correspondence received during the peak summer holiday period due to the normal seasonal constraints on staff resources and the priority assignment of resources to the urgent requirements of the CFRAM programme. A reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s correspondence will issue shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 201 together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce new legislation to protect small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies. In addition, you may be aware that the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 was introduced by Senator Feargal Quinn and passed Committee and remaining stages in the Seanad on 8 March 2011. It is now before the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Mr Brian Hayes is working with Senator Quinn to continue a collaborative approach in regard to advancing the Bill. The Senator&rsquo;s Bill is a welcome initiative and I understand that Minister Hayes and Senator Quinn held a meeting with relevant stakeholders and opposition spokespersons on 28th June 2011. This consultation highlighted a number of matters relating to the Bill that required further consideration and that have been taken into account in the Regulatory Impact Assessment which is being finalised in my Department at present.</P>
        <P>These steps will make it possible to bring proposals to Government about how to progress this legislation. It is intended to have the legislation progress in the D&aacute;il in the current session.  It is important that a solution to the problem of non-payment in the construction sector must not place an unnecessary regulatory or cost burden on the parties to the dispute, other parties involved in the project, or the State.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 198 together.</P>
        <P>Prior to the appointment of the former Secretary General to the post of Secretary General to the Government in January 2000, the Government decided that the terms applicable to Secretaries General appointed under the Top Level Appointments Committee (TLAC) process would apply in his case.  At the end of his term in December 2010, the then Government confirmed the application of those TLAC exit terms on his retirement but deferred his retirement until 6 July 2011 at the latest.  It was decided by the Government in June 2011 that his retirement be further deferred to 31 July 2011.  In these circumstances the payment of the former Secretary General&rsquo;s superannuation and severance benefits was deferred until he ceased to hold office and his benefits were then paid in accordance with the Government decisions made on his appointment and on 7 December 2010.</P>

The severance arrangements to which the Deputy refers only apply to Heads of Departments and not to other senior level appointments in Departments.</P>
        <P>Their appointments were made in line with Government Decision of 5 March 1987 concerning appointments of Secretaries General of Departments which provides for early retirement terms and a special severance gratuity.  These arrangements are currently under review and I expect that proposals will be brought to Government in due course.  I should also point out that I will before the end of this month introduce the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011.  This will propose a career averaged rather than final salary pension for Single Scheme members.  In addition, the Bill provides that abatement will apply for a civil or public service pensioner who takes up a public service position.  There will be no provision for added years or severance payments in that Bill.</P>

	<P>On 1 July 2011, I announced my intention to streamline the State&rsquo;s five employment rights bodies and to introduce a simpler, more effective system, including a single point of entry for all users of the State&rsquo;s employment rights machinery.  The Rights Commissioner Service is part of the Labour Relations Commission, one of the five bodies in question. </P>
        <P Just="Left">On 15 August 2011, I published a consultation paper on this reform process, and invited submissions from interested parties by 16th September.  My proposals are aimed at providing Ireland with a world-class employment rights system, as well as reducing costs for taxpayers and users of the system.  My proposals include providing a system that will be easy to understand and use; a new integrated two-tier structure to replace the five existing employment rights bodies; individuals being able to take their own case and not having to rely on a legal representative, a representative body or a labour inspector; the development of shared services and integration of back office functions to ensure greater efficiency and savings; support to ensure that speedy resolution can occur at workplace level; related cases being taken at the same hearing; one entry point to the system.</P>
        <P>At this stage, it is too early to be precise as to how the reformed entity will operate, whether by a form of &lsquo;administrative complaints procedure&rsquo; or by some other procedure.  These issues will be addressed in the context of the streamlining review.</P>

	<P>The position in relation to the society referred to by the Deputy is that the society was registered by the Registrar for Friendly Societies on 25 June 2007, under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893-1978.  This legislation requires that societies file an annual return with the Registry of Friendly Societies no later than the thirty-first of March each year.  I am informed that the last year for which an annual return has been filed with the Registry of Friendly Societies (RFS) by the society referred to is in respect of the year 2008.  The annual returns for the years 2009 and 2010 have not been filed to date.</P>
        <P>This information is available on the public file of each society, which includes details of registration, the rules of the society and its annual returns, and is available for inspection at the Registry of Friendly Societies.  The Registry of Friendly Societies issues timely notification to registered societies to file annual returns, and in respect of those societies that fail to file on time, subsequent reminders issue.  The non-filing of annual returns constitutes an offence under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts.  Provision also exists under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts for cancellation of the registration of such societies.  In this regard the Registrar has cancelled societies in the past for failure to file annual returns and the position in relation to those societies who have outstanding annual returns is kept under review.</P>

MABS currently assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  The role of money advisers is to help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors.</P>
        <P>While there is some merit in the general idea of a MABS for small business, there is a need to fully consider precisely what role it would play and whether a new structure is needed to assist business people in effectively running their businesses.  There are already a number of State agencies supporting the enterprise sector which provide, inter alia, advice in relation to general financing of a business and also cashflow management.  Business accountants and auditors also provide financial advice and input along with many other private sector specialists.  In addition, business representative bodies provide assistance to their members in dealing with financial matters. To the extent that such advisory services are already available, it remains to be seen to what extent a MABS for Small Business would be necessary.</P>
        <P>In the context of debt management for overly indebted businesses, the need is for such businesses to develop a recovery strategy and to negotiate a solution with creditors, including the banking sector.  Opportunities exist for formal and informal debt restructuring arrange<Col N="999"/>ments.  In the first instance, businesses in difficulty must recognise their difficulty, confront their problems and discuss their position frankly with their creditors.  In the current climate, the most significant creditors would tend to be the banks.</P>
        <P>I think the idea of a MABS for Small Business needs to be considered more fully in order to determine what interventions are needed by business and who is best equipped to provide those interventions.  The current MABS initiative has a budget requirement in excess of &euro;18m and is provided through 52 independent MABS companies operating local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country.  Any consideration would have to include an examination of existing supports, the demand for a new initiative, the resources, and a cost benefit analysis.  In developing any proposal, there should be an involvement and contributions from all stakeholders in the process.  I do not think that the State alone should be seen as the solution to the issue either in terms of service delivery or underwriting the cost of any initiative.</P>

	<P>The issue of restructuring the CEBs has been in the public domain since the publication of the McCarthy Group Report in 2009.  There is no doubt but that the County Enterprise Board model has served the micro-enterprise sector very well over the years but some restructuring of that model is now required to meet the current social, economic and technological landscape of Ireland in line with the many changes since the establishment of the Boards in 1993. The indigenous micro-enterprise sector plays a key part in Irish business and will be vital to our return to economic growth, and it is therefore important that the current deliberations on the most appropriate structures for the support of the micro-enterprise sector are dealt with in a considered and focused manner.</P>
        <P>There are a number of schools of thought on the best way forward in relation to CEB restructuring. It will be important to ensure that there is a coherent and cohesive delivery of State support to the indigenous business sector based on clear enterprise policy principles laid down by this Department. Any restructuring must not diminish the State&rsquo;s engagement with and support for our important micro-enterprise sector and in particular must not make it more difficult for the end-user to access the support services available for the Sector.</P>
        <P>Within my Department we are currently seeking to determine the extent to which there should be restructuring of the CEBs having regard to the Programme for Government, and to other recommendations on CEB restructuring, taking account of the need to achieve a rational and focused model for entrepreneurs, as well as the need to ensure that there is targeted local delivery of enterprise support, driven by a national enterprise policy, in a manner which eliminates overlap and duplication.</P>

	<P>I am working towards the introduction of a targeted, Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee scheme which will be in operation later in the year.  </P><Col N="1004"/>
        <P>The current position is that the contract for the design of the Scheme was awarded to Capital for Enterprise Limited (CfEL) on 26th   August following a competitive tendering process.  CfEL is a Non-Departmental Public Body owned by and reporting to the UK Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills. CfEL have extensive experience of developing and operating the Small Firms Loan Guarantee and Enterprise Finance Guarantee schemes in the UK.  CfEL is currently actively engaged on the design of an appropriate scheme.</P>
        <P>Once a suitable scheme design has been agreed in early October, there will then be a further tendering process to select an operator to allow for the roll out of the scheme towards the end of the year.</P>
        <P>As the Scheme is still in the design phase I am not in a position to set out specific details to the Deputy. Under the scheme, a loan guarantee will be provided by the guarantor (the State) to the lender, under strict criteria to target specific identified market failures, thereby facilitating the outflow of additional credit from the banks. Both the borrower and the bank will retain exposure in the event of default. The State will be exposed only to the portion of the loan guaranteed up to a pre-specified limit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Allowing for a level of default and taking into account income from premiums, there will be an overall direct net cost to the Exchequer.  However this net cost will be compensated by Exchequer gains in terms of employment sustained and created, savings on welfare payments and increased direct and indirect tax payments.  It should also have a positive impact on exports, contributing to further jobs in the medium-term.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment will be for an initial period of one year.  Specific performance criteria will be set down that allow for review and revision of the scheme at the end of that initial period, before any commitment to a roll-over of the scheme for subsequent years.</P>

	<P>The Enterprise Ireland Mentor Network was established to help companies identify and overcome obstacles to growth and provide tailored advice, guidance and support, to help accelerate growth and build management capability.  Mentors are senior executives, drawn from the private sector, with a proven track record in business.  They act as a confidential sounding board, advising companies on key operational and strategic issues.  The Network is regularly refreshed with CEOs and senior executives with high levels of achievement and with proven skills in a range of areas.  Every effort is made to match the Mentor to the specific needs of a company. </P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />A mentoring assignment consists of 10 visits from a Mentor over a 12 month period.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Companies choose a Mentor from a short-list of Mentors with the experience to meet their stated needs.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />The goals and objectives are established by the client in agreement with the Mentor at the start of the assignment.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />All Mentors sign a strict confidentiality agreement with Enterprise Ireland.</P><Col N="1005"/>
        <P FLI="0">Enterprise Ireland has 291 active mentors on its Mentor Network nationally.  Six of these mentors are located in County Meath.</P>
        <P>Since 2005, EI mentors have been appointed to 33 assignments with EI and County Enterprise Board clients located in County Meath.  23 of these assignments have been completed over a course of 133 visits and 10 are in progress with 36 visits instigated so far.</P>
        <P>Mentors from the Network were appointed to companies across the country in the following years:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />2009 &mdash; 365 assignments set up</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />2010 &mdash; 327 assignments set up</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />2011 &mdash; To date 259 assignments have been set up, and 420 assignments are currently in progress.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Meath County Enterprise Board and the County and City Enterprise Board (CEB) network across the country provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases.  The assistance provided includes a wide range of one-to-one mentoring, business advice and information services.</P>
        <P>Meath CEB&rsquo;s mentoring services are complemented by business advice sessions and &lsquo;Start Your Own Business&rsquo; (SYOB) training.  In 2010, there were 228 business advice sessions and 193 SYOB provisions.  Meath CEB has an available panel of 151 mentors across a variety of business specialisations.  Mentoring sessions in 2010 to Meath CEB clients totalled 26 individual project promoters with 66 sessions carried out.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Meath CEB offers three mentoring packages as follows:</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" /><i>Developmental Stage Mentoring:</i>   This is aimed at those who cannot attend a Start Your Own Business Programme due to personal or work commitments and wish to gain expert advice on how to get started. This package consists of 4 mentoring visits (3 hours per visit).</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" /><i>Crisis Mentoring:</i>   This is aimed at businesses in difficulties financial or otherwise who cannot attend training courses but require immediate help with their business. It allows micro-enterprises (i.e. businesses employing 1-10 employees) the opportunity to meet with a business mentor over a period of 1.5 hours to discuss the clients credit control, cash flow or other urgent issues.  Additional hours may be granted if necessary.</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" /><i>Subsidised Mentoring:</i>   This is for client businesses operating within manufacturing and internationally traded service businesses, those who have been in receipt of a grant from the Board, or those who have the potential to be assisted by the Board, and are offered between 3 and 5 sessions each of 3 hours duration. Mentors may be appointed, at the discretion of the Board, for those businesses operating in the services sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0">CEB mentoring provision operates on broadly similar parameters across the CEB Network.  However, it has not been possible within the timescale to provide the required information across the remaining 34 CEBs.</P>
        <P>Throughout 2011, the CEBs have continued to be actively involved in the economic development of the country by direct grant aid to businesses and project promoters and through the provision of one-to-one mentoring together with other &ldquo;soft supports&rdquo; to business, all of which help to stimulate indigenous enterprise and job creation.</P>

	<P>The role of Meath County Enterprise Board (CEB) as part of the CEB Network is to provide support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level, with priority being given to manufacturing and internationally traded services. CEBs recognise that business growth and job creation are inherent considerations in their activities.</P>
        <P>Subject to eligibility criteria new and developing micro-enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of priming, expansion/development and feasibility/innovation grants. In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.</P>
        <P>The average cost of jobs is calculated by reference to the total capital grants paid to promoters since 1993 and the gross jobs existing at the end of 2010.  Meath CEB provided &euro;4.910m in capital grant aid to project promoters over that period with gross jobs amounting to 883, giving an average cost per job of &euro;5,561.  Allocations to Meath CEB in relation to current expenditures and soft supports are not included in the cost of jobs calculation.</P>

	<P>Meath County Enterprise Board (CEB) as part of the CEB Network provides support for the micro-enterprise sector (small businesses not exceeding 10 employees) in the start-up and expansion phases. CEBs also promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level, with priority being given to manufacturing and internationally traded services. CEBs recognise that business growth and job creation are inherent considerations in their activities and while their primary function is to promote enterprise, CEBs can support individuals, firms and community groups provided they have the capacity to achieve commercial viability which is vital to job creation.</P>
        <P>The CEBs deliver a range of tailored Programmes and Supports in order to fulfil this role. The overall priorities for Capital expenditure by the CEBs focus on the promotion and stimulation of entrepreneurship at local level and the development of sustainable growth-orientated micro-enterprises, which, over time, can develop into strong export entities. This is done through the provision of both financial assistance and non-financial assistance.</P>
        <P>The criteria under which funding is available from the CEBs is based on factors such as the sector of the economy in which an enterprise is operating or intends to operate and the size or proposed size of the enterprise. CEBs can assist in the establishment, and/or development, of new and existing enterprises subject to the following eligibility criteria;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />the enterprise must be in the commercial sphere;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />the enterprise must demonstrate a market for the product/service;</P><Col N="1007"/>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />the enterprise must have a capacity for growth and new job creation;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />the enterprise must not employ more than 10 people;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />the enterprise must not give rise to deadweight or displacement.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Within the above eligibility criteria there are certain priorities and restrictions imposed such as the following;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />priority must be given to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland Portfolio;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />tourism enterprises must be aimed predominantly at overseas visitors;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />locally provided enterprises promoted by the unemployed, those recently made redundant and women re-entering the workforce can be supported provided that those enterprises <u>do not</u> give rise to concerns about deadweight or displacement;</P>
       <P><Miles com="mdash66" />it is considered inappropriate to support other areas such as retail enterprises, personal services (e.g. hairdressers, gardeners, etc), professional services (accountants, solicitors, etc) lacking export potential, construction, etc, as it is considered that these generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight (where projects would have proceeded anyway) and/or displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market) concerns.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The CEBs can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter. The forms of <i>financial assistance</i>, which are available, subject to certain restrictions and conditional on an agreed business plan, include priming Grants for Start-ups, Business Expansion and Development Grants to assist with pre start-up market or product studies to include testing the viability of the business.</P>
        <P>The provision of <i>non-financial assistance</i>   can take the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives etc. While these soft supports may not directly generate jobs in an enterprise, they can contribute positively to the wider policy objective of building an enterprise culture which, in time, may result in job creation without direct financial assistance from the State.</P>
        <P>Through the provision of both financial and non-financial support the CEBs are central in assisting many micro-enterprises in developing their growth potential and, which over time, can develop into strong export entities where they have sufficient mass to access the services of Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>In 2010, Meath CEB provided &euro;230,515 in financial assistance to 32 projects resulting in the creation of 43 jobs and sustaining a further 40. In addition, training was provided to 366 participants. To date in 2011 15 projects have been assisted resulting in 22 full time jobs created, and sustaining a further 22 jobs.</P>
        <P>During 2011, Meath CEB and the CEB network will continue to be actively involved in the economic development of microenterprises across the regions.</P>

	<P>This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that bank officials engaged in business lending have a good knowledge and understanding of the financial needs of viable businesses, the sectors and markets they trade in, and modern business models.  The development and maintenance of close working relationships between our banks and enterprise will enable Irish companies to trade locally as well as helping them to take full advantage of export growth opportunities.</P>
        <P>It is in this context that Enterprise Ireland has established working relationships with both the pillar banks and other SME banks.  Knowledge sharing activities have been initiated which have included reciprocal secondments, sectoral briefings, participation in Enterprise Ireland sponsored events including international markets week, the finance for growth workshops and the trade mission to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2010.</P>
        <P>This ongoing interaction between Enterprise Ireland and the banks has to date facilitated the participation by over 100 senior bank officials from the main banks, across various general and specialist functions (including Business and Corporate Banking, Trade Finance, Treasury and Credit) in knowledge sharing activities.  Enterprise Ireland does not collate data in relation to this type of activity on a county basis.</P>
        <P>Additionally, Enterprise Ireland is encouraging the banks to develop propositions for exporters and technology companies that are suited to different stages of growth (start-ups, early stage and mature companies) and to adopt a cashflow lending approach as opposed to the asset backed approach that has been the norm in recent years.</P>
        <P>This engagement is ongoing and is a key part of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to ensure that viable businesses have access to credit.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is to provide short term support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. </P>
        <P>At the end of December 2010 there were 17,974 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of 337% over the 2007 figure. There are currently over 18,500 households benefiting from the scheme for which &euro;77.2m has been allocated for 2011.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s review of the administrative, policy and legal aspects of the mortgage interest supplement scheme was published in July 2010 in conjunction with the interim report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group. The final review of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group was published in November 2010. These reports set out a number of recommendations. These recommendations are centered on the delivery of significant customer service improvement by ensuring that State support for those unable to deal with mortgage arrears is better targeted, consistent and easily understood. Allied with the focus on customer service improvement are recommendations that seek to ensure that lending institutions, borrowers and the Exchequer share responsibilities and commitments in a balanced way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recommendations set out in the Mortgage and Personal Debt Review Group&rsquo;s final report are now being considered in the context of other commitments contained in the Programme for Government in relation to mortgage holders and are now informing the wider remit of the Economic Management Council&rsquo;s review. Specifically, the issue of distressed mortgages is being examined by the Economic Management Council&rsquo;s (EMC) subgroup on Mortgage Over-Indebtedness. The subgroup is due to report to the EMC at the end of September with <Col N="1011"/>the final report being issued to Government by the EMC.

	<P>Social Welfare legislation already provides the Health Service Executive with the authority to refuse payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority or an approved body where the reasons for that requirement include anti-social behaviour or the interests of good estate management.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of private rented accommodation, tenancy arrangements involve a contract between the landlord and tenant and tenant behaviour is a matter for the landlord in the first instance. There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board and/or recourse to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and/or the Courts in relation to the enforcement of the law in dealing with anti-social or criminal behaviour. If necessary, the landlord may seek termination of the tenancy which, if effected, would result in the termination of rent supplement.</P>
        <P>There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to review the operation of the rent supplement scheme with a view to introducing a code of conduct for rent supplement eligibility similar to that which operates for local authority tenants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This review should ensure that tenants who are receiving long term support from the State under the rent supplement scheme are subject to the same type of anti-social behaviour regime as local authority tenants. However, the most appropriate way for this to happen is for local authorities to take over full responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of these individuals. My Department is currently working with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to achieving this goal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228, 240 and 257 together. </P>
        <P>The savings in the fuel allowance scheme and household benefits package were provided for last December in Budget 2011 but were not specified or announced by the Government at that time.</P>
        <P>From September 2011 the fuel allowance has been standardised at &euro;20 per week, the rate currently received by the majority of customers, with no additional allowance for living in a smokeless area.  The cost of the telephone allowance is reduced following negotiations with Eircom which will ensure that customers receive &euro;26.86 of value on their bills, at a cost to the State of &euro;22.22 per month.  The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance will be reduced to the level at the start of 2007 (from 2,400 to 1,800).  These three measures will generate savings of &euro;17 million in 2011 and &euro;65 million annually.</P>
        <P>The rationale for paying the smokeless allowance to customers in smokeless areas cannot be maintained.  The price differential between the types of coal is as low as 2% while the allowance represents an addition of 20% to the fuel allowance.  Use of coal has dropped considerably, to about 3%.  It is inequitable to continue paying this top-up allowance to some customers and not others when the purpose for which it was intended no longer applies.</P>
        <P>As regards the telephone allowance, the deal negotiated with Eircom represents good value for the State and the customer.  The main saving is that the Department will no longer pay a monthly rental for handsets, but customers will be able to keep their set at no charge. Indeed a lot of households no longer use or have their original handsets so it makes no sense that the State would continue to pick up this cost.</P>
        <P>The reduction in units in the electricity allowance and equivalent gas allowance is essential to control spending.  Because the allowances are based on units the full cost of energy increases has been borne by the State, with no incentive for customers to switch to other cheaper companies. Currently, up to 82,000 (21%) customers under-use their allowance of 2,400 units.  Only 16% of social welfare customers have switched companies compared to 42% nationally.  People will be able to offset some of the reduction in units by availing of cheaper rates.</P>
        <P>A poverty impact assessment was carried out in the context of developing a range of options for the future administration of the household benefits package in a de-regulated domestic energy market.  While this focused on the potential impact of changing the electricity allowance from a unit base to a cash base to avail of cheaper rates available it also examined the issue of the vulnerability of older people who are the main recipients of the household benefits package.</P>
        <P>Data for the 2009 EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) show that households comprising predominantly older people had lower consistent poverty rates than other age categories. Single adults aged over 65 with no children had a consistent poverty rate of 0.6% while people in households with 2 adults at least one of whom was aged 65 or over with no children <Col N="1014"/>had a consistent poverty rate of 1.0%. In 2009, in the general population, 5.5% of people were in consistent poverty.</P>
        <P>My Department will spend over &euro;530 million in 2011 on the fuel scheme and the telephone, gas and electricity elements of the household benefits package which will benefit over 630,000 people.  Help will also continue to be available for people with special or additional heating needs through the Heating Supplement and Exceptional Needs Payment Scheme under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.</P>
        <P>Along with other Departments and agencies, my Department has been working with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on an Affordable Energy Strategy which will be published shortly.  The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty in the long term is to reduce their consumption of energy through improving the thermal efficiency of the home. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has administered an energy efficiency programme for privately owned low income households (Warmer Homes) since 2001. Over 65,000 such households have benefited to date, with a further 15,000 expected to receive energy efficiency upgrades this year. A similar upgrade programme is also in place for local authority houses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Pat Rabbitte T.D. announced this week that Electricity and Gas customers experiencing financial hardship will not be disconnected this winter provided they have entered a payment plan or have agreed to the installations of a pay-as-you-go meter. The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is to work with all gas and electricity supply companies to implement the initiative.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, myself and my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Pat Rabbitte T.D. are in the process of seeking greater discounts from the ESB in the context of the electricity allowance. However to date I have been disappointed at the apparent reluctance of the ESB to offer what I would regard as meaningful discounts. In circumstances where a large percentage of the ESB&rsquo;s customers are in arrears, my Department is effectively guaranteeing the payment of 390,000 customers&rsquo; bills on exceptionally favourable payment terms; it is therefore a matter of serious concern to me that the ESB is either unwilling or unable to offer my Department a discount that is commensurate with the benefits it derives from the electricity allowance.</P>
        <P>My officials have been liaising with Minister Rabbitte&rsquo;s officials in relation to this matter and we hope to be in a position to arrange a meeting with the CEO of the ESB in order to urgently progress this matter.</P>
        <P>As regards informing our customers, these changes were announced by my Department on 12th July 2011. On foot of a press release there was significant coverage in the national papers, radio and television.  Information, including a Frequently Asked Questions segment was available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.welfare.ie</i>.  My Department&rsquo;s phone system was updated with a recorded message advising changes to the scheme and a Lo-call number was available for any enquiries. Given the volume of customers in receipt of either a fuel allowance or household benefits package the cost of changing the slip in post offices or writing to customers individually on the changes would be prohibitive in an environment where departments are under pressure to achieve savings.</P>

        <Quest> if the transitional pension, which is due to come to an end in 2013, will be replaced by a similar scheme for persons <Col N="1015"/>who retire early but who have enough social insurance contributions; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no plans to introduce a scheme as outlined by the Deputy.  State pension (transition) (SPT) is currently paid to people aged 65 who have a minimum yearly average of 24 social insurance contributions and who have retired from work.  Currently it ceases at age 66 when the claimant transfers to State pension (contributory) (SPC).  <b></b></P>
        <P>As announced in the National Pensions Framework, State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of State pension age at 66.   State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028. It is worth noting that, until the early 1970s, the qualifying age for State pension (contributory) was 70 years of age.  By gradually increasing the qualifying age for State pension, people will be further encouraged to remain in employment beyond 65 years of age.</P>
        <P>The Quarterly National Household Survey Q4 2010 showed that the numbers currently at work drop dramatically at 65 years of age.  While 77.2 per cent of people aged 45-54 years are in employment, this drops to 64.3 per cent for 55-64 year-olds and to just 8.7 per cent  for people aged 65 years or older.   It is clear, therefore, that the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.   Increases in life expectancy mean that more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  While this is to be welcomed, this has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.   The fundamental principle that people need to participate in the workforce for longer needs to be emphasised and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.</P>
        <P>People who have retired before State pension age will be entitled to apply for another social welfare payment, as is the current position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The PPS No. is the individual&rsquo;s unique reference number for all dealings with Government Departments and public bodies.  This covers its use for DSP purposes as well as use by other agencies (in accordance with legislation &mdash; Section 262 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 provides the basis for the allocation, use and sharing of the PPS No.).</P>
        <P>These numbers are issued by my Department following checks on an individual&rsquo;s identity. The checks vary depending on the type of individual concerned &mdash; we accept notification via the General Register Office of births but for the last number of years (since 2000) insist on a face to face interview before issuing a PPS number to a resident of working age.</P>
        <P>There are some 7.4m records on my Department&rsquo;s central database, each identified by a PPS number. These records are for all PPS numbers ever issued so the amount of PPS numbers issued and the population figure should differ. As well as all individuals currently resident in the State who have been issued with a PPS number, the figure also includes any individual who:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />since 1979, required a PPS Number and has died,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />has been resident in the State but has subsequently left the jurisdiction (including those born in the State since 1971) or</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />has not been resident in the State but has, for instance, benefited from an Irish Estate (the Revenue Commissioners have a requirement that all beneficiaries of Irish Estates should have a PPS Number).</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">It is not possible for me to describe all uses that other agencies have for the PPS Number, but it is worth remarking that my Department uses the number to identify an individual&rsquo;s PRSI contributions while they are working in the State. This means that, even after they have left the State, the number allocated to them remains valid. The PRSI contribution information will be relevant to calculating pension entitlements in other jurisdictions as well as this one.</P>
        <P>I will also make the point that possession of a number, in itself, does not convey any entitlement. While it can make identifying a person easier for both the individual and the agency, checks on identity and meeting the qualifying conditions for any scheme must be carried out.</P><Col N="1017"/>
        <P>My Department takes its stewardship of the individual&rsquo;s data very seriously and, although any database containing the volume and historical content of its client records will contain incomplete and incorrect data, we have processes in place to monitor, correct and enhance the data that we hold. Most importantly, we also continue to enhance the processes associated with collecting the data in the first place.</P>

	<P>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) scheme   operates from the beginning of June until the end of September each year.</P>
        <P>The administrative arrangements for the 2011 BSCFA scheme differ from those that applied in previous years. For this year, the majority of BSCFA entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers, 127,000 households in respect of over 250,000 children received their payment automatically in June.</P>
        <P>Those customers who did not receive an automated payment are required to complete and return an application form to the Department. The timescale for determining applications for Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance claims is dependent on a number of factors including: the number of applications received, when the application is lodged, the availability of the required information such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements and other relevant information regarding an individual&rsquo;s application.</P>
        <P>In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.  Staff are working as quickly as possible on clearing the large volume of manual application claims received. Based on the current volume of applications it could take up to 7 weeks from date of receipt to process claims. Departmental records show that an application form was received from the person concerned on 2nd August 2011 and it is expected she will be notified of the outcome of her claim shortly.</P>

	<P>The focus of Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) scheme is to assist those who are most marginalised and distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system. The BTEA scheme can offer participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The eligibility criteria for participation in the BTEA scheme require a person to be in receipt of Illness Benefit for at least two years prior to commencement of their approved course of study.  However, if a person fails to satisfy the two year requirement on Illness Benefit, periods spent on other qualifying social welfare claims can be used to make up the two year qualifying period provided that at least 50% of the two years is spent on Illness Benefit.  The 50% rule is relaxed for persons in receipt of Illness Benefit and subsequently qualifies for another qualifying illness related payment.</P>
        <P>Additionally, a person in receipt of Illness Benefit can pursue a course of study while receiving payment without recourse to BTEA if it is medically certified that pursuit of the course will not impede his or her recovery.</P><Col N="1020"/>
        <P>At present there are no plans to change the qualifying criteria for the BTEA scheme, however all employment schemes will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and the changing economic circumstances.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>A person wishing to pursue back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others.</P>
        <P>A waiting period is considered essential given that BTEA confers entitlement to income support for an extended period and avoids establishing a pull factor to the Live Register. It is also considered necessary as it reduces unnecessary provision, for those who will leave the Live Register in any event, in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.</P>
        <P>The qualifying period for the second level option of the scheme has remained at 3 months in recognition of the need for more urgent intervention in the case of people who have not completed formal second level education. With effect from 19th July 2010, the period for which a person is required to be on a qualifying social welfare payment before accessing third level education under the BTEA was reduced from 12 months to 9 months (a 2 year qualifying period continues to apply to participants coming from Illness Benefit).  Since 2007, people who are awarded statutory redundancy may access BTEA immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
        <P>However, if a person wishes to pursue a part time education course they may be able to do so while still obtaining their jobseekers payment.  They must apply at their local social welfare office and verify that participation on the course does not reduce their availability for work.  In the case of jobseekers benefit, participation on a course does not grant any extension to the normal period for which jobseekers benefit is paid. In May, a new fund, entitled Springboard, which is being managed by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, provides education and training opportunities to support unemployed people. The target group for this programme of over 200 part-time courses includes unemployed people with a previous history of employment who already hold a higher level qualification at NFQ Levels 6 to 9, who may also require additional upskilling or reskilling in order to re-enter employment. By way of the part-time education option, unemployed people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments will be facilitated in retaining their payment, subject to continuing entitlement, within the broader back to education framework.</P>
        <P>The BTEA, in conjunction with other employment support schemes, will be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.</P>

	<P>The family income supplement (FIS) is designed to provide income for employees on low earnings with families.  This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</P>
        <P>The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  In the case of parents who are separated, a parent who is wholly or mainly maintaining a former spouse can qualify for FIS. However, only one FIS payment can be made in respect of any family.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, a person included in one particular family for any period for FIS purposes shall not be regarded as a member of any other family during that period. I have no immediate plans to amend the legislation further in this regard.</P>

	<P>From 1st January 2011 policy and funding responsibility for F&Aacute;S functions in relation to employment and community employment services was transferred to this Department in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010. </P>
        <P>A number of special community employment projects operate under the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.  As part of the Strategy (whose primary objective is to continue to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs), F&Aacute;S is committed to providing 1,000 places on such projects as part of the overall funding for the community employment programme. These 1,000 community employment places are ring-fenced for persons undergoing rehabilitation from drug addiction.  Specific criteria exist for these places and the eligibility for participation.  These were revised and agreed with the sector in 2010/2011.</P><Col N="1024"/>
        <P>Further work is under way in the context of the National Drug Rehabilitation Implementation Committee to review the allocation of these places and ensure that appropriate referral protocols are in place. Participants can be in specific drug response projects or may be in &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; community employment projects.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to ensure the continuation of such projects subject to the overall budgetary constraints for the community employment programme.</P>

        <Quest> if she has given any consideration to re-introducing the pre-retirement allowances for over 55s, which was abolished under the Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Act 2006; and if her attention has been drawn to the growing number of over 55s who, after years of employment, are struggling to find jobs in the current turbulent labour market. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24798/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Pre-Retirement Allowance (PRETA) is means-tested payment for people in Ireland aged 55 and over who have left the labour force. Persons on PRETA are no longer required to sign-on as they do not need to be available for work. On the 4 July, 2007, PRETA was discontinued for new entrants. The phasing-out of PRETA was consistent with efforts being made to encourage and facilitate people to continue to work up to and beyond pension age. Theses efforts are being made in the context of the significant challenges facing the Irish pension system. In particular, the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population. There are currently six workers for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050.  Increasing State pension age is one of the ways in which we can sustain the pensions system and also maintain the value of the State pension at 35% of average earnings. As announced as part of the National Pensions Framework, state pension age will be increased <Col N="1026"/>gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of the state pension age at 66.  State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments. While the primary responsibility for job creation rests with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Innovation, this Department already has a role in supporting people from welfare to work. The National Employment Action Plan process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the Live Register. It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services.</P>
        <P>While it is acknowledged that the decision to phase out PRETA was taken at a time when labour market conditions were significantly different to that of today. Any re-introduction of the scheme, or a similar benefit type payment, would be inconsistent with the interaction of current working age/pensions policy. Significant costs would also arise.</P>

Her claim was referred to one of the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors who was of the opinion that the person was not medically suitable for disability allowance.  The deciding officer accepted this opinion.  Furthermore, she was assessed with weekly means in excess of the statutory limit for receipt of disability allowance so her claim was disallowed on two grounds. The person was notified in writing of this decision and the reasons for it on 10 February 2011.</P>
        <P>The person subsequently appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. Based on the evidence before him the appeals officer found that the person concerned failed to show that her weekly means did not exceed the statutory limit allowed for receipt of disability allowance and she was not substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment by reason of a specified disability within the meaning of Social Welfare legislation and, accordingly, the appeal was not allowed.  The applicant was notified of this decision in writing by the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 6 August 2011. An appeal officer&rsquo;s decision is final and conclusive in the absence of any fresh facts or evidence.</P>

        <P>The administrative arrangements for the 2011 BSCFA scheme differ from those that applied in previous years. For this year, the majority of BSCFA entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers, 127,000 households in respect of over 250,000 children received their payment automatically in June.</P>
        <P>Those customers who did not receive an automated payment are required to complete and return an application form to the Department. The timescale for determining applications for Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance claims is dependent on a number of factors including: the number of applications received, when the application is lodged, the availability of the required information such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements and other relevant information regarding an individual&rsquo;s application.</P>
        <P>In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</P>
        <P>Staff are working as quickly as possible on clearing the large volume of manual application claims received. Based on the current volume of applications it could take up to 7 weeks from date of receipt to process claims. Departmental records show that an application form was received from the persons concerned on 8 August 2011 and it is expected they will be notified of the outcome of his claim shortly.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case.  There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.  In the context of dealing with the considerable number of appeals now on hand, the Department made 9 additional appointments to the office earlier this year.</P>
        <P>While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person&rsquo;s oral hearing will be heard, but she will be informed when arrangements have been made.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

	<P>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) scheme operates from the beginning of June until the end of September each year.  The administrative arrangements for the 2011 BSCFA scheme differ from those that applied in previous years.  For this year, the majority of BSCFA entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers, 127,000 households in respect of over 250,000 children received their payment automatically in June.</P>
        <P>Those customers who did not receive an automated payment are required to complete and return an application form to the Department.  The timescale for determining applications for Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance claims is dependent on a number of factors including: the number of applications received, when the application is lodged, the availability of the required information such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements and other relevant information regarding an individual&rsquo;s application.</P>
        <P>In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</P>
        <P>Staff are working as quickly as possible on clearing the large volume of manual application claims received.  Based on the current volume of applications it could take up to 7 weeks from date of receipt to process claims.  Departmental records show that an application form was received from the person concerned on 1st August 2011 and it is expected she will be notified of the outcome of her claim shortly.</P>

	<P>Customer service is at the centre of my Department&rsquo;s strategies and business.  Processing times vary across schemes because of both the volume of applications and the differing qualification criteria.  For example, means assessments are required for all of the social assistance schemes; medical examinations are required for some of the illness related schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence conditions.  In the case of the insurance-based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.</P>
        <P>All scheme areas in the Department are subject to continuous business process improvement supported by modern technology.  In addition, the staffing needs of my Department are kept under constant review to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.</P>
        <P>In excess of 900 staff have been assigned to my Department since May 2008, to fill critical vacancies and additional posts that were approved to deal with the significant increase in claims for the various schemes operated by my Department.</P>
        <P>One of the main impacts on current service delivery has been the increase in the Live Register.  In this context, my Department has introduced a range of process improvement initiatives regarding claims for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  One of the most significant initiatives, aimed at reducing queuing and waiting times, involves customers attending their local office by appointment at which time the claim is taken and decided.This provides for the appropriate appointment to be scheduled for the customer thus enabling certain claims to be dealt with in a single visit to the office.</P>
        <P>Process improvements have resulted in a significant reduction in the number and proportion of all claims awaiting a decision.  For example, there were 35,329 jobseeker&rsquo;s claims awaiting a <Col N="1036"/>decision on 10 September 2011 equating to 7% of the total claim-load. This compares favourably to 11 September 2010 when 44,717 claims or 9% of claim-load were awaiting decision and 69,074 claims or 14% of claim-load in September 2009.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s eGovernment strategy aims to support and develop customer contact channels that maximise customer service and minimise cost of delivery and recent years have seen significant investment in the provision of improved information and online services, resulting in increased customer awareness of their entitlements and more efficient claim processing procedures.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.welfare.ie</i>, redesigned in 2008, provides comprehensive information on all the Department&rsquo;s schemes and services as well as a range of online services which include online claiming for State Pension Contributory, Household Benefits, Child Benefit, Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments and Widow(er)&rsquo;s and Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension.  It is planned to extend the online claiming service in 2011/2012 to include Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Disability Allowance, State Pension (Non-Contributory) and Redundancy Payments and Insolvency Payments.  The range of online services on the website also includes</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />dedicated pages for each local and branch office, containing contact details, maps and notice boards</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />social insurance record request service</P>

        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />anonymous reporting of suspected social welfare fraud</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />form and leaflet request service</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Department has also recently introduced a pilot initiative allowing certain customers to sign on for their Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment online.</P>
        <P>As well as online services, the Department operates an SMS (text messaging) service through which customer can request applications forms and leaflets and also request statements of benefit paid.</P>

	<P>The introduction of the Public Services Card (PSC) will assist in the identification of customers to providers of public services. </P>
        <P>A more secure registration process, leading to issue of a PSC incorporating the customer&rsquo;s photograph and signature, will give significant assurance as to the identity of the cardholder. This means that the issuer of a PSC will get three main benefits:</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />It will reduce the number of people who fraudulently claim to be someone else,</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />It will be a secure card and will considerably reduce the potential for forgery, and</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />It will save some of the time currently spent re-verifying an individual&rsquo;s identity each time a member of the public tries to access a public service.</P><Col N="1037"/>
        <P FLI="0">This last benefit will also be realisable for those other bodies that use the card subsequently &mdash; they will not have to re-register a card-holder. Small savings for each interaction with cardholders will represent a considerable overall saving.</P>
        <P>The benefits for a cardholder are similar to those for a public body. It will make it more difficult for someone else to claim to be that cardholder, thus playing its part in reducing identity theft. It will also save time and effort for the individual in that they will not have to re-register for every supplier of public services who need to verify identity and it should reduce the amount of time spent establishing identity for each transaction.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance means test includes a value attributed to any capital a person may have. Capital refers to savings, investments, cash-on-hands and property (excluding their own home). The value of all of these items is added together and a  formula applied to their total value to calculate a person&rsquo;s weekly means, depending on the particular social assistance scheme in involved.</P>
        <P>Capital that is owned but not personally used or enjoyed (e.g. a second house) is assessed as means under the means test. Where capital or property is assessed on this basis, any income received from its use (e.g. interest on savings, dividends from shares, rent from property) is not assessed as cash income. Instead, the following formula is used to establish weekly means:</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />Disregard first &euro;5,000 of capital value of property/savings</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />Assess next &euro;10,000 at &euro;1 per &euro;1,000</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />Assess next &euro;25,000 at &euro;2 per &euro;1,000</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />Assess remaining capital over &euro;40,000 at &euro;4 per &euro;1,000.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The capital assessment formula applicable to SWA is not intended to determine a potential rate of interest or income from the capital, but rather to ensure that any such capital or savings should be utilized by applicants towards their basic income needs.  Apart from this assessment formula, any interest or income actually received by an applicant derived from this capital is not taken into account further for SWA means assessment purposes.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to change the treatment of capital under the supplementary welfare allowance means test. Any changes would have to be considered within a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>The table below shows the number of recipients of rent supplement in County Wicklow from 2007 to 2011.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are several commitments contained in the Programme for Government in relation to the rent supplement scheme. In this regard, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, on 16 June 2011, announced a new housing policy framework statement reflecting the content of the Programme for Government (Government for National Recovery 2011-2016) and setting out the principles to underpin the development of housing policy into the medium term. This policy framework statement contained an announcement in relation to the transfer of responsibility for providing for the housing needs of long term rent supplement recipients to housing authorities on a phased basis.</P>
        <P>This transfer of tenants from rent supplement to the local authorities will help achieve a key Government commitment and return rent supplement to its original intention of a short-term income support payment. My Department is currently working with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to achieving this goal.</P>

        <Quest> if he will include unmarked burial grounds outside the confines of established burial grounds in the existing record of monuments and places established under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994, which would accord unmarked burial grounds a legal designation and ensure they are protected in county development plans, in view of the fact that a new version of the record of monuments is proposed. </Quest>

	<P>The National Monuments Service of my Department records all pre-1700 AD burial places as monuments, either as &lsquo;Graveyard&rsquo; where associated with a church, or, as &lsquo;Burial ground&rsquo;, for those that are not associated with a church. My Department is currently examining the recording of post-1700 AD monuments with a view to formulating policy and criteria for including them in a revised and updated Record of Monuments.  The objective of the review is to achieve a standard approach nationally that will ensure that all elements of the built heritage continue to be adequately protected.</P>

	<P>I envisage that the website of the National Monuments Service of my Department (<i>www.archaeology.ie</i>) will, in future, be the primary portal for the dissemination of information on archaeological monuments. Summary descriptions of approximately 50% of the records for County Kildare will be available online by the end of this month, with the remainder to follow over the next 18 months.</P>
        <P>This website will continue to be complemented by the published archaeological inventory series which, to date, has seen the publication of twenty-one volumes covering sixteen counties. The series, which is aimed at the general reader and scholar alike, supports the key strategy of promoting the awareness and appreciation of our rich archaeological heritage. The inventory for County Kildare is being progressed, along with other counties, but I hope that, in the meantime, the availability of the Archaeological Survey records on our website will be of assistance to all interested parties. I <Col N="1043"/>should point out that, due to a security breach, the web-site is not full operational at the moment. However, the mapviewer component is available and information on monuments can still be accessed. Work is ongoing to resolve this issue. <i>http://www.archaeology.ie/</i></P>

        <Quest> the reason there is no mention at the Connemara National Parks Visitors Centre of the history of the Letterfrack industrial school and its association with the park; his plans to update the information displays to include information regarding the history of the industrial school; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Connemara National Park was established in 1980, combining land from a number of sources including Kylemore Abbey, Coillte Teoranta and a number of private landowners.  The Park is managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department.</P>
        <P>The main remit of the National Parks and Wildlife Service is the conservation of our natural heritage and the Park provides a valuable amenity for both locals and visitors to the area and encourages the development of sustainable tourism in the locality. The main purpose of the Park&rsquo;s exhibition area is to interpret the landscape and natural heritage of the National Park and the surrounding area through information exhibits and special events such as children&rsquo;s activities, guided walks and evening talks which are organised throughout the year.</P>
        <P>While the graveyard and some outbuildings from the former Letterfrack Industrial School lie within the boundaries of the National Park the main building which housed the School does not.  With regard to the graveyard itself, its enhancement was facilitated and funded by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the area is treated with dignity and respect and is cared for by NPWS staff who maintain it to the highest standards.  In addition, there is appropriate signage in place where the access path to the graveyard leaves the main route in the park.</P>
        <P>The appropriate means of highlighting the history of the Letterfrack Industrial School and other such institutions and the commemoration of those who spent time there is a matter that falls outside the primary remit of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and is more appropriate to the Department of Education and Skills.</P>
        <P>I understand from enquiries made to that department&rsquo;s Residential Institution Redress Unit that as part of the Government&rsquo;s implementation of the recommendations of the Ryan Report, an independent Committee was appointed by the Minister for Education &amp; Skills to oversee the design and commissioning of a memorial for those affected by institutional abuse.</P>
        <P>Following the consultative process, a competition is being organised and administered on behalf of the Committee by the Commissioners of Public Works. The competition is open to all including those who might wish to make proposals for an appropriate memorial to those affected by institutional abuse in Letterfrack Industrial School.</P>
        <P>The closing date for receipt of expressions of interest is Thursday 13th of October 2011 and details of the competition, including selection criteria, indicative dates, and competition jury membership is available on the Department of Education &amp; Skills web-site <i>www.education.ie</i> and <i>www.publicart.ie  .</i></P>

	<P>The Ocean Energy Development Unit in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) was established to take forward the ocean energy sector in Ireland.  SEAI operates a Prototype Development Fund aimed at stimulating the development and deployment of ocean energy devices and systems and developers may apply for funding under the scheme. </P>
        <P>Prior to the introduction of the Prototype Development Fund, SEAI considered a variety of ways to incentivise industry to develop innovative products, seeking to introduce a level playing field for all product developers/inventors.</P>
        <P>Developers/inventors often require support at the very early stage of their project to be able to bring their products to a workable design level.  A concern with the proposal outlined would be that only those companies that already have initial development funding in place would be able to avail of such a scheme.  The suggestion of the state taking a stake in patent rights is complex and would require in-depth analysis. It would also likely involve the state in the product on an ongoing basis, perhaps well beyond the lifetime of the scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.  Infrastructural connections which extend the natural gas network are a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the companies involved in gas transmission and distribution, principally Gaslink and Bord G&aacute;is Networks (BGN). Under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, the CER, which is a statutory independent body, has been charged with all aspects <Col N="1048"/>of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State.  The CER must be satisfied that a proposal to extend the network is an economic proposition before it will grant consent for it, as otherwise uneconomic projects will increase costs for all energy consumers.</P>
        <P>In 2006 the CER directed BGN to implement a new Connections Policy Document, allowing for the appraisal of connecting new towns in relative proximity to the gas network, either on their own or as part of a regional group of towns.   This Connections Policy was adopted in April 2006 and updated in June 2008.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the new policy, BGN carried out a comprehensive review of towns being considered for connection to the national gas network. The review was carried out in three Phases. During 2008 and 2009, BGN, on behalf of Gaslink, examined the potential connection of 39 towns throughout the country, in a study known as New Towns Analysis Phase III. The results of this examination were reviewed and subsequently approved by the CER in April 2010. As part of this analysis, the connection of six towns in the North West to the natural gas network was examined (Ballyshannon, Bundoran, Donegal Town, Lifford, Letterkenny and Sligo Town). The report considered the connection of these towns under three different potential routes.  In all cases, the results of the analysis showed that none of the six towns were economically viable for connection to the gas network.</P>
        <P>The CER&rsquo;s decision not to proceed with connecting certain towns in this regard followed a detailed economic analysis based upon criteria outlined in the Connections Policy. In light of the general economic downturn and evidence from previous phases, the CER required a more prudent application of the Connections Policy than in previous phases, particularly relating to underlying assumptions.</P>
        <P>At an earlier stage in 2001, the Government had at the time approved in principle the extension of the gas network to Letterkenny from the proposed Belfast Derry pipeline.  It was also agreed that a formal detailed proposal for extending the network, with full costings, should be submitted to it before any formal decision was made to commit Exchequer funding for the project. In July 2004 the Department, commissioned the feasibility study, which was undertaken by Fingleton McAdam Consultants. It concluded that the pipeline proposal was not viable in economic terms and could require up to 100% subvention.   On foot of that study, the Minister decided to carry out a full Cost Benefit Analysis and DKM Economic Consultants Ltd was commissioned to undertake this work.  The report was completed in March 2005. The report concluded that the pipeline would require 100% subvention of the capital costs and would also require an annual subvention to offset the operational costs of the pipeline.</P>
        <P>While the project could have attracted a contribution towards the construction phase under the InterReg III Programme, in the light of the conclusions of both the feasibility study and the cost benefit analysis that the extension was not viable either in financial or economic terms, the Special European Union Projects Body decided in June 2005 to re-allocate the relevant envelope of funding to other infrastructural projects located in the border region. Against this backdrop, the Minister decided not to progress this project by means of using significant Exchequer funds and advised Government accordingly in June 2005.</P>

	<P>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function of a local authority.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis.  The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in making the rating system fairer and equitable for ratepayers.</P>
        <P>Following completion of the revaluation programme, there is expected to be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability and this relationship will thereafter be maintained by means of recurring revaluations provided for in the Valuation Act.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 333 and 334 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland recognises the right of States to determine their own energy mix, including whether or not to develop nuclear power.  It is Ireland&rsquo;s expectation that, where a State chooses to develop a nuclear power industry, this will be done in line with the highest international standards with respect to safety and environmental protection.</P>
        <P>In view of the potential for transboundary impacts, however unlikely, the importance of prioritising nuclear safety and environmental protection is a matter of concern to non-nuclear States such as Ireland. With regard to the UK&rsquo;s plans for new nuclear build, including at Sellafield, my Department has engaged bilaterally with the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change on these plans since they were first signalled a number of years ago and continues to do so.  This engagement serves to highlight to the UK any concerns identified from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective in relation to the planned new nuclear build. Concerns raised to date have included the long-term management of radioactive waste, as well as potential cumulative impacts of having multiple nuclear sites in an area, including with respect to emergency planning and response and radioactive discharges to the Irish Sea.  As part of these ongoing discussions, UK authorities have advised my Department that they have identified no likely significant effects arising for Ireland from the planned new build programme.  I will continue in these efforts to ensure that the UK authorities are made aware of and address our concerns and take all possible steps to ensure that the highest levels of safety apply at Sellafield and any other new plants to be developed in the coming years.</P>
        <P>At the request of my Department, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) is conducting an independent assessment of possible impacts for Ireland from the UK&rsquo;s new nuclear build programme. This work is ongoing. Its initial timeframe was revised to account for the demands placed on the RPII&rsquo;s Nuclear Safety Directorate by the response and follow-up to the accident at the Fukushima nuclear facility in Japan in March 2011. It is now expected that the results of the assessment will be provided to my Department at the end of 2011.</P>

	<P>The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981.  The provision of fire services to the areas referred to in the Question is, therefore, a matter for Kerry County Council.</P>
        <P>By way of background, Kerry County Council&rsquo;s fire services are provided by a retained staffing system. Retained fire-fighters are employees of fire authorities, and are organised to provide a full professional fire service throughout the county, including for the communities referred to in the question.  The retained fires services are appropriately trained, equipped, supervised and operate to proper procedures.  The local station whose closure is referred to in the Question was a voluntary fire unit, which was outside the direct control of the fire authority.  The voluntary unit in question did not have the requisite training to attend and deal safely with a variety of incident types.  While it received some training, equipment and funding from the <Col N="1053"/>Council in the past, it did not report to and was not under the control of the Council&rsquo;s Fire Service.  I would like to emphasise that the most effective measure to protect the lives of persons in the communities referred to, as in all communities, is to ensure that each dwelling is fitted with proper smoke alarms.  I encourage all households in Kerry, as throughout the country, to ensure that this is the case.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Part 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provision) Act, 2009 provides for an incremental purchase scheme in respect of newly built houses reserved by housing authorities for the purpose. Regulations to implement the Incremental Purchase Scheme for new homes were made in June 2010.  The scheme is available to all housing authorities.  I am not aware of any completed purchases to date under the scheme and it is not appropriate to set targets for a scheme such as this which will be provided by housing authorities according to the specific opportunities and needs in their own areas.   It is acknowledged that the current economic climate, reduced demand for house purchase including purchase by local authority tenants, constraints on availability of credit to applicants and a scale back of new-build local authority houses have all combined to limit the potential of the scheme at present.  Capital funding is not needed by authorities as funding to purchase or build a housing unit designated for Incremental Purchase has generally already been provided by the Exchequer.</P>

	<P>I have established and am chairing the National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments to oversee implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments, together with the Government&rsquo;s response to the recommendations.  The Committee is meeting on a regular basis with the aim of publishing a report on progress achieved within the next 12 months.  In the meantime, work is ongoing on implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group and real progress is being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.</P>
        <P>To date, my Department has made allocations totalling some &euro;2.16 million to fifteen local authorities from the &euro;5 million funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues.  The types of works that have been approved include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting, and other works to secure sites.  My Department will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed.  Planning authorities are also making progress in securing the co-operation of developers, financial institutions and/or bond holders, thereby obviating the need to use Exchequer resources to fund such work.</P>
        <P>Developers and owners of unfinished housing developments (or their receivers, where appointed) have the primary legal obligation in addressing outstanding problems associated with these developments.  Any public funds expended under this provision should ultimately be recouped from the developer/receiver.  Estates which fall under the direct control of NAMA, or receivers appointed by NAMA, are being managed by them and as a consequence do not fall within this scheme.</P>
        <P>The recent national survey of Unfinished Housing Developments has identified that there are no serious health and safety issues on Phase 1 of Castlemoyne.  In relation to Phase 2 of this development the unbuilt areas have been fenced off.  Fingal County Council has not identified this estate as being Category 4 &mdash; the only category being considered for funding under the public safety initiative &mdash; and has therefore not received any funding.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The greater the degree of separation of different categories of waste by consumers and businesses, the easier it will be to reduce the proportion of our waste disposed of in landfill and to create the conditions for investment in much needed recovery and recycling infrastructure.  Waste presentation is largely determined by permit conditions and local by-laws.  The Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007 provide that a permitted waste collector must source-segregate, treat or recover a specified proportion of waste collected, or class or classes of such waste, in such manner as may be specified by the relevant local authority.  In <Col N="1055"/>2008, my Department instructed local authorities to provide, as a matter of urgency, for the implementation of source-segregated collection for organic waste in urban areas.</P>
        <P>The Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations 2009 require the segregation and recovery of food waste arising in the commercial sector.  A Regulatory Impact Assessment is currently underway in relation to the placing of an obligation on waste collectors to provide or arrange for the separate collection of household food waste and its diversion from disposal to recovery and recycling.  The increases to the landfill levy which became effective earlier this month are intended to provide an economic mechanism to encourage the segregation of waste.</P>
        <P>Performance has undoubtedly improved in recent years.  The National Waste Report 2009 states that in 2009 a 2-bin service was provided to 72% of serviced households and a 3-bin service was provided to a further 24% of serviced households.  However, notwithstanding the legal and policy framework, our improved performance and the likely impact of recent and anticipated changes, as a society we must do better.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government commits to the development of a coherent national waste policy, adhering to the waste hierarchy, which will aim to minimise waste disposal in landfill and maximise recovery. I am prioritising this commitment.  A public consultation in relation to the new national waste policy is under way; a discussion document has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website to help inform consideration.  The discussion document sets out a range of possible policy initiatives and issues for wider consideration, including in relation to the mandatory segregation of waste, and presents a real opportunity for interested parties to contribute to shaping a new national waste policy.  The consultation period closes on Friday 30 September.</P>

	<P>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  As with all local charges, the invoicing and collection of due amounts is a matter for the local authority concerned to manage in the light of prevailing local circumstances and in accordance with normal accountancy procedures.  I recognise that these are difficult economic times and I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration in my Department.</P>
        <P>The revenue base of local authorities was broadened in 2009 by the introduction in the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 of a &euro;200 charge on non-principal private residences.  The charge is payable in respect of private rented accommodation, holiday homes and other non-principal private residences.  As at 15 September, 2011, the non-principal private residence charge has raised &euro;69,821,880 in 2009, &euro;68,294,000 in 2010 and &euro;61,789,760 in respect of 2011.</P>
        <P>The EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland commits the Government to the introduction of a property tax for 2012.  The Programme reflects the need, in the context of the State&rsquo;s overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.  In light of the complex issues involved, a property tax, requiring a comprehensive property valuation system, would take time to introduce and accordingly, to meet the requirements in the EU/IMF Programme, the Government has decided to introduce a household charge in 2012.  The household charge is an interim measure and proposals for a full property tax will be considered by the Government in due course.  The charge will be set at &euro;100 and will apply to the majority of the households in the country, subject to a limited number of exemptions and waivers.  It is expected to raise some &euro;160 million and it is the intention that the revenues from the charge will support the provision of local services.  Legislation to underpin the household charge will be brought before the Oireachtas shortly.</P>
        <P>The information requested in respect of each local authority is set out in the following table.  2009 is the most recent year for which audited information is available.</P>

	<P>There are 36 Local Action Groups contracted, on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, to deliver the Rural Development Programme throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding.  Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with Departmental operating rules and EU regulations.  There is provision in the operating rules of the Rural Development Programme to allow an applicant if dissatisfied with the decision of a Local Action Group, to appeal that decision to the Regional Inspector.  The applicant in question appealed a decision made by South West Mayo Development Company not to support a grant application.  On foot of the appeal by the applicant a review was carried out and has been completed. The applicant was made aware of the findings of the appeal on the 29 June 2011.  Subsequently the applicant wrote to my Department requesting a review of the appeal decision.  This is currently under consideration.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 346 and 359 together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water.  The objective is to install water meters in households connected to public water supplies and move to a charging system based on usage above a free allowance.  My Department is currently preparing a strategy to implement these proposals, which will include estimates of the cost of metering and consideration of how the metering programme is to be funded and procured.  The Programme for Government also proposes the establishment of a new State-owned water company, Irish Water.  The Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the European Union and International Monetary Fund commits Ireland to undertaking an independent assessment of the establishment of a water utility.  Work on the independent assessment is underway.  The assessment will examine the optimal organisational structures for Irish Water and will also include recommendations on the functions to be assigned to the company (e.g. administration of billing and collection functions).</P>

	<P>The Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution (Houses of the Oireachtas) Bill 2011 is being sponsored by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Government has approved the establishment of a Referendum Commission in relation to the proposed amendment of the Constitution contained in this Bill.  Arising from that decision, I exercised the powers conferred on me under the Referendum Act 1998 to establish the Commission on 13 September 2011.  The task of the Commission is to explain the subject matter of the referendum proposals, to promote public awareness of the referendum and to encourage the electorate to vote at the poll.  Further information about the Referendum Commission can be found at <i>www.refcom.ie.</i></P>
        <P>The Government has also agreed that a statement for the information of voters at the forthcoming referendum should issue in accordance with section 23 of the Referendum Act 1994. This statement will be sent with the polling information card to every elector and issued separately to postal and special voters. It will be displayed in poster form in polling stations and it will also be available to presiding officers to assist blind and incapacitated voters and voters with literacy difficulties on polling day.  The required motions for resolutions of each House of the Oireachtas in relation to the Statement are being progressed in tandem with the passage of the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>My Department considers water conservation to be of paramount importance. The current Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas library, places a significant emphasis on water conservation, providing for network rehabilitation contracts with a total value of some &euro;321 million to commence in the period 2010-2012.</P>
        <P>In the aftermath of the severe weather in December 2010 and January 2011, my Department carried out a review of the local authority response.  The purpose of the review was to identify lessons learnt &mdash; what worked successfully and what needed improvement, so that organisations/agencies could consolidate and further enhance preparedness and the response process in the future.  Specifically, in relation to water services, local authorities have identified the contingency arrangements needed when a severe weather incident is predicted.  These include demand management measures to seek to reduce demand and replenish reservoirs during the period of freezing weather, mainly through pressure reductions and night-time restrictions and ensuring that staff are available throughout the thawing phase to manage pro<Col N="1062"/>duction, find and fix leaks, provide alternative supplies through tankers and standpipes and provide information through websites and other media outlets.  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management is currently drawing up a severe weather preparedness guidance document, which includes guidance on water issues.</P>

	<P>Local authorities have arrangements and applications in place which facilitate citizens in making complaints or suggestions or in reporting problems through various mediums, including by post, phone, text, fax, e-mail and on-line through their websites.  In the context of the commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department is working with local authorities in developing options for the enhancement of these arrangements which will further assist citizens in availing of local authority services and in reporting problems or faults to their local authority.  This has included engagement with the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association and bilateral discussions with South Dublin County Council who are now piloting a website <i>www.fixyourstreet.ie</i>, which allows members of the public notify non-emergency issues such as graffiti, road defects, street lighting, drainage, litter and illegal dumping.  Subject to successful piloting and any necessary adaptations, it can then be considered for extension to other local authorities.</P>

	<P>The audit of the accounts of all local authorities is required to be carried out by the independent Local Government Audit Service under the Local Government Act 2001.  I have no plans at present to alter this statutory arrangement.  The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which include adopting the annual budget and authorising borrowing, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.</P>
        <P>In order to enhance the financial management and audit control systems in local authorities, an audit committee, with both councillor and expert external membership, is now in place in each county and city council.   The functions of an audit committee are to review financial and budgetary reporting practices and procedures within a local authority, foster the development of best practice in the internal audit function, review auditors&rsquo; reports and special reports and assess follow-up action by management, assess and promote efficiency and value for money, review risk management systems and make such recommendations to the authority as the committee considers appropriate in respect of such matters.</P>
        <P>The Report of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group made a number of recommendations in relation to value for money and audit functions. In particular, it recommended that the Director of the Local Government Audit Service produce an annual report that takes <Col N="1063"/>a more strategic overview of financial management and audit issues across the local government sector, taking account of sectoral issues that emerge from the audit of individual local authorities.  The Group considered that this report would provide the opportunity for the Director to put before my Department key issues for attention and for the local government sector to address.  In addition, the Group recommended that this report should be sent to the relevant Oireachtas committee so that it can be discussed with the Director and relevant local government officials.  The Group considered that this approach would facilitate Oireachtas oversight of local expenditure of central funds, while at the same time recognising that expenditure by local authorities is a matter of separate local democratic accountability.  In accordance with this recommendation, the annual report of the Director of Audit of the Local Government Audit Service, covering local authority accounts for the year 2009, has been submitted to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>

	<P>The embargo on the filling of posts in local authorities was introduced on 24 March 2009 following a Government decision to implement savings measures across the wider public service.  My Department received a delegated sanction from the Department of Finance in August 2009 for implementation of this general moratorium on the filling of public sector posts across all local authorities.  This is on condition that the overall staffing levels in the sector are reduced by the end of 2013.  In this regard, local authorities have reduced numbers, in terms of whole time equivalent staff, by approximately 6,500 since June 2008.  The work carried out by departing staff has been absorbed by remaining staff delivering very significant savings in terms of sustainable remuneration costs.</P>
        <P>Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  In this regard, it is a matter for County and City managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the reduction in staff numbers is managed so that the appropriate service level is maintained.  Where vacancies arise, local authorities must consider all options for reorganisation and reallocation of work to meet requirements.  Any exceptions to this principle, which will arise in very limited circumstances, require sanction from this Department.  All staffing sanction requests are examined on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services and the need to further reduce overall staffing levels in the local authority sector.  In this regard, local authorities have an employment control framework numbers ceiling of 30,000 whole time equivalents for the end of  2013.  In June 2011, total local authority staff numbers were approximately 30,900.</P>
        <P>My Department works closely with local authorities to ensure key posts are filled.  In this regard, the majority of the sanctions granted are for the filling of posts in front line service areas such as water services, roads maintenance, housing, community and enterprise, fire and emergency services and in relation to capital projects.  In view of the financial position facing local authorities and the country as a whole, my Department and local authorities will continue <Col N="1064"/>to make every effort to ensure that further efficiencies and savings are attained by the sector while an appropriate level of service to the public is maintained.  In this context, while local authorities must comply with statutory obligations, including those outlined in the Disability Act 2005, all options for reorganisation and reallocation of work to meet the statutory requirements must be made.</P>

	<P>Harvested rainwater can potentially be used as an alternative source of water for various domestic purposes, e.g. supplying toilet cisterns, washing machines etc., and for various business and commercial operations.  Environmental and economic benefits can also accrue from reducing the demand for water abstraction at source and the subsequent and expensive treatment of raw water for human consumption.  Large-scale rainwater harvesting systems are already in use by some schools, factories and other buildings and are increasingly being incorporated into new developments.  Retrofitting a rainwater harvesting system in existing households could require the installation of an attic storage tank and the re-routing and upgrading of plumbing and, therefore, could be expensive.  Any plumbing system based on rainwater collection may contain traces of atmospheric and environmental pollutants, along with animal and bird faecal matter.  It is essential, therefore, that there is no cross-connection between any pipe, fitting or appliance carrying non-potable water and pipes carrying potable water in order to avoid potentially serious issues for public health and risk of cross-contamination of the public water supply.  It is essential that any installer is competent in safeguarding potable water supplies within a mixed pipe system and consumers installing such systems should be aware of the ongoing operational and maintenance requirements.</P>
        <P>My Department has funded two pilot projects undertaken by the Dublin Institute of Technology on behalf of the National Rural Water Services Committee.  The first pilot was carried out at two locations, a house in Ballinabrannagh, County Carlow and a farm at Clonalvey, County Meath.  The project concluded that rainwater harvesting is a sustainable water conservation measure but was inconclusive on economic grounds.  The report on the second pilot project, which was carried out in a school at Carrowholly in County Mayo, will be published shortly.  All findings and recommendations regarding the projects will then be assessed fully by my Department.  Earlier this month, I amended the Planning Regulations to facilitate rainwater harvesting in agricultural buildings.  This amendment inserted a new exemption which will allow a farmer to install rainwater collecting receptacles either below ground or at gable ends of sheds to gather rainwater which can then be used for cleaning, etc.  This provision should facilitate farmers to store and use free water for purposes other than watering their livestock, thereby saving money on their water bills as well as making optimal use of natural and renewable resources.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has advised that this water cannot be used for feeding livestock etc., unless it is properly treated.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented residential sector. My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 with a specific emphasis on whether it best supports the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions and whether legislative amendments would support the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector. The outcomes of the review were announced by my predecessor as Minister of State in April 2010, and the Government approved the preparation of the Heads of a Bill to deliver on the review&rsquo;s recommendations.  Full details in relation to the background of the review and the outcomes are available on my Department's website <i>www.environ.ie</i>.  The drafting of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2011 was approved by Government in July 2011.  The General Scheme of the Bill, <i>inter alia</i>, includes the introduction of fines where a landlord is found unjustifiably to have retained all or part of a tenant&rsquo;s security deposit, as a first step to eliminating the problem of deposit retention.  I am at present evaluating the Residential Tenancies Act review process recommendations and associated legislative proposals.  I have met with the PRTB which has engaged in some research as to the viability of a separate deposit retention scheme pursuant to its function, under section 151(1) of the Act, to provide advice to the Minister concerning policy in relation to the private rented sector.  On foot of that meeting, I have asked the PRTB to carry out further research on how best to address the issue of deposit retention.  This research will further inform my thinking on this matter.</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 353 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper which sets out my Department&rsquo;s general policy position in relation to rainwater harvesting and addresses certain operational issues arising in the use of these technologies.  Funding of &euro;427 million is available for allocation <Col N="1066"/>to qualifying projects up to the end of 2013 under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-13.  Some 36 Local Action Groups are contracted on my Department&rsquo;s behalf to deliver the RDP throughout the country.  These groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding.  Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with departmental operating rules and EU regulations.  There is scope for funding water harvesting facilities under the conservation measure of the rural development programme which is subject to a range of eligibility criteria.  Funding cannot be made available to public bodies under the RDP.  However, it may be possible to consider funding applications in respect of initiatives that are organised, managed and led at community level.

        <P FLI="0">A number of different statutory processes are involved in appointments to State boards.  In some cases, statutory selection procedures must be followed or nominations must be sought from independent nominating panels before appointments are made by the Government or by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In other cases, only particular public office holders may be appointed to certain boards.  In a number of situations, only some appointments to the body concerned are made by the Minister, or appointments are made with the consent of the Minister for Finance or following consultation with the Minister for Finance or Minister for Education and Skills, as appropriate.  The boards of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Environmental Protection Agency are executive in nature and the members/directors hold full-time salaried positions.  The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency (Housing Agency) and the National Buildings Agency (NBA) are served by a single interim board which was established by the Department until such time as the Housing Agency is established as a legal entity and the NBA is closed down.</P>
        <P>In that context, it is expected that a new board will be established for the Housing Agency early in 2012.  A process is in place to merge the Local Government Management Services and Computer Services Boards into the Local Government Management Agency.  The membership of both boards has been standardised to enable them to act as one in advance of the required legislation.  Pobal operates under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Pobal is a private company limited by guarantee.  It is not a State agency and the Department does not appoint members to its Board.  As provided for by Government Decision S28081 of 2 November 2005, the members are appointed by the Government on nomination by the key stakeholders.  Generally, Board appointments are made on an annual basis on the normal rotation of Board members as prescribed by the Company&rsquo;s Articles of Association.</P>

Provisions governing mortgage lending by local authorities are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009 and associated credit policy.  To ensure effective targeting of resources, loan finance continues to be available to first-time buyers only.  Income limits are also in place, distinguishing between single and dual income households and a maximum loan limit is applied.  In assessing loan applications, local authorities take account of the household&rsquo;s ability to finance the loan based on their net household income.  While, as a general rule, the credit policy provides that loans are not available to those in receipt of unemployment or social welfare benefits, an exception may be made where there is a primary income of a permanent waged or salaried nature, and where the secondary income is from the Department of Social Protection.  In such cases, long-term social welfare payments can be considered, provided the long-term nature of the payment is confirmed.  The final decision on whether to grant or refuse an applicant lies solely with the relevant local authority.  All local authorities must satisfy themselves on the financial risk they are undertaking.  These provisions apply for purposes of mortgage lending by all local authorities.</P>

	<P>My Department, along with the Office of the Attorney General, is finalising the preparation of a Bill to establish a system of inspection of septic tanks and other on-site systems.  This is necessary to comply with a European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland in October 2009.  I expect to bring the Bill to the Government in the coming weeks to seek approval for its publication.  Full details of how the inspection system will operate will be announced at the time.  I can confirm that the new legislation will require householders to register details of their on-site systems on a national register and a modest fee will be charged for registration.  As I indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 1 and 2 of 15 September, a registration fee of no more than &euro;50 is envisaged.  The revenue generated from the registration fee will be used to implement a proportionate and risk-based approach to inspections.  It is intended that inspections will be targeted to areas where drinking water sources or habitats are likely to be, or have been, affected by septic tank discharges.  The inspections will be carried out in accordance with a national inspection plan which will be developed by the EPA.  The implementation of the national inspection plan will be managed by the local authorities and there will be no charge to householders for inspections.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Information on tyre flows and the management of waste tyres has long been regarded as inadequate.  The Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyres) Regulations 2007 were designed to <Col N="1069"/>tackle this deficit and put in place a proper regulatory framework.  These regulations facilitate the comparison of quantities of waste tyres arising with the amounts placed on the market and the tracking of the movement of waste tyres from their discarding until they are either reused or processed for recycling.  The Regulations impose obligations on persons who supply tyres to the Irish market, whether as producers (e.g. manufacturers, importers including wholesalers, traders and retailers who source tyres outside the State), or suppliers (e.g. wholesalers, traders and retailers who source tyres exclusively within the State), and on the collectors of waste tyres.  Economic operators have the option of either self-complying with the regulations or participating in an approved industry compliance scheme which takes on the administrative burden associated with self-compliance.  Self-complying economic operators are required to register with local authorities and submit information on tyre and waste tyre flows in each quarterly period to the relevant local authorities.  Participants in an approved collective compliance scheme must also submit information on tyre and waste tyre flows in each quarterly period to the scheme concerned.  I have approved two collective compliance schemes, Tyre Recovery Activity Compliance Scheme Ltd. (TRACS) and Tyre Waste Management Ltd. (TWM) to operate as approved bodies under the regulations.  The Programme for Government makes a commitment to drive a waste reduction programme through the extension of Producer Responsibility initiatives and, in that context, my Department will shortly be conducting a review of all aspects of the producer responsibility schemes.  The results of this review will help determine whether TRACS and TWM have been operating satisfactorily.  It will also assist in determining whether a system that tracks products from the time they are placed on the market until they reach end of life is effective in keeping waste tyres out of the reach of unauthorised operators, or whether it would be more effective to require producers to take direct responsibility for the environmentally sound management of waste tyres.</P>

        <P>While the specific information sought by the Deputy is not maintained at ports of entry by the Garda National Immigration Bureau at this stage, I am committed, as I stated at the launch of the programme, to carry out a review of its operations.

	<P>In the absence of further details on the person&rsquo;s situation, it is difficult to address the question in any specific manner. However, in general,  the onus is on the individual who requires permission to remain in the State to keep this permission up-to-date at all times.  If a person is required to have the permission of the Minister to remain in the State and he/she does not obtain or renew that permission as applicable, that person is staying in the State illegally, is in breach of Irish Immigration law and may ultimately be subject to deportation proceedings.</P>
        <P>By  virtue of section 4(9) of the Immigration Act 2004, it is an offence for a foreign national not to comply with any conditions attached to his or her permission to be in the State including a condition as to duration of stay. A person guilty of such an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. Non-EEA nationals whose stay exceeds 3 months are required to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>
        <P>Section 4(3) of the Immigration Act, 2004 sets out the grounds on which an immigration officer may, on behalf of the Minister refuse to give a person permission to enter the State.</P>
        <P>An Immigration Officer may, on behalf of the Minister, attach to a permission under section 4 of the Immigration Act, 2004 such conditions as to duration of stay and engagement in employment, business or a profession in the State or amend such conditions, as he or she may think fit. In performing these functions, the Immigration Officer shall, pursuant to section 4(10) <Col N="1072"/>of the Act of 2004, have regard to all the circumstances of the non-national concerned known to the Officer or represented to the Officer by him or her and, in particular, to matters including the following:</P>

        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the intended duration of the stay in the State,</P>

	<P>On 2nd March, 2011, the person concerned, through his legal representative, made an application for the renewal of his permission to remain in the State on the basis of his marriage to an Irish national. Following consideration of this application, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 28th July, 2011, that his application was refused for reasons set out in that letter.  That letter also informed the person concerned that, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should not have a Deportation Order made against him.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned. In advance of a final decision being made, the case of the person concerned will be examined to determine what, if any, impact the recent European Court of Justice Judgment in the Zambrano case may have on his case.</P>

Its purpose was to provide a forum where migrants could speak direct to the Minister of State regarding their experiences of integration in Ireland and thereby promote better-informed policy making by identifying any issues and bringing them to attention.</P>
        <P>The Council is organised in regional formation and an inaugural meeting of each regional forum &mdash; Dublin, Rest of Leinster, Munster and Connacht/Ulster &mdash; was held in 2010.

	<P>The Deputy may be aware that Irish charities may take a number of legal forms.  For example, many charities are companies limited by guarantee while other charities are trusts.  They are, therefore, governed by the relevant legislative or other provisions governing such entities.  Incorporated charities, for example, are subject to the provisions of company law and thus eligibility for becoming a director of such a charity would be subject to the provisions of Irish company law, and particularly Part VII of the Companies Act 1990. In the case of charitable trusts, trusteeship would be subject to the general provisions of trust law, though most of the precedents for disqualification have actually developed in case law. For example, it has been held that unsoundness of mind, bankruptcy, or conviction for a dishonest crime, should disqualify a trustee.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that responsibility for the Charities Act transferred to my Department in May 2011. This Act contains provisions relating to eligibility for trusteeship. Given the likely costs involved,I am considering the potential for full commencement of this Act in the context of the review of expenditure currently being undertaken in my Department.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Deputy is particularly interested in the interaction between charities and children. In this context, organisations would generally adhere to the standards contained in &ldquo;Children First&rdquo;, which was launched in July 2011 by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.Under these guidelines, &ldquo;<i>every organisation, both public and private, that is providing services for children or that is in regular direct contact with children should ensure best practice in the recruitment of staff or volunteers, which includes Garda vetting, taking up of references, good HR practices in interviewing, induction training, probation and ongoing supervision and management&rdquo;.</i></P><Col N="1076"/>
        <P>Finally, in July 2011, I obtained Government approval for a draft scheme of a &ldquo;National Vetting Bureau Bill 2011&rdquo;. This will place the vetting of persons working with children or vulnerable adults on a statutory basis . It seeks to provide an appropriate balance between the need to disclose such information in the public interest, and in the interest of protecting children or vulnerable adults, while also providing appropriate safeguards to recognise the rights of persons who are the subject of such disclosures. The scheme also provides a statutory framework for vetting procedures provided by the Garda&iacute; arising from a range of other enactments. It is hoped to publish the Bill in the fourth quarter of 2011.</P>

	<P>I would draw the attention of the Deputy to provisions contained in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010. Section 127 of the Bill sets out the obligations on carriers in relation to the provision of information in relation to persons travelling to or from the State and the uses to which that data can be put; including for law enforcement purposes. The information collected may be shared with a number of Departments and agencies in specified circumstances including the Minister for Social Protection where it relates to a person of concern who has committed or is suspected of committing an offence under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
        <P>One of the outcomes when this provision of the Bill is commenced is that it will allow us to meet the requirements of the Council Directive 2004/82/EC of 29 April, 2004 on the obligation of carriers to communicate passenger data. However, as an interim measure in advance of enactment of the Bill, I am actively considering transposing the above Directive by way of Regulation under the European Communities Act, 1972. This would facilitate the collection of passenger data by carriers on flights originating from outside the territory of the EU Member States and its transmission to the Irish immigration authorities for the purposes of combating illegal immigration and improving border control.</P>
        <P>I should also add that section 8 of the Data Protection Act 1988 (as amended by the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003) provides that restrictions in the Act on the processing of personal data do not apply if the processing is required for the purposes of preventing, detecting or investigating offences or prosecuting offenders in any case in which the application of those restrictions would be likely to prejudice the exercise of those functions.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 provides that certain &ldquo;designated matters&rdquo; are excluded from the scope of civil legal aid. Defamation is one of these matters and thus legal advice or legal aid is not generally available on foot of the legal aid scheme. There are some very limited exceptions to this. On foot of the EU Directive on cross border legal aid the Legal Aid Board is required to take into account the nature of the case where the applicant is claiming damages to his or her reputation. The Board may therefore grant applications for legal aid in relation to defamation, where the applicant is domiciled or habitually resident in another Member State. The Board has however received little or no such applications in recent years.</P>
        <P>The Board has previously been asked for its views in relation to the inclusion of defamation within the scope of civil legal aid. It took no particular view. In its comments on the Civil Legal Aid Bill 1995 (now the Act), the Board did not express an opinion on the matter.  It has not been formally considered by the Board since that time.</P>
        <P>The matter was the subject of discussions with my Department in 2006 following the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the Steel &amp; Morris v United Kingdom (&ldquo;McLibel&rdquo; case), when the Board suggested that the continued exclusion of defamation might leave the State open to challenge for not providing for the possibility of the provision of legal aid in such cases.</P>
        <P>While there is only basic research to hand on the availability of legal aid for defamation cases in other jurisdictions it would appear that it is not available, or is available only in very limited circumstances in England / Wales, Scotland, New South Wales and South Australia. The only country where it appears that it is more readily available for defamation cases is New Zealand.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Board&rsquo;s services are under considerable pressure at the moment due to increased demand for its services which has resulted in longer waiting times for a first appointment with a solicitor for many applicants. Bringing another area of law within the scope of civil legal aid is likely add to those pressures.</P>

        <P>In 2011 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in their Annual Policing Plan, identified trafficking in human beings as one of their priorities and have conducted a number of operations to combat human trafficking, including child trafficking, and will continue to do so in line with intelligence available to them.</P>

	<P>In 2010, the Swedish government completed an evaluation of its 1999 legislation criminalising the purchase of sexual services. Following its publication, the Dignity Project arranged a visit to Stockholm to learn more about the evaluation. The delegation included representation from my Department.  The Dignity Project was a research project funded by the EU. An inter-agency and inter-jurisdictional initiative led by the Dublin Employment Pact and the Immigrant Council of Ireland, it examined services provided to victims of human trafficking with a view to replicating best practice models in partner countries.  My Department&rsquo;s Anti-Human Trafficking Unit and the Garda National Immigration Bureau were partners with observer status.</P><Col N="1081"/>
        <P>In this jurisdiction, it is not an offence to sell sex. In general, it is not an offence to purchase sex either. Consequently, neither party to the transaction is currently criminalised. Any proposal to amend the law in terms of criminalising the purchase of sex would therefore, require very careful examination.</P>
        <P>Our legislative approach to prostitution is based on protecting society from the more intrusive aspects of such activity from a public order perspective, while also seeking to protect prostitutes from exploitation. Accordingly, it is an offence to solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution. The offence can be committed by the prostitute, the client or a third party &mdash; a pimp, for example. It is also an offence to organise prostitution, coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute, knowingly live on the earnings of a prostitute, or keep or manage a brothel.  In addition, our 2008 human trafficking legislation made it an offence to knowingly solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, for the purpose of prostitution.</P>
        <P>I am examining a report prepared by my department following the visit to Stockholm and which was submitted to the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office. I am also examining the Attorney&rsquo;s advices concerning the legal and constitutional implications of introducing a ban on the purchase of sex.</P>

It is not known how many Garda&iacute; stationed in the Kerry Division will retire in the coming years.

        <P>Responsibility for the allocation of resources, including personnel, within the Force rests with the Garda Commissioner, in consultation with his senior management team.  In this context, it must be recognised that, under plans agreed by the last Government as part of their compliance with the terms of the EU/IMF agreement, Garda numbers are due to be reduced to 13,000.  As part of this process, the Commissioner will of course have to examine every option for increased efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of services.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the average processing time for vetting applications received at the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) is approximately 10 weeks. I appreciate that it is important to process these applications in as timely a manner as possible and that the length of time currently being taken is a matter of concern which I am determined to address.</P>
        <P>A number of immediate steps are being taken to improve the situation.  The sanction of the Department of Finance has been obtained to retain the services of ten temporary employees in the GCVU.  A further ten temporary employees have recently commenced work in the GCVU.  Other measures aimed at improving turnaround times are also under consideration. All of this should have a positive impact on processing times.</P>
        <P>I should mention that, in processing an individual vetting application, additional time may be required in cases where clarification is needed as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  It should be understood that while the Garda&iacute; make every effort to reduce the time to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out what are very necessary checks, there will always be a reasonably significant period required to process a vetting application and registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection processes.  In addition, the average processing time for vetting applications also fluctuates in line with periods of increased demand.</P>
        <P>The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives from around 188,000 in 2007 to almost 292,000 in 2010.  At present, there are approximately 55,000 applications in the course of being processed.<b> </b> I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that at present there is a total of five Garda&iacute;, 76 full-time Garda civilian personnel and twenty temporary civilian personnel assigned to the GCVU.  This represents a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development in Garda vetting began in 2005.</P>

A high level of confidentiality is essential to protect the individuals involved and the operation of the protection measures in place.</P>

	<P>The Criminal Assets Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime since its inception in 1996.  The Bureau was established with a statutory remit of identifying and depriving persons of the proceeds of criminal activity.  The Bureau is being actively utilised to target assets accumulated by criminal gangs. Furthermore, a strategic partnership has been established between the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau in identifying common targets who are then pursued through intelligence-led investigations, in order to maximise the response of law enforcement to organised crime gangs. </P>
        <P>In recent years the Bureau has targeted the proceeds of crime of more middle and lower ranking criminals.  A significant resource in this regard is the Divisional Asset Profilers Programme. Under this programme 167 asset profilers have been trained to date to assist the Bureau in targeting the assets of well known criminals, including drug dealers, in local communities, by supplying them with local knowledge.  Asset Profilers are now based in every Garda Division in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Garda Authorities that the Criminal Assets Bureau currently has sufficient financial and other resources to continue to operate effectively, pursuant to its statutory remit.</P>

	<P>Tackling serious crime including drug trafficking remains a key ongoing priority both for the Government and for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda Policing Plan for 2011 reflects this priority with one of its key actions being the proactive targeting by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of drug trafficking.</P>
        <P>In implementing this action a multi-agency law enforcement approach is used, whereby Garda National Units from the National Support Service work together to target those involved in the trafficking, importation, sale and supply of illegal drugs.  To further enhance this approach a strategic partnership has been established between the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau in identifying common targets who are then pursued through intelligence-led investigations, in order to maximise the response of law enforcement to organised crime gangs.</P>
        <P>This multi-agency approach is supported by a number of further strategies targeting drug dealing including, for example,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />The operation of dedicated Divisional and District Drug Units.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Continued cooperation with the Revenue Commissioners (Customs &amp; Excise) under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding in the pro-active investigation of persons suspected of being involved in international drug-trafficking.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Strong and strategic partnerships in place at international level targeting drug trafficking.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Our drug law enforcement efforts are underpinned by a significant body of criminal law targeting organised crime. As I have indicated to the House it is my intention to keep under <Col N="1089"/>review the question of whether any further improvements could be made to the overall legislative framework in this area to render it more effective.  In addition, in accordance with the commitments contained in the Programme for Government it is my intention, in due course, to bring forward legislative proposals which will serve to strengthen the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau in relation to forfeiting the proceeds of crime.</P>

	<P>Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 makes it an offence to harm or threaten, menace or in any other way intimidate or put in fear a person who is assisting in the investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of an offence or a witness or potential witness or a juror or potential juror in proceedings for an offence or a member of his or her family, intending to obstruct, pervert or interfere with an investigation or the course of justice.  The original penalty provided for in the 1999 Act upon being found guilty under this section was 10 years.  In view of the gravity with which this type of criminal activity is viewed, the penalty was increased to 15 years by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that separate records are not maintained of offences under section 41 as between those directed against witnesses and those directed against jurors.  Accordingly, the information available from the Garda&iacute; covers both categories of individuals. The Deputy will appreciate that, of their nature, instances of intimidation of jurors are less likely to come to notice than instances of witness intimidation.  The Garda&iacute; rigorously enforce the provisions of the law relating to witness and jury intimidation and, of course, will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>The following table shows the position with regard to the number of proceedings commenced for offences under Section 41 of the 1999 Act for the period from 2008 to 15 September 2011.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will see from the Government Legislative Programme for the Autumn 2011 Session that a new Gambling Bill is being prepared.  It will provide for the licensing of online services as part of a major reform of the gambling laws.  The collection of taxes in this area, as in all others. is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. However, I think their task will be eased when all operators are licensed, as will be the case under the new legislation.</P>
        <P>In this legislation I aim to provide a well regulated system that is fair and transparent and that fosters safe and socially responsible gambling. Such an outcome would enhance our reputation. I&rsquo;m sure large operators looking for a place to invest would be attracted by the system I aim to achieve.

They are part of on-going legal processes in the Channel Islands (Alderney) following the decision by the AGCC to suspend the gaming licence for the company concerned. Legal proceedings are also underway in the USA. I am keeping in touch with developments, but, in light of the on-going legal processes, it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this stage. I understand when the hearings resumed yesterday, they were held <i>in camera</i>.</P>
        <P>I hope to have an opportunity later this year to meet with the Minister from the Channel Islands with responsibility for the regulation of gambling, for a wide ranging discussion.  I am, of course, aware of the subsidiary based here and I regret that, in the case of some of its employees, there is some uncertainty at present about their continued employment.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware from the Government Legislative Programme for the Autumn 2011 Session that a new Gambling Bill is being prepared.  I can confirm that it will provide for the licensing of online services as part of a major reform of the gambling laws.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 424 and 427 together.</P>
        <P>On 16 May 2011 I wrote to the Chairman of the Irish Red Cross Society regarding corporate governance, with particular reference to turnover and rotation at leadership levels in the Society.  I did so as I am of the opinion that it is not conducive to good corporate governance that any individual should serve indefinitely on the Central Council or the Executive Committee, or in the same appointment.</P>
        <P>The Chairman, in his response, advised me that the issue of turnover and rotation at leadership levels was raised by him at a subsequent Central Council meeting and that agreement was reached on a mandatory three-year break, or one full-term break, for Executive Committee members in circumstances where a member may have previously served for two full terms.</P>
        <P>I subsequently met with the Chairman and the Secretary General of the Society.  The matters raised in my letter of last May were discussed and the progress that the Society has made in relation to governance reform was outlined. I offered my support to the Chairman and the Secretary General in their efforts and I anticipate that further progress in this regard will be made in the coming months.</P>

	<P>The bodies under the aegis of my Department are the Civil Defence Board, the Army Pensions Board and the Board of Coiste an Asgard.  The Civil Defence Board was established in 2003 under the Civil Defence Act 2002. The Act provides that the Board shall consist of at least eight but not more than fourteen members who shall be appointed by the Minister for Defence. The current Board was appointed by the Minister for Defence from 11 July 2011 for a three year term.  </P>
        <P>The Government has recently approved a proposal to begin drafting legislation to transfer the functions of the Civil Defence Board back into the Department of Defence. This decision is in line with Government policy to bring the functions of many State agencies back into their parent Department. The proposed Bill will, if enacted, repeal the Civil Defence Act, 2002, dissolve the Civil Defence Board and transfer its functions, property, rights, liabilities and other responsibilities to the Department of Defence. Such changes will not have any impact on Civil Defence operations nationally.</P>
        <P>The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927.  Since its establishment, the Board has been made up of a chairman and two ordinary members.  The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps.  The chairman and the non-Military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence.</P>
        <P>There is no specified period of appointment to the Army Pensions Board.</P>
        <P>In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers <Col N="1094"/>and Expenditure. As a result, no funding was provided in 2010 or 2011. No appointments have been made since that decision was taken and the Board will be dissolved shortly.</P>

	<P>Allocations of milk quota from the National Reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations from the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal.  The Tribunal examines and makes recommendations on applications for additional quota from individual producers.  </P>
        <P>There is no fixed allocation to successful applicants. The amount of milk quota available for distribution through the scheme each year is limited, and particularly so in the years in which demand increases due to a greater probability of the national milk deliveries exceeding the country&rsquo;s quota.</P>
        <P>On the basis of the information supplied by the named person, the Tribunal recommended an allocation of 3,000 litres. This recommendation has now been approved and notification has issued to the named person and his Co-op.</P>

My Department is currently making arrangements to process outstanding payments to farmers of the 25% due in respect of 2010 in the cases where penalties were incurred and I expect payments to commence in these cases in October.</P>

	<P>The person named has been approved into the AEOS scheme with effect from 1 September 2010.  Under the EU Regulations governing the Agri-Environment Options Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed on all applications before any approvals can issue.  In addition, as part of the checks required under EU regulations, the person named was randomly selected for inspection.  As part of this process Record Sheets documenting details of actions undertaken under AEOS must be inspected and authorised by the Department&rsquo;s inspector.  My Department has been in contact with the person named in relation to aspects of his claim and once a response is received the application will be further processed.</P>

	<P>On Thursday 8 September 2011, I signed into law the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Agriculture) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 456 of 2011) to address the findings of the European Court of Justice against Ireland in the manner that the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive (85/337/EEC), as amended, was transposed into Irish law. </P>
        <P>The Court found that Ireland was over-reliant on size thresholds and did not take other relevant criteria, such as the cumulative impacts of development, the location of the development or activity relative to sensitive sites etc, into account.  The Regulations relate to three categories of projects &mdash; restructuring of rural land holdings, the use of uncultivated land or semi-natural areas for intensive agriculture, and land drainage works on lands used for agriculture</P>
        <P>The Regulations will be underpinned by a comprehensive guidance document.  To facilitate consultation, the draft guidance document will be available on the Department&rsquo;s website from <Col N="1098"/>today and will invite relevant stakeholders to comment on this guidance during a consultation period of four weeks which will close on Friday the 21 October.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Foal Levy Scheme was introduced in 2000 on a statutory basis, the Horse and Greyhound Racing (Betting Charges and Levies) Act, 1999, refers.  The Levy is payable by all breeders whose thoroughbred foals are born and registered in Ireland.  The scheme is administered by Horse Racing Ireland, the State body with responsibility for the thoroughbred sector. </P>
        <P>The proceeds of the levy are used by Horse Racing Ireland to help fund the Irish Equine Centre, the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association and Irish Thoroughbred Marketing.  These organisations provide key support structures to the Irish thoroughbred breeding industry.  The rate of the levy is calculated by reference to the advertised value of the nomination fee of the stallion in accordance with the provisions of the Thoroughbred Foal Levy Regulations, 2007, S.I. No. 853 of 2007.  There are six levy rate bands.  The setting of the rates of the levy and the distribution of the funds is decided by the Board of Horse Racing Ireland based on the advice of its Foal Levy Committee which includes representatives of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders&rsquo; Association (ITBA) and the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association (IFA).</P>
        <P>Given that it is the function of Horse Racing Ireland to submit proposals relating to the Foal Levy Scheme to me for approval I suggest that it would be appropriate for you to raise this matter with Horse Racing Ireland in the first instance.  I understand Horse Racing Ireland is currently undertaking a review of the scheme and any changes ultimately proposed will have to be submitted to me for consent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The report &lsquo;Supporting Child Contact: the Need for Child Contact Centres in Ireland&rsquo; prepared by One Family Organisation addressed the need for a service of this type to be established in the context of a wider <Col N="1101"/>discussion on social, health and justice related services in Ireland.  My Department agreed to facilitate and coordinate the implementation of one of the reports key recommendations which was to establish a pilot child contact centre project with the aim of testing different models of provision, drawing on international experience.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform you that preparations for the pilot project (which is to be operated by Barnardos) are at an advanced stage and that funding is to be provided jointly by my Department along with the HSE, Family Support Agency and Ballymun Regeneration.  An initial progress report has been received and Barnardos have indicated that the project is due to commence at the end of October 2011.  A single contact centre will be located on the North and South City respectively with the client base drawn from the catchment areas of the North and South Dublin City Health offices.  Details of the exact locations will be announced and publicised once formal leases and letting arrangements have been finalised.</P>
        <P>It is important to state that this project as with any pilot is partly a learning exercise and that precise details relating to mode and methodologies for referral etc will be finalised at a later stage however it is anticipated that referrals will eventually come from both Social Care Professionals and/or the Courts system.  Both the systems of referral and the exact nature of services provided may change and evolve as the centres begin operating on a practical basis.</P>
        <P>The report also recommended that an appropriate monitoring mechanism needs to be put in place to evaluate the pilot project and to help guide decisions on further provision.  The funders for this project will be mainly focused for now on ensuring that the maximum amount of existing funding allocations are maintained given the very tight fiscal situation at the present time.  Arrangements to put in place appropriate monitoring and evaluation will be discussed at a later stage as the energies of those involved are now concentrated on getting the centres open and the pilot service up and running.</P>

The Heads of the Bill are currently being drafted, in consultation with the Adoption Authority.  The aim is to provide for a structured and regulated way of providing access to information and contact for those affected by adoption.  This is a complex area involving the balancing of rights and as such must be dealt with in a careful manner. I intend to take this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.</P>

	<P>There are 107 family resource centres throughout the country funded by the Family Support Agency.  The aim of the Family Resource Centres Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit.  The programme emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.  In 2011, funding of &euro;15.897m has been provided to the Family Support Agency for the programme.</P>
        <P>The family resource centres provide a range of services for families and groups at local level.  These include information, education and training opportunities, childcare, breakfast, homework and after school clubs and youth work services.  The family resource centres have an important role to play, in harnessing local community efforts, in support of improved outcomes for children and young people which is a key objective of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  My department is not engaged in discussions regarding local authorities or local partnerships taking over the Family Resource Centres Programme.  Plans for the future development of the Family Resource Centres Programme will be formulated in the context of the arrangements for the new Child and Family Support Services Agency and in consultation with the Family Support Agency and the family resource centres themselves.</P>

	<P>Youth Homelessness has been identified as a priority for 2011.  My Department met with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and service providers at the end of May, to assess and review the current demand for services, the progress made to date under the Youth Homelessness Strategy 2001 and the need to address any outstanding service deficits.  Work will commence shortly on a high level review of the 2001 strategy.  This review will form the basis for the development of a framework to address youth homelessness over the next 5 years. </P>

	<P>My Department, in conjunction with other organisations and Government Departments, is involved in a number of programmes that encourage the adoption of healthy lifestyles.  We also have healthy eating guidelines specifically targeted at children, one for children in preschools and another for primary school children.  In parallel, the Health Service Executive is involved in many programmes to help prevent obesity.  Earlier this year I set up a Special Action Group on Obesity, comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Health Service Executive, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and Safefood to examine and progress a number of issues to address the problem of obesity, including nutritional labelling, calorie posting on restaurant menus, restrictions on the marketing to children and the treatment of obesity.  The Group will liaise with other Departments and organisations as required.</P>

	<P>The facility referred to by the Deputy is not a public facility, it is a voluntary facility which has a service level agreement with the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2009. </P>
        <P>The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires all private nursing homes and voluntary nursing homes which previously received funding under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004 to negotiate and agree a price for the cost of care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to participate in the scheme. This is a necessary feature of the scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person&rsquo;s contribution.</P>
        <P>The NTPF has statutory responsibility for the negotiation of prices with private and voluntary nursing homes. The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process. This method of negotiation is necessary in order to ensure <Col N="1108"/>that the State obtains the best value for each individual in a nursing home and to comply with competition law.</P>
        <P>The HSE is continuing to engage with the Board of Management of the facility to support the process of decision making with regard to the future of the service.  The HSE will support whatever decision the Board of Management makes and hopes to work closely with it to provide services in the area into the future in a sustainable manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Employment Control Framework for the Health Sector, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has discretion to make exceptions to the general moratorium on recruitment in the public service in order to maintain essential services. Such exceptions must of necessity be kept to a minimum so that the targeted employment reductions and consequential payroll savings are met. The Framework also provides that certain posts are exempted from the moratorium, such as social workers, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and medical consultants. </P>
        <P>Recently, the HSE made the decision to pause recruitment due to its serious budgetary situation. Notwithstanding this pause, exceptions are still being made to address critical service risk.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) introduced new arrangements for contracting agency staff on 14 March 2011. The new contract for agency staff is part of the approved service plan for 2011 and was intended to deliver cost savings in 2011. However, I have been informed by the HSE that given its current financial situation, there are limitations on the use of agency staff and every effort is being made to make the best use of internal resources. The HSE has further advised that there is also a protocol in place which allows for internal part time staff to increase their hours on a temporary basis to deal with urgent service needs.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Teach T&eacute;armainn is on the point of completing a major new capital development in Kildare.

The application includes a request for approximately &euro;440,000 to be allocated on a recurring basis to cover the full year costs of operating the refuge.</P>
        <P>The HSE reiterated its support for the project at that time.  However, this new development was not included in the funding allocation for 2011 and, unfortunately, given the current financial position the HSE has no additional funds for allocation this year.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government provides for the VHI to remain in State ownership in order to provide a publicly-owned health insurance option when the new system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI) is introduced.  As part of preparations for the introduction of UHI, I have consistently voiced my concerns about the dominance of the VHI in the private health insurance market and my intention to take action to address this.  Earlier this year I appointed a consortium consisting of Goodbody Stockbrokers and Matheson Ormsby Prentice Solicitors to undertake a review of options for rebalancing the private health insurance market.  The project has been completed and I am currently considering the consortium&rsquo;s report before deciding on next steps.  </P>
        <P>I am also very conscious of an imminent ruling by the European Court of Justice which will be announced by the Court on 29 September 2011.  The case relates to the VHI derogation under the Third Non-Life Insurance Directive, which exempts VHI from the requirement to be authorised as an insurer by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The ruling of the Court will have implications for the future status of the VHI and my Department has been working for some time on measures to prepare for the outcome, whatever that may be.  I plan to discuss the matter with my colleagues in Government shortly and I will make a further statement once the ruling of the Court is known.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 500 and 501 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health Service Executive has stated that 345,806 persons over-70-years now hold medical cards and that 224 hold GP Visit cards.</P><Col N="1115"/>
        <P>The Executive estimates that approximately 72,000 card holders in the over 70 age group are reviewed each year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Data on the number of medical cards withdrawn on a yearly basis is not routinely collected by the Executive.  The HSE does not disaggregate the cost of reviewing the over 70s scheme from the cost of other services provided by the Primary Care Reimbursement Services (PCRS).  Schemes managed by PCRS currently include the over 70s Medical Card Scheme and the under 70s Medical Card Scheme; Drugs Payment Scheme; High Tech Drugs Scheme; Long Term Illness Scheme and payments to doctors, pharmacists, dentists and opticians contracted to provide these services.</P>
        <P>The Executive has simplified the review/renewal process for over 70s medical cards where there has been no change in circumstances.  In other circumstances, the case is reviewed in the normal way.  However, the review process is an important quality assurance aspect of the management of the GMS.  For this reason the HSE does not intend to abolish the review process for those persons whose circumstances have changed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) was published in June of this year is report has not made any findings of negative health or environmental effects concerning fluoridation of water.</P>
        <P>The SCHER Report states that a narrow margin exists in children between achieving the beneficial effects of fluoride in reducing dental decay and the potential adverse effect of dental fluorosis is true regardless of the source of fluoride, whether from water fluoridation or other sources, such as ingested toothpaste.  It should be noted that dental fluorosis is a cosmetic or aesthetic condition which refers to the way teeth look and is generally easy to treat.  It is in contrast to the treatment of tooth decay which may on occasion involve the use of general anaesthesia and hospitalisation.</P>
        <P>The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups.  There are no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.</P>

Funding for the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces in 2012 will be determined in the context of the Estimates process, taking account of the need to protect front line services as far as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 509 and 519 together.</P>
        <P>The processing of approvals for financial support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme was suspended for a month from May to June while an examination of funding was being carried out.  However, the HSE has been issuing funding approvals again since the 13th June. Almost 1,700 people have been allocated funding since that date.  The HSE is continuing to process applications within the funding limits available to the scheme and in accordance with the legislation.</P>
        <P>The HSE intends to deal with those currently awaiting approval within the next month. This week, a further 900 funding approvals will be issued to applicants.</P>
        <P>By the end of the year, the HSE intends that any delays in awarding funding will be eliminated.  The situation will be closely monitored to ensure that funding is allocated as soon as it becomes available. It is anticipated that any delays will be resolved in the final quarter of 2011.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>HSE services for people with eating disorders are embedded in the Community Mental Health Service and with Primary Care.  Individuals with eating disorders frequently present to the primary care practitioner with complications of their condition and early intervention at this level greatly improves outcomes.  The HSE has developed a Mental Health in Primary Care accredited training programme for primary care practitioners with Dublin City University with a view to enhancing the capacity of primary care to recognise, assess and treat a range of mental illnesses within the primary care setting.  </P>
        <P>Community based Adult Mental Health Services receive referrals from Primary Care and provide assessment and treatment to individuals with eating disorders; Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams provide a similar role for their cohort of referrals.  Where the individual&rsquo;s psychiatric or medical needs are more acute, in-patient admission is offered within the local psychiatric services or acute medical care where necessary.</P>
        <P>The HSE can and has worked with service providers in the independent sector to provide specialised care, on an in-patient and/or an out-patient basis.  In a limited number of cases, referrals to specialised eating disorder services in Dublin or the UK can be clinically recommended and supported in appropriate circumstances, subject to the necessary resources being available.</P>
        <P>The situation with regard to services that are covered by private health insurance is that each private health insurance provider in the Irish Market, currently Aviva Health, Quinn Healthcare and VHI Healthcare, has the right to determine which health care providers they will cover for the benefit of their customers.  The right to this determination is provided for in the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Minimum Benefit) Regulations, 1996.  Health insurers operating in a commercial market may choose the providers they cover and it is a matter for each insurer to determine how much capacity in any particular area is required by them to deliver the services required by their members.  The definition of &ldquo;prescribed health services&rdquo; in the 1996 Minimum Benefit Regulations excludes <Col N="1118"/>health services relating to eating disorders or weight reduction.  Therefore there is no obligation on private health insurance providers to provide insurance cover for this type of treatment.</P>
        <P>My Department does not have a role to play in relation to whether the insurers would cover the services offered by any particular provider.</P>

	<P>The Employment Control Framework for the Health Sector exempts a number of grades, including Social Workers, from the moratorium on recruitment to maintain essential services.  Since 25 June 2010 the Health Service Executive has filled a total of 457 social worker vacancies.  These were to satisfy the recommendations of the Ryan report and to fill other vacancies caused by retirements, maternity leave, etc.  This recruitment of Social Workers has resulted in a net increase of 212 WTE to 2,448 WTE at end-July 2011.</P>
        <P>Currently, the HSE is processing a further 242 posts (62 of which are to address the recommendations of the Ryan report) as follows</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />70 &mdash; in the clearance process/awaiting permission to issue contracts</P>

However, as the law currently stands, it is not possible for cannabis-based medicinal products to be prescribed by a medical practitioner in Ireland. However, my Department is examining the issues associated with applying controls, similar to those that apply to other controlled drugs that can be misused, such as morphine and methadone, to cannabis-based medicinal products to permit them to be prescribed and dispensed in Ireland.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 516 and 517 together.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has responsibilities in the area of detection of counterfeit and contraband tobacco products. Smuggling cigarettes into Ireland is illegal and penalties prescribed in this regard reflect the gravity of such acts; however, policy with respect to the consumption of cigarettes is largely oriented towards reducing smoking &mdash; and it does not discriminate between the consumption of legal or illegal cigarettes.  This is predicated on the fact that one in every two smokers will die from a tobacco-related disease &mdash; a stark fact that is central to the HSE&rsquo;s health education QUIT campaign aimed at encouraging smokers to quit; and in this regard, I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern in relation to lung cancer deaths.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the measures being taken to reduce smoking, it seems appropriate to firstly reflect on the comprehensive range of tobacco control legislation that has been introduced in Ireland since 2002, particularly the successful implementation of the smoke-free initiative in 2004; the ban on the sale of packs of cigarettes of less than 20 in 2007; and the ban on in-store display and advertising and the introduction of the retail register in 2009. This comprehensive nature of our tobacco control legislation places Ireland in the top rank of countries internationally in this regard.  Ultimately, the legislation further de-normalises smoking among children and will, I believe, reduce childhood initiation in the long term.</P>
        <P>In addition to the HSE&rsquo;s QUIT campaign, other measures to encourage people to quite smoking include Nicotine Replacement Therapies (NRT) &mdash; which are available to medical card holders &mdash; and Smoking Cessation Services within the Health Service Executive that offer services in different areas.  Specialist Smoking Cessation Counsellors are trained to deliver these <Col N="1121"/>services on full time, part time and sessional basis nationally.  Health Promotion Departments within the HSE also offer an extensive programme of training that includes developing skills for health care practitioners to support people wishing to stop smoking; they also provide support to schools around the issue of smoking and substance misuse, and support to workplaces on developing smoking policies.</P>
        <P>The HSE funds the National Smokers Quitline which, in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society, provides a smoking cessation advice and support service. This provides the public with access to a telephone support service from a trained smoking cessation counsellor.  Referral to local smoking cessation services can also be arranged and a quitting booklet is offered and sent out to all callers who request it.</P>
        <P>Finally, there is a range of measures under consideration by the Tobacco Policy Review Group (TPRG) including price, enforcement of existing legislation and cessation services.  I anticipate that the report of the TPRG will be completed in the coming months and that this will be brought to Government for decision.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
        <Quest> if the Health Service Executive or Office of Tobacco Control have conducted research on the dangers of counterfeit cigarettes; his views on the necessity of conducting a public information campaign specifically outlining the increased danger associated with counterfeit cigarettes. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24974/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>All tobacco products, whether legally produced or counterfeit are injurious to health.  No specific research on the dangers of counterfeit cigarettes has been undertaken by the HSE or the Office of Tobacco Control, which was merged into the HSE in December, 2010.</P>
        <P>The HSE has no direct function in relation to illicit tobacco trade which is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. However, my Department and the HSE support Revenue&rsquo;s <i>Strategy On Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011- 2013).</i>  This multifaceted programme focuses on border and inland operations and internal distribution chains, and includes anti-smuggling initiatives, intelligence gathering and analysis, investigation and prosecution.  In the period 2008 to 2010 the Irish Customs Service seized a total of 532 million cigarettes with an estimated retail value of &euro;222 million representing just under 30,000 individual seizures.</P>
        <P>The overwhelming majority of smokers in Ireland use legitimate tobacco products.  The HSE&rsquo;s priority is to reduce the number of people smoking and de-normalise tobacco use in Irish society.  The HSE recently undertook the QUIT campaign  which highlighted that &ldquo;1 in every 2 smokers will die of a tobacco related disease&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>There is a range of measures under consideration by the Tobacco Policy Review Group (TPRG ) including price, enforcement of existing legislation and cessation services.  I anticipate that the report of the TPRG will be completed in the coming months and that this will be brought to Government for decision.</P>

        <Quest> the steps he will take by ministerial regulation or legislation to address the growing practice of the sale of part worn tyres which may contribute to serious deficiencies in transport standards and may even contribute to road traffic accidents; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>While there is currently no legislation that explicitly bans the sale of second hand or part worn tyres, there is legislation in place governing the condition and standard of tyres. Statutory Instrument No. 5 of 2003 (Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations) sets out the specific requirements with respect to tyre condition and tyre tread depth for vehicles. Specifically, it requires that a vehicle should not be used on a public road if: </P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /><i>the main grooves of the tread pattern of the tyre do not have a depth of at least 1.6 millimetres throughout a continuous band around the entire outer circumference of the tyre,</i></P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /><i>the tyre is not maintained in such condition as to be fit for the use to which the vehicle is being put or has a defect which might in any way cause damage to persons or damage to the surface of the road.</i></P><Col N="1123"/>
        <P FLI="0">Furthermore, when undergoing the roadworthiness test all cars, goods vehicles and buses have their tyres inspected for tread depth, condition and the presence of European approval (E or e) marks.  I have no proposals, at present, to introduce additional legislation in this regard.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority (NTA) on December 2009, the implementation and development of infrastructure projects in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), such as a DART link to Dublin Airport, comes under the remit of the NTA.   I have recently received a copy of the preliminary business case that Iarnrod Eireann has submitted to the National Transport Authority in relation to the development of the DART link to Dublin airport. In compliance with the  Department of Public Expenditure capital appraisal guidelines which require independent review of business plans, this plan is currently being reviewed by the NTA. It would not therefore be appropriate for me to comment on the business plan details until this process is complete.</P>
        <P>In relation to Government policy on public transport investment, the comprehensive review of capital expenditure is currently underway. The level of funding available for public transport investment from 2012 to 2016 will be dependent on the outcome of this review which takes place against a background of new funding realities. A major consideration for transport investment over the next five years will be the need to prioritise funding to protect investment made to date and to maintain high safety standards.</P>
        <P>In relation to the large public transport projects in the Dublin area, the availability of funding, both from the Exchequer and private sources, will be a key consideration in the capital review as will the contribution to transport objectives, including the potential to add value to existing services, and create employment.  The outcome of the review should be available in the next few weeks.  </P>

	<P>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road schemes, including the M50, are matters for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  In particular, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Roads Act 2007).  I understand that the NRA has advertised for consultants to assist the Authority in relation to the running of existing tolling operations and to provide general advice on tolling options. </P>
        <P>To date no decisions have been made in relation to future tolling strategy or the introduction of additional road tolls. Careful consideration will be given to the issues involved before any decisions are made.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The implementation of individual national road projects, including the M3, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007.</P>
        <P>In particular, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Roads Act 2007).</P>
        <P>Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the NRA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you don&rsquo;t receive a reply within 10 working days.</P>

	<P>As outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 55 of 6th July 2011, in the context of the March 2007 agreement between the Irish and British Governments on a funding package to support the restored Northern Ireland Executive, the Irish Government made a commitment to provide funding for a roads investment package for Northern Ireland to contribute to the upgrading of the A5 road from Aughnacloy to Derry/Londonderry to dual-carriageway status. </P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach recently indicated, the Government remains committed to the upgrade of the A5 road in the context of the North West Gateway Initiative designed to develop the economic potential of the North West.</P>

	<P>Following discussions  between my Department and the City and County Managers Association <Col N="1128"/>Community Social and Economic Committee, Minister Varadkar and I approved an initiative whereby grant aid towards the upgrading of energy and water conservation measures as well as disabled access enhancement, to a maximum total of &euro;400,000, would be provided for Local Authority swimming pools. </P>
        <P>This is not a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme or a general refurbishment scheme for swimming pools.</P>
        <P>An expression of interest was received in the Department from Sligo County Council on 1 June 2011 on behalf of Sligo Regional Sports Centre to upgrade the energy, water and enhanced disabled access.  On 7 July the Department wrote to all local authorities, including Sligo County Council, to produce a more detailed application for funding by 29 July 2011. </P>
        <P>A submission on behalf of Sligo Regional Sports Centre was received in the Department from Sligo County Council.  This was assessed for a grant in accordance with the terms and conditions of the initiative, subject to the amount of funding available in the Department`s Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme subhead.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately the Department did not have sufficient funds available to fund the Sligo Regional Sports Centre pool under this initiative. However if further funding becomes available in the short term the application will be reconsidered.</P>
