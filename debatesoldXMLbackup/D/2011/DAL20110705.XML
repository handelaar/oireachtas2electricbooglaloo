      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In line with established practice, the 100 day progress report on the implementation of the programme for Government was posted on my Department&rsquo;s website on Thursday, 16 June, where it is accessible to all who wish to be informed.  I do not propose to circulate a formal report.  I envisage that an annual report on progress will be published by my Department and that it will also be posted on its website.  When the Government achieves its objectives, periodic press releases will continue to be issued and posted on my Department&rsquo;s or the relevant Department&rsquo;s website, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>While my Department co-ordinates policy in a number of ways, responsibility for implementing specific aspects of the programme for Government rests with the relevant Department.  Responsibility for implementation rests in the first instance with each Minister, having regard to the programme for Government and the matrix of priorities and responsibilities within and across each portfolio.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="418"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Three weeks ago the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste held a press conference and issued a document mainly about implementing measures prepared by the last Government.  It included almost none of the specific commitments the Taoiseach made in respect of the first 100 days in government, such as his personal diplomatic initiative or his ban on constituency work by Ministers.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach also stated on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; that he had prepared report cards on all Ministers relating to the implementation of promises.  When will we be allowed to see these report cards?  Do these score cards exist?  If they do, surely the Taoiseach is now in a position to publish them.</P>
        <P>This is not a new policy of the Taoiseach.  As long ago as 2007, he said he would resign if he did not implement everything he promised.  He also said he would agree performance score cards with every Minister and that he would publish them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a good job Deputy Martin did not get one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Buttimer would definitely be in trouble.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin would get a &ldquo;no grade&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin will not see report cards published.  It is a matter for engagement with all Ministers.  Currently, I am actively involved in holding a series of bilateral meetings with Ministers in respect of their portfolios, responsibility and the programme for Government in so far as it impacts on their Departments and responsibility.  I have had a number of such meetings.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government sets out the objectives of what the Government intends to achieve over its period in office.  At the end of the first 100 days, a progress report on the achievements of the Government in its first 100 days was produced and published and it is on the website for everybody to read.</P>
        <P>The question asked by Deputy Martin on publishing, in the near future, a report on the Government&rsquo;s performance beyond the first 100 days report refers to the remaining items in the programme for Government, of which there are many and which we aim to achieve during our period in office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The 100 days lark was an election gimmick.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A lark is never a gimmick.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>If one read what the Taoiseach announced during that press conference, it bore no relation to the incredible commitments he made to many people throughout the country on specific items, such as retaining all hospitals, his personal diplomatic initiative, which he has not embarked upon, and many other issues.  Now the 100 days has passed, we will go back to an annual review.  The Taoiseach said he would not publish a formal review.  Why will he not do so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is already on the Department&rsquo;s website and it is accessible to everybody in the country and beyond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The 100 days was the election gimmick.  There are set procedures in terms of reviewing the programme for Government with every Minister and on informing the public about the degree to which commitments made in the programme are adhered to. <Col N="419"/> Normally, that takes the course of a formal review.  Who will conduct and be responsible for that formal review in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Perhaps the Deputy did not hear my reply.  I said that from time to time as Ministers and their Departments achieve their objectives, it will be posted on the Department&rsquo;s website for everybody to access and to read.  It will be either on my Department&rsquo;s website or on the relevant Minister&rsquo;s one.  That is the way the procedure operates.  We can collate all of that at the end of the year and have a second collection of achievements from the programme for Government.  As objectives and targets are achieved and as issues are dealt with, it will be posted on each Minister&rsquo;s website.  That is appropriate in order that everybody can access the information and understand progress is being made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>In the programme for Government there is a commitment to a major undertaking to secure burden sharing on an equitable basis, meaning speculating banks should take losses incurred in property gambling, rather than inflicting them on taxpayers.  There is a further promise to secure a reduction in the penal and opportunistic interest rates charged by the European Union as part of the programme to save banks from their gambling losses on the backs of the Irish people.  In four months not one iota has been achieved in these major objectives which are also fundamental to the national finances.  What are the Taoiseach&rsquo;s revised aims?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, a figure of approximately &euro;5 billion has been leveraged from subordinated bond investors.  The Minister for Finance has made it clear that he intends to have discussions with the European Central Bank in respect of senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank commencing in the autumn.  An interest rate reduction, agreed in principle at the meeting on 11 March, has not yet been concluded.  However, that discussion is continuing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Government determined the effect of the delays in implementation of the stated programme with regard to the estimated cost to the taxpayer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">One would wish these issues could be concluded quickly rather than later.  When the Minister for Finance proceeded down the road towards responsibility sharing with subordinated bondholders, he was not aware that court cases would be taken, but that matter has been dealt with to a degree.  We cannot provide a date or an absolute conclusion on the matter, as agreement is required on the Government&rsquo;s intention of pursuing senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and a decision cannot be taken unilaterally.  As I noted, an interest rate reduction is under continuing discussion with our colleagues in Europe.  Responsibility was given to Ministers for Finance to conclude the matter.  Irish officials are in constant contact with their colleagues and counterparts to reach a conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Sula leanfaidh m&eacute; ar aghaidh le mo cheist, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh leis na daoine a ghlac p&aacute;irt sna Cluich&iacute; Oilimpeacha Speisialta.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeadh an Taoiseach s&aacute;sta comhgairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh, ar son na D&aacute;la, leis na daoine speisialta seo.  Rinne siad jab iontach ar son na h&Eacute;ireann.  Before I ask my question, there is some good news.  I am sure the Taoiseach and other parties will join me in congratulating the 126 Irish athletes who took part in Special Olympic Games.  To bring back 107 medals is a fantastic achievement.</P>
        <P>It is not good enough to issue an annual report.  Sinn F&eacute;in has prepared a report on the Government&rsquo;s first 100 days in office which itemises 50 failures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not seen that report.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="420"/>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has broken promises made by Fine Gael and, ironically, has kept promises made by Fianna F&aacute;il to pay big bankers and fund toxic banks, etc.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>What promises did Sinn F&eacute;in keep when in government in the North?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the annual report include information on the U-turns made and failures to keep promises made in the programme for Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Aonta&iacute;m leis an Teachta gur ch&oacute;ir dh&eacute;anamh leo si&uacute;d ar fad a ghlac p&aacute;irt sna Cluich&iacute; Oilimpeacha Speisialta.  Go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r &oacute; thaobh iad si&uacute;d a bh&iacute; in &eacute;ineacht leo, ag tabhairt a gcuid ama go deonach gan airgead ar bith a fh&aacute;il, agus a thaispe&aacute;in a suim pearsanta agus chlainne sna cluich&iacute; sin, I agree with Deputy Adams.  Obviously, I have not seen the report the Deputy&rsquo;s party produced.  I know he is a bit touchy about the commitments the Fianna F&aacute;il Party might have entered into.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, the Taoiseach is not a bit touchy about them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said in my initial reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We are familiar with his zeal to implement them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the various Ministers achieve their targets and objectives, in accordance with the remit that applies to each Department under the programme for Government, those items and matters will be posted publicly on the departmental websites.  That is how it should be done.  Obviously, later in the year we will have an opportunity to discuss the progress that is being achieved in terms of the programme for Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important business.  Our job is to try to keep the Government accountable.  Will the process mentioned by the Taoiseach include the universal social charge, the water charges and the poverty taxes?  We compiled our report after 100 days, which was before the revelations about the junior doctors.  I invite the Taoiseach to support Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion this evening.  Deputies who are present promised their constituents that acute accident and emergency services would be kept open.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in did the same thing in the North before the Assembly elections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I invite them to support the Sinn F&eacute;in motion later this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in cannot have it both ways.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he intends to do so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Adams is learning very fast.  He raised the Special Olympic Games, water metering, the universal social charge, junior doctors and his party&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion in the context of a question that relates to the distribution of a formal review of the implementation of the programme for Government.  I have already pointed out that every Minister will post these results &mdash; details of the extent to which the targets they set themselves, and are bound by under the programme for Government, are being achieved &mdash; on the website of his or her Department.  The question of the universal social charge has been referred to by the Minister for Finance.  The programme for Government commits the Government to reviewing the charge before the 2012 budget.  The Minister for Finance has said it will be a very difficult budget.  The medical and hospital situation will be discussed when the House considers the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members&rsquo; motion this evening.  An amendment to that motion, <Col N="421"/>setting out the Government&rsquo;s concerns, will be proposed by the Minister for Health.  On the matter of metering, the question of the payment one will have to make in respect of one&rsquo;s usage of water after one&rsquo;s free allowance has been used is being and will be dealt with by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to return to one of the other issues covered in the programme for Government.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will refer to it in passing.  Has the Minister undertaken an internal assessment of the impact the implementation of the legislation providing for the burning of junior bondholders would have on the Irish credit union movement and individual credit unions throughout the country?  It is clear when one reflects on the impact of last Friday&rsquo;s decision, for example, that more transparency and clarity is needed in respect of this important matter.  We need to consider the impact of such a decision on various credit unions throughout the country.  The Taoiseach said the score card issue was a metaphor for something or other.  I have to say it sounded great on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Deputy John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Deputy was impressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a sense that the Taoiseach intended to tackle all the Ministers and haul them in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Deputy watched it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a suggestion that there would be a clear benchmark.</P>

	<P>On your bikes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>He said that if these guys were not doing the business, he would deal with them.  We have now been told it was a metaphor for something or other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a bit like the Deputy himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am really intrigued by this.  We will have to go back over every interview the Taoiseach did, for example on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; and with Matt Cooper, to work out what he was really saying, what he really meant and whether we can believe it.  I am afraid that seems to be the story.  Did this good soundbite come from some focus group?</P>

      <Speaker pid="RayButler"><NameTxt>Deputy Ray Butler</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is the most popular politician in the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Buttimer should have stayed in Killarney.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin is correct to say some bonds are held by some credit unions and by Irish Life &amp; Permanent.  The Minister for Finance is examining those matters where bonds are held by a small number of credit unions, and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Would it be possible to share that with us?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Put down a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In good spirit, could the Minister share that information with the other Members of the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>Let the Taoiseach finish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to see that Deputy Martin looks at &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  Let me be clear about this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I was beginning to believe this transparency stuff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The compilation of the report cards to which he referred is a metaphor for the bilateral meetings I have with each Minister about the Departments for which they have responsibility.  It is about the political activities and the progress they are making in achieving the requirements of the programme for Government in so far as it relates to their Departments.  I have had five or six of those bilateral meetings already and will continue to conclude them in the next fortnight.  Thereafter I will have a clearer picture of progress and about the difficulties Ministers see ahead in respect of achieving other targets in so far as their Departments are concerned.  As Deputy Martin will be aware, from an economic perspective the situation is challenging and that will require Ministers to focus on the priorities that can be delivered and to maintain services, and at the same time cut out waste and achieve more with less.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach publish those?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Boyd Barrett.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach will not publish them.</P>

	<P>There will be one for everybody in the audience.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not get the report cards published for assimilation by the electorate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We are really disappointed with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>These are the requirements of the Taoiseach, that he should know about his Ministers.</P>

	<P>I call Deputy Boyd Barrett please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that one of the most pressing issues facing people is the massive unemployment crisis, the fact that close to half a million people are without work and many are leaving because there is no work.  The programme for Government stated that job creation was central to any recovery strategy.  Given that the public sector recruitment embargo means a slow grinding attrition of jobs, demand is <Col N="423"/>being depressed in the economy because of cuts in income and pay and the bank recapitalisation means the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the banking sector, where does the Taoiseach see his commitment to job creation in the programme for Government being realised?  How will the Taoiseach create jobs as he committed to do in the programme for Government given that everything happening in terms of austerity is working in the opposite direction and is leading to a jobs massacre?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

        <P>Deputy Boyd Barrett will be aware that also on 1 July the jobs initiative decisions taken by Government to reduce VAT, to halve PRSI for employers and remove the travel tax kicked in.  This is the first direct stimulus to the hospitality tourism sector and those labour intensive areas for job creation and to retain employment.  He will also be aware that the pipeline of investment from outside the country remains exceptionally strong and that the work being done by the Government in terms of rebuilding Ireland&rsquo;s reputation continues strongly.  The situation in so far as the 12.5% corporation tax rate being unchanged has been made clear and has drawn a strong response from international investors.  The decision taken by the Government in respect of the banks allows for a serious extent of credit of &euro;10 billion a year for each of the next three years following the de-leveraging of non-core assets by them.  The challenge for us is to stimulate the demand for credit from indigenous industry and a demonstration from banks that it is happening.  Certainly, that is a challenge.  In my travels throughout the country in the past fortnight, I have encountered a number of small firms, especially in the engineering and software areas, in which there is the potential for an increase in employment and some are making that happen.  We must accelerate that and make it clear that the credit now becoming available to banks will be lent under proper conditions and will be proven to be lent to businesses for a change of direction or an expansion of whatever it is they are involved in.</P>

	<P>From this perspective, the continued flexibility, increased productivity and output and the trade surplus in terms of our exports are running strongly.  We must restore confidence to the indigenous economy and grow the capacity for small and medium enterprises.  This requires credit being available and a demonstration that it can be proven to be lent.  In addition, the Government is working on the production of a Bill which will give an insurance guarantee in respect of some credit to assist in that work, which I am sure will be of interest.</P>

        <P>I met the chairman and members of the Croke Park implementation body, together with the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on 29 June.  During the course of that meeting I heard their account of the progress being made and I conveyed my personal commitment to the most vigorous and ambitious implementation of the terms of the agreement, having regard to the major challenges which we face in ensuring the affordability and effectiveness of the public service.  I met the public service union representatives who are members of the implementation body in this context.  I have also met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discuss issues of mutual concern, including the importance of the public service reform agenda, and I addressed the biennial conference of the congress in Killarney yesterday, 4 July.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>A fortnight ago the Taoiseach withdrew his election comments about the Croke Park agreement not being implemented, which I wish to acknowledge.  It was not made clear from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply whether he sees himself as Head of Government having any role in driving this initiative and fostering a positive approach to public service reform.  The Taoiseach has removed all the staff in his Department who would have had direct responsibility for this area to another Department.  Will the Taoiseach take a personal role in driving this process?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I support the work of the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform 100%.  Having spoken to the Minister some weeks ago, I agreed it was important that I should meet the implementation body with him to express our confidence and appreciation of the efforts made by the implementation body and the constituent union members thereof in achieving significant change and success in respect of the first analysis of the Croke Park agreement.</P>
<TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, in Government Buildings.  When speaking to its representatives in Killarney yesterday, I reiterated that the Government is completely supportive of the implementation of the Croke Park agreement.  We are keen to see the agreement implemented in full.  As has been made clear by Minister after Minister, it is important that the process is accelerated to achieve the targets we need to achieve.  Yesterday, I said to the ICTU members and to the congress that in so far as I am concerned as Taoiseach, where there is a visible commitment to making the changes necessary to implement the Croke Park agreement, they will have in me a person as Head of Government for which they will have parity of esteem and an open door in respect of any discussions, concerns or anxieties they may have.  I put this to them openly.</P>
        <P>This is a process whereby the implementation of the agreement is critical for the future well-being of the country.  From this point of view, while social partnership does not exist as it did previously, there is a willingness and a commitment from Government to engage with the trade union sector and the public sector unions to discuss the further changes required in the Croke Park agreement.  I assure them of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to respond in respect of the conditions that have been agreed and signed off.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>While I take the view that it is important to adopt a constructive approach, does the Taoiseach consider the targets that have been met to be sufficient to meet the budgetary targets that clearly are required to be met in the next 12 months?  In other words, <Col N="425"/>has an assessment been made that the actual savings made will be sufficient to meet the overall deficit reduction challenge, given that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have ruled out tax increases and social welfare cuts?  Will the savings be of the necessary magnitude to make up the shortfall to arrive at the deficit reduction target set for the budget to be announced next December?  Does the Taoiseach agree that it is not a highly constructive approach for some members of the Government to lecture people about reform from the safety of newspaper articles and so on, rather than becoming more personally engaged in driving a reform programme across Departments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware that there is a comprehensive spending review taking place in all Departments.  When it becomes available, the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance will reflect on the findings in the context of the preparations for the budget for 2012.  As an analysis of the first review shows, there have been highly significant achievements to date in respect of the Croke Park agreement.  However, acceleration of the process is necessary if the agreement is to be implemented in full, which is of such importance to the well-being of the country.  As the Deputy is aware, the agreement was made between the previous Government and the trade unions in the public sector and, obviously, it is important that the Government, for its part, shows a willingness to work with the public sector to achieve the changes and objectives identified.  Yesterday I wanted to reassure the Irish Congress of Trade Unions of the Government&rsquo;s full commitment to so doing in an all-island sense because, as the Deputy is aware, it is an all-Ireland body.  The economic situation will not be transformed if we pretend to operate from individual sectors only.  This is a requirement in respect of which there must be communication, dialogue, discussions and co-operation.  The agreement is <i>in situ</i> and there is a strong belief it can be achieved in full.  As I want this to happen, I seek an acceleration of the process by which it is to happen in line with the Government&rsquo;s view in this regard and with the co-operation of and goodwill on the part of the trade unions concerned.  For my part, I am willing to participate and co-operate in the discussions and discourse on how this is to be achieved because the agreement has been signed off on with set conditions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has spoken about the affordability and effectiveness of the public service, but I am sure he will agree that the real measure of successful reform within the public sector is the experience of citizens seeking to access public services.  Citizens should have the right to access public services.  They should have the right to access to education and health services.  However, because of the policies of this and the previous Government, they do not have that right.  It is not present as a fundamental entitlement and core value of the State.  Given the austerity programme, of which he is now part, and the promise or threat of further cuts of &euro;4 billion, does the Taoiseach accept that the situation can only get worse?  Does he accept that it would be far better for the Government to face up to the major burden placed on citizens, rather than continuing with the shredding of public services?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach has stated social partnership will not continue in the way it has.  An mbeidh s&eacute; ag cur pr&oacute;isis eile ina &aacute;it?  An mbeidh an D&aacute;il &aacute;balta eolas a fh&aacute;il &oacute;n Taoiseach anseo sa Teach faoin bpr&oacute;is&eacute;as sin?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is facing up to tackling the big burden.  If we leave things as they are, they will only get worse.  Deputy Adams is aware that there is a deficit of huge proportions which has to be dealt with.  There is no point in running away from it.  There is no point in turning one&rsquo;s back on it.  There is no point in thinking that somebody will walk in next week and pay it off.  The country and the people have to deal with the deficit and this is the reason the Government is facing up to tackling the big burden and the reason we have made <Col N="426"/>changes in respect of the banks and we are trying to do something about serious situation even though constrained by the conditions of the IMF-EU bailout deal.  On the other hand, we are carrying out a serious analysis of how public money is spent so that we can make decisions in the best interests of the people and the country in order to close that deficit.</P>
        <P>Deputy Adams makes the point about citizens having the right to services and this is what the Government wants.  However, this cannot be achieved without making these structural changes.  I pointed out to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions yesterday that many of its members have shown absolute commitment to making serious change and many of them across the board have encountered a great deal of difficulty in making changes.  It is clear that a significant number of public servants know that the arcane structures within which they work are not conducive to delivering the kind of efficient professional modern service to which the Deputy refers and this is what we must aim for.  This has happened in other countries, notably in Finland, to which the Secretary General referred and in Canada and other countries.  The cost of delivery of public sector services can be downsized without impacting upon the quality of the delivery of front line services.  The Government recognises the scale of the challenge and this is the  up front political challenge.  We are tackling the big burden and when it becomes clear what programmes should go or which should be maintained or expanded, the Deputy will have ample opportunity to discuss them in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>This format does not allow a deep penetration and discussion about some of these issues and underlying it is a deeply important philosophical question about the core values of this State.  There was a time when the great and the good judged this Republic by how many millionaires we had and people are still scandalised.  Every day we hear about HSE and other State agency executives being given large hand-outs.  If we are to judge public services by the fact that a child could not be flown to Britain to get a transplant or that people who live in certain parts of this State will not have access to accident and emergency departments and that from next Monday, 11 July, the Government will have closed down or withdrawn many of those accident and emergency services, this is the core issue.  A society must be built around these fundamental issues.  From the cradle to the grave, wraparound health services must be a fundamental core value of this society.  If this Government were to pledge itself to work to this core value, then it would find that people would support the Government in a real way when it tries to measure out the pain we are told all of us must suffer.  Only a certain section of people are suffering that type of pain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In respect of young Maedhbh McGivern, the Minister for Health has apologised to the McGivern family for what happened.  It should not have happened.  As a parent I can only begin to estimate the trauma and the absolute consternation that applied.  They had been waiting for the phone call for 11 months and when it came, the follow through was not possible.  I too want to find out the exact sequence of what transpired from when the phone call was made from the hospital in the first instance.  As soon as an accurate report becomes available, the Minister for Health will present it to the House because it is in everybody&rsquo;s interests, as Maedhbh's father said, that this should not happen again.  I respect that people working in these sectors have a genuine commitment to seeing that things happen properly.</P>
        <P>In terms of values our republic should be seen as the best place in which to raise a family and grow old with dignity and respect.  The decisions of Government and the moneys paid by taxpayers provide services and opportunities through education and health whereby young people can have competence and confidence to stand on any stage in the world.   They should have the opportunity to grow and develop; they should a sense of prosperity and achievement and have career opportunities here if that is what they want.  That is what good government is <Col N="427"/>about.  Internationally, our country should be seen as a place of vibrancy, energy, initiative and endeavour where first class services apply.  That, unfortunately, is not the case now and is why the Government has set out what we believe are the main targets in our programme for Government which has the potential to turn around the fortunes of the country and of our people.</P>
        <P>These challenges will not be easily taken on, but they will be taken on because the Government is focused on bringing about a situation whereby we can understand that the values to which I referred can be achieved in an environment where political decisions are seen to be made strictly in the interests of our people and our country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach admit that the Croke Park agreement is nothing more than a cover for crudely cutting thousands of jobs in the public sector despite an OECD report which shows the Irish public sector to be far more modest than those in many more successful countries in Europe?  The end result is now being felt in the drastic cuts being proposed in education, in terms of schools, the health services and so on.</P>
        <P>Can we have the truth rather than fine words about values which do not mean anything in the face of what has happened here?  At the conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions the Taoiseach promised more privatisation and cuts.  Yet, apparently some congress leaders are hankering after partnership again.</P>
        <P>Why should ordinary workers be fooled again when for 20 years partnership was used as a cover under which bankers and developers profiteered outrageously on the backs of ordinary people, but when the crisis blew up the trade union leaders were unceremoniously kicked out in the rain by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor?  The price of that criminal greed was placed entirely on the shoulders of working people.  That is the net result of partnership.  Why should workers have any illusions about this fraudulent process, given the circumstances in which we find ourselves?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s comment that this is crudely cutting public service jobs.  The Croke Park agreement was signed off between the Government, the public sector and the trade unions.  As I said to Congress, many public sector workers understand better than the Deputy or I the arcane structures they were happy to put up with and the manner in which they are constrained from using their initiative and creativity to play their part.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is aware of the numbers to be down-sized in the programme for Government over the lifetime of the Government.  He is also aware of the numbers who have accepted voluntary redundancy to date.  It is not a case of fooling anybody.  We live in a very real world and, as I said to Deputy Adams, if the situation is not dealt with it will only get worse.  Ordinary workers tell me the Government&rsquo;s job is to sort this out in everybody&rsquo;s interests.  The programme for Government is quite clear in being committed to the sale of non-strategic State assets to realise up to &euro;2 billion over the lifetime of the Government, and then to be sold at an appropriate time and at appropriate rates.  The Government will make its own decision on that matter in due course.</P>
        <P>I also pointed out to the Congress of Trade Unions that there are serious opportunities to reform the way in which things are done.  The Croke Park agreement contains many of those elements.  As I told congress yesterday, in so far as the Government is concerned, we will work with the implementation body and the trade unions to see that the achievements signed on for become a reality.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide details of the elements in the EU-IMF programme with Ireland that he intends to put on the agenda for renegotiation as part of the forthcoming quarterly review by the troika, EU-ECB-IMF; and his objectives in this regard. </Quest>
        <QRef>[18891/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Quarterly reviews, such as the one which will start later this week, are a standard feature of financial support programmes.  The purpose of these reviews is to assess the progress of the programme to date and, in particular, to determine if the targets for the relevant quarter have been met.  It will also consider progress on targets which are due in subsequent quarters to ensure sufficient progress is being made.</P>
        <P>The review process includes a mission by the EU, ECB and IMF staff to Ireland and the preparation of reports on their findings.  The disbursement of further funds is conditional on positive assessments of compliance and approval by the Eurogroup, the ECOFIN Council and the IMF executive board, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The Government has repeatedly stated its commitment to the programme targets.  Meeting these conditions on time and on target is the best way to ensure that we emerge successfully from this programme.  That will mean that we can return safely to the financial markets for funding in as timely a manner as possible.  This is one of the principal objectives of the programme.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the programme does not stop us from seeking and agreeing changes to aspects of the programme.  We have already done this successfully.  The Government will continue to do so at the appropriate time.</P>
        <P>For the forthcoming review, the primary focus will be on our performance against the targets due by the end of the second quarter of 2011 and assessing progress on targets due in subsequent quarters.  I have already signalled that, notwithstanding the substantial consolidation already carried out, in particular the amount being delivered by the Government this year, difficult decisions in relation to future consolidations remain.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that budget 2012 will be another difficult budget that will require an adjustment of a minimum of the &euro;3.6 billion already indicated.  Final decisions in relation to budget 2012 will be made by the Government in due course in light of the latest relevant information available at that time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  The purpose of the question was to establish whether there are particular items that the Minister has placed on the agenda for this week&rsquo;s visit by the troika.  Does he wish to renegotiate issues in the current deal?  The Minister has gone on record previously as saying he believes this to be a bad deal for Ireland.  The issues that were changed during the first and second quarterly reviews were quite modest, to say the least, and certainly did not reduce the cost of the deal.  The agreement to introduce a jobs initiative, the reversal of the minimum wage, an agreement to undertake a comprehensive spending review, and the decision not to transfer any further loans to NAMA are really changes around the edges of the deal.  There is nothing there that reduces the cost or burden to the State as regards the EU-IMF deal.</P>
        <P>There is an opportunity this week and if the Minister still believes it is a bad deal, what elements of it is he still seeking to renegotiate and change?  It would be helpful to have some <Col N="429"/>clarity on these issues.  The Minister might consider providing us with an update on the interest rate reduction and whether he expects any movement on it before the autumn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has outlined the successful renegotiation of the deal we achieved when we met the troika a number of weeks ago.  We agreed major changes, including the provision of scope for the jobs initiative which the Deputy recently described in extravagant terms in the House, a commitment to an expenditure review and, more important, to a review from 2012 to 2015.  While the programme negotiated by the Deputy&rsquo;s party in government was to run straight through to 2014, there is now a commitment to a review following the first two budgets, which is significant.</P>
        <P>On the review due to take place next week, we have not signalled any major items for renegotiation.  However, during the quarter in the run-up to the budget there will be items for renegotiation because the manner in which we will make the correction in the budget may not accord with what is in the memorandum of understanding.  As long as our approach is fiscally neutral, we will be in a position to substitute one measure for another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone accepts that there is no difficulty in making changes which are fiscally neutral.  The troika will not have a difficulty with this.  However, the Minister is on record since November last as saying this is a bad deal for Ireland.  The question now is how does he intend to improve what he regards as a bad deal for Ireland.  The changes made which I have summarised do not reduce in any way the cost of the deal to the State.  The Minister said he would be in a position to negotiate these changes, yet he has not done so or taken the opportunity on the floor of the House today to indicate the issues on which he intends this week to seek renegotiation.  Perhaps he might also take the opportunity today to advise the House whether an interest rate reduction will remain a live issue during the summer months or if we are unlikely to see any movement this side of the autumn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>An interest rate reduction is the subject matter of subsequent questions and I do want to take the ground from other Deputies by answering supplementary questions on the matter from Deputy McGrath.  My response to it will come in due course.</P>
        <P>The changes made in the review were substantial.  On criticising the programme, I have always said the greatest problem in that regard was the manner in which the outgoing Government had turned bank debt into sovereign debt.  In that context, the major change we have made which has huge cost consequences involves a restructuring of the banks which I announced at the end of March or early in April.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Implementation of the goals set out in the programme for Government to which the Deputy refers will be introduced in a measured way and in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s priorities over the period of the programme.  The Deputy will be aware that as part of the restructuring and recapitalising plans announced last March, as part of the PCAR <Col N="430"/>and PLAR exercise, the banks are engaging in cost cutting plans which are under way.  I refer to the consolidation of the banks around two pillar banks, made up of the merger of Allied Irish Bank and the Educational Building Society, alongside Bank of Ireland.  The merger of AIB and the EBS which concluded last week will enable cost savings through shared services and economies of scale.  By deleveraging non-core assets, the banks will be better placed to focus on supporting the domestic economy.  The effect of these changes will bring about cost reductions which will improve operating margins and permit the banks to better absorb funding costs. The Government remains in consultation with the banks in connection with the more significant parts of the plans, including a significant reduction in employee numbers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are all aware that the number of mortgage holders in distress is increasing daily.  As of March this year, there were 86,271 mortgage holders in distress, which equates to approximately 500 families being subjected to serious mortgage distress every week.  We know that 50,000 mortgage holders are more than 12 weeks in arrears.  This is the largest increase in the level of mortgage holder distress since the Financial Regulator commenced releasing figures in this regard.  New figures to be released this month by the regulator will show the impact of the European Central Bank interest rate increase announced in April.  I am aware the banks are deleveraging and reducing their costs.  However, there is a clear commitment in the programme for Government to direct any mortgage provider in receipt of State support to present to the Government a plan, over and above existing plans, of how it intends to cut its costs by a sufficient amount to allow it to forgo a 25 basis points increase in its variable mortgage interest rate.  There is a good indication that the European Central Bank will again increase the rate later this week.  This will be the second announcement and we are expecting more.  Is the Minister directing the banks to reduce their costs in order that they will be able to forgo the 0.25 percentage point increase?  Has he asked any of the relevant banks, as provided for in the programme for Government, to reduce their costs sufficiently so as to ensure the interest rate increase will be absorbed within the bank structures, thus relieving the concern of the 200,000 people concerned about the forthcoming announcement?</P>

	<P>The code of conduct on mortgage arrears has been substantially revised to implement the recommendations of the mortgage arrears and personal debt expert group which published its final report in November last.  It sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers when facing mortgage arrears, with due regard to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its merits.  In this context, the Government&rsquo;s economic management council recently asked that further work be carried out to address the situation of over-indebted mortgage holders with a view to identifying a range of responses appropriate to individual circumstances.  The work will be undertaken by a group which is chaired by Mr. Declan Keane, an accountant seconded to the Department of Finance, and will report by the end of September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister has not answered my question.  It is stated in the programme for Government that the banks will be instructed to forgo the 0.25 percentage point interest rate rise.  My question on behalf of the 200,000 mortgage holders crippled by mortgage repayments is whether the Minister has instructed the relevant banks to come up with a plan which will enable them to forgo the 0.25 percentage point interest rate increase due to be announced this week by the European Central Bank.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The banks are being reconstructed.  There will be two pillar banks.  We will have much smaller banks, as the banks will be deleveraging most of what they have in terms of impaired debts abroad and will be concentrating on the home market.  Much smaller <Col N="431"/>banks will require fewer employees.  Restructuring of the banks will result in significant savings to the banks which will enable them to offer a more cost effective service to all of their customers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate that.  However, my question relates to the interest rate applicable to mortgages and the banks being instructed to forgo the 0.25 percentage point interest rate increase.  While I welcome all of the other information provided, have the banks been directed to forgo the 0.25 percentage point interest rate hike?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The restructuring of the banks has not yet been completed.  The process is under way.  We hope to have the banks fully recapitalised by the end of July, following which they will be in a position to provide better credit lines for customers.  Also, as I stated, there will be redundancy programmes in the banks.  When all of this has been done, the cost base of the banks will have been reduced and they will be in a position to offer a more cost effective service to all of their customers, including those with mortgages.</P>

        <Quest>   in relation to his stated view that senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society should have substantial losses imposed on them, if he discussed this question with US Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Geithner, the European Central Bank and the EU; and if he will report on any such discussions.   </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate the Government&rsquo;s position on the bondholders of Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS.  As indicated in my statement of 31 March, the position on bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and the INBS &mdash; institutions in different circumstances from the remainder of the banking system &mdash; will be considered following the completion of the independent review of the capital requirements of the INBS and Anglo Irish Bank last month.  While the Central Bank has concluded that no additional capital is required for these institutions, this does not remove the onus on the Government to consider all options to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of resolving these institutions.  I will, therefore, in the autumn raise with the IMF and EU authorities the issue of burden sharing to allow for the imposition of losses on unguaranteed and unsecured senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and the INBS.  As I stated at the time of my visit to Washington, I discussed this issue with representatives of the IMF who indicated they fully understood the Government&rsquo;s position and would work with us to seek to resolve it.  I did not, however, discuss this matter with the US Secretary of the Treasury, Mr Geithner.</P>
        <P>Regarding discussions with the ECB and the EU, there have been no formal consultations on the matter in line with Government policy as I have already outlined.  I propose to engage with the EU and IMF authorities in the autumn on these issues.</P>
        <P>It is important to reiterate that, in light of the potential broader financial stability and contagion issues that might arise, the Government will not take any unilateral action on this matter.  Rather we will continue to work closely with our external partners to explain our perspective and hear their views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that ordinary people and taxpayers will find it beyond belief that he did not discuss this issue with the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Geithner, who, we believe, vetoed the burning of tens of billions of bondholders&rsquo; bad gambling debts at a G7 meeting and therefore was directly responsible for contributing at any rate to have that burden continued on the shoulders of the Irish people?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the Minister&rsquo;s bold statement in Washington that he wanted the bondholders burned related to the fact that the following day was a press occasion for the Government on its first 100 days in office?  When the Minister found himself in Washington, was he rather like the brave schoolboy smoking behind the shed, bragging against the teacher and talking big, but then when he faced the schoolmasters of Frankfurt and Brussels the big talk stopped?  Was it not a most cynical intervention with no substance behind it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Deputy still has the same charitable view of other people&rsquo;s motives that he has had since he was first elected to this House.  My statement in Washington was very carefully thought out and phrased.  I know exactly why I made that statement and why I made it on that occasion, and I intend to pursue it in the autumn.  I do not know whether I will be able to pursue it successfully, but in light of what was happening in Europe at the time and the imminent negotiations that were about to occur in Greece, I believe on reflection the Deputy will also see it as a very timely statement.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s bailout agreement as negotiated by the previous Government is with the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank; it is not with the American Government.  I intend discussing it with the European Central Bank, which is the body that does not agree to burden sharing with senior bondholders and I already discussed it in Washington with the IMF.  I discussed it with the relevant parties and I did not make allegations against the United States Secretary of the Treasury as the Deputy has done in the House without any evidence of which I know.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>   if he has received any indication that the Troika, EU/ECB/IMF, will require Ireland to achieve a fiscal correction of greater that &euro;3.6 billion in 2012; and his views on whether this is still the appropriate figure in view of all available economic and fiscal data.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[18892/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>As part of the memorandum of understanding on specific economic policy conditionality of the joint EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland, budget 2012 is to include an overall budgetary consolidation package amounting to at least &euro;3.6 billion.  This was the figure contained in the original memorandum of understanding agreed at the time of entering into the joint programme late last year and it is also the figure contained in the updated April 2011 version of the memorandum of understanding which was published following the first and second quarterly programme reviews in April of this year.</P>
        <P>The precise nature of the measures to be implemented in 2012 will be decided upon in advance of budget 2012 in light of more up-to-date economic and fiscal data and the outcome of the comprehensive review of expenditure, which is under way.</P>
        <P>The stability programme update submitted to the European Commission in late April forecasts the 2012 general Government deficit at 8.6% of GDP.  Based on the macroeconomic and fiscal outlook at the time, this target is consistent with a level of adjustment of the order of &euro;3.6 billion and is within the terms of the revised excessive deficit procedure recommendation issued by the ECOFIN Council last December.</P>
        <P>Quarter 1 economic data released in recent weeks and budgetary data for the first six months of the year which were released yesterday were both broadly consistent with expectations.  My Department is in the process of assessing what implications the latest macroeconomic and budgetary data might have for 2012 and beyond.  Such assessment will, along with later data, inform the Government in the context of its budgetary preparations over the coming months.</P>
        <P>The next quarterly review of the joint EU-IMF programme of financial support gets under way tomorrow and I, along with my officials, will be discussing with the external funding partners a range of economic and budgetary issues, including the current outlook for 2012.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="434"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly the precise mixture of the elements in December&rsquo;s budget will not be decided until closer to the time.  However, the key question is whether it is the mixture of elements or the overall figure that is subject to review between now and then.  Rightly or wrongly, the Minister has considerably narrowed the options available to him in the preparation of that budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>On the spending side he has removed social welfare completely and public sector pay is dealt with through the Croke Park agreement.  On the taxation side&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;corporation tax is not touchable, income tax changes will not happen, VAT policy is set in stone and so forth.  Is it the make-up of the &euro;3.6 billion that is subject to review depending on the economic data available at the time or is the figure itself open to review between now and then?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very interesting question, but we are a long way from the budget which will be announced early in December.  The Deputy will recall from the memorandum of understanding that while the target that has been recited for 2012 has been &euro;3.6 billion, there is another target not so frequently mentioned, which is achieving a deficit of8.6%.  We hope the means, a &euro;3.6 billion adjustment, will achieve the 8.6% target, but there are many variables between now and December, which means that could move slightly but not by much.  I said yesterday that the adjustment would be approximately &euro;4 billion, but the target was &euro;3.6 billion.  In other words we must achieve a target of &euro;3.6 billion but there is an issue of whether &euro;3.6 billion is sufficient to bring the deficit below 8.6%.  That is why I used the figure yesterday to indicate it is not as precise as people think and in the range of between &euro;3.6 billion to &euro;4 billion will get us in with the required deficit.  Of course we will be discussing that with the troika as the year goes by.  We will also be discussing the elements of the adjustment that will get us to those targets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>If I interpret the Minister correctly, he is saying the percentage deficit must be achieved and that, therefore, will determine the exact monetary amount of the adjustment to be introduced in the budget for 2012.  If there is slippage in economic growth figures during the remainder of this year, that figure of &euro;3.6 may increase significantly if we are still to come within the deficit of 8.6% of GDP for 2012.  Is that a fair summary of what the Minister is saying?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying that as precisely as the Deputy is putting it.  I am saying there are two targets: one is a monetary target of &euro;3.6 billion and the other is a deficit target of 8.6% of GDP.  To try to get the two of those aligned is what has to be done.  Already, the target we have provided to Europe would get us to 8.6% with an adjustment of &euro;3.6 billion, and there are other estimates which are slightly north of that.  The IMF estimates that an adjustment of &euro;3.6 billion would get us to 8.8%, so, while the figures are very close, there is a slight variation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the 8.6% a must?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not a must but, obviously, it is a matter for negotiation.  The assumption is that an adjustment of &euro;3.6 billion will get one to a deficit of 8.6%.  As the year goes by, we will know, but much will depend on the year-end figure.  Obviously, if we <Col N="435"/>have a year-end figure which exceeds the target, then the adjustment would not be as strong as would be required in the Estimates.  However, if we fell short at year-end, it would be another variable that must be taken into account.  I am not saying anything particularly new.  I am simply saying that next year will be difficult and there will be a hard budget.  Whether it is &euro;3.6 billion or &euro;4 billion, it will still be a very difficult budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>So the &euro;3.6 billion is fixed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a minimum adjustment.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>   if, during any of his meetings at the European Council, he has raised the fact that the European Union will profit to the tune of &euro;10 billion as a result of the 3% mark up on the interest rate charged on the EU portion of the EU/IMF bailout loans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[18895/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU portion of the EU-IMF programme funding for Ireland is made up of the European financial stabilisation mechanism, EFSM, the European financial stability facility, EFSF, and the bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark.  Of these, only the EFSM relates directly to the European Union.  Based on full drawdown of the &euro;22.5 billion from the EFSM, the current margin of 2.925% and an average maturity of 7.5 years, the gross margin would be about &euro;4.9 billion, out of which its costs would have to be deducted.  Interest paid on EFSM loans, including the margin, will be entered into the EU budget as miscellaneous revenue from which all member states, including Ireland, benefit.</P>
        <P>The margin on borrowing from the EFSF, on the other hand, accrues to the EFSF in the first instance.  Based on the current margin of 2.47%, full drawdown of the &euro;17.7 billion available and average maturity of 7.5 years, the gross margin will be around &euro;3.3 billion.  This ultimately accrues to the EFSF guarantors.</P>
        <P>The margin from bilateral loans accrues to the relevant country.  Only the UK facility has been agreed and it provides for a margin of 2.29%, providing a gross margin in the order of &euro;650 million.  The agreements, and therefore the margin, for Denmark and Sweden have yet to be finalised.  Taken together, the total margin applying under existing arrangements could be of the order of &euro;9 billion over the period.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s strong position that the margin being charged on loans from both the EFSM and the EFSF is excessive.  This argument, which has been supported by the European Commission, is one I and my Government colleagues, plus our officials, make at every possible opportunity.  It is safe to say my ECOFIN counterparts are fully aware of this issue and I will continue to remind them and press them on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The Exchequer figures yesterday showed that just over 20% of all taxes collected in the State are now needed to pay off the interest on our national debt and that figure is about to increase given the figure for servicing the interest on our national debt is &euro;5.2 billion this year and will increase to &euro;9.2 billion by 2015.  We often talk about figures when dealing with questions in the House, which is important, but there is also the question of fairness.  Given this increase, does the Minister believe it is fair that our European partners are profiting by more than &euro;9 billion as a result of our hardship and as a result of decisions this Government and the previous Government have taken to bail out bankers?</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance and the European Commission have been busy sending out press releases on this issue, including one sent out before 7 a.m. today.  The NTMA estimated at the beginning of December that the average cost of the EFSM loan would be 5.7% &mdash; I understand the previous Minister for Finance indicated this to the House &mdash; but it is expected <Col N="436"/>as a result of the increased cost of borrowing at European level that the cost will probably increase to approximately 6.1% or 6.2%.  If this is the case, the cost of borrowing under that portion would have increased by approximately &euro;750 million.  Will the Minister clarify whether this is the case?  Is the average rate under the EFSM by the NTMA on 1 December last 5.7% or has the cost increased as a result of the cost of borrowing at European level?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very fair to say that when we talk about a bailout for Ireland, or indeed Greece or Portugal, we are not talking about grant-in-aid.  We are getting a facility to borrow money and we are paying a very high interest charge on it.  We are not in receipt of charity or of grant-in-aid.  It is simply a loan facility to keep us going when we could not raise money on the markets, and the interest rate is very high.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have argued consistently &mdash; in opposition, in government and at ECOFIN &mdash; that one of the flaws in the bailout programmes across the programme countries is that the cost of the programme is excessive, which makes it very difficult for programme countries to come out of programmes because the margin is too big.  Clearly, the people who designed the programme in consultation with the last Government had considerations of moral hazard as well as being paid a strong interest rate.  They wanted to discourage people from going into programmes and they wanted to ensure that people came off programmes at the earliest possible date.  Of course, it is a flawed analysis.  As I have told our colleagues in Europe, when a party like Fianna F&aacute;il, which was the party of Government for a generation, is taken from 42% to 15% in a general election, that is moral hazard enough to be going on with when one is Government.  One does not need a penal interest rate on top of that to make a Government behave.  Despite this, these were the considerations that fed in.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A more realistic consideration is that some of the guarantor countries which are also contributors to the fund, such as Spain and Italy, were last week borrowing money at approximately 5%, and one could not expect guarantor countries, which are contributing, to borrow at 5% and lend at less than that.  There is a real issue in this regard as well because, while the margin over the fund is approximately 2.5%, the margin over the costs of contributors to the fund can be quite slight.  This is why it is so difficult to negotiate a very significant interest rate reduction.  As a general principle, the architecture defending the euro has flaws in it, one of which is the price of the money.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest>   the number of persons currently employed in those companies that pay the full 12.5% rate of corporation tax.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[18607/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 55 and 78 together.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputies that companies operating in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on their trading profits.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits and chargeable capital gains.  This rate also applies in respect of certain petroleum, mining or land dealing activities.  The 10% corporation tax rate for profits from manufacturing expired at the end of 2010 and the 12.5% rate now applies to such profits.  Accordingly, all companies operating here pay corporation tax at the 12.5% rate or at the higher 25% rate on their taxable profits.  Irish resident companies pay corporation tax on their worldwide profits subject to relief for foreign tax paid on profits earned abroad.  Non-resident companies trading in Ireland through a branch or agency pay corporation tax on the profits of their Irish branch.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, for the year 2009, which is the most recent year for which information on corporation tax returns is available, approximately 47,000 companies with taxable income filed returns for accounting periods ending in that year.  Of these, approximately 28,000 companies, or 60%, paid corporation tax at the 12.5% rate.  The remaining companies either paid tax at the 10% manufacturing rate, now expired, or at the 25% rate.</P>
        <P>In regard to employment, the Revenue Commissioners do not have an estimate of the number of persons currently employed by companies chargeable to tax at the 12.5% rate of corporation tax but, based on P35 returns filed by employers for 2010, the estimated number of employments in all companies on Revenue records for that year was 1,590,367.  I should emphasise that this number relates to employments, not individuals, and reflects the reality that many employees have more than one employment.  Employees with more than one employment are therefore counted more than once in the figures provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>How many of the companies subject to the 12.5% rate pay a lower effective tax rate as a result of various measures allowing them to write down their tax liabilities?  Does the Minister have numbers or percentage figures in respect of companies that have not paid tax as a result of these initiatives?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the figures sought by the Deputy to hand but, in overall terms, there has been a debate on who pays what rate of corporation tax across the European Union.  If one takes the effective rate rather than the nominal rate, Ireland is positioned in the lower segment of mid-table.  Our effective rate is 11.9% whereas our nominal rate is 12.5%.  The two rates are very close because most of the allowances have been removed over the years.  France, for example, levies a variety of rates.  The rate that applies to SMEs is approximately 32% whereas the rate is much lower for the top 40 French companies in general terms.  This has been a matter of contention in France for a long time.  While one needs to compare like with like, if one combines all the rates that apply in France, its effective rate stands at 8.1% even though it is making considerable noise about our effective rate of 11.9%.  Contrary to the conventional wisdom, we are mid-table in Europe and are not at the bottom of the table by any means.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was surprised to hear the Minister state that the effective rate is 11.9%.  Perhaps he can clarify the source of the figure because other figures were outlined in the Private Members&rsquo; debate on this issue which indicated that the effective rate was approximately 10%.  Can he confirm whether the fleets of company cars which are given to <Col N="438"/>highly paid executives in highly profitable companies continue to be written down for tax purposes so that companies can sidestep some of their corporation tax liabilities?  Given the sacrifices being made by ordinary workers and vulnerable people dependent on our public services, is it fair that profitable companies which make hundreds of millions of euro per year pay a lower proportion of tax on their earnings than the workers who clean the floors of their buildings?  How can the Minister morally justify that in the current circumstances?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>As corporation tax is a tax on company profits, obviously costs are taken out before one calculates the base on which the 12.5% rate is applied.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Should swanky company cars be taken out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is a cost, it is a cost.  It is a tax on profits.  That is straightforward.  The source is a survey carried out by one of the international accountancy firms.  I do not have further information to hand but I will get it for the Deputy.  The survey investigated nominal rates and effective rates throughout the European Union and we circulated the results widely through the diplomatic service to ensure the debate is conducted on the real figures.  This is one of the reasons the European Commission, the IMF, the OECD and 25 of the 27 member states either support us or are silent.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> of changes to our corporation tax rate in return for a reduction on our interest rate is now an issue that only France is pursuing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While I agree with the Minister on comparisons between the French rate or even the European average and Ireland&rsquo;s effective rate, I would like to know the number of profitable companies which pay a low effective tax rate as a result of being able to write off their taxes against the various initiatives introduced in successive budgets.  Can an argument be made for a minimum effective tax rate for profitable companies so that they can only avail of these schemes to a certain extent?  That is the line of questioning I wish to pursue but I do not know if the Minister has the relevant figures to hand.  Clearly, if our effective tax rate is lower than the nominal rate, certain companies are paying smaller amounts and I would like to know the rationale for this.  Is it on the basis of being able to avail of different schemes, as was the case for high earners until a minimum tax rate was introduced in respect of them?  This is the type of information I seek.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>More than 28,000 companies pay tax at the 12.5% rate but the Deputy wants to know how many pay smaller amounts.  I do not have the precise figures to hand and I do not think anybody does.  In general terms, there are few allowances but the tax is levied on profits.  Obviously companies can deduct costs before the tax break arises.  The one break of which I am aware was introduced in the Finance Bill 2004 and allows write-offs for research and development.  This has proved attractive to companies setting up here.</P>
        <P>The normal course for a company is that it incurs significant costs when it initially sets up operation here and, as such, pays little tax over the first several years while it offsets these costs.  Once it is established it comes up to the 11.9% rate, which is the standard rate paid, as against the nominal rate of 12.5%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Doherty touched on an interesting line of questioning.  If the Minister is correct about the effective rate, which he undoubtedly is given that he cited the figures he was given, what is the reaction of his counterparts in France when he tells them we in Ireland regard it as rank hypocrisy that they are demanding a reduction in our rate?  Their rate is lower than most others in Europe, including ours.  Will he tell them we will listen to <Col N="439"/>what they say but will do what they do by reducing our tax rate to the same effective rate as applies in France?  That should keep them happy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have shared this information through our diplomatic system.  The initial reaction of colleagues in Europe was surprise but they all accept it now.  We got the information published in the leading French newspapers, including <i>Les Echos</i>, which is the French equivalent of the <i>Financial Times</i>, and I think it was also published in <i>Le Monde</i>.  There has been a change in the French position.  It is no longer seeking an increase in our 12.5% rate and has moved the argument on to the tax base.  The information has gone through, therefore, and it has had an effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Minister consider reducing our corporation tax to the same effective rate as in France?  That would be fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister opened up my supplementary question on the related issue of the base, changes to which could result in corporate profits currently taxed here being taxed in another European jurisdiction.  What is the current position on these discussions?</P>
      
        <P>During the recent summit of the European Council, there were suggestions that the issue of the base was now the <i>quid pro quo </i>for a reduction in the interest rate on the bailout.  Can the Minister confirm if the discussions between our officials and European officials is focused on that issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Discussions are focused on the possibility of getting an interest rate reduction.  An argument about the rates has moved on to the base for quite some time now.  The base is described along with the CCCTB, and the Commission has done a paper on it, which will eventually come before the Council of Ministers.  It is before some technical committee at the moment which is making adjustments to it.  There are 27 countries in the Union and all 27 of them have expressed unhappiness, to one degree or another, about the CCCTB paper.  France has a view about the base which its officials are pushing, and we do not agree with that view, so we are not doing business there either.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>In my reply to a similar question in March, I stated the consideration of flooding matters in the River Shannon catchment falls within the national programme of catchment flood risk assessment and management studies, or CFRAM studies, being commissioned nationally throughout 2011.  The Office of Public Works appointed engineering consultants, Jacobs International, in Dec 2010 to undertake the Shannon CFRAM study.  This work will identify and examine in detail the causes of flooding throughout the Shannon catchment and produce an integrated plan of specific measures to address the significant flood risk factors in a proactive and comprehensive way. Its output will be a flood risk management plan for the Shannon catchment, taking into account economic, social and environmental factors.</P>
        <P>Considerable progress has been made in progressing the study, which will continue to 2015 and will meet the requirements of the EU floods directive.  A number of meetings of both the CFRAM advisory and progress groups, which includes representatives of the principal stakeholders, have taken place and the study programme remains firmly on track.</P><Col N="440"/>
        <P>The incidence of summer flooding of the Shannon Callows between Portumna and Athlone is an important part of the CFRAM study for the Shannon catchment.  It is important to stress that the long-term resolution of significant areas of flooding risk in the Shannon catchment, and indeed on all national river catchments, must derive from the extensive range of CFRAM studies now being undertaken.</P>
        <P>In the context of the delivery of the first principal reporting stage of this study, which is the preliminary flood risk assessment, a public consultation will take place in the late summer in the local authority areas contiguous to the River Shannon catchment, as well as nationally for all other catchments.  In parallel with this public consultation, I have engaged extensively in a series of meetings with local delegations and the Irish Farmers Association in Athlone, Longford and east Galway.</P>
        <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State, in addition to the observations and dialogue I have already heard during my recent sequence of meetings along the Shannon, I am arranging for a stakeholder consultation forum at the end of this month.  This will include the main stakeholder groups in the Shannon catchment and will provide a more structured opportunity for those groups to set out their concerns. This stakeholder consultation forms an integral part of the CFRAM process.</P>
        <P>In the interim, a number of minor flood mitigation works have been funded by the OPW through the relevant local authority in Ballinasloe, Athlone and Carrick on Shannon, totalling &euro;2.4 million in 2010 and 201.  This is a very considerable investment in this region to provide enhanced flood protection.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>Operational control of water flows on the Shannon is essentially a matter for both Waterways Ireland and the ESB.  The OPW maintains regular consultation with Waterways Ireland and the ESB to ensure water management protocols for the major storage areas in the Shannon system are kept under review.</P>
        <P>Some maintenance works on the Shannon channel are subject to agreement with the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Approval for the application to carry out these minor maintenance works has been the subject of discussions between the OPW and the NPWS.  In this regard, I also had a meeting at the end of May with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and a number of Shannon-based Deputies.  The issue of licence approvals was discussed at that meeting and I am pleased to note assurances from the NPWS that the first of these approvals will be given this month.  A meeting to resolve the outstanding issues on the remaining application will take place this week between my office and the NPWS.  Subject to these approvals, it is intended that these maintenance works will be scheduled for autumn 2011.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>   if he will provide a list of the funds provided by him for all buildings currently rented or leased by the State that are subject to upward only rent reviews indicating which of those buildings have been subject to rent increases in the past three years; and the amounts of any such increases.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[18590/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Prior to March 2010, when legislation addressed the issue, virtually all commercial office leases in the market with a lease term longer than five years contained the provision for an upward only rent review.  This stipulated that on review, the rent could not be lower than the current passing rent or the initial rent. In general, these lease rent review provisions typically provided for rent to be determined every five years and the rent review <Col N="441"/>provisions usually stipulated that the reviewed rent could not be lower than the rent payable prior to review.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Office of Public Works has 462 leases, of which 160, with a total rental yearly value of &euro;58,080,640, attract the upward only rent review clause.  The following table schedules these leases with county, location, building and rent per annum.  Seven leases had a rent increase since 2008 and the total increase was &euro;206,882.  The details are set out in the following table.</P>

	<P>I am surprised that Question No. 70 has not been taken with this.  The Department has obviously appealed the decision on the upward only rent review, or sought an independent arbitration.  Does the Minister of State believe it is fair that other Departments in the Government are operating such rent reviews?  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food operates an upward only rent review at a premises in Killybegs, and this is putting businesses there under severe pressure, and possibly out of business.</P>
        <P>In respect of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to legislate to end the practice of upward only rent reviews, what is the Minister of State&rsquo;s view on the DKM report, which has shown that a substantial loss would be borne by the State, via the banks and NAMA?  Has there been any contact with NAMA officials about legislating to end this practice?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware of the commitments in the programme for Government in this area, which are being dealt with by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  He is working with the Government on the legislation under consideration and will make a statement in due course.</P>
        <P>As the principal body responsible for leasing State property, the issue is about getting value for money.  The total sum paid out by the Department in 2009 was &euro;149 million.  For 2011, we estimate that the sum will be &euro;117 million, so it is coming down.  I must admit I would like to see it come down sooner, as it is important to get better value for money when we are running a deficit reduction programme.  The OPW is proactive in ensuring we get rent reviews and in ensuring the breaks which were part of the original negotiations are set out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Government got legal advice to the effect that it is possible to remove this clause from existing leases?  Has any assessment been done of the overall net impact to the State of removing the clause?  While it would be very beneficial for tenants and retailers, there is also an impact on property values, financial institutions and NAMA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is primarily an issue for the Minister for Justice and Equality, as he is responsible for the legislation.  He is having consultations across the Government on the issue.  The key issue is the long-term impact it will have on the State.  We all want to reduce leases and the amount we are spending on them.  There are many cases where one arm of the State is renting from another arm of the State.  This is principally an issue for the Minister for Justice and Equality to determine, following Government support and approval.  I presume he will be in a position in the not too distant future to make a statement on that.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>   if he will outline the progress made on the commitment in the programme for Government to tightly regulate moneylenders.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[15365/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is already a comprehensive licensing system in place for moneylenders.  Moneylenders have to apply to the Central Bank annually to have their licences renewed.  Section 93 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended, sets out the Central Bank&rsquo;s powers in regard to the grant or refusal of a moneylender&rsquo;s licence.  The appropriate money<Col N="446"/>lending application form &mdash; new or renewal &mdash; must be completed and returned to the Central Bank with a number of items for review and consideration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to the licensing system, the Central Bank has in place a consumer protection code for licensed moneylenders.  The Central Bank has power to impose sanctions on moneylenders for a contravention of the code.  The code sets out general principles with which a moneylender must comply.  For example, a moneylender must act honestly and professionally with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of  consumers.  The code also places requirements on moneylenders in regard to the provision of information to the consumer, preservation of a consumer&rsquo;s rights, knowing the consumer, suitability, unsolicited contact or cold calling, disclosure, errors, handling complaints, consumer records, unsolicited credit facilities, arrears and guarantees, debt collection and the contents and presentation of advertisements.</P>
        <P>On 18 February 2011, the Central Bank published the results of a themed inspection of licensed moneylenders.  The inspection showed a high level of compliance with the requirements of the code among firms.  Inspections were conducted in 11 of the 46 licensed moneylenders currently operating in Ireland.  The inspections focused on whether consumers were being charged in accordance with the moneylenders&rsquo; authorised APRs &mdash; that is, their annual percentage rates &mdash; and costs of credit as set out in the moneylenders&rsquo; licences.  It also examined whether firms had their licences on display and whether they indicated the high-cost nature of loans on loan documentation issued to consumers, as required by the code.  Overall, the inspections found a high level of compliance with the requirements and that consumers were being charged in accordance with the moneylenders&rsquo; authorised APRs and costs of credit.  In addition, firms had their licences on display and indicated the high-cost nature of loans on loan documentation issued to consumers.</P>
        <P>I expect that in future the annual regulatory performance statement of the Central Bank will refer to the regulation of moneylenders.  This statement will be presented to each House of the Oireachtas.  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 provides that a committee of the Oireachtas may request the Governor of the Central Bank or the head of financial regulation to attend before it and provide information relating to the regulatory performance statement.  This will allow Deputies the opportunity to seek relevant information on regulatory matters, including the regulation of moneylenders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear from that report that the level of compliance among licensed moneylenders is quite good but the issue is the plethora of unlicensed moneylenders.  There was a commitment in the programme for Government to regulate this area tightly.  Perhaps the Minister might elaborate on what he had in mind in that regard.  Is it to bring in new measures which would bring into the net many of those unlicensed moneylenders or is he planning an even tighter regime in regard to those currently licensed and regulated by the Central Bank?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Operating as an unlicensed moneylender is illegal and it is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance.  In regard to the licensed moneylenders, we have ongoing discussions with the regulator and the Central Bank about all the lending institutions.  I will raise the issue the Deputy mentioned with the Cental Bank and the regulator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of licensed and unlicensed moneylenders, given that many people, especially those on low and middle incomes, are going to moneylenders because they cannot get access to credit from the banks, does the Minister believe the APR they are allowed to charge is too high and that we need to revisit that issue owing to the economic conditions in which we find ourselves?</P><Col N="447"/>
        <P>In regard to the illegality of unlicensed moneylenders, I do not know them personally but we hear stories of unlicensed moneylenders in most towns and villages throughout the State, in particular in the run-up to Christmas.  The fact they are illegal does not seem to matter.  Will there be tighter legislation which will remove these types of parasites who are feeding off the financial difficulties people experience, in particular in the run-up to events like Christmas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The APR is set down in regulation and it is always a matter of debate as to whether a particular interest rate is too high, but it is regulated.  As Deputy Michael McGrath pointed out, the issue of most concern is not the licensed moneylenders who, by and large, comply with the law, but the unlicensed moneylenders.  The best approach to this is to ensure credit unions continue to be a strong part of the landscape for lending small amounts in communities throughout the country.  We are committed to that in the reorganisation of the credit unions which is proceeding at present.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>On 27 January last, the Taoiseach launched his election campaign promoting a report from a PR firm.  He talked at length about how the promises he would <Col N="448"/>make in this election would be completely different from anything that had gone before.  With typical understatement he promised a new redemptive politics and a new redemptive trust.  He looked people in the eye and told them they could trust him and that he would keep his promises.  As communities throughout this country have been discovering in recent weeks, these promises, especially where they relate to local health services, do not count for very much.</P>
        <P>In Sligo, the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, sought and got votes with a promise backed up by the Taoiseach that if Fine Gael got into power, in the first 100 days &mdash; those famous 100 days &mdash; a satellite facility would be restored at Sligo General Hospital.  He further promised that Fine Gael would upgrade it to a regional hospital.  The T&aacute;naiste gave a commitment as late as February that his party would immediately restore all services to Sligo and designate it as a centre of excellence.  There were no &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;, &ldquo;buts&rdquo; or &ldquo;maybes&rdquo; attached to the promises made in Sligo, Roscommon or other communities.</P>
        <P>Now the deputy leader of Fine Gael has fired the expert board of the HSE and taken personal control of all HSE decisions.  Yesterday his Department said spending is running &euro;40 million below budget projections.  There is no way to dodge responsibility for the decisions now being made.</P>
        <P>Days before the election the Taoiseach told the people he had a list in his pocket of hospital services he would keep open.  Will he tell us why he made those promises and which hospitals were on the list?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am getting a little fed up of the Deputy putting words in my mouth.  He should indicate which promises were made in respect of which hospitals and if he can stand over the claims made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Which promises?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach stated that in the Government&rsquo;s first 100 days a satellite facility would be restored at Sligo General Hospital.  I refer him to the Private Members&rsquo; motion to which he spoke in the House a number of months ago regarding the retention of services in local hospitals.  That was when he was in opposition.  In February he said, &ldquo;My only focus is on election day.&rdquo;  It is very clear that is one promise the people could actually believe.  No one forced the Taoiseach to make direct and solemn promises to the communities concerned, but he did so because his only concern was to win votes.  Nothing has changed in the past three months to justify his breaking of these promises.  The only difference is the Department has spent &euro;40 million less than that budgeted for and that the deputy leader of Fine Gael is personally in charge of the HSE.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="449"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>He made a decision to fire the board.  As he travels around the country the Taoiseach can see the reaction of the people to the solemn commitments given that have now been broken.  Will he intervene to ensure his solemn promises to the hospitals and communities concerned will be honoured, or will he continue to ignore the growing concern throughout the country and that he and his colleagues in the Labour Party deliberately sought and obtained votes on the basis of false promises?  We are talking about facilities in Roscommon, Sligo and elsewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is unable to back up his charge.  The position is that the parties in government &mdash; the Labour Party and Fine Gael &mdash; each produced a programme before the general election, as was their right and that of the Deputy&rsquo;s party when it was in government.  After the people had cast their votes, Fine Gael and the Labour Party came together and produced a programme for Government which was endorsed in the House and is being implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, it is all the Labour Party&rsquo;s fault.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin may quote all he likes and make all the comments he wishes to, but I am prepared to look the people in the eye and tell them the truth of what we found when we took on the responsibility of being in government.  I am also prepared to say we stand over our position in changing the health structure, as referred to by Deputy Adams in a question earlier, to provide health services of which the people can be proud.  They will be efficient and deliver services which the people expect and pay for and will be of the highest standard.  That is patently not the current position, which is why the Minister for Health has set out, on behalf of the Government, to change the structure of the Health Service Executive in order to produce a universal health insurance scheme.  That will provide for the ending of the two-tier system and bring about a health system of which we can be proud.  That will not happen in the Government&rsquo;s first 120 or 300 days; rather it will take its first period in government to change the structure in the way we want to change it.  In the meantime, the legacy left by the Deputy&rsquo;s party, for which he has denied all responsibility, must be dealt with and we will do so.  I would like to be able to stand up and indicate that every clinic, service and hospital in the country will continue to engage in service provision because of a change of Government, as if there were no legacy debt or inferior structure to deal with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a different show now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the Taoiseach said when he was on this side of the House.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>The Government will continue to focus, as it is required to do, on sorting out these problems in order that the people can have the kind of health service that they need and deserve; it should be of the highest standard.  That is the challenge facing the Government.  It is obvious that there are places in the country where changes are required, as happened in the past.  That will not be to everybody&rsquo;s liking, but in the interests of providing the best service in the most effective way, changes must occur.  There is no intention to close down any hospital, just in case the Deputy is trying to get around that issue.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is true that Fine Gael and Labour Party candidates made all sorts of election promises on which they turned their backs, including those they made about services in Sligo.  It is also true that the party which closed down services in Sligo was Fianna F&aacute;il.  I will come as quickly as possible to the point I want to make.  There is a significant crisis in front line services, including the appalling withdrawal of special needs assistants in the education sector and the downgrading of 24-hour accident and emergency services in important hospitals right across the State.  Last week the Taoiseach stated there was a budget deficit of &euro;99 million in hospital spending.  The Government is consistently trying to explain and excuse what is being done in front line services and the aforementioned deficit.  Last week it paid &euro;12 <Col N="451"/>million to senior bondholders with unguaranteed bonds in what was once Anglo Irish Bank.  It will pay a further &euro;10 million tomorrow.  I cannot believe that on 2 November the Government will pay &euro;703 million to the exact same crowd, seven times the current deficit mentioned.  Why is there an unlimited supply of money for senior bondholders with unguaranteed bonds in toxic banks and not enough for front line services in hospitals across the State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has put his finger on the button.  The reason we are in this quandary is a relatively small number of people brought the country to the edge of economic ruin.  The Government complied by transferring bank debt to sovereign debt, meaning &euro;30 billion will be put into Anglo Irish Bank in the next ten years.  The Government and the people have been put at a serious disadvantage because of the carry-on of earlier Governments and reckless banking lending practices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The bonds are not sovereign debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not guaranteed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy noted a number of the payments made.  Because of the actions of the Minister for Finance, some &euro;10 billion has been taken from subordinated bondholders to date and of the &euro;24 billion laid out in recapitalisation, the NTMA reckons that approximately &euro;5 billion can be taken from this by further pursuit of subordinated bondholders.  As has been made clear to the House and the nation, the Minister has pointed out that senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank are in a very different category than those in Bank of Ireland and AIB.  In advance of further payments to Anglo Irish Bank, the Minister will discuss the matter with the ECB early in the autumn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps he should have checked with it before now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the case that the Government can make a unilateral decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Dooley&rsquo;s party gave the guarantee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is wrong, as these are unguaranteed bonds.  It is very difficult, when following Fianna F&aacute;il speakers, to be heard or hear what others are saying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.  There should be order in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>There are unguaranteed bonds which are not part of the sovereign debt.  For once the decision has not been made by Fianna F&aacute;il but by the Government.  We spoke earlier about citizens&rsquo; rights and the mark of a republic.  What society values the greed of senior bondholders above the health needs and entitlements of citizens?  As we all know, people who end up in hospital are vulnerable, in trauma or ill.  Tomorrow, the Government will pay a huge amount of money to these greedy bondholders in respect of unguaranteed debt.  They got into this position because of their own private greed.  </P>
        <P>As a result of the failure to deal properly with the shortage of junior doctors, other closures or cuts in accident and emergency services across the State will be announced on 11 July.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware &mdash; this has been pointed out by the Minister &mdash; the Government has deemed that Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide are not functioning banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Why give them money?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="452"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>For that reason, their deposits have been transferred to other banks.  It&rsquo;s clear that senior bondholders in those non-functioning banks are in a different category from senior bondholders in the two pillar banks.  The Government has to focus on those two banks as part of its decision not to maintain six dysfunctional banks.  When the Minister for Finance was in the United States, he made it clear that the Government regards senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank as being in a different category.  For that reason, we will pursue the question of sharing responsibility with the ECB early in the autumn.  </P>
        <P>Every Deputy understands the sensitivity and the personal trauma encountered by families every day when they find it difficult to access quality health care, as close to them as possible, when they need it.  Obviously, it is a matter of genuine interest for every Deputy and everyone else in the country.  Everybody knows we cannot get to the point we want to reach if changes are not made.  The Minister for Health and the Government have to grapple with how those changes can be made, consider what the priorities will be when that has been done and decide how all of it will be funded.  A fundamental part of that involves changing the structure of the HSE, which was supposed to provide a world-class health service but has failed to do so.  The need for a change in direction is clear when one bears in mind that the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il has objected to the collocation of private hospitals on public hospital lands, which was supposed to be a cornerstone of the previous Government&rsquo;s approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not a cornerstone of anything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As Minister, he objected to that in the case of Cork.  </P>
        <P>The point I make to Deputy Adams is that I recognise the challenge we face if we are to help people who want to access hospital treatment, are lying in hospital beds or on trolleys in corridors, or are waiting to get into hospital for treatment.  We have to deal with this matter in a structured way and on the basis of an understanding that people are entitled to a quality health service.  The Minister for Health established the special delivery unit to deal, in the first instance, with the endless waiting lists this country has had for far too many years.  Deputies are aware that such an approach has worked in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.  It will work here too.  The Minister for Health and the Government will co-operate in dealing with several parallel challenges.  We are trying to provide an effective and safe health system with the highest standards &mdash; a system that works for people when they need it, which is what we all want.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the plan to move 130 Irish jobs within the Vodafone group to Egypt and India?  Does he share my concerns about the matter?  According to the company&rsquo;s most recent financial report, published in March 2011, Vodafone made an annual profit of &euro;123 million in Ireland.  Does the Taoiseach agree that its decision to move these jobs offshore is very damaging for the staff of the company and the country as a whole?  At a time when businesses and workers are struggling to keep their heads above water, the Irish economy is enduring one of the most prolonged recessions since the foundation of the State.  Will the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, meet representatives of Vodafone?  Will they ask them to reverse this decision?  Will the Taoiseach stand up for the Communications Workers Union, the members of which are trying to protect their jobs and their livelihood?  Does the Taoiseach agree that if he does not protect these jobs, it will make a mockery of the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative plan or any other job creation projects?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the Taoiseach replies, I ask Deputies to ensure the noise level is low when all Members of the House are speaking.  Everyone should have a chance to ask questions and respond.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="453"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I met union representatives of the call centre workers when I was in Killarney yesterday to address the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I was informed of Vodafone&rsquo;s decision to move these jobs to India and Egypt.  I regret that they will be lost to this country.  This is not a new phenomenon.  When I was Minister for Tourism and Trade, a number of international airlines and other companies with trade elements here set up call centres here.  The centres lasted a number of years until companies found they could provide the same service in other locations at a cheaper cost.  There was then a move to a higher level of expertise and experience.  I regret the decision made by Vodafone.  The requirement and the challenge for the Government is to continue to create jobs in Ireland.  As a start, the jobs initiative, which was drawn up within the conditions of the IMF-EU bailout deal, provides an incentive to stimulate the indigenous economy here.  As the Deputy pointed out, the Government&rsquo;s programme does not involve taxing employment or work.  When I met the union representatives yesterday, they clearly explained their concerns in this regard.  Obviously, I was aware that the matter might be raised during Question Time here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  I am delighted he met the unions.  It is important to hear the views of workers.  The Taoiseach has a national duty to implement the Government&rsquo;s policy on job retention and protection in the case of this crisis.  Is he aware that if these 130 jobs are lost, some &euro;2 million will be lost to the local economy?  That is a serious issue for this economy.  While respecting that a company cannot be compelled to make any decision, I ask the Taoiseach to put serious political pressure on Vodafone and to support intervention in this matter.  This company has enjoyed the loyal support of many Irish customers, including me and many other Members of the Oireachtas.  I ask the Taoiseach to stop this company from walking off the pitch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot stop the company from walking off the pitch.  The Government does not give it grant aid.  The Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, have met representatives of the company.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and I have met representatives of the trade union.  As we do not provide grant aid to the company, we have no power to block it from walking off.  There has to be an emphasis on continuing to create new opportunities for the companies&rsquo; workers and protect the circumstances that currently prevail.  That will be done as part of the process of rebuilding our reputation at home and internationally.  As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton will continue to work on that.  Although it is regrettable that Vodafone has decided to move these jobs to India and Egypt from the centres in counties Dublin and Louth, we will continue to strive to create new jobs by attracting new foreign direct investment and stimulating the indigenous economy.</P>

	<P>The Standing Orders are clear on the right of the House to ask for documents which are important for discussions.  The Taoiseach will be aware that Fianna F&aacute;il Members, including me, asked repeatedly for all background documents to be published before a decision should be taken to amend the terms of reference of the Smithwick tribunal.  None were produced and the motion was guillotined through the D&aacute;il and Seanad in one day.  We had asked for it to be delayed.  We had asked for the Government to give full background material to Deputies in the House.</P>
        <P>It has now been revealed that the Government had in its possession very serious letters from Mr. Justice Smithwick which were withheld, clearly deliberately, from the Oireachtas.  It is not possible to argue that they were irrelevant to our discussions.</P>

	<P>Let me be clear about this.  As the Deputy is aware, when the motion went through the House some years ago setting up the Smithwick tribunal of inquiry part of the remit was that within ten days of public hearings being held an internal report would be produced.  The Minister for Justice and Equality required that an interim report would be produced, which has been produced.  In accordance with the deadline being set for November it is perfectly clear that there is no intention to interfere with the work of the Smithwick tribunal.  The Justice has pointed out the number of witnesses who must be heard and the position in respect of papers held by the British authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is in the interests of the taxpayer that there be a connection related to progress being made by any tribunal of inquiry.  This should be obvious.  The judge pointed out in his letter the range of hearings that must be held and the witnesses from which evidence must be taken.  If the tribunal comes back to the House, which sets up tribunals, the D&aacute;il will reflect on what the tribunal states about its ability to conclude its hearings.</P>
        <P>Deputy Martin will agree that we have had tribunals stretching out over a long period that have cost a vast amount of money.</P>

	<P Just="Left">While one cannot put a figure on the truth it is important that the D&aacute;il, a House of the Oireachtas, is informed at intervals about what progress is being made in any tribunal.  In respect of this tribunal, conducted from this jurisdiction and about alleged collusion between members of the police force, it is important that it is seen to retain its absolute independence, which it will.  In respect of a timescale for its conclusion, it is important to note that occasionally there should be a progress report and it is the right of the House of the Oireachtas which set up the tribunal to hear it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I seek the guidance of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on this.  This is a serious matter.  A significant scandal is involved to a certain extent.  I am not referring to the rights or wrongs of progressing a tribunal.  At issue fundamentally is that the Taoiseach and the Minister were asked to provide any background materials or documents that gave rise to the Minister&rsquo;s decision to change the terms of reference and put forward the amendment.  We asked for the documents but none was forthcoming.  The documents were withheld from Members.  The debate took place in the context of documents not being made available.  Now, in the aftermath of the debate, we find that the most serious of concerns had been raised by a chairman of a tribunal in respect of the actions taken by the Minister to affect and to have an impact on that tribunal.  The tribunal was set up by the House.  In amending the terms of a tribunal, in changing the direction of a tribunal or in trying to speed up a tribunal it is obvious that the Members should be in full possession of all documentation relating to the proposal put before us.  For some reason, these documents were withheld from Members, violating their right to a proper, fully informed debate on the status of the Smithwick tribunal.</P>
        <P>This is a serious issue in terms of process and procedure in the House.  What has taken place is unacceptable.  The Taoiseach should apologise to the House for the manner in which the debate was orchestrated and choreographed.  It seemed to have everything to do with spinning and with the view that the Government was taking on the judge and the tribunal and that it would do the devil and all yet again.  This is a sensitive tribunal with regard to the perception of people and the perception of how we do our business in terms of being fully fair, objective and impartial and so on.  Many people were looking askance at what was going on in terms of this issue.  It is unforgivable that the debate took place in the context of the documentation being withheld.  The Taoiseach knew or, at least, the Minister for Justice and Equality knew about the correspondence with the judge.  I asked the Taoiseach specifically to provide me with this material.  I asked him not to rush the matter through the House, not to guillotine it and to give some background material to the Deputies opposite in respect of the decision.  It is unforgivable and unacceptable and the Taoiseach should apologise to the House for it.  I will take the advice of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>You asked me for guidance, Deputy.  I cannot be expected to rule on this matter without notice.  Notice should be given to the Chair if you expect me to deal with it on the spot.  It is something you can come back to and you can put down a substantive motion.  Does the Taoiseach wish to comment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not believe there is any scandal involved in complying with the conditions of the motion that set up this tribunal, which has been sitting for more than six years, which has begun public hearings and which, in accordance with the motion setting it up, was required to produce an interim report.  It is only right and proper that while respecting the right of the sole chair and his independence in doing his job, at the same time the taxpayer, who funds this, should be entitled to a progress report at intervals as to how the tribunal is doing its work.  As I have made clear before, if the Smithwick tribunal comes back here in the autumn and suggests <Col N="458"/>it is unable to complete its work for given reasons, the House must make a decision onthat.</P>
<TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This is not about tribunals conducting their work in secret indefinitely.  It is a case of respecting their independence and allowing the sole member to conduct his business in accordance with the motion to set up the tribunal but it is also about understanding that the taxpayer funds the bill at the end of the day.  There have been discussions in the House before about the Flood and Moriarty tribunals and all the tribunals that have gone on for many years.  When I was on the other side of the House, there were claims from Members that they should be expedited, that interim reports should be produced and that they should be concluded by particular dates.  In this case, we require an interim report, which we now have.  If Mr. Justice Smithwick comes back in the autumn with reasons he is unable to conclude the tribunal report inside a particular time, then it is a matter for the House to decide and discuss and to make its decision in that regard.  The Deputy can take it that there is no intention to interfere with the work and the responsibilities of the Justice in this tribunal.</P>

Will the aforementioned legislation pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas before 2 November, when an unguaranteed bond for &euro;750 million will mature?  Will there be enough time, if the Government gets approval from the ECB, to impose burden-sharing on that bondholder in respect of the aforementioned bond for &euro;750 million?  It is due to mature seven weeks after the D&aacute;il reconvenes after the summer recess.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2011 is a short but important Bill that contains three important electoral reforms.  It amends the terms of reference of a constituency commission in section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997 by providing that the number of Members of the D&aacute;il, subject to the relevant provisions of the Constitution, shall be not less than 152 and not more than 160.  It provides for an amendment to be made to section 39(2) of the Electoral Act 1992 to provide that the writ for a D&aacute;il by-election shall be issued within six months of the vacancy occurring.  It also provides for amendments to the Electoral Act 1997 to provide for a reduction in the spending limit at a presidential election from &euro;1,300,000 to &euro;750,000 and for a reduction in the maximum amount that can be reimbursed to a candidate at a presidential election from &euro;260,000 to &euro;200,000.  The three measures are separate and distinct and all are important features of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to push ahead with much-needed electoral reform.</P>
        <P>I first will turn to the proposal to reduce the number of Members in the D&aacute;il, in respect of which the Government&rsquo;s position is quite clear.  It wishes to reduce the size and cost of government and the programme for Government has identified a &ldquo;clear need for our political system to embrace change, share the burden and lead by example&rdquo;.  Under the heading political reform &mdash; change must start at the top, the programme for Government states &ldquo;the political system cannot ask others to change and make sacrifices if it is not prepared to do the same&rdquo;.  A number of commitments have been made in the programme including one to reduce significantly the size of the Oireachtas and to reduce the number of Deputies following the publication of the 2011 census of population.  The proposals in this Bill regarding the terms of reference of a constituency commission respond to this commitment.  The preliminary census results were published by the Central Statistics Office last Thursday.  These results show that Ireland has a higher than average level of parliamentary representation, as with a population of more than 4.5 million and a combined D&aacute;il and Seanad of 226 Members, our representation level is one Member to 20,271 people.  This is out of line with other similar sized countries.  For example, in New Zealand the ratio is one member to 35,000 people and in Denmark it is one member to every 30,500 people.  It is worth noting that both these countries have unicameral parliamentary systems and the reduction in the number of Members set out in the Bill would bring Ireland into line with them, particularly if the Government&rsquo;s proposal to abolish the Seanad is approved by the people in a referendum.  This obviously would further reduce the number of parliamentarians by 60.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendment to the terms of reference of a constituency commission set out in the Bill would give a commission the option to recommend a set of D&aacute;il constituencies based on a minimum of 152 and a maximum of 160 Members.  While the provisions in the Bill will alter the terms of reference of a constituency commission, the overriding constitutional provisions relating to the number of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and equality of representation will remain unchanged.  Article 16.2.2&deg; of the Constitution provides that D&aacute;il representation &ldquo;shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population&rdquo;.  Article 16.2.3&deg; of the Constitution provides that &ldquo;The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.&rdquo;  If one applies the constitutional provisions to the new population figure, the minimum number of Deputies that can be recommended by a constituency commission, subject to enactment of the Bill by the Oireachtas, is 153, while the maximum number is 160.  Therefore, depending on what the com<Col N="462"/>mission recommends, there will be a reduction in D&aacute;il membership of between six and 13 from the current number of 166 Members.  Given the census results published on 30 June mean the lower figure of 152 in the Bill for the number of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is not feasible, I wish to signal to the House my intention to bring forward an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage.  The proposed amendment will set the range open to the commission at not lower than 153 and not more than 160.  We should legislate on the basis of the best information available.  In this case, the information that has emerged from the preliminary census results is that the minimum number of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann allowable under the constitutional provisions would be 153.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are eight possibilities in the range being given to a commission.  It is important to give this flexibility to a commission as it should assist the commission in adhering to the other terms of reference set out in the Electoral Act 1997.  These include avoiding the breaching of county boundaries as far as practicable, ensuring each constituency returns three, four or five Members and endeavouring to maintain continuity in relation to the arrangement of constituencies.</P>
        <P>Regarding costs, it is important to note the savings that will be realised by reducing the number of Members of the D&aacute;il.  The McCarthy report on public service numbers and expenditure programmes estimated a saving of some &euro;3 million with a reduction to 154 Members.  This estimate gives a good indication of the annual costs that can be expected to be saved by amending the terms of reference of the constituency commission in the manner proposed.  I wish to emphasise that the timing of this Bill is important.  As Members will be aware, last Thursday the CSO published preliminary results for census 2011.  The publication of these results triggers the establishment of a constituency commission by me, as Minister.  I have commenced the process of establishing the commission by writing to the Chief Justice seeking the nomination of a judge to chair the commission.  I intend to establish the commission formally once this Bill has been enacted.  This will ensure the commission will be working on devising a set of constituencies based on the reduced number of Deputies.</P>
        <P>One of the key elements of the work of the constituency commission will be the consultation process which the commission must undertake.  The provisions of the Electoral Act 1997 require a commission to allow at least three months for the making of submissions to it.  With the commission commencing work on the basis of preliminary census data, greater time is now made available than in the past for consultation with interested organisations and individuals.  This will ensure a fuller opportunity for political and wider public input to the revision process.  I urge people to avail of the opportunity to engage with the process when the commission invites submissions.</P>
        <P>The commission must complete its work not later than three months after the publication by the CSO of the final census results.  When the commission has presented its report to the Ceann Comhairle it will be a matter for me to bring forward legislation to address the recommendations of the constituency commission.  This is likely to be in autumn 2012.  Constituencies enacted at that point would have effect only after the dissolution of this D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The Bill also contains an amendment to the Electoral Act 1992 relating to the holding of D&aacute;il by-elections.  The proposed amendment ensures steps are taken to hold a by-election to fill any vacancy if the D&aacute;il has not moved within six months of the vacancy arising.  The current provision regarding D&aacute;il by-elections requires the Ceann Comhairle to instruct the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to issue a writ for the filling of the vacancy as soon as the D&aacute;il so directs.  However, there is no timeframe within which the D&aacute;il must act in relation to the filling of the vacancy.  This can and has led to some extraordinarily long delays in filling D&aacute;il vacancies, often for political expediency.  Recent examples include the 538-day duration of a vacancy in the Donegal <Col N="463"/>South-West constituency with Dublin South and Waterford not far behind at well over 300 days each.  Delays of this duration are simply not good enough in a parliamentary democracy.</P>
        <P>We need to ensure citizens are fully represented in the D&aacute;il even if this means taking measures to prevent Governments in power using their majority position in this House to further political objectives by blocking the filling of vacancies.  The people have a right to full democratic representation in their national Parliament.  Preventing this, as has happened in the past on a number of occasions, only damages the reputation and integrity of Irish political institutions.  I spoke on this theme in this House 12 months ago when I introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to address the situation.  Of course, that Bill did not receive majority support and we ended up with the ridiculous and costly solution of citizens taking their case to the courts.  We should not have the situation again in the future where people must go to the courts to ensure a by-election is held.  I am, therefore, taking the opportunity presented by this Bill to address the by-election issue directly.</P>
        <P>Specifically, the amendment I propose in this section is for a continuation of the existing arrangement during the six month period following the occurrence of the vacancy, namely, that the D&aacute;il, in its discretion, may direct the Ceann Comhairle to instruct the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to issue the writ at any time.  However, if the D&aacute;il has not availed of the opportunity during that six months, then at the end of that period, the Ceann Comhairle will be obliged to direct the Clerk to issue the writ.  This amendment will bring greater certainty to the process of filling vacancies.  While it will constrain the currently unfettered discretion of the D&aacute;il in this area, a period of six months within which the D&aacute;il will retain that discretion is more than reasonable.  Providing for a shorter period within which the D&aacute;il would be obliged to act might be considered too restrictive.  On the other hand, a longer period could not be justified when consideration is given to the general points I have already made with regard to the people&rsquo;s right to full democratic representation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The third measure in the Bill seeks to reduce spending limits and the amount of expenses that can be reimbursed to a candidate at a presidential election.  As Members will be aware, a presidential election is due to be held in 2011.  It must take place within the 60 days before the expiration of the term of office of the outgoing President, in other words between 11 September and 10 November 2011.  It is, therefore, timely, that the matter of the spending limit and the level of reimbursement of election expenses to apply to candidates be considered.  The measures contained in the Bill will have the effect of reducing the maximum amount that can be reimbursed from the Exchequer to a presidential election candidate from &euro;260,000 to &euro;200,000.  The spending limit at the 2011 presidential election and all subsequent presidential elections is also to be reduced from &euro;1,300,000 to &euro;750,000.  The reduction in the reimbursement payments will save the Exchequer money that can be put to better use elsewhere.  While it is not known at this stage how many candidates are likely to contest the 2011 presidential election, were three candidates to qualify for a reimbursement payment at the maximum rate, the total saving would be &euro;180,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding the reduction in the spending limit, the cost to candidates of running a presidential election campaign would be reduced by up to &euro;550,000 per candidate if he or she wishes to spend the amount allowable.  While this will not save the Exchequer money, the reduction is of symbolic significance in reducing costs associated with the election of the President of Ireland.  Candidates will have to run their respective election campaigns with reference to the reduced spending limits and moderate their election spending accordingly.  Political parties and candidates seeking election to office should lead by example and this is only right given the times in which we are living.</P><Col N="464"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill makes provision in primary legislation, through the Electoral Act 1997, for the setting of the maximum payment that can be made to a presidential election candidate in respect of the reimbursement of expenses.  It also sets out the qualifying criteria and administrative arrangements for the making of payments.  The Bill replaces the existing provisions in the Electoral Act 1997, which required that arrangements for the reimbursement of election expenses be put in place by regulations made by the Minister.  Statutory Instrument 442 of 2004 set the reimbursement level at &euro;260,000 and also specified the related administrative arrangements.  This statutory instrument is now repealed and its provisions are replaced by a new section 21A in the 1997 Act.  This new section largely replicates the administrative arrangements that were included in the statutory instrument.  The significant change is in respect of the maximum amount that can be claimed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill will also have the effect of consolidating into primary legislation, the Electoral Act 1997, the legal arrangements for the payment of election expenses to candidates at a presidential election where there are equivalent existing provisions that apply in respect of elections to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Currently, a candidate who receives votes in excess of one quarter of the quota at a presidential election can claim a reimbursement of election expenses up to a maximum of &euro;260,000.  After the election in 2011, an application is submitted through the Standards in Public Office Commission with payment being made by the Department of Finance through the Central Fund.  The same key qualifying criterion of receiving one quarter of the quota will apply under the revised provisions, as will the administrative arrangements for submitting an application for payment.  Similar arrangements are in place for D&aacute;il and European Parliament elections.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 21(2) of the Electoral Act 1997 made provision for the level of reimbursement to apply at a presidential election to be set by regulations made by the Minister.  These regulations came into effect on 14 July 2004 and first applied at the presidential election scheduled to take place in 2004.  In the event, President McAleese was returned unopposed and no claim or payment for the reimbursement of election expenses was made.  With the spending limit at a presidential election also being reduced from &euro;1,300,000 to &euro;750,000 as part of this Bill, it is appropriate that the level of reimbursement of expenses be reduced also.  While there was no provision for the reimbursement of election expenses at the last contested presidential election in 1997, by applying the relevant qualifying criteria, three candidates would have been able to claim a reimbursement.  Should three candidates qualify for the reimbursement of expenses at the maximum level at the 2011 presidential election, the total saving would be up to &euro;180,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme for Government makes reference to the application of spending limits at a presidential election, in the following terms:</P>
        <P LI="1">we will introduce spending limits for all elections, including Presidential elections and constitutional referendums, including for a period in advance of scheduled Local, European, General and Presidential elections respectively.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">At a presidential election the agent of each candidate is required to furnish a statement of election expenses to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  This statement must be submitted within 56 days of polling day and must include details of the candidate&rsquo;s spending at a presidential election.  When running their campaigns and submitting statements of election expenses, candidates will now be required to stay within the revised spending limit of &euro;750,000.  It will be an offence for an election agent or candidate to exceed the spending limit.  This change will send out a strong signal that those involved in public life are committed to moderating their own expenditure, thereby showing a positive example to others.  Reducing the election spending <Col N="465"/>limit is of symbolic significance in demonstrating the willingness of those involved in public life to scale back their spending on elections.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 53(1) of Part VI of the Electoral Act 1997 provides for the spending limit to apply at a presidential election to be specified by an order to be made by the Minister.  The order setting the spending limit at &euro;1.3 million was signed on 14 July 2004.  As I mentioned, at the presidential election in 2004 President McAleese was returned unopposed and as a consequence there no data on spending at previous presidential elections.  However, a lot has changed in this country since 2004 when the current spending limit was set and there is a clear case for its substantial reduction.  To do this requires that a change be made in the primary legislation.  That is why I propose to amend the Electoral Act 1997.  Bearing in mind the current economic circumstances facing the country, it is important we lead by example and moderate our spending.</P>
        <P>I will outline briefly the specific contents of each section in the Bill.  Section 1 contains definitions.  Section 2 inserts a new section 39(2A) into the Electoral Act 1992.  The new provision provides that where, after a period of six months from the date of a vacancy arising in the D&aacute;il, the D&aacute;il has failed to direct the Chairman of the D&aacute;il to instruct the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to issue the writ for a by-election, the Chairman shall so instruct the Clerk as soon as is practicable.</P>
        <P>Section 3 amends section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997.  The amendment revises the terms of reference of a constituency commission which will now be required to recommend D&aacute;il constituencies based on a reduced number of Members.  I have already signalled my intention to table an amendment on Committee Stage to provide for a range of between 153 and 160 Members.  The number of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann recommended by the constituency commission will still be subject to the limits set out in the Constitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 4 deletes provisions currently in sections 21(2)(<i>a</i>) and 2(4) of the Electoral Act 1997 that enable the Minister to put in place regulations to provide for the reimbursement of expenses to a candidate at a presidential election.  Revised arrangements are being made in section 5 of the Bill, which will insert a new section 21A into the Electoral Act 1997.  Section 5 provides that the maximum amount which can be reimbursed to a candidate at a presidential election is &euro;200,000.  It makes provision in primary legislation, through the Electoral Act 1997, for the setting of the maximum payment that can be made to a presidential election candidate in respect of the reimbursement of expenses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 6 provides that the spending limit at a presidential election shall not exceed &euro;750,000.  It makes provision in primary legislation, through an amendment to the Electoral Act 1997, for the spending limit to apply at a presidential election and replaces the existing section 53 of the 1997 Act.  Section 7 provides for consequential amendments to the Electoral Act 1997 arising from the provisions in sections 4 to 6, inclusive, of the Bill.  Finally, section 8 contains standard provisions of a general nature dealing with the Title, construction and citation of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Deputies will know the Government has outlined an ambitious programme for constitutional and electoral reform.  The programme for Government commits to a radical overhaul of the way Irish politics and government work.  It sets out a wide-ranging series of commitments to this end, a number of which are within my area of ministerial responsibility.  I am committed to working with my Government colleagues and all Oireachtas Members to implement these measures in full.  In taking forward the measures set out in the Bill, I am conscious that a piecemeal approach to electoral reform may not generally be the most productive approach.  However, I also believe these are important and timely reforms that should be introduced now rather than put on the long finger.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is a disappointing Bill.  I agree with one of the concluding remarks made by the Minister, namely, that a piecemeal approach to electoral reform is not generally the most productive approach.  He is acknowledging that it is a bad piece of work and I commend him for saying that.  I have to make a number of political points.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael promised to cut the number of Deputies by 20, which was a populist and high profile approach before the election.  It also promised to abolish the Seanad, a question which remains unanswered.  It sought to reduce the number of Ministers of State and has not done so.  It promised there would be no more bank recapitalisation, that it would burn the bondholders, that there would be no more increases in taxation and that the Minister would be responsible for bringing in a suite of backdoor taxes on the population.</P>
        <P>We discuss hospitals here every day of the week.  We can now see the effects of what the Government is doing to hospital services around the country.  It has the wherewithal to address the issue financially.  It has introduced measures in the House such as the pension levy to raise more money and has made political decisions and decided on political priorities such as funding the removal of the air travel tax rather than keeping accident and emergency departments open.  It is yet another U-turn.</P>
        <P>It stated it would reduce the number of Deputies by 20, which I do not agree with and on which it is now reneging.  The Bill is ill thought out.  When it was published it immediately offended the Constitution.  The Bill gives the constituency commission a band of 152 to 160.  The Government has acknowledged that it jumped the gun on the census figures.  Where did it get the band from?  What rationale and logic was applied in arriving at those numbers?  It is fundamentally undemocratic and will dilute democracy.</P>
        <P>The Government is equating the number of Members by adding the number of Deputies and Senators and coming up with a Member to population ratio which does not reflect the current situation.  It is reducing the number of Deputies which is fundamentally undemocratic.  Our party&rsquo;s proposal during the general election was to discuss a total reform package.  A piecemeal approach, as the Minister acknowledged, is not the way to address the issue.  If we are serious, we should have a complete debate on reform in the House on the D&aacute;il, Seanad, committee system and local government.  Let us debate the whole package and not have a piecemeal approach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We proposed a single-seat constituency arrangement, supplemented by a list system which allowed for gender balance.  We also proposed an idea whereby if a Member of the D&aacute;il was asked to serve in government, an alternate would be placed to do his or her work as a Deputy in order that he or she would not be double-jobbing as both a member of Government and constituency Deputy.  I want to put the Minister on notice that we will table a number of amendments, one of which concerns the number of Deputies indicated in the banding.  It is worthwhile to note that the Labour Party has been silent on this issue.  In the pre-election period it rubbished the idea of cutting the number of Deputies.  There is one Labour Party Deputy in the House who may contribute to the debate.  It was on the record in terms of keeping the number of Deputies and democracy.</P><Col N="467"/>
        <P Just="Left">It is correct to focus on spending limits for presidential elections.  There will be a presidential election in a number of months.  The current limit of &euro;1.5 million until the Bill changes it is quite high because, due to the nature of the contest, candidates enjoy a significant amount of what could be termed free media, exposure and publicity.  The spending limits are quite high and it is correct to reduce them but we should go further.  A sum of &euro;750,000 is a lot to spend on an individual campaign, given the amount of free media and exposure that is enjoyed by candidates.  From that point of view, the limit should be closer to &euro;500,000.  I know that will not suit political parties, but it will suit the Independents.</P>
        <P>I would be interested to know whether the Minister intends to introduce his legislation to reduce corporate donations and the amount that people can contribute to political parties.</P>

Our local authority members throughout the country have been mandated, where they feel they can, to offer a presidential nomination to people who request it.  I think that is right.  I do not think that local authority members should block anyone from participating in the democratic process.</P>
        <P>The boundary commission will be established on similar lines to its predecessor in terms of its membership.  Has any consideration been given to producing an interim report or will we just see a final report?  As the Minister knows, constituency boundaries have been contentious during the years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Look at Limerick.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue has arisen in Leitrim and in my constituency.  What was west Limerick is now part of Limerick, while another part went into north Kerry.  The same applies to south Offaly, east Carlow and west Waterford which went in with Tipperary.  County boundaries have not been recognised in parts of the country and therefore it is a highly contentious matter.  We should tighten up the terms of reference.  I know the Minister is asking the commission to adhere to county boundaries where possible and practical, but we should examine a mechanism to make it tighter.  Due to the urban sprawl of the greater Dublin area, it has spilled over into neighbouring counties.  In rural areas, however, the breaching of county boundaries is a bigger issue.  The last occasion it arose was in the south Offaly example.  From that point of view, we will have to examine the possibility of tightening up the terms of reference involved.</P>
        <P>The proposal to run by-elections within six months of a vacancy occurring is a good one.  We are generally in agreement with that idea, which is the right thing to do.  We should not tie our hands completely on the six-month period, however, if we are running close to a local or European Parliament election.  If, for example, the six-month limit arose three before a local or European election, it might make sense to have some discretion to defer the by-election for a further three months.  This might make for a more efficient running of the event.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We will be opposing the Bill on a number of fronts.  We will also be tabling a number of amendments, namely, on the number of Deputies, presidential election spending limits and the production of an interim report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Niall Collins for sharing his time.  The Bill gives us an opportunity to make some points about the boundary commission as well as commenting on the Minister&rsquo;s address.  When it comes to the presidential election, I am sure the Minister will have to support Avril Doyle in my constituency.  I am making a play for her here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Thanks very much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to know the Deputy is crossing the floor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Knowing the former Deputy, Avril Doyle, I am sure she is well able to fight her own cause.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill deals with the boundary commission, a reduction of funds for the presidential election, and holding by-elections within six months.  I welcome the fact that in future by-elections will be held within six months of a vacancy arising.  Previous Governments, including Fianna <Col N="469"/>F&aacute;il ones and others, have delayed by-elections as long as possible where they have not suited the political situation at the time.  We have all been guilty of ensuring by-elections have not been held, thus not giving an opportunity for the electorate to elect a Deputy when a vacancy occurred.  It is important that by-elections are held within a set timeframe.  There are times, for example, if the six-month deadline was close to a general election, when it might make common sense not to hold the by-election, but other than that example I welcome the six-monthlimit.</P>
        <P>The boundary commission&rsquo;s drafting of constituency boundaries has been a bugbear of mine for quite a long time.  I have argued with previous Ministers with responsibility for the environment about this matter and we have had a number of them in the past 14 years.  When the commission makes its recommendation or comes forward with a report, I understand the Minister of the day has the right to accept or reject it.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point in his reply.  Some of the decisions taken in the past by the commission were not good for constituency politics.  In recent years, we had the farcical situation where Leitrim was divided down the middle and had no Deputy at one stage.  That caused problems in the area and it also happened in other constituencies.  We have parts of Carlow in Wicklow, while parts of Limerick went into Kerry.  I am not sure it is the right way to go.  I know it is difficult to draw up constituency boundaries that suit everyone but common sense should prevail.  Will the Minister clarify whether he can reject the commission&rsquo;s proposals if he is unhappy with how the constituencies are divided up?  He might come in for some political criticism if he tried to change things once an independent boundary commission has drafted them, but common sense must prevail.</P>
        <P>To a certain extent, the Minister has tied the boundary commission&rsquo;s hands by saying that there must be three, four or five-seat constituencies.  Have the Minister and his officials considered the possibility of having six or even seven-seat constituencies?  Why is he confining it to three, four or five-seat constituencies?  I understand there were six and seven-seat constituencies in previous times.  The commission will face considerable difficulty in trying to avoid breaching county boundaries.  It should be able to get around some of the problems by adopting guidelines that each constituency shall be composed of contiguous areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The make-up of the commission is also important.  The Chief Justice, Mr. John Murray, will be asked by the Minister to nominate the chair of the commission.  In line with past practice, the commission will be made up of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, the Clerk of the Seanad, the Ombudsman and the Secretary General of the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  I wonder if the make-up of the boundary commission could be extended to include an ordinary citizen of the State.  Why should membership of the commission be confined to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, Clerk of the Seanad, the Ombudsman, the Secretary General of the Minister&rsquo;s Department and a judge?  I have no problem with a judge heading up the commission but the Minister should consider breaking with tradition and appointing an ordinary citizen of the State to the commission.  I ask that the Minister consider this.</P>
        <P>Census 2011, as published recently by the Minister, records that Ireland&rsquo;s population now stands at 4.5 million, an increase of approximately 400,000 when compared with census 2006.  Census 2006 recorded Ireland&rsquo;s population at 4.2 million, the first time since 1871 our population rose above 4 million.  Also, census 2011 records a population increase of 100,000 more people than predicted by the Central Statistics Office.  It is stated in the programme for Government that the Government proposes, by way of D&aacute;il reform, to reduce the number of Deputies in this House.  I wonder if that is wise now given the approximately 400,000 increase in population.  I may perhaps be one of a minority in this House but I do not agree with the proposal to reduce the number of Deputies.  All 166 Members of this House during my time as a Member <Col N="470"/>and down through the years have served the people well, regardless of their political affiliations.  Despite the criticism Members get from time to time from the general public the people love their representatives.  They certainly like to have them make representations in this House on their behalf.</P>

If the maximum reduction is not made &mdash; I doubt that the commission will agree to the maximum reduction &mdash; the saving will be much less.</P>
        <P>The Minister might clarify if one of the reasons the Government has not gone down the route of the 20 Deputy reduction is because such a reduction would affect the west more than any other part of the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The new provision in the Bill that a by-election must be held within six months is long overdue and as such, we welcome it.  It will put a stop to the practice of Governments not holding by-elections for fear that they will lose a seat.  It is nothing short of an affront to democracy to leave people unrepresented for months on end in that manner.  We should not forget that this provision is the result of Deputy Pearse Doherty of Sinn F&eacute;in having to take a court challenge in order for a by-election to be held.  Pat the Cope Gallagher stood down in June 2009 in order to take a seat as an MEP.  The then Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government left the seat vacant until the High Court ruled in November 2010 that there had been an unreasonable delay in holding the by-election.  By-elections that should have been held in Dublin South, Waterford and Donegal North-East never took place, depriving voters in these constituencies of adequate representation, because of the cowardice of a Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government which was running scared of the people.  It prevaricated when it came to holding the by-elections because it was sure it would lose the seats, as if it had a God-given right to hold on to them.  That was one of the fundamental problems with that Government &mdash; it spent far too much time thinking it was entitled to do whatever it wanted because it had been in power for so long and to hell with the rest of us.</P>
        <P>It is baffling, therefore, that, even as the Minister brings forward the proposal to impose a six-month deadline for the setting of a by-election date, which we fully support, the Government is still appealing the High Court decision on the holding of the by-election in Donegal South-West to the Supreme Court.  The by-election was held nine months ago and we have had a general election since.  It seems farcical and is a waste of taxpayers&rsquo; resources that the Government is paying for an appeal to the Supreme Court in this matter.  I am asking the Minister to take the opportunity to announce that it is withdrawing the appeal.</P>
        <P>Why has the Minister chosen to introduce a six-month deadline?  While we welcome the provision to hold by-elections within six months, why has the Government stipulated that it be six months?  Why should an by-election not be held within four or five months?  The general election was called in a matter of three to four weeks.  We were all out on the hustings and 165 Deputies were elected.  Is there a particular reason it takes so long to hold a by-election?</P>

	<P>It is to show respect for families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is considerable arbitrary number-plucking from the sky.  We take serious issue with the proposal to cut the number of Deputies from 166 to between 152 and 160.  In the absence of a comprehensive overhaul and strengthening of local government structures, it makes no sense to reduce the number of Deputies.  While we accept the need for money-saving proposals, if this is such a proposal, we would prefer to see the pay of Deputies being reduced rather than the number of Deputies.  Will reducing the number of Deputies make the D&aacute;il more representative?  Will it empower Deputies to act as legislators?  Will it improve the position in terms of the scandalous under-representation of women in the Oireachtas?  Will it assist the D&aacute;il in holding the Executive to account?  If there are 155 Deputies instead of 166, will this enable more scrutiny of State bodies and agencies?  The reality is, as the Minister is well aware, that it will do none of these things.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s first 100 days have passed and there is little to show for it beyond a few gimmicks and a pile of U-turns, but this legislation will allow the Minister to pose as a reformer.  It is all about being seen to be doing something.  When the Minister is asked what Fine Gael and the Labour Party have done to reform politics, he will be able to point to reducing the number of Deputies.  It hardly amounts to reform when we will merely have 20 fewer saying <Col N="475"/>the same thing as before.  In Fine Gael&rsquo;s election manifesto the proposal to reduce the number of Deputies by 20 which the Minister has acknowledged is unconstitutional is directly linked with the need for the political class to be seen to be making sacrifices during this time of economic crisis.  My party shares this sentiment.  However, if Fine Gael and the Labour Party are serious about providing political leadership at a time when so many are facing cuts, they should support the legislation proposed by Deputy Doherty.  The Reduction in Pay and Allowances of Government and Oireachtas Members Bill 2011 would cut the Taoiseach&rsquo;s and the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s pay by 30%, Ministers&rsquo; pay by 27% and the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s pay by 36%.  In addition, it seeks to reduce the pay of Ministers of State and other officeholders by a scale ranging from 20% to 31% and to cut the basic salary of Deputies and Senators by 19% and 9%, respectively.  We are also proposing to eliminate the perks and privileges of Whips and committee Chairmen that they hold dear.</P>
<TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">In advance of budget 2011 Social Justice Ireland called on all Deputies to vote against any reduction in welfare rates.  It produced research that showed the take-home pay of Deputies had increased enormously since 1986, while unemployment benefit rates had risen by only &euro;143.73 in the same period.  Ministers&rsquo; take-home pay in the same period had risen by &euro;1,200 a week.  If there ever were a collection of people in the State who were due a serious pay cut, it is the Members of this House.  The savings made would be far greater than those that will be achieved by way of Fine Gael&rsquo;s target of reducing the number of Deputies by 20.  If this is all about cutting costs, why not cut them in a way that would not undermine the ability of the Oireachtas to do its job and demonstrates real political leadership?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week the CSO published preliminary census figures.  They show that the population of the State now stands at 4,581,269.  Article 16 of the Constitution specifies that the number of Deputies must not be less than one Member for every 30,000 people.  The figure of 152 proposed as the minimum in this legislation would be unconstitutional were it to be set by the commission, as it is slightly less than the 1:30,000 ratio.</P>
        <P>These proposals also do not seem to take population growth into account.  The rate of population growth in the past five years was 8.1%, according to the census.  If this rate continues, we can expect the population of the State to be just under 5 million by 2016.  If we divide the 2016 figure, which would be 4,952,351, by the figure of 30,000 specified in Article 16 of the Constitution, we get a figure of 165, which is almost exactly the number of Deputies we have now and the minimum we would need to be in line with the Constitution at that point.  However, under section 3 of the legislation, the maximum size of the D&aacute;il would be set at 160 Deputies, less than the likely constitutional minimum in five years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister explain whether he believes the rate of population growth will slow down and outline his evidence for this to the House?  Considering that data from the ESRI in June stated that we have the highest birth rate per head of population in the European Union, I do not understand how this will happen.  The population of Laois has increased by 20% in the past five years.  The Minister acknowledged the consequences of this population growth when he visited the Portlaoise area to open a new stretch of road recently.  Laois-Offaly needs to remain a five-seat constituency as the combined population in the census figures, when they are published, will show the population of the two counties together is now 157,464 in total.  Will we have to revisit this legislation in five years when we realise that our electoral law and the Constitution are contradictory?</P>
        <P>This proposal is nothing short of populist nonsense.  In theory, one could agree with the reduction in the number of Deputies if there was a fundamental overhaul of how local govern<Col N="476"/>ment was structured and organised.  If it was to be reformed, strengthened and empowered to do what is necessary, then one could effectively redistribute the democratic representation between State and local government.  This is not what the Government proposes, however.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am at a loss as to how the Government expects a smaller number of Deputies to represent effectively what will be effectively larger geographic constituencies with higher populations.  Does the Government expect that people will suddenly stop attending Deputies&rsquo; constituency clinics with issues that local government cannot effectively resolve, including many issues referred to by a previous speaker?  The strengthening and reform of local government is an essential prerequisite to even a discussion around the reduction of the numbers of Deputies.  This is Mickey Mouse reform; it does nothing but give the Minister some other issue on which to put out a statement.</P>
        <P>It is less than a year since the Joint Committee on the Constitution, which included members of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party, published its review of the electoral system in which it examined suggestions to reduce the number of Deputies.  It found that &ldquo;...a reduction in the current number of members of the D&aacute;il would hamper the effectiveness of members in performing the collective parliamentary functions of the House as a whole... [and] ...would also affect the proportionality and representativeness of the D&aacute;il&rdquo;.  Did the Minister consider this report, which five of his party colleagues signed up to, before bringing this legislation forward?  Will he explain why he has seen fit to ignore the recommendations on this issue and what evidence he has uncovered to contradict the proposals from the committee?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am disappointed that the constituency commission has not been allowed to consider increasing the number of seats per constituency, although this would involve enlarging the geographical area of constituencies rather than increasing the number of Deputies, as has happened before in the State.  This would ensure a much more accurate representation of the public&rsquo;s voting intentions based on their percentage vote, in contrast to the current system that favours the largest parties, particularly in three-seat and four-seat constituencies.  I welcome that the last Fianna F&aacute;il speaker acknowledged this would be a good idea, which may be due to the reduced size of Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The report of the Joint Committee on the Constitution highlighted an increasing trend towards the creation of three-seat constituencies, which it was argued make it more difficult, for example, for women candidates to get elected.  The committee also examined the wealth of international evidence to show that increasing the number of seats per constituency has a positive effect on the representation of women and minorities, and results in a parliament that is more representative of voters&rsquo; choices.  It was a little timid in its recommendation to set the number of Deputies per constituency at never less than four, since we should consider five-seat constituencies.  However, it was at least a move in the right direction, if a small one.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To return to my earlier point, why are we proceeding with a proposal to cut the number of Deputies?  How will it improve accountability in public life or the functioning of the Oireachtas?  Why will the D&aacute;il work better and citizens be better represented if there are fewer of us?  The Deputies who most welcome this have said it is evidence that the Government is committed to &ldquo;real political reform.&rdquo;  Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in heralded the proposed change by stating: &ldquo;At a time when tens of thousands of Irish men and women have had to make significant sacrifices in their daily lives in order to cope with job loss or emigration, it is heartening to see politics changing as well.&rdquo;  I ask the Deputies who share this view what exactly will be the impact of this proposed Bill on the lives of those who are struggling to pay their mortgages and put food on the table, or are currently considering emigrating.</P><Col N="477"/>
        <P>One cannot simply reduce the number of Deputies and assert that this is &ldquo;political reform&rdquo; without some kind of justification for it.  To have the Government reply &ldquo;Because I said so&rdquo; is not an option.  That is the response one would give a five-year-old who does not want to go to bed, not an adult electorate which wants to know why a reduction in the number of Deputies is &ldquo;reforming&rdquo;.  If this is about cost, and cost alone, then let us cut costs properly.  Let us drastically cut the pay and allowances of our elected representatives and Ministers.  Sinn F&eacute;in is ready and willing to do this, and has proposed legislation.  We ask all parties in the House to support us.  There was much talk about accountability and reform during the general election campaign in February.  I hope it was more than just political posturing and that the other parties will support that Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.</P>
        <P>If the Government seriously wants to reform the Oireachtas and our electoral system, let us all work together to do this.  Let us do it properly, together and in a meaningful way, instead of as part of some pathetic, panicked, populist rush from the period before an election, and let us try to show that the incoming Government will do something other than U-turns.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Does this Parliament need to reduce the cost of doing its business?  Without question, it does.  All of us said to the public that the cost of running Parliament must be reduced, and that the public is entitled to see better value for the money it spends on its Parliament.  Does the nation need less democracy?  No, it most assuredly does not.  The mistake in the Bill is the confused and confusing view that to have better value for money and a reduction in the cost of Parliament, we must have a reduction in the number of Deputies.  That is a simplistic proposal and it will not have the desired effect.  I acknowledge that we need to reduce costs but we certainly do not need less democracy in this country.  When I made my maiden speech in this House, I was almost an extinct species as a Deputy who happens to live in County Leitrim.  People do not understand the total population of County Leitrim is approximately equal to the average population per Deputy.  When a Government or a commission splits that county down the middle, it becomes virtually impossible for a person living in either of the two parts of a now divided and weakened county to be elected to the D&aacute;il.  The Taoiseach kindly described me as the exception who proves the rule but my election does not right the wrong visited on the people of Leitrim.  I see nothing in this Bill that would right that wrong.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to &ldquo;avoiding the breaching of county boundaries as far as practicable, ensuring each constituency returns three, four or five Members and endeavouring to maintain continuity in relation to the arrangement of constituencies&rdquo;.  However, the terms of reference of the constituency commission, which is set out in the Electoral Act 1997, state: &ldquo;the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable&rdquo;.  In 2010, the Joint Committee on the Constitution recommended: &ldquo;in drawing constituencies according to the required representation ratio, due regard be had to natural and/or county boundaries&rdquo;.  It is recognised that the breaching of county boundaries causes problems for Members, candidates and voters.  Both politicians and political scientists have pointed out problems such as electoral alienation and low turnout.  I do not see anything in the Bill that would result in significant changes to this.  I hope I am wrong but I will seek to beef up the provision that breaches of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We speak about three, four and five-seat constituencies as if there is something inherently wrong with six-seat constituencies.  We should not tie the commission&rsquo;s hands by recommending smaller constituencies.  There is nothing illegal, unethical or inherently wrong about six-seat constituencies and, if they offer commission members a fairer alternative to arranging the distribution of constituencies, why should we restrict them?  Our aim should be to make it <Col N="478"/>easy for commission members to do the right thing by ensuring each county has at least one representative in order that we can strengthen democracy on this island.</P>

	<P>There is nothing surer than the need for political reform.  The people of this country desperately want reform and for their politicians to be brought down to earth, taken out of the bubble of the Houses of the Oireachtas and planted with their feetfirmly in the ground where ordinary citizens are forced to suffer the effects of bad political decisions.</P>
        <P>In the context of the obvious need for accountability and politicians who are responsive to the needs and wishes of the public, this Bill and almost anything the Members of this D&aacute;il might say is virtually irrelevant because of the EU-IMF package which hands over the control of this country to the unaccountable representatives of bankers and bondholders who care nothing about ordinary people.  This Bill merely shifts the deck chairs on the sinking <i>Titanic</i> of the economy and Irish society.  It does not even proceed in the direction of addressing the need for political reform.  The measure to ensure by-elections are called within six months is reasonable, if overdue, and it is also reasonable to reduce the spending limits on presidential elections.  I support the abolition of the Seanad because it is an elitist institution which does not represent every sector of society.  The question remains of how to develop a political system that genuinely represents the people.  Can we achieve that aim by providing less democracy and public representation or do we need more democracy and better and more responsive representation?  The Seanad should be replaced by another tier of democracy composed of genuinely elected representatives of all sectors of society.  As non-professional politicians, these representatives would not be paid but they would have real powers over local services and issues, as well as oversight of this House.</P>
        <P>The plan to reduce the number of Deputies goes in the wrong direction.  Savings of &euro;3 million have been suggested as the maximum that can be achieved from this measure.  We all want to cut the cost of government but, given the obscene level of remuneration that many politicians and Ministers receive, why do we not cut their pay?  We could save far more than &euro;3 million by cutting the pay of politicians.  If we did so, they would also be more responsive to ordinary people because the big problem is that they are unaffected by the decisions they make over the lives and incomes of others.  If our pay and conditions were more closely aligned to that of the average citizen, perhaps this House would be more representative of the needs and aspirations of ordinary people.  To put it simply, instead of reducing the number of public representatives we should be cutting politicians&rsquo; pay, expenses and leaders&rsquo; allowances.  It would not only be fair in itself to cut the pay of politicians at a time when they are slashing the incomes of ordinary people, but it might also make them more wary of imposing austerity on those who cannot afford it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like other speakers, I welcome certain aspects of this Bill.  Section 2, which requires the calling of a by-election within six months, is a dramatic improvement, but I concur with those who asked why the period cannot be shortened to four months.  I am not sure where the point comes from, but it is obviously a step in the right direction.  The lowering of expenditure in presidential elections &mdash; what can be spent and recouped &mdash; is also welcome, but, again, it is not enough.  I will be tabling amendments in this regard.  There will be three <Col N="479"/>constituencies for European elections and the reimbursement figure is &euro;38,000 per constituency, which gives a figure of &euro;114,000 to be recouped.  Why are we allowing a figure of &euro;200,000 for presidential elections, even if that is a step in the right direction?</P>
        <P>The main problem with the Bill is in section 3 and the Government&rsquo;s stunt in reducing the number of Deputies and revising the terms of reference for the constitutional commission.  This is nothing more than a gimmick dressed up as reform.  The point has been made that the parties opposite in fighting the general election stated they would reduce the number of Deputies by 20, but now they shrug their shoulders and tell us that they can only reduce the number by 16 and that even that is in breach of the Constitution.  There were methods for changing the Constitution if it was a serious proposal, but, of course, it was no such thing.  It was just an illusion that Fine Gael and the Labour Party were trying to clean up the political system, whereas the reality is that this proposal will make the system less accountable and democratic.</P>
        <P>It is very easy for us to pick figures arbitrarily from other countries or use European averages to justify the argument that in Ireland we are over-represented.  However, we are not comparing like with like, especially given the way in which the population in Ireland is dispersed along the east coast, particularly around Dublin.  We have a very different system of governance.  This is one of the few countries without regional authorities to engage in serious decision-making.  Let us be honest about it; we do not have real local government either.  This Chamber has stripped these bodies of their decision-making powers.  If the Government was really serious about reform, it would be starting from the bottom up and ensuring involvement in decision-making at local level.  Instead, what we have is a stunt.</P>
        <P>It is not the number of Deputies that annoys people but the fact that people often do not know who they are or what they do.  What really galls them is the amount of money Deputies are paid.  We are told this is about money, but that is nonsense.  If the Government was to remove 16 Deputies, the salary saving would be around &euro;1.5 million a year.  If it was to reduce the salaries of 166 Deputies to the average industrial wage which would make Members appreciate the living conditions of ordinary people, it would save &euro;9 million a year.  This does not include the allowances parties receive, the staff they receive and so on.  The Government could make radical savings of tens of millions of euro every year if this was all about money, but, of course, it is not.  It is an attack on democracy and is undermining the democratic process.  We know the real outcome of a reduction in the number of Deputies would statistically hurt the small parties and Independents more than the bigger parties which have larger resources and the bigger machines.  Having larger constituencies tends to benefit smaller parties more.</P>
        <P>The carving up of constituencies by the boundary commission was one of the biggest insults to democracy in Ireland.  Members have spoken about counties being carved up.  I come from Swords, the so-called capital of the county of Fingal, which was partitioned in the last electoral boundary review.  Such an affront to democracy must be corrected this time.  Towns cannot be partitioned and included in diverse geographical areas.  This is unsustainable and must be taken into account in the electoral boundary review in order to overcome the democratic deficit, the outcome of the last review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am looking for vision in political reform, but I do not see it.  We are seeing piecemeal changes, some of which are welcome.  If we are to rebuild our democracy, we must have a vision for the democracy we want to see in five or ten years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill provides for a reduction in expenditure to &euro;750,000 for a presidential election candidate, which I welcome.  However, we could go further.  The recoupable amount is &euro;250,000; therefore, from where will the other &euro;500,000 come?  It will come from corporate donations <Col N="480"/>and so on.  We cannot criticise this and then allow an amount which provides no option for serious candidates but to raise funds in that way.</P>
        <P>We would not be looking at a change in the by-election system were it not for the fact that a court case was taken.  Every excuse under the sun was given for not holding a by-election the last time around when the Government claimed it was too busy.  I took a seat in a by-election and know that on the vast majority of days when a candidate is out canvassing he or she will not see anybody from the Government.  Government politicians show up on the last weekend, on which I could write the book.  The Government was just trying to give excuses because it did not want to go before the electorate.</P>
        <P>The Bill to redraw constituencies should always postdate the census.  The Government excelled itself this time by publishing the Bill before the findings of the census were made available and then discovered that the figure of 152 would make the Bill repugnant to the Constitution.  Each vote for each citizen should be equal.  I felt so strongly about this issue that with Deputy Finian McGrath I commenced a constitutional challenge in 2007 after the 2006 census figures had showed wide variations in constituencies.  The 2006 census figures were not used in redrawing boundaries.  That challenge was successful and had the effect of changing the law; therefore, the preliminary census figures are now being used to trigger a redrawing of constituencies which will take practical effect in 2016, or whenever the Government ceases to have the support of the Parliament.  Given the size of the Government, it looks like it could happen in 2016.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If there were 152 Deputies in the D&aacute;il, there would be one Deputy per 30,140 people.  The Constitution states the figure cannot be more than 30,000.  If the population keeps growing, it is inevitable that there will have to be a referendum to change the provision, as the Constitution is clearly restrictive.</P>
        <P>People get annoyed when they hear about proposed changes such as the abolition of the Seanad or a reduction in the number of Deputies by 20, when those proposing the changes do not even look at the Constitution.  Almost every second page of the Constitution contains a provision about the Seanad; therefore, changes are going to require a referendum.</P>
        <P>There is no mention of political parties in the Constitution, yet the Standing Orders of the House and electoral funding provisions are to the benefit of parties, as opposed to Independent Members.  There has been much talk in recent weeks about the leader&rsquo;s allowance paid to Independent Members.  I have no difficulty in being held to account for my expenditure, as all public moneys should be accounted for.  However, astronomical figures are transferred from the State to run political parties.  If we are to have genuine political reform, we must go much further than this Bill goes, which is what people want.  We must sketch out a vision.  We must put in place local government rather than the local administration we have because people want to have some control over their lives and that is the place to start.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome this Bill in the very narrow sense that it is good as far as it goes but it does not go far enough.  I question one aspect of it which everyone accepts so readily, that is, the setting up of the electoral commission.  I noted what Deputy Browne said that all the great and the good are put onto this commission, including the Ombudsman, a High Court judge, the Clerks of the D&aacute;il and of the Seanad and others.  He asked why in the name of God an ordinary person, whatever that is, is not put onto it.  I agree with him but it should be more than one person.  Perhaps the Minister will respond to this.  Why do we not <Col N="481"/>have a majority of citizens decide on what the electoral boundaries will be?  Why do we not have a majority of six or seven citizens on the commission who would outnumber those who know more about the nuts and bolts?</P>
        <P>It is not very fashionable to say this but High Court judges who are put in charge of sensitive areas of this sort are not immune from political pressures and there is no point pretending they are.  Just because someone is a High Court judge does not mean he or she is politically untouchable.  There is a great temptation for all Governments, in particular the last one, to say they are appointing a High Court judge to the chair and, therefore, it is all right.</P>
        <P>Everyone knows High Court judges, in particular, are politically appointed and they are also subject to political pressure because if they want to go on to the Supreme Court, that promotion is politically controlled also.  I am not saying any abuse is intended in this Bill, but it must be acknowledged that law of this sort is made for bad Governments and not for good ones.  It is made in order that it passes the test of time and cannot be abused.</P>
        <P>I do not accept that this commission or its membership should be set in stone.  The same should be said of clerks, civil servants and the secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, a very sensitive position which should be pointed out also as being subject to political pressure, and the Ombudsman.  I believe all Ombudsmen serve at least one term.</P>
        <P>It would be open to any government to apply pressure, whether for reappointment or otherwise, on people on this commission.  Everyone in this House knows there is constantly talk of appointing tame judges and tame people to commissions of this sort who will come out with the right result which will give advantages to the government in power.  Time and again, commissions have been set up and the results of those commissions have been questionable because of the political input into them.  That is the reality and not something that is said.</P>
        <P>The Minister should consider at the very least widening the basis of this commission by putting people onto it who do not have a vested interest, who are paid by the State, who cannot have pressure put on them by the political party in power and who are not identifiable, as judges so often are, as being attached or having loyalties to the political party in power.</P>
        <P>This is a tidying up Bill and, as such, it should be welcomed.  It attacks three principal aspects of our electoral law.  Does the Government intend it to be the forerunner of many Bills to come to tackle the electoral law?  I have a different view from my colleagues on some of these issues.  I do not particularly like the idea of multi-seat constituencies.  It is one of the few things that is not in the programme for Government and which the Government has not put into effect and on which it should be congratulated.  The idea of multi-seat constituencies &mdash; a six or a seven-seat constituency &mdash; will only multiply the difficulty we have where people pay more attention to work in the constituencies than they do to work in this House.  I agree the two should be balanced but the balance currently is very obviously in favour of doing all the work in the constituencies, which undermines the work of this House.  To some extent, if we start to go down the road of having even more seats in the constituencies, we will tilt the balance even further in that direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Coming from my constituency, I thought the Acting Chairman would not be as hard on me.  Obviously, what Deputy Ross said about working in the constituency does not always work.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill, but I am concerned that many of the promises made about real political reform have been abandoned.  The measures in the Bill only tinker with the notion of political reform, although I welcome them.  Section 3 relates to the number of Deputies.  This is a red herring because people need better representation and more democracy.  As was said by pre<Col N="482"/>vious speakers, we need change at local authority level and to give it back some powers instead of stripping it of powers which has been done by successive Ministers and Governments.</P>
        <P>I welcome the six-month provision in respect of by-elections, but why is there a need for by-elections?  Why could we not go back to the returning officer and ask him or her for the name of the defeated candidate with the highest number of votes from whatever party or persuasion and allow him or her to take over without a by-election?  That is democracy in action because he or she would have received the next highest number of votes.  We could do a lot more work in the constituency rather than travelling to wherever the by-election is taking place, knocking on doors and pestering people.  It was an outrage that the last Government did not hold the by-elections for so long.  The Acting Chairman and I know that we were pretty busy in south Tipperary-west Waterford looking after Waterford because it was without one Deputy for so long after the former Minister, Martin Cullen, retired.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also welcome the lowering of spending limits in presidential elections.  Fine Gael has assembled a war chest to go after the most prestigious job which has eluded it for so long.  It has many potential candidates.  However, this will come too late for that, but I agree with curtailing the spending.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent months the Technical Group has been blackguarded.  There was talk of fair play and so on but it did not happen.  We have no representative on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission nor does Sinn F&eacute;in.  We did not receive fair play in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts and in many other areas.  Light is being made of the leaders&rsquo; allowance for Independents.  Some of the parties are getting three times the allowance for Independents.  Let us be fair and honest.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Ross asked, why can ordinary people not be on the electoral commission?  Why must it always be a commission of the high priests, such as a High Court judge, a Secretary General and so on?  They do not understand life.  The Judiciary needs to be reformed.  One must be re-elected to this House but, once appointed, one is a judge for life.  I know to my cost the situation where judges are politically appointed, politically motivated and politically selected for certain court cases.  What has happened is an outrage and I could go back to the gerrymandering of the Tully regime in the 1970s and what happened.</P>
        <P>This is neither open nor honest nor is it intended to be fair.  It cannot be fair because certain political appointees must look after their masters.  If they do not, they will not be appointed again and soft judges will be picked.  A judge who supports a political party will be appointed.</P>
        <P>I respect the role of the Judiciary and the fact it must be independent.  However, these judges need refresher courses, as do these commissions.  We have had a number of commissions and they cut County Leitrim in two as well as towns.  There are rumours of amalgamating Tipperary South and Tipperary North but it is almost 110 miles from the County Waterford border to the County Galway border.  Is that fair representation?  I know there are large constituencies elsewhere, including in County Donegal.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  I will begin by discussing two of the changes proposed.  The implementation of a six-month deadline for by-elections is to be welcomed, as it will mean there will be no repeat of the events of the last D&aacute;il when we had to wait for over 18 months for by-elections to be held.  Imposing such a deadline will take the decision away from the D&aacute;il and ensure by-elections will take place within the allocated time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like other speakers, I welcome the reduction in spending limits for presidential elections.  However, I question the reason for having a figure of &euro;750,000 and ask whether it could be reduced further to bring reality to a presidential election campaign.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on the proposed change to the number of Deputies to be elected to the D&aacute;il.  The Bill was published on 30 June, but when the Central Statistics Office published preliminary census figures, we discovered that some of the provisions of the Bill concerning a reduction in the number of Deputies to 152 would be unconstitutional.  If the Minister had waited a week, he would not have had to bring forward an amendment to bring the Bill into line with the Constitution.  The proposed reduction in the number of Deputies is window dressing, much like the changes made to the numbers of committees in the Houses, as the Government wanted to portray an image of reform in politics.  There are now committees covering two or three Departments, which committees will have such a workload they will not be able to hold these Departments to account.  This was done in order that the Government would be able to state it had reduced the number of committees; the Bill has been introduced purely because it wants to state it will reduce the number of Deputies in the D&aacute;il, it is not about making our democracy more efficient.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about having one representative for just over 20,000 people.  He conveniently included Seanad representatives in these figures in order to reduce the ratio and compared Ireland to countries such as New Zealand with unicameral systems where the figures are significantly higher.  I commend the Library and Research Service for its Bills digest on the legislation and the Minister would do well to read it and consider the figures for representation in our European neighbours.  In Austria there are 45,000 people for each Member of Parliament; in Denmark there are 30,000 people; in Finland, 26,500 people; in Hungary, 25,900 people, and in Sweden 26,300 people.  These countries have similar populations to ours; therefore, the number of citizens for each Deputy is not out of line with that in our European neighbours and does not need to be changed significantly.  If we were to reduce the number of Deputies to 153, there would be one Deputy for each 29,500 people.  If the population was to increase by 4% in the next census, we would have to increase the number of Deputies again.  The Bill is only window dressing and we require real political reform.  We should examine our political structures.  The people want to see the D&aacute;il working on their behalf, not just a reduction in the number of Deputies.</P>

	<P>That is what friends are for.  </P>
        <P>I wish to take up one of the points made by Deputy Ross regarding the composition of the constituency commission.  Reference was made to section 1 of the Electoral Act 1997 and I wish to comment on the membership of the commission.  I am not that familiar with the Bible &mdash; Deputy Ross may be more familiar with it &mdash; but the issue reminds me of the parable on finding one honest man; it seems it is almost impossible to get somebody to be a member of anything in this country who is not above reproach.  In the past I expressed concern about the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government being a member of the commission, not because of the individual in question.  What I said while in opposition I will say while in government: the suggestion of political interference can be made because the Department offers secretarial back-up to the commission.  My understanding is that the Department presents various options to the commission.  The Minister should examine the issue with a view to considering the type of electoral commission discussed in the past, or even the Standards in Public Office Commission assuming the role.  I would like to see in the the report the details of submissions or various options presented by the Department or others.  We would then be able to see the reasoning behind the process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Much reference has been made to the breaching of county boundaries and taking geography into account.  In many instances people in one county may have greater empathy with others in a neighbouring county than in their own.  Deputy Ross is smiling at that suggestion.  However, the constituency commission should have regard to the need for continuity.  There is a small part of County Carlow in my constituency and I made the point after it had been included in the constituency of Wicklow, that the turnout in that part of County Carlow increased because the people there had a greater association with their new constituency.  At the same time the turnout decreased in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to see the Minister dealing with a couple of other issues in the Bill, including a problem that has been ongoing for decades.  Could we, please, adopt a commonsense approach to the register of electors?  How does one explain the system to a family in public housing when members are knocked off the register on polling day?  It is crazy that there is no interaction between the various bodies involved, but with a little common sense, we could get it right.</P>
        <P>I abhor the concept of posters appearing all over a constituency.  We should consider the idea of having a defined area in each constituency in which a number of posters could be put up.</P>
        <P>The main issue in the legislation is the reduction in the number of Deputies in the D&aacute;il.  I made the point a few years ago that if the population imbalance continued, the eastern seaboard would have all of the representatives, while the western seaboard would, relatively speaking, be devoid of Deputies.  I made a case &mdash; to my detriment &mdash; that geography should be considered.  At the time in an editorial in the <i>Evening Herald</i> I was referred to as a nut who wanted two culchies for every Dub in the D&aacute;il.  We must consider this issue.  It is likely that <Col N="485"/>Donegal and Kerry will be five-seat constituencies, whereas in travelling five or ten minutes either away in Deputy Ross&rsquo;s or Deputy Mitchell&rsquo;s constituency, one will cover the lot.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There may not be a need for as many Deputies in the future.  I do not know if anybody read the article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> in which it was indicated that politicians could be fined &euro;5,000 for every unsolicited text, e-mail or telephone call made to members of the public, following the signing of statutory instruments by the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, last week.  The Data Protection Commissioner has indicated that there will shortly be contact with political parties to explain that only electronic contact with members of the public who have consented to be on text, e-mail and telephone lists is permissible.  We may reach a point where we will not be allowed to contact members of the public at all, which would mean there might be no need for as many of us.  This is crazy.</P>
        <P>We should limit spending between elections, not just at election time.  We also should limit the amount of money politicians and parties can spend in promoting themselves between elections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Although this is probably one of the shortest Bills to come before the House for a while, I suggest any Member could speak on it for days.  Electoral issues seem to be very close to our hearts.  As I have just a few minutes, I will concentrate on the proposal to reduce the number of D&aacute;il Deputies which is exercising our minds.  Obviously, I would have preferred a greater reduction in the number of Deputies to be proposed.  I suppose we were stymied by the unexpected increase in population revealed by this year&rsquo;s census findings.  The Constitution prohibits us from getting rid of a greater number of Deputies without holding a referendum.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Ross who has left the Chamber that multi-seat constituencies are not good, overall.  Ultimately, we should get rid of them and adopt another system.  National and local politics would benefit from a move away from the competitive constituency politics from which we cannot seem to escape.  Given that we are retaining multi-seat constituencies, however, it is a shame that the constituency commission will be required to confine itself to three-seat, four-seat and five-seat constituencies.  I ask the Minister to consider allowing it to use six-seat constituencies in exceptional circumstances in order to avoid breaches of county boundaries.  I know it is supposed to try to avoid such breaches where practical, but the reality is they happen every single time.  To be honest, they are a complete pain in the neck and make the job of local and national representation much more difficult.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A council which caters for a small portion of a different county or constituency tends to regard the business of that area as an add-on to its main business.  I am sure that tendency is absolutely unintentional.  Regardless of the assiduousness of the councillors elected in one of these areas, if the bulk of the members of the county council represent a different constituency, that will be the focus of the council.  That is what happens when bits of constituencies are pushed into other areas.  It is not malign &mdash; it is human nature.  That has been my experience.  Two thirds of my constituency is in one county council area, while one third is in another.  If the phenomenon to which I refer can create difficulties in urban areas that are geographically much the same, as Deputy Timmins pointed out, one can imagine how much more difficulty can be caused in rural areas that are geographically more distant and diverse than cities.  Like most Members, I am sure the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is aware of the role played by counties and constituencies in generating and engendering a sense of place and belonging.  Therefore, it is not a good idea for counties and constituencies to be working against one another.</P>
        <P>Although the Bill provides for some political reform, much more needs to be done.  I think the Minister accepted this when he spoke.  I welcome the announcement that a White Paper <Col N="486"/>on local government reform is to be prepared.  Those of us who have been around for a while know that previous efforts to reform local government resulted in anything but reform.  We ended up with less effective local government.  I am a great admirer of local government which has a huge role to play.  It should be a great force in improving quality of life.  We all know it can do better than it is doing.</P>
        <P>Now that we are in the midst of an economic crisis, it is time to bite the bullet on the form and functions of local authorities.  As I said, there is far too much public representation at local and national level.  We could make do with less representation.  We would do much better with fewer councillors.  It is time to bite the bullet with regard to town councils.  However, I am sure town councillors would not agree with me.  I suggest the functions undertaken by town councils would be far more efficiently undertaken by city and county councils with greater powers and responsibilities.  I do not under-estimate the difficulties involved in devolving functions and streamlining local authorities.  However, if we are to achieve real political reform at national level, Deputies must be released to deal with national issues, concentrate on the bigger picture, scrutinise legislation rigorously, ensure the laws of the country are the best we can have and put in place the safeguards, checks and balances needed.  This cannot be done, unless we begin by reforming local government.  We all recognise that during the recent general election campaign people spoke about national issues and said Deputies should be dealing with them.  I am sure the reality is that no Deputy has noticed a diminution in the number of local issues being raised with them.  That will continue until we have fundamental political reform.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ReginaDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Regina Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I had the pleasure of listening to a speech made by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, at a meeting just over one year ago.  He spoke about what he would do to change how we govern at local level and outlined the political reforms he had planned.  He referred to changes in the manner in which local and national politics were funded.  As a county councillor at the time, I was very excited about his plans.  I wish him every success with them in his role as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I am delighted to speak on them this evening.</P>
        <P>The people are crying out for political reform.  This legislation marks the start of the Government&rsquo;s progressive plans.  If one asks any voter if we need 166 Deputies to represent the people, overwhelmingly one will be told we do not.  In the purest sense, there are two distinct facets to the job I am blessed to have.  First, we are required to scrutinise, amend and improve the legislation that people live and the country is governed by.  Second, we have to meet and listen to representative bodies which want their proposals to be heard and relayed to policymakers.  Like many of my colleagues in the House, I think our job involves far more than the two facets I have mentioned.  I disagree with my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, in that regard.</P>
        <P>The people of Meath East elected me to this House.  If I am to represent them effectively, I must be aware of their views, concerns and needs.  The only way I can do this is to be available to the people who elected me.  That takes time and commitment.  If we do not have a real debate on how the local needs of citizens are represented, we are fooling ourselves into thinking we can impose a blanket reduction in the number of Deputies without it having a detrimental effect on the direct access of citizens to Members of this House.  People need to be honest with themselves.  Do they want true legislators, in the purest sense of that role, or do they want to retain their direct access to their representatives which is what the current system allows?</P>
        <P>I am not talking about filling potholes or medical card applications.  I accept such issues are very important to those who make representations on them.  I am talking about national issues such as joblessness, mortgage arrears, access to education and funding.  I am sure that other Deputies, like me, are contacted about such real issues on a daily basis.  They need to be <Col N="487"/>represented and dealt with.  We cannot have a real and earnest debate on the proposed reduction in the number of Members of this House until we ensure the job description of Deputies matches what we want them to do.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to provide that by-elections be held within six months.  The last Government grossly abused the facility to delay calling by-elections to suit its agenda and protect its slim majority.  No Government owns any seat in this House.  The last Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government abused its privilege and showed utter contempt for the people.  The changes proposed in the Bill are a reflection of our respect for the House and the people we represent.  I also welcome the proposal in the Bill to reduce the spending allowances and reimbursement fees that apply to presidential election campaigns.  I look forward to future changes in the allowances and fees that apply to local and general election campaigns.</P>
        <P>This legislation shows how serious we are about political reform.  This is the start of what the Minister, Deputy Hogan, believes is a progressive plan.  I commend him for his approach to these reforms.</P>

I agree with Deputy Doherty and others who praised the proposal to ensure by-elections will be held within six months.  However, I would go further.  Deputy Mattie McGrath was correct when he spoke about the possibility of not having by-elections.  We do not use by-elections to fill vacancies at local authority and EU level.  In those chambers the party or Independent grouping which held the seat previously is allowed to co-opt someone to fill the vacancy.  In the long term that is something at which the Minister should look.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann calls on the Government to stand by its commitments and ensure:</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />the continuation of all existing accident and emergency services at hospitals across the State as promised by candidates of the Fine Gael and Labour parties in advance of the general election, including Roscommon, Navan, Letterkenny, Portlaoise, St. Columcille&rsquo;s (Loughlinstown), Portiuncula (Ballinasloe), the Mid-Western (Limerick), Clonmel, Mallow and Bantry;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />the retention of key services such as orthopaedic services at St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork and the return of comprehensive breast cancer services to Sligo, also as committed by candidates of the parties now in government; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />equal access to safe and efficient hospital services for all, without discrimination based on income or geographic location.</P><Col N="488"/>
        <P FLI="0">I think the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has the list of those with whom I am sharing time.  I move the motion on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la and urge all Deputies to support it.</P>
        <P>There is grave concern and growing anger among communities across the State at the prospect of the closure of accident and emergency departments in a range of hospitals.  The level of that concern and anger has been increased because of the total lack of clarity on the part of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, the Government and the HSE on exactly what is planned for these hospitals.  This is in the context of the shortage of junior doctors and the imminent turnaround date of 11 July and, importantly, what is to happen in the medium to long term.</P>
        <P>What we know for definite because the Minister and the Taoiseach have told us is that the 24-hour accident and emergency service at Roscommon County Hospital is to be axed.  This has been confirmed this evening by the Health Service Executive.  The accident and emergency service at Roscommon County Hospital is to be no more and replaced with a medical assessment unit-urgent care centre.  This is an absolutely disgraceful decision.  This action is in flagrant violation of the clear and unambiguous commitments given by Fine Gael Deputies in advance of the general election.  Deputy Naughten, now chairperson of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">... a clear commitment on the hospital&rsquo;s future has been provided by Fine Gael&rsquo;s Health Spokesperson, Dr. James Reilly.  Not only will Fine Gael retain all existing services at the hospital but we will also enhance and develop services ... Under our proposals the future of services at Roscommon Hospital will be determined locally.  We want to have a local board appointed by staff, patients and the community to run the hospital in conjunction with local management and not have it run by faceless bureaucrats within the HSE ... The reality is that Fine Gael is the only party which has delivered a written commitment on the future of Roscommon Hospital and is the only party with a plan to reform the health service as a whole.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">These commitments can still be read today on his website.  Interviewed for the <i>Roscommon People</i> newspaper he stated: &ldquo;I made it clear that if, down the road, those commitments were not delivered upon, then yes, I would be prepared to resign the party whip.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Feighan stated: &ldquo;... Fine Gael is determined that its plan to retain and enhance services at hospitals like Roscommon will finally put a halt to this much-touted reconfiguration plan of hospitals in the west which essentially amounts to downgrading by stealth.&rdquo;  Labour Party candidate Senator Kelly stated: &ldquo;The future of the hospital is very safe in Labour hands.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Even more significant than these clear commitments was the commitment made by the then Fine Gael spokesperson on health, Deputy Reilly, now Minister for Health, who, in an open letter to the people of Roscommon published in the local press prior to the general election, wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">I would like to confirm that Fine Gael undertakes, in accordance with the Fine Gael Policy on Local Hospitals, to retain the Emergency, Surgical, Medical and other health services at Roscommon Hospital which are present on the formation of the 31st D&aacute;il ... Furthermore, in the event of the A&amp;E being downgraded, we are committed to reinstating a 24/7 service, where feasible.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">When replying to health questions last week in the D&aacute;il the Minister tried to sow confusion about this letter.  The only meaning &mdash; make no mistake about this &mdash; that can be taken from it is that, in the event of accident and emergency services at Roscommon County Hospital <Col N="489"/>being downgraded prior to Fine Gael entering government, it would reinstate a 24-7 service, where feasible.  That is what the Minister intended; that is what he meant and any twisting of words will not alter this one iota.  The accident and emergency service in Roscommon County Hospital was not downgraded prior to the general election but is to be under a Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.  Without question, the Minister, his party and coalition partners collectively are breaking their commitment to retain at the hospital the services which were present on the formation of the Thirty-first D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The Minister claims the accident and emergency service at Roscommon County Hospital is not safe but also claims that he was not aware of this at the time he made his pre-election commitment.  However, I put it to him that it was well known all along that the accident and emergency service was under threat in the so-called reconfiguration plans for hospitals so ardently pursued by then Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, and the former HSE chief, Professor Brendan Drumm.  Otherwise, why would the Minister and his party colleagues have felt it necessary to make these commitments to, in the words of Deputy Feighan, &ldquo;finally put a halt to this much-touted reconfiguration plan of hospitals in the west which,&rdquo; he correctly indicated, &ldquo;essentially amounts to downgrading [of services at Roscommon County Hospital] by stealth&rdquo;?  This Sinn F&eacute;in motion is not only about Roscommon County Hospital.  If the axe falls on its accident and emergency department, as indicated, it will surely fall elsewhere also.</P>
        <P Just="Left">T&aacute; strait&eacute;is ann le fada chun seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; in ospid&eacute;il timpeall na t&iacute;re seo a ghearradh siar.  N&iacute; rud nua &eacute; seo.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; mar phr&iacute;omh-aidhm ag iar-Aire Sl&aacute;inte agus Leana&iacute; Harney, le taca&iacute;ocht &oacute; Fhianna F&aacute;il i rialtas &oacute; 1997.  As a Deputy representing counties Monaghan and Cavan, I can speak from long and bitter experience.  The words we are hearing from the Minister and the HSE were the words used to justify the downgrading of Monaghan General Hospital which was downgraded and dismantled service by service, beginning with maternity services and the removal of the accident and emergency unit.  The strategy was to starve the hospital of resources up to the point where it was deemed unsafe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an interesting parallel between the removal of all acute services from Monaghan General Hospital just under two years ago, on 22 July 2009, and what is happening now.  Both scenarios involved an election.  In July 2009 I was reliably informed from within the HSE that then Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, and the then Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, were closely involved in the decision to axe these services.  It was signalled by the HSE that the services were to go in November 2008, then at the start of 2009 and then in the early summer.  Of course, the local and European elections followed and the axe was hidden until polling day had passed.  It was merely being sharpened and two days before the D&aacute;il went into summer recess until September 2009 we had the announcement that the axe would fall on 22 July.  It flew in the face of all appeals from front line health care workers, including nurses, general practitioners, consultants and support staff, and the community across all political affiliations, including, strongly, colleagues of the Minister.</P>
        <P>As happened in Monaghan, lives will be put at risk day and night if more communities lose vital hospital services, including emergency and inpatient medical care services.  Lives were lost when Monaghan General Hospital was off-call for emergencies in the past, as we pointed out in July 2009.  As the Minister is aware, there are approximately 1,600 public hospital beds closed due to cutbacks.  Today on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on RTE the former HSE chief, Professor Brendan Drumm, was still maintaining that we had too many hospital beds, this at a time when accident and emergency units are overflowing and waiting lists for acute hospital beds are growing.  When Monaghan General Hospital was downgraded and acute care services ended, not one additional inpatient bed was provided at either Cavan General Hospital or Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda to which patients formerly treated in Monaghan must go.  These <Col N="490"/>hospitals continue to be over-stretched and under-resourced.  All of the promised support services due to be put in place before the axing of acute care services in Monaghan General Hospital were not put in place.  In the HSE&rsquo;s confidential so-called transformation planning document of April 2008 which I revealed at the time rehabilitation, respite and step-down facilities are described as &ldquo;alternatives to acute inpatient care&rdquo;.  The Minister is a general practitioner and knows they are no such thing.  They are distinct from acute inpatient care services.  Their availability may free up some beds inappropriately occupied, but they are not alternatives to acute inpatient care for those who require it.  However, not one additional inpatient bed was provided.</P>
        <P>This is the type of scenario other hospitals face if they are given what I can only describe as &ldquo;the Monaghan treatment&rdquo;.  The emergency department at Navan hospital is hanging by a thread.  No ambulances are accepted there and those who present are assessed and diverted to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  In 2010 Deputy English of Fine Gael stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The news that all trauma cases will drive by Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital Navan is a terrible blow to Meath and all its residents. The HSE has clearly deliberately downgraded Navan Hospital to pave the way for this decision ... The Lourdes Hospital will not be able to cope with the increased numbers coming from Meath, which means lives will be put at risk.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Deputy McEntee of Fine Gael stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">This moves make no sense at all.  Navan is located at the heart of Meath and is easily accessible from all parts of the county, but most of the roads to Drogheda are of a poor standard.  The main road to Slane is currently closed and the diversion via back roads is barely suitable for ambulances.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The downgrading of Navan hospital was also criticised by the then Labour Party health spokesperson, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.  There are real and well grounded fears that the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise could share the same fate.  It may be that the emergency measures being introduced to address the junior doctors issue will prevent the downgrading of the accident and emergency department at Portlaoise for now, but I urge those campaigning on the issue not to desist.  Almost 42,000 people attended the accident and emergency unit there last year and there must be no question of the department being closed or services being reduced there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Letterkenny hospital senior clinicians are seriously concerned about what will transpire there from 11 July.  Any diminution of accident and emergency services there would be a disaster for the people of the north west.  In the case of St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital, Loughlinstown, the proposed downgrading of accident and emergency services would deprive the people of County Wicklow of a vital service and place further pressure on St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, Dublin.</P>
        <P>An indicator of the doubts and concerns raised by the junior doctors shortage was the fact that the board of the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick had indicated that its complement of non-consultant doctors had been halved and that it would be obliged to close the accident and emergency service, the second busiest in the country, for 12 hours duration overnight.  HSE West regional director, Mr. John Hennessy, has since stated no decision had been taken to close or curtail the emergency service.  I call on the Minister to confirm that this is the case and give a clear commitment that definite action will be taken to ensure nothing of the kind will be allowed to occur and that this will apply to all of the other hospitals mentioned in the motion, as well as the accident and emergency unit at Clonmel.</P><Col N="491"/>
        <P>In the case of the other hospitals referred to in the motion, those in Mallow and Bantry, the downgrading plans are being implemented.  If Fine Gael and the Labour Party were sincere in their claimed commitment to these smaller hospitals, they would reverse the cuts.  The parties now in government also made commitments to the retention of key services such as orthopaedic services at St. Mary&rsquo;s Orthopaedic Hospital, Cork, as well as to the return of comprehensive breast cancer services to Sligo.  Rightly, the people are demanding that these commitments are kept also.  We make the same call again on the floor of the House in our motion.</P>
        <P>The context for the hospitals crisis is the regime of savage cuts to public health services imposed as a result of the continuation by the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government of the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government&rsquo;s disastrous economic policies.  The Minister and the Taoiseach have stated the over-spend in hospitals this year is &euro;99 million.  However, on 29 June the Government paid out &euro;12 million to senior Anglo Irish Bank bondholders with unguaranteed bonds.  On 20 June it paid out &euro;20 million.  By the end of the year it will have paid &euro;779 million to the same cohort of gamblers.  Apparently, seriously ill patients must wait but bondholders cannot.</P>
        <P>The latest cuts in my region, the north east, are to services for sick children.  In the Louth Meath Hospital Group the HSE has reduced the number of paediatric outpatient department clinics and increased waiting times for routine outpatient department appointments from approximately 16 weeks to 32.  Children with cancer previously admitted to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda will not now be admitted but transferred to Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other aspect of the current context is the the non-consultant hospital doctor issue.  The Government is undertaking stop-gap measures to meet the shortage of junior doctors from the turnaround date of next Monday, 11 July.  These measures, including the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, are necessary, but we are unclear as to how far they will go.  They may avert full or partial closure of accident and emergency services at some hospitals such as at Portlaoise general hospital.  However, what is to happen in the medium to longer term?  As I pointed out, there is a long-standing strategy of downgrading hospitals and centralising services in a handful of regional hospitals.  The junior doctor issue is being used as a smokescreen to implement the policy of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor in government, whom he berated here day after day for the same pursuit.  The non-consultant hospital doctor issue is not a new problem.  It has been known and widely recognised for years that the hospital system is totally over-reliant on junior doctors.  Successive Governments have failed to address the issue and now it is looming again, worse than ever.  Recruiting sufficient additional junior doctors will be required in the short term, but this is not enough.  Nurses should be freed up to fulfil more responsibilities in accident and emergency departments, as they are qualified and willing to this work.  Hospital consultants should be required to fulfil their contracts to serve the public hospital system, contracts which continue to be widely breached.  More consultants are required in the public hospital system.  The current excessive remuneration for consultants must also be reduced to facilitate the employment of more consultants.</P>
        <P>I urge all Deputies to support the motion.  Let us make no mistake about it: the immediate backdrop to our meeting in the Chamber is the announcement by the HSE this evening that accident and emergency services at Roscommon County Hospital are to cease as we have known them.</P>
        <P>The right to access to safe and efficient health care should not be conditional on one&rsquo;s postal address.  There can be no discrimination on the basis of geographic location or the size of one&rsquo;s bank account.  Tragically, that all too often is the reality in Ireland today and will become the reality for many more thousands of Irish citizens.  The people were led to believe by the parties <Col N="492"/>now in government that change was coming and that in the health service, above all, a new chapter would be written.  It is time these elected representatives, as well as the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues, listened to the people again.  They have a duty to keep the commitments they have given.  I commend all those who have been campaigning in defence of hospital services and for health care justice.  They are courageous people of all political views and none and I urge them not to give up but to keep on campaigning, to unite with other communities nationwide and avoid approaching the problem as individual communities with a sole hospital focus.  Instead, they should merge into a single strong campaign and stand together in demanding the protection of and a guarantee in respect of the continuation of accident and emergency and all other essential services currently in place across the network of local hospitals across the State.  The destruction of the public health services must be prevented.  Therefore, I urge all Members to support the motion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is known that countries with comprehensive primary care systems tend to have lower health care costs, lower mortality rates, longer life expectancy rates and greater satisfaction rates in their health care systems.  As long ago as 2001, Deputy Martin of Fianna F&aacute;il, then Minister for Health, announced with great fanfare his Government&rsquo;s primary care strategy, A New Direction.  The outcomes, of course, have fallen far short of the promises made by him.  While time has passed, the fundamental flaw of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s strategy lives on in the Government&rsquo;s plans for primary health care provision.</P>
        <P>Primary care teams need facilities, but, to date, sufficient buildings have not been provided to complement the Government&rsquo;s primary care strategy.  Instead, the few virtual primary care teams available have no buildings from which to deliver services and are unable to develop robust relationships with their communities or one another.  Despite this recognised failing of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s health strategy, the programme for Government does little to right this wrong.  Although experience shows that primary health programmes work best when appropriate infrastructure is in place, primary health care centres get a mere passing mention in the Government&rsquo;s post-election commitments.</P>
        <P>This problem is compounded by the ongoing shortage of general practitioners.  Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city, which I am proud to represent, has the lowest general practitioner coverage per head of population and the highest incidence of closed GP lists.  It also has some of the worst health and deprivation indices in the country, with the poorest access to primary health services.  While the north Dublin inner city training programme in general practice is trying to address these imbalances, the lack of primary care facilities continues to thwart the efforts of those concerned.  It is time the Government stepped up and delivered desperately needed primary care facilities to the inner city, as well as increased GP training places.  The evidence shows that the establishment of general practitioner training programmes in places in which it has been traditionally difficult to attract GPs leads to an increase in the number of GPs working in these areas and this is what must happen.  These are not options or luxuries but basic must-haves.</P>
        <P>I take the opportunity to note the news that an independent review group has recommended the Mater hospital site as the best location for the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  I support the call of my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, for the publication of that review, as well as the concerns he has raised as to what will happen in the interim to Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght hospitals.  These hospitals must be properly resourced and supported to continue to provide excellent hospital services for children, while awaiting the opening of the promised new facility.  Moreover, now that a decision has finally been made on the location of the children&rsquo;s hospital, action is needed.</P><Col N="493"/>
        <P>The Government must also address the ongoing shortfalls in existing hospitals, including the large acute hospitals in Dublin.  I note the HSE recently gave the Mater hospital a red card for unsatisfactory performance in respect of waiting lists for patient admissions.  I am conscious this problem is not unique to the Mater hospital, as the numbers languishing on hospital trolleys across the State testify.  Moreover, an estimated 200,000 citizens are waiting for outpatient appointments in hospitals across the State.  This is simply stunning and a shameful figure for any Government to stand over.  As Members debate this issue, what the Minister intends to do about it is anyone&rsquo;s guess.  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion calls on the Government to maintain services and provide access to quality services on a universal basis.  I commend it to all Members of the House.</P>

	<P>As my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, has dealt comprehensively with the State-wide picture, I intend, as a Deputy representing Donegal North-East, to focus my comments on its local hospital, Letterkenny General Hospital.  The Minister will be aware that not long ago 15,000 people gathered together in a county that previously had not been renowned for massive public protest.  They gathered in the pouring rain to seek equality in cancer care, to ask for services to be upgraded in the region and for the full spectrum of cancer care services to be provided.  That campaign was led by women who had moved to County Donegal from Scotland, Belfast and Monaghan.  Through their personal experiences and determination, they inspired thousands of others and their campaign has been successful.  </P>
        <P>People in County Donegal thought this would be the beginning of a new dawn for health care services in the county.  They thought that at last the long neglected needs of the people living in the county and region would begin to be addressed comprehensively.  However, to their horror, they have watched the debacle over the extension to Letterkenny General Hospital unravel into a farce.  The building company which was awarded the contract, McNamara Construction Limited, was closed down by NAMA, as in turn were the subcontractors who had carried out the work in the hospital.  Most importantly, the people who had waited so long for proper and adequate accident and emergency facilities and modern facilities in the wards in the floors above were let down.</P>
        <P>The aforementioned project will have been delayed by one year, but even when it comes on-stream, cutbacks in the HSE mean wards in the existing hospital building will be closed and not a single additional new bed in the three-storey building will have been created.  This constitutes a damning indictment of how health services are run.  While it is bad enough that people were obliged to wait another year, after decades of waiting for proper facilities, on its completion it will only offer a nicer environment in which to work but no new capacity.  The impact of this development is that patients are to be found on trolleys in the accident and emergency unit there on a regular basis and no doubt the position will not change when the new building finally comes on-stream.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The impact of the cutbacks and the impossible budgetary demands placed on staff of the hospital results in outpatient clinics and elective surgery being cancelled regularly.  There is ongoing suspension of elective surgery.  People who are crippled with pain &mdash; mostly elderly persons &mdash; have to wait long periods for basic operations.  Consultants are paid huge salaries, yet they are sitting around twiddling their thumbs.  As they have said this publicly, they do not need me to say it.  It is ridiculous.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Due to the failure to appoint junior doctors, the continuation of the 24-hour accident and emergency service at Letterkenny General Hospital is under real threat.  We await clarification as to when junior doctors will be appointed and what is envisaged as a permanent solution.  There has been a downgrading of critical services in the hospital, in comparison to hospitals serving much smaller areas.  The morale of the often heroic staff on the front line is being <Col N="494"/>sapped.  They do not know what to do with themselves as a result of the pressure and the impossible demands being imposed on them by the system.</P>
        <P>The motion implores the Minister and his colleagues who campaigned for change and appealed to the real desire of the people for a new beginning after the crisis we have endured to do the right thing.  It appeals to the Minister to find the resources to honour the commitments made, not to neglect regions of the State which have been neglected for far too long.  It also appeals to him to give the people the health service they deserve and for which they pay taxes.</P>

	<P>In supporting tonight&rsquo;s motion I reiterate the importance of securing funding for essential hospital services across this island.  Our health system is failing people across this State and nowhere is this more clearly recognised than in my constituency of Dublin South-West.  Tallaght hospital, despite the best efforts of its hard-pressed staff, exemplifies much of what is wrong with the health care system.  A shortage of key personnel such as radiologists, physiotherapists, dermatologists and even clerical workers, reflects the difficulties within the hospital.  The way a nation treats its most vulnerable and weakest citizens reflects how a society functions.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in calls on the Government to stand by its pre-election commitments and to respond to the worsening crisis which is denying access to the most basic care.  The failure to provide funding to ensure sustainability and development of essential services has had a profound impact on the lives of people who are dependent on public health services when sick or injured.  Tallaght hospital has the busiest accident and emergency department in the country and in 2010, 93,000 people were treated there yet it remains chronically under-funded since its opening.  In a recent newspaper article, a patient describes its corridors as being a breeding ground for infectious bacteria, a view substantiated recently by the Dublin County Coroner, Dr. Kieran Geraghty, who described the hospital as a very dangerous place.  His comments were made after a local man, Thomas Walsh, died after being admitted to Tallaght hospital with a severe ankle pain.  He had been left in a so-called virtual ward, a euphemism for abandoning sick patients in hospital corridors while awaiting a bed in a ward.  The sheer obscenity of having dozens of sick patients lying on trolleys with no privacy, a lack of basic hygiene facilities and no real health supports, brings into sharp focus the cuts in the health service.  I was present in the hospital one night when more than 50 patients were lying in rows of trolleys.  A family grieved around the bedside of their elderly mother &mdash; no dignity for the dying and no dignity for their families.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that HIQA, the Health Information and Quality Authority, has published the terms of reference for a statutory inquiry into the safety and governance of care at Tallaght&rsquo;s accident and emergency department.  I understand that under the eight terms of reference, the inquiry will assess the quality, safety, governance and accountability of services provided to patients who attend the accident and emergency department.  It will also examine whether the board of the hospital has been effective in managing risks to patients.  The inquiry must begin immediately and the focus must be on implementing radical improvements in the hospital.</P>
        <P>The Minister might also look at the lack of after-hours GP services in Tallaght and its impact on the accident and emergency department.  He might also look at an area such as Fettercairn in Tallaght, with a population of 7,000 people but with no general practitioner based in that area.  My colleague, Deputy McDonald, cited the recent announcement about the new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  There will be no celebration in my area.  Sinn F&eacute;in was the first party to highlight the difficulties its siting creates for families or individuals trying to cross to the Mater site.  We outlined the length of travel time on public transport.</P><Col N="495"/>
        <P>I ask the Minister to also look at the policy on the rolling out of children&rsquo;s hospital services, the paediatric services, in this city.  There will be no overnight beds for sick children on the south side of Dublin.  He needs to look radically and quickly at this difficulty which families will face.</P>

Thug siad na gealltanais sin le f&aacute;il isteach sna cathaoireacha ina bhfuil siad inniu.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is very clear and I do not have to repeat what other speakers have said earlier and again this evening that this Government has broken the promises to the electorate.  It has broken the promises to people in very vulnerable areas who depend on their health services, from Navan to Drogheda, from Roscommon to Leitrim and areas in my constituency in Donegal.  Not only had the Government parties given the nod and wink to the constituents during the election campaign that they would ensure that the services were maintained, but they went further.  In the case of my constituency and the hospital with a catchment area in part of my constituency, Sligo General Hospital, one of the Government Deputies went so far as to say that he would resign from Government if cancer services at Sligo General Hospital were not restored within one hundred days.  I am sure the Minister is disappointed at the lack of honesty of that Deputy, the lack of honesty to the electorate and the people who elected him, who believed that by electing him to this House and this Government, he would defend the rights of cancer patients across the north west.  He has failed, just as the Government is failing to deliver the health services it has pledged to the people across the State.</P>
        <P>This issue was inherited from the previous Government which ran down the health services over many years.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to it when he said the template to be used across the State for the downgrading of hospitals was the template used in Monaghan General Hospital.  If there was ever a time when I wished Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was not correct, it was then.  We have seen this transpire over recent years under the Fianna F&aacute;il, Green Party and Progressive Democrats Government and now, unfortunately, we see this Government putting another nail in the coffin of health services throughout this State.</P>
        <P>There is a crisis brewing and 11 July is the date when the non-consultant hospital doctors will not be available to provide adequate cover for many hospitals.  The Minister has yet to tell the House which of those hospitals will be affected.  Which rural hospitals will be affected?  We understand that in Donegal, Letterkenny General Hospital might not be affected on 11 July.  However, given that 67 of the non-consultant hospital doctors are locums and those posts will disappear a number of weeks after that, there is a serious threat to the downgrading of Letterkenny General Hospital.  The accident and emergency department may not remain open after August and September.  In answering questions from Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in last week, the Minister said junior doctors would be directed to regional hospitals.  I ask him to provide clarification for patients across the north west and the State on which hospitals will retain services.</P>
        <P>The Minister told people the money will follow the patient.  It is very clear from this Government that the only people whom the money is following are bondholders.  Last week the Government paid out &euro;12 million of unguaranteed debt to bondholders.  Tomorrow it will pay out another &euro;10 million.  The debt of Letterkenny General Hospital is approximately &euro;6 million <Col N="496"/>to &euro;8 million.  On 2 November, &euro;750 million in bonds will mature: the debt of Letterkenny General Hospital amounts to 1% of that.  The Government is prioritising bondholders over the safety and health of patients.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P>&ldquo;&mdash;recognises that the first and over-riding priority for all hospital services must be the safety of patients;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />supports the Government&rsquo;s approach to ensuring that all patients have access to timely, high quality emergency services;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />notes the growing evidence that larger hospitals with a higher volume of patients treated by appropriately trained health professionals have significantly better outcomes for patients with complex or life-threatening conditions;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />endorses the recommendations of the independent Health Information and Quality Authority on this issue and welcomes the Government&rsquo;s commitment to implementing the approach advocated by the Authority;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />strongly supports the Minister for Health&rsquo;s establishment of the Special Delivery Unit within his Department, which has already started its work to reduce unacceptable waiting times in emergency departments, and will also address lengthy waiting times for in-patient, day case and out-patient treatments;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />supports the Government&rsquo;s continuing emphasis on providing high-quality diagnostic and treatment services for patients with cancer irrespective of where they live;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />commends the Minister for Health&rsquo;s work to ensure that there is a sufficient number of non-consultant hospital doctors to provide high quality acute hospital services throughout the country; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />endorses the Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce a system of Universal Health Insurance, which is based on fair access to healthcare for all, irrespective of income or geographic location; and resolves that no hospital will close but that some services will change.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I start by responding to some of the issues raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  While it might have been known that Roscommon&rsquo;s emergency department, which is still referred to as an accident and emergency department, was under threat it was not known that it was unsafe.  The Mallow HIQA report had not been released at that point and was not published until April.  It was the first report to identify clearly the hospitals about which it was concerned.  Nobody has raised this issue with me more and shown more concern about this than Deputies Naughten and Feighan.  Senator John Kelly has been at my door on numerous occasions in regard to his concerns.</P>
        <P>I want to touch on one or two things that were said about Tallaght and Fettercairn.  I met the Tallaght Hospital Action Group today and we had a good conversation.  It raised its concerns about staffing levels and the budget and I have taken that on board.  I am equally aware and concerned about the fact that a place like Fettercairn has no GP service.  It is an area to <Col N="497"/>which I refer when I talk about the right of my Department to implement our social policy when it comes to supporting practices.  If we open the GMS to all GPs I have no issue with that, but we will not support five practices on Grafton St. when there is none in Fettercairn.</P>
        <P>In regard to the national paediatric hospital, the ambulatory care unit in Tallaght will be open first and the report alludes to the need for some overnight beds there, something which will certainly be considered.  On the comments on Loughlinstown, the hospital is seven minutes from St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  Therefore, what can be carried out safely there is obviously a matter of consideration and what can be achieved by moving a patient seven minutes down the road also has to be considered.</P>
        <P>I made it clear before the last general election that if the cancer services in Sligo General Hospital were out of operation for more than a year it would be very difficult to reinstate them, but we have not closed the door to that possibility and are still in discussions.  Deputy Doherty mentioned that money follows the patient but that the money has left the country.  If we were to follow his advice and debunk on everything we would have to make an adjustment of &euro;19 billion or &euro;20 billion in one year.  How many salaries and cuts would that cost?  The system could not withstand the shock.</P>
        <P>In regard to Roscommon in particular, I understand the fear of local communities.  In the past it often meant death by stealth.  That is not the case here and it is not the agenda of this Government.  The Government is very clear that the future of smaller hospitals is bright.  It is not the beginning of the end.  In fact it is the beginning of a new lease of life, but in a much safer way by doing a lot of different work from what they did hitherto.  We need our local hospitals and their capacity and expertise.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach said, in regard to Roscommon we also need to be truthful.  Not enough non-consultant hospital doctors will be available to us, something which I will outline in more detail.  Smaller hospitals are not as safe as bigger ones in key areas.  There is a wealth of international research to back this up.  When it comes to multiple traumas, strokes and heart attacks, it has been proven internationally that one has a 25% better survival rate at a larger hospital which has a higher volume even if one is more than one hour away.  In this context paramedics are very important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What has happened here in recent years is something which has now been highlighted by HIQA.  We all thought if there was an accident and emergency department with a doctor and X-ray machine the service was safe and could look after us if we were acutely ill, and that the skill set was available to deal with multiple traumas, double fractures, heart attacks or profuse bleeding.  We have to realise that behind many of these hospitals the skill set is not there and there is no vascular surgeon, orthopaedic surgeon, anaesthetic consultant on-site at night or a person to carry out intubation.  If a person has to wait 15 minutes for someone to come from down the road to intubate him or her, he or she will be dead.</P>
        <P>We have to look at what constitutes safe practice and be honest with people.  People are starting to vote with their feet.  It is important to point out the attendance rates at smaller hospitals.  In Roscommon 30 people attend on a daily basis on average, a total of up to 14,000 per year.  Fewer than one person a day, or 360 patients a year, is transferred from the accident and emergency department to Galway, rather than the 14,000 some would have us believe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The golden hour has been much talked about but has been superseded in recent years by a wealth of international experience that shows that a high-volume unit is where the best outcomes are achieved, even if it is well in excess of an hour away.  This view was formally endorsed in Ireland by the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine, the medical director of the National Ambulance Service and the national programme director of the HSE&rsquo;s clinical programme on <Col N="498"/>emergency medicine.  Dr. Una Geary, the clinical leader in emergency medicine in this country, said at a press conference the other day, &ldquo;There is not a single serving emergency department consultant in Ireland who believes differently.&rdquo;  That is the reality.</P>
        <P>The Deputies opposite referred to the statement I made during the election on Roscommon hospital.  Any statement I made was made in good faith.  Any utterance I made was born out of a strong conviction that all hospitals have a future with integrity in their communities.  Anything I said was in defence of hospitals and out of a determination that no hospital should be downgraded out of existence.  My priority is to defend patients and above all else ensure their safety when they are at their most vulnerable, when they are acutely ill and when they are utterly reliant on the skills of those around them to save their lives and ensure the best outcome for them.</P>
        <P>The Opposition wants to sustain what is unsustainable and keep unsafe that which must be made safe.</P>

	<P>I reject that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  I do not accept that the changes to the emergency department at Roscommon hospital represent the downgrading of the entire hospital.  I want to be clear about what I want to see.  I want to see it made safe.  I do so, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, with the background of a non-consultant hospital doctor shortage.  We have known for the past 20 years about our dependence on non-national, non-consultant or junior hospital doctors in this country.  However, in 2007 we changed the law and got rid of temporary registration, which made it more difficult and less attractive to come here.  We changed the way we treated our non-consultant hospital doctor posts, so we have created training and non-training posts.  Many of these non-training posts are simply not attractive either to our own doctors or to doctors coming from abroad.  We have sought to correct that legal deficit, which is giving an advantage to our UK neighbours and others across Europe who are seeking doctors.  In that way, we can now create new supervised posts with temporary registration which allows doctors to come here.  They will be subject to an intense assessment, including a one-day exam followed by two weeks of assessment on site.  These doctors will be extremely well assessed, therefore.  Even if by some quirk, however, we find that an individual is not suitable for the post, he or she will not be able to leave that post &mdash; having come here to do surgery &mdash; and go off to do psychiatry in Cork and present a danger to patients.  They will automatically lose their registration and will have to return to their country of origin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to talk about the safety of emergency departments and the increased survival rates at bigger hospitals.  In recent days, a draft report has become available which has not yet been finalised.  Some of the statistics in the report, while rough, are so startling that they cannot be ignored.  They were gathered over the past three years.  One set of statistics shows that a patient attending Galway University Hospital has a 5.8% mortality rate compared with a 21.3% mortality rate in Roscommon, which is four times greater.  That is not the fault of doctors in Roscommon hospital; it is a reflection of the fact that the skillsets and backup are not there.  There is no intervention cardiologist or multiple trauma team to deal with patients.  Talking about cardiology alone, it comes down to the fact that there is no ability to put a stent in, which is now the required standard of care.  Thrombolytics only go so far.  One must be able to get angiography and a stent in to where the blockage is.  That is what improves survival and that is what one gets when one goes to a bigger hospital, but it is not available at Roscommon and other smaller hospitals.  That realisation must be taken on board by all of us.</P><Col N="499"/>
        <P>Does that mean that people in Roscommon will be left without a 24-hour service?  Not if I can help it.  I have asked that we should have an urgent care centre there and I am guaranteed it will be staffed from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. by a non-consultant hospital doctor supervised by a consultant with the backup of a medical assessment unit.  I can give an undertaking that between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. there will be a new GP out-of-hours co-op service in Roscommon town, based in the hospital outpatients department.  I hope that will only be a temporary situation and that we can ultimately move, within a month or so, to that being carried out in the urgent care centre with access to diagnostics.  In the interim, and the HSE is trying to find the right person to do this because it involves a particular skillset, I am seeking one, but I think we will need two, non-consultant hospital doctors to staff the urgent care unit between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. under the supervision of local consultants.  This is only a temporary measure.  It will be run on a bona fide,<i> pro bono</i> basis by local consultants and would not be sustainable in the long term.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, will not accept it for longer than a month, nor will the HSE&rsquo;s clinical leads.  However, it would buy time to allow the GPs to consider moving to the urgent care centre.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Have they yet to consider it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be many other services at Roscommon, including an additional ambulance.  Therefore, there will be four ambulances in Roscommon during the day and three at night, two of them based in Roscommon town.  There will be paramedics available in a car for Roscommon also.  There will be additional diagnostics and screening, including colorectal cancer screening, that is, colonoscopies, at Roscommon.  We intend to extend day surgery in order that it will not be 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. or 11 p.m.  It will be a 23 hour per day surgery and overnight surgery two or three days a week that will allow a much wider range of things to be done.</P>
        <P>I find it extraordinary that people are going to big hospitals such as Galway, Beaumont and Tallaght for hernia repairs, gall bladder removals, varicose veins and other conditions that should be directed to smaller hospitals.  It is our intention to have much more activity at the smaller hospitals but it will be safe.  The future of Roscommon hospital is secure.  There is no question of this being death by stealth or the beginning of the end.  This is the beginning of a new lease of life for Roscommon.</P>
        <P>There are now 180 vacancies for non-consultant hospital doctors and we have 200 plus medical people who have sought visas to work here.  I cannot give a guarantee they will be here until they land, however, and they must also be trained to be fit for purpose.  Last year, there were 150 such vacancies.  I am hopeful we will end up with sufficient people to run the service over a two year period that will give them a guarantee, security of tenure, training and clinical up-skilling.  It will also give us security of tenure to allow the forum to be established to report not later than the end of autumn to inform us about manpower training and to match undergraduate with postgraduate posts that are needed.  It will also give a clear career path to doctors.  Specialists who are qualified and to all intents and purposes could be consultants but do not have a job will be given work in this country.  They will report only to a clinical director and no other consultant.</P>
        <P>I have not had time to talk about the special delivery unit, which will certainly address a lot of the problems we have.  It is my intention that Roscommon hospital will deliver safe and appropriate care, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  This is not the beginning of the end, as I said, but the beginning of a new lease of life.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="SimonHarris"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to place my thoughts concerning the future configuration of our hospital services clearly and categorically on the record of this House.  I commend the new Minister for Health on not ducking the issues and not passing the buck which we saw with so many previous Ministers for Health.  Where his predecessors chose to abdicate their responsibility, referring to the Department of Health as Angola, or, in the case of the current Fianna F&aacute;il leader, to create a monstrous bureaucracy unaccountable to the people and their representatives, the Minister is determined to reform our health service, including areas that have long been ignored.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s hands-on and innovative approach to addressing the shortage of non-consultant hospital doctors is to be welcomed.  I am sure we all hope these efforts will bear fruit.  As other Members have said, this is an issue that has been ignored for far too long.</P>
        <P>When it comes to health care and the well-being of my constituents, I will not take my lead or advice from the Sinn F&eacute;in party or, indeed, any political party, my own included.  The people I want to hear from and those whom the public deserve to hear from are the clinicians who treat patients every day on the front line in hospitals.  These are the medical experts who can correctly assert what is safe medical practice and what is not.  They, rather than a political party, the HSE or any individual politician, have the qualifications, expertise and background to make life-saving decisions for my constituents.</P>
        <P>Historically, my constituency of Wicklow has been the poor relation with regard to health services, despite the previous economic boom.  We have no general hospital and have been dependent on travelling for medical treatment to other counties, such as Dublin, Kildare or even Wexford in some cases.</P>
        <P>I was extremely angry, frustrated, annoyed and insulted to hear through newspapers and other media about the HSE&rsquo;s proposals to reconfigure services at St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital in Loughlinstown, County Dublin.  This drip-feed of leaked information does not allow for a rational debate or consultation on proposals.  It creates an environment of fear and of genuine worry among the public.  Unfortunately, on occasions, it also creates an environment in which some politicians try to tap in to that genuine public concern.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Medical professionals in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital, Loughlinstown &mdash; and this also applies to the broader health services in County Wicklow &mdash; should hold a public information day when people could drop in to hear what services are on offer.  They should be able to hear facts and figures without the political spin from any party.</P>
      <TimeSt down="3" idown="3">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>They can see what services would be on offer under a changed system and how they would interact with people on a daily basis.  I want to see plans for increased capacity at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency department before any changes are introduced at St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital, Loughlinstown.  We need a much improved ambulance service for County Wicklow, with ambulances located at the best possible point to serve people quickly and resourced with paramedics with all the necessary qualifications.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Deputy McDonald that we need to hear more about the roll-out of primary care facilities in my constituency in Bray, Greystones, Arklow and Wicklow town.  There have been far too many missed opportunities where primary care facilities have become glorified <Col N="501"/>places in which general practitioners have rooms.  They need to be much more than that, a desire which I know the Minister shares.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Crowe made a valid point in regard to after hour general practitioner services.  This issue needs to be examined and I urge the Minister to do so in consultation with general practitioners in Wicklow and south Dublin in regard to St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital, Loughlinstown.  Reforms at St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital are needed but no change should take place in isolation.  It should happen as part of an overall package to co-ordinate services between St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital, St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital should be mandated to take the clinical lead in some areas of medical speciality.  Reconfiguration equals change but must not equal downgrade.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments in that regard.</P>
        <P>I will continue to pursue these issues with the Minister over the coming weeks and months.  I will support whatever service is deemed best not by my political opponents but by those with the qualifications and know-how to serve my constituents.  I need to hear about how my constituents in County Wicklow, a county abandoned from a health point of view during the boom years, will fit into the roll out of primary care centres and indeed improved access to an ambulance service.  It is extremely important, as we in this House wrestle control from an unaccountable HSE and restore accountability to this House, that the message goes out to the HSE tonight from all sides of this House that the leaking of information and the deciding of HSE proposals without consultation is not on.</P>
        <P>There is a new sheriff in town.  It is important that message is heard loudly and clearly by the HSE.</P>

	<P>There has been a sustained attack on the safety of small or local hospitals, facilitated and promoted by the last Government.  All of the medical professionals say their practises are not safe and that their emergency departments should be closed.  Surely then the solution is to make them safe and keep them open.  Instead, we are faced with a one size fits all approach from medics based a few minutes away from the major regional centres.  This is unacceptable.  There are clear exceptions where this type of approach simply cannot work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should and must look at the unique geographic problems facing communities such as that serviced by Roscommon County Hospital and come up with a tailored solution that takes this and other factors into account and acknowledges that the one size fits all approach simply will not work.  Commentators and so-called medical experts say that Roscommon County Hospital has no future yet none of these people is prepared to acknowledge that many parts of the hospital&rsquo;s catchment area are two hours from the so-called centre of excellence.  These geographical issues are being completely ignored by the setting of standards by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, which seem to be solely focused on standards applicable when people come to the door of a hospital or are placed in an ambulance rather than on the transportation of inadequately resuscitated and unstable patients over large distances.  This must change.</P>
        <P>Door to door, via the motorway, Roscommon County Hospital is one hour and 21 minutes from Galway University Hospital.  This does not include call-out time, assessment and stabilisation of the patient by a paramedic and return journey from the scene of the emergency.  I am not a medical expert.  However, the total disregard for these facts does not make sense to me.  I invite all of the local medical professions in Roscommon, including the consultants and general practitioners, to meet directly with the Minister and his medical advisers and to thrash out once and for all the so-called safety issues at Roscommon County Hospital.</P><Col N="502"/>
        <P>The proposed complete closure of the accident and emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital came not from outside but from the hospital and its consultants.  I believe the consultants proposed the closure of accident and emergency in good faith as a last resort.  The fact is that this is now being used as an implementation plan.  The HSE is saying this is what the people working in the hospital have put forward.  I urge the consultants to revise their plans and to work with the Minister to ensure Roscommon County Hospital can provide additional services locally to individuals who should not have to travel significant distances to access treatment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The urgent care centre proposed by the Minister is the first of its kind in the country.  It is a blank canvas.  I urge the consultants and general practitioners to work with the Minister to create a unique centre of excellence that can become the benchmark for other geographically isolated communities.  I reject utterly the proposal for the complete closure of the accident and emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital.  The people of Roscommon need a 24 hour-seven day a week service.  We have some of the best nurses and support staff in the country working in and supporting our emergency department.  We should be using these professionals to develop services not undermining their role.  I have not thrown in the towel.  I am committed to working in the best interests of the hospital, its patients and staff in providing the best possible safe service long into the future.</P>

	<P>In the brief time available to me I would like to address the situation in my constituency, with particular reference to the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise which is not a district, county or general hospital but a regional hospital that over the past 12 months carried out 41,825 accident and emergency procedures.  This to my mind places the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise in a most different place to those hospitals referred to in the debate thus far this evening.</P>
        <P>It is totally unacceptable to have to highlight again in this House the total breakdown of trust between the people of County Laois and the Health Service Executive.  The Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise was consistently bled of funds by the previous Administration.  Rumour and counter rumour are swirling about that accident and emergency services at the hospital are to be terminated as and from next week.  I would like clarification on this issue as soon as possible to allay the genuine fears of the people in my constituency concerned about their health services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week, the Central Statistics Office released under Census 2011 figures in respect of County Louth which, unlike in any other county in the country, has experienced a population growth of unprecedented levels, an increase of 20% in population over the past five years.  Portlaoise is unique in that on any given day up to 800 prisoners may require emergency treatment given the nature of our prison system.  Good quality health care and a service that people in my constituency can have confidence in is absolutely paramount.</P>
        <P>I do not have any medical expertise.  I was elected by the people as a public representative.  I confess that medical specialty is not among my talents.  I will never profess to be an expert on medical issues.  I will be guided by what the clinical practitioners say, both locally and nationally.  However, I will require best practice for my constituents and will fight to ensure the health service be quantifiable in terms of service.  I would like the Minister, whom I congratulate on his efforts in difficult circumstances, to facilitate the recruitment of the non-consultant hospital doctor team for the next six months.  I understand that great progress has been made at the Midlands Regional Hospital, Portlaoise and I am confident the team in white coats will be in place for Monday next.  However, I want to see additional matters at the hospital <Col N="503"/>addressed, including the availability of a 24 hour CT scan.  I want clarification in regard to the health service delivery plan for the people of County Laois which I have sought from the HSE over the past 12 months, to no avail.</P>
        <P>I refer again to the total breakdown of trust which will require the Minister&rsquo;s personal intervention and leadership, which I look forward to.   The ambulance service was mentioned.  This, too, is a serious issue in Portlaoise.  I thank the Deputies opposite for facilitating this debate, to which we will have to return.  I make no apology for fighting for my constituents, albeit as a layman in terms of medical expertise and clinical diagnosis.  However, like every other Deputy in the House, I hope we can have a service in all our areas in which the people can have a fair degree of confidence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>When in opposition, during a debate on a cancer services motion on 20 May 2008, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The motion is self-explanatory but the rationale behind it requires further elucidation.  At the core of it is the question of trust.  What is at issue is whether the people of the north west and west can trust the Government, the Minister for Health and Children and the monolithic Health Service Executive to deliver the services they have promised.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Certainly the issue of trust has been shattered for many people in the mid-west, north west and west given the commitments made by the Minister when he was in opposition on the provision of services in Roscommon, Sligo and elsewhere in the north west and west.  Our party, when in government, was involved in a reconfiguration programme and the HSE was the organisation carrying it out in conjunction with waiting for reports from HIQA.  However, we did not hide behind any reports.  We were upfront and honest with the people in every constituency on the provision of services and what reconfiguration might mean for some services in certain areas.</P>
        <P>The motion before the House comes about as a result of deceit and cynicism at its highest level perpetrated on many people with breaches of promises made prior to this year&rsquo;s general election.  In the same debate in 2008 the now Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said:</P>
        <P LI="1">We should not be obliged and restricted by the acceptance of independent reports.  He said we should have the courage to change them if we believe they are not correct...  This is an opportunity for the Government to show the courage he speaks of because this is not only a medical position but a political decision and the Minister knows it.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He went on to state:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am appalled at the attitude of Government Deputies who said this fight was lost when statements were issued by management.  Members of hospital management do the jobs they are supposed to; politicians reflect the views of the people and make political decisions in the best interests of the community.  I inform the Minister, Deputy Harney, that I would not stand here and defend this motion in the name of Fine Gael if I did not believe that the standards of surgery, clinical outcome and survival stand up.  The Minister has not proven anything in this debate to date to demonstrate that the service in Sligo or in Mayo General Hospital should not continue.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The issue of hospitals is very emotive, a point Fine Gael and the Labour Party played on when in opposition.  I often sat on the other side of the House listening to the issue being raised continually as is the right and duty of every Opposition Deputy.  However, equally every politi<Col N="504"/>cal party has an obligation at least not to sow seeds of deceit and cynicism as perpetrated on the people of the west, north west and mid-west.</P>
        <P>Let us be under no illusions about the commitment made on Roscommon hospital.  Deputies were arriving home like Neville Chamberlain in 1938 with a letter declaring peace in our time, except it was accident and emergency units and retention of hospital services in our time.  Clearly Fine Gael did a poll in the Roscommon-South Leitrim constituency, which showed that Fine Gael was close to winning two seats and also indicated that Roscommon General Hospital was the biggest issue for voters in the constituency.  Contact was made, and the party&rsquo;s deputy leader arrived and gave his cast-iron guarantee to the people of Roscommon.  I get no joy from saying this.  The Taoiseach said we should respect the Minister&rsquo;s opinion because he takes into account HIQA reports, the advice from clinicians and from the HSE and equally because he is a medical practitioner himself.  At the time he made that commitment I do not believe that the Minister did not know there were some difficulties with accident and emergency services in Roscommon General Hospital.  This commitment was made solely to con the people of Roscommon and get two seats for Fine Gael in the process.</P>
        <P>Deputy Naughten was quoted in the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> on 22 March 2011 as saying:</P>
        <P LI="1">Fine Gael has already committed to retaining services at the hospital and as a party we have outlined our plans to not only protect but also to enhance and develop those services.  This decision by Minister Reilly is the first step in securing the future of services at smaller hospitals such as Roscommon and Portiuncula.</P>
        <P FLI="0">On 5 October 2010 Fine Gael tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion on health services calling on the Government to:</P>
        <P LI="1">ensure that there are no further reductions to front line staff or services;</P>
        <P LI="1">suspend the loss of front line health services and capacity at hospitals, for example, at Clonmel, Merlin Park, Nenagh, Roscommon, Navan, Sligo, Letterkenny, Portiuncula, Wexford, Monaghan, Ennis and Louth county.</P>
        <P FLI="0">During the debate, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">This motion is about protecting patients from cutbacks necessitated by mismanagement and waste in the HSE, presided over by this Minister [Mary Harney].  It intends to demonstrate clearly that there is a third way by changing the bizarre working practices and bloated bureaucracy at the root of the waste in our service.  The Government, through a series of policy failures, continues to undermine the provision of fair and equitable health services to our citizens.  Current health policy, particularly as outlined in the amendment to the motion, sends a clear statement that the Government does not view health as a priority.  [This is the cracker in it all.]  It has consistently ignored the concerns of local people, medical professionals and service users when stripping hospitals of their services.  Nobody in the House opposes excellence in clinical care or denies the need for change in the provision of hospital services but when the Government&rsquo;s immediate reaction is to close theatres and wards or to withdraw front line services to save money, we do have a problem, as this is a lazy way to attack our difficult situation.</P>

	<P>In that debate the Minister, Deputy Reilly, went on to say:</P>
        <P LI="1">People are feeling pain but HSE administrators have taken the soft option of cutting front line staff and services.  Navan hospital is a case in point.  The Minister alluded to it being shut because of economic considerations, given all hospitals must stay within budget, but Navan hospital is operating within budget.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We had a statement the other day from the Minister, Deputy Reilly, quite clearly directed to all hospitals and the HSE.  I remind the House that the HSE is now governed by the Minister.  He has assumed sole responsibility for the provision of health care in the State.  He waltzed into HSE headquarters, sacked its independent board, and appointed people from the Department of Health and the HSE who are to work under his guidance with his hand always on the tiller when it comes to decision making.  On any decision made from now on, Government backbenchers cannot blame us or the HSE.  They can look to their own Minister, the man who decided to take in charge all issues on the provision of health care.</P>
        <P>Following the recommendations in the HIQA report, I accept nobody in this House would stand over putting patients at risk.  However, there are two ways to address the issue.  There is the lazy and deceitful option the Minister has taken of withdrawing the services or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Not withdrawing chairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;alternatively he could address the deficiencies impacting the safe delivery of services in the areas HIQA highlighted.  To date the Minister has not done that in Roscommon, Sligo, Letterkenny, Castlebar, Galway and many of the hospitals highlighted in the HIQA report on Ennis hospital.  The report is being used by the Minister to breach all the promises made during the general election campaign.</P>
        <P>In my constituency of Cork North-Central there was an issue with St. Mary&rsquo;s Orthopaedic Hospital.  At the time I was honest with the people and informed them that the reconfiguration was taking place and the recommendation was for a transfer of orthopaedic services to the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital.  A campaign was rightly waged.  However, we had cast-iron guarantees from the Minister, Deputy Reilly, that there would be no movement of orthopaedic services.  He then carried out a brief review, the details of which we did not see.  Lo and behold, at the end of the day we discovered that services are being moved from St. Mary&rsquo;s Orthopaedic Hospital to the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital.  He has stated that he hopes some services might move up to St. Mary&rsquo;s on the north side of the city.  I do not mind the cut and thrust of politics, but this is a case of playing on people&rsquo;s fears and concerns prior to a general election and then doing a complete U-turn on the provision of services.  I thought the Minister was about to quote Winston Churchill referring to the end of the beginning and the beginning of the end.  Winston Churchill also said that men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever happened.  In this context, the Minister is picking himself up and hurrying off as if nothing happened.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="506"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not hurrying anywhere.  The Deputy can be assured of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I had the joy of reading the Minister, Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s website today.  To be fair, it is a very active website and it is clear the Minister is very active working hard as a TD, as is the right and duty of everybody in the House.  However, I then found a statement on the website with regard to the national children&rsquo;s hospital from which I must quote as it raises grave concerns in the context of the provision of care in such a hospital.  The statement refers to the resignation of Mr. Philip Lynch, the chair of national paediatric hospital project team, and reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">This must lead to a re-think.  There is an offer on the table from Noel Smyth which deserves consideration.  We don&rsquo;t serve our children well by telling them fairy tales about a hospital that may never be built.  Our sick children have a window of opportunity for optimum outcome that closes quickly and when they miss it they could be damaged for life.  We must ensure that our sick children get care when they need it.</P>
        <P LI="1">There is a worrying arrogance about this Minister and Government [Deputy Reilly is referring to the previous Government] that they refused to entertain a different view, from their own appointed chairman, especially when that view could be the difference between a realistic plan and a plan based in never never land.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This has been an ongoing saga for many years.  There is almost a duty on everyone in the House to fully support the provision of a national children&rsquo;s hospital on the Mater site.  There have been reports, reviews and recommendations.  The Minister was obviously playing local politics with this press release, which makes no sense from any other angle.  The Taoiseach regularly points out that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is a general practitioner but to call the plan &ldquo;never never land&rdquo; is to downgrade the efforts of the previous Government and many previous Administrations to facilitate the building of a national children&rsquo;s hospital next to a hospital that has all the other tertiary services and is in line with the recommendation that it should be next to a university hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>With &euro;200 million from philanthropy.  That is never never land.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Mater is that hospital.  I urge the Minster to ensure he brings clarity to this issue and that he states that he is fully committed to the development of the children&rsquo;s hospital so that it moves to the planning stage as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>There is a shortage of funding and we do rely on philanthropy and support from the private sector to develop the hospital.  If there is uncertainty in the context of the commitment from the Government to the development of a national children&rsquo;s hospital, it will undermine confidence in those who may want to assist the State in developing a children&rsquo;s hospital.  The timeline is in place but it is tight.  We expect that the Minister will give full support to the children&rsquo;s hospital.</P>
        <P>While I do not want to play politics with the case of Maeve McGivern, can I have clarity that protocols will be put in place as quickly as possible to make sure that what happened recently in the context of a transfer to Britain for a transplant will not happen again?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my party colleague, Deputy Kelleher&rsquo;s amendment as well as the broad thrust of the motion put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.  I have been very disappointed at what we have seen from the Government to date, which was essentially that the current Government parties made grand promises to get into Government only for them to turn around afterwards and renege on those promises.  I saw at first hand the situation in the <Col N="507"/>north west during the general election, where Labour Party and Fine Gael candidates gave cast-iron guarantees that services would be returned to Sligo hospital within 100 days of the election, only for those election promises to be shown up for what they were.</P>
        <P>In the short time available to me, I will concentrate on Letterkenny General Hospital, with which I am most familiar and which counts most to the constituents of Donegal North-East.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, in recent days issued a diktat that there is no way he will consider hospitals running over budget.  When one considers this, it can only mean one thing, namely, treatments which otherwise would have been carried out will not be carried out.</P>
        <P>As an example, Letterkenny General Hospital had a budget last year of &euro;103 million compared to a budget of &euro;95 million this year.  This, coupled with the fact that it last year ran &euro;4.5 million over budget, shows the strain being put on the hospital to deliver the service expected of it.  Given the service it is operating at present, the hospital is facing an overrun of more than &euro;6 million this year.  For this to be addressed, the only option is that the hospital stops providing some of the services it currently provides and cuts back on other services.  Letterkenny General Hospital is different from other hospitals in that 90% of the treatments carried out there are non-elective, which means cases come through the door on a day-to-day basis and are not scheduled, which does not allow the hospital the same measure of control.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister, with the representatives of the hospitals which are currently finding difficulty in providing services, and before he issues a diktat stating they cannot run over their budgets, to ascertain what exactly this would mean for the individual hospitals.  We cannot have a situation where people are left in pain and waiting months for treatment and operations to be carried out because we cannot afford to do them.  We must give the No. 1 priority to health.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>While I cannot deal with the issue in two and a half minutes, I will simply say I am concerned by what I have heard today.  I have dealt with the HSE and the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government in recent years in regard to hospital reconfiguration.  The terminology, phrases, sentences and words I have heard here today, such as &ldquo;a new lease of life for local hospitals&rdquo; and &ldquo;no hospital will be closed but the services will change&rdquo;, are reminiscent of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Government.  It appears this represents the old centralisation and specialisation policy of the previous Government, and, although I hope I am proved wrong, I am concerned with what I have heard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Deputies Charles Flanagan and Simon Harris, who said earlier that we should take on board the views of clinicians.  In south Tipperary at present, the HSE and, it would appear, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, proposes to close the acute psychiatric unit.  To a man and woman, each clinician in the hospital, each GP in the county and each of the clinicians in the hospital to which the beds are supposed to be transferred, St. Luke&rsquo;s hospital in Kilkenny, are opposed to the closure of that acute psychiatric unit.  I agree with the Deputies to whom I referred that we should take this on board.</P>
        <P>I hope we are not going back to the centralisation and specialisation policy of the previous Government, which is not a soundly based, evidence based or patient centred policy.  There is clear international, independent professional evidence which confirms that medium sized hospitals in the 200-bed to 400-bed range provide much better quality of service, value for money and access for patients and their families.  General hospital services should be provided on that basis as close as possible to local communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not have as much speaking time as I would like, I thank the Minister for coming to visit South Tipperary General Hospital in Clonmel.  The Minister <Col N="508"/>made great promises as to what he would do with the HSE and while he has removed the board, little other change has taken place, although I do not blame him for all of that as he inherited many of the problems.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to give a commitment that the reconfiguration of South Tipperary General Hospital has been abandoned.  Thankfully, the hospital has a full complement of staff, unlike some other hospitals where shortage of staff or inability to get staff is being blamed.  I note that a team of accountants is involved and that this is the only hospital in the country being singled out in this way.  It is an attack by the HSE on the services provided by South Tipperary General Hospital and it is being carried out under the Minister&rsquo;s watch but I will take him at his word.  Clonmel is the base for a large number of high technology and pharmaceutical industries and it has an extensive catchment area.  We saw what happened to north Tipperary when Nenagh hospital closed and transferred to Limerick.  Patients and staff are frightened by what they see happening elsewhere.  Any man is as good as his word and I will await the fulfilment of the Minister&rsquo;s commitment.</P>
        <P>We are being blackguarded with our acute psychiatric hospital, which the HSE wants to close.  The Hillery report revealed that the HSE and health board officials mismanaged the situation and rode roughshod over staff, consultants and everybody else.  We are not opposed to A Vision for Change but we cannot be accused of saying we do not need acute psychiatric beds in the case of psychotic attacks and everything else.  The psychiatric unit is located on the campus of the general hospital.  These services have to be maintained.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to speak to his Minister of State, who made a fly-by-night visit to the hospital.  I welcome the fact that she visited it but she ran in and ran out when we demanded that she come to see the problems for herself.  I ask that a deputation of Oireachtas Members from south Tipperary be facilitated in meeting her because she is avoiding the issue and will not meet us.  It is a far cry from where she stood in the last D&aacute;il.  I supported her on many issues in committee and elsewhere.  As the elected representatives of the area, we need to know what is happening.</P>

	<P>At a time when an embargo is being imposed on public sector recruitment and with record levels of unemployment, it is appropriate to restructure significantly the numbers involved in the Oireachtas.  The Minister&rsquo;s efforts in that direction are to be welcomed and I would support further radical reform in this area.  People have spoken about the need to change and possibly expand constituency size to six or seven seats.  I am a firm supporter of single seat constituencies and the Minister should give further consideration to that alternative as a way of reforming the way our political system operates.  It is often the case that the biggest competition is within political parties, which is unhelpful and does not necessarily deliver an effective Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I support Deputy Olivia Mitchell&rsquo;s comments regarding the need for full reform of local government as well as the procedures of this House.  Our local government system does not work and, while I am aware the Minister intends to bring legislation in this regard later in the year, it is not sustainable that some counties contain as many as six local authorities.  We need to consider rationalising them.</P>
        <P>Deputy Timmins spoke earlier about the electoral register.  Any reform of our electoral system needs to include a radical overhaul of how the register is compiled because to describe the system as haphazard is putting it mildly.  I hope the Minister will be able to introduce further reform in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be sharing time with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I appreciate the opportunity of speaking on this Bill.  It is welcome that by-elections will be held within six months of a vacancy arising.  Successive Governments have delayed the timing of by-elections.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated the guidelines for the number of Deputies are between 164 and 168.  This Bill will reduce that number and introduce spending limits for all elections, including the presidential election which will be held this year.  The question arises of how to maintain county boundaries while reducing the number of Members.  The west has been subjected to numerous breaches of county boundaries, often because of the constitutional preference for three, four and five seat constituencies.  Some people in rural areas will argue that a five seat constituency is too large while others would prefer to see six seat constituencies.  Perhaps that is why County Leitrim was divided on two different occasions.  It would be interesting to see the result in a five or six seat constituency in a rural area.  When Galway West was turned into a five seat constituency in advance of the 1977 general election, we were told it would improve our status.  This was before County Mayo had five seats.  I often wonder whether the people of Galway West regard having a five seat constituency as a matter of status.</P>
        <P>I never fought an election in a five seat constituency and when I was first elected in a by-election in 1975, the constituency was known as north Galway and south Roscommon.  We had already begun the habit of breaching county boundaries.  The constituency commission had not been established then and decisions were made by the Minister.  There were many allegations of gerrymandering, irrespective of who was in power.  During the 1990s there was a provincial breach when Roscommon-Longford was created as a constituency.  In more recent times, Offaly and Tipperary were created as a constituency.</P><Col N="510"/>
        <P>There have been many breaches of county and provincial boundaries and people question why these things happen and ask whether there is a better way to deal with the matter.  There has been much comment about having three, four and five-seat constituencies.  Deputy Phelan spoke about having one-seat constituencies based on a system of proportional representation, which has its merits.  It has often been said this would have carried the day in a referendum, rather than having the first past the post system which was rejected by the people.  I am worried about counties such as Leitrim which has been split into two between counties Roscommon and Sligo.  If we reduce the number of Deputies, counties such as Leitrim will lose representation more often.</P>
        <P>Before we put the issue of abolishing the Seanad to the people, perhaps we might look at the idea of every county having a Senator.  In that way, counties such as Leitrim would never suffer the absence of representation in the Oireachtas.  The United States has two Senators per state, regardless of size or population.</P>
        <P>Sometimes a by-election can take place the same day as local or European Parliament elections, for which there are good reasons.  Cost is a factor.  Some wonder why we do not have a co-option system, as we do to fill European Parliament and local authority vacancies.  I do not agree with it, but it could be considered because I have heard people ask why we should close down the D&aacute;il to go off and fight a by-election campaign.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has published a Bill on electoral spending limits and corporate donations, an issue on which I hope we will make progress.  Having a maximum expenditure limit is a welcome aspect of this Bill, while reimbursement is a new element.  In my early days in politics there was no question of receiving a refund.  If there is to be reimbursement, it should happen more quickly than has been the case up to now.  Sometimes a candidate or the party receives the money.  If a candidate has to wait a long time, there is no point in saying there is reduced reimbursement.  In the heat of a general election, common sense can sometimes go out the window when it comes to posters, canvass cards, the new phenomenon of painting cars, mobile phone technology, social networking and so on.  It is important, therefore, that we do this in a reasonable and rational way.  Some are great at putting up posters, but there is no point in seeing 20 or 30 posters at a roundabout when there are good vantage points in other parts of the country.  It is sad that posters are still being defaced.  On a more sinister level, they can be taken down and put up again seven days after polling.  As a result, candidates can be fined &euro;125 for each poster they never knew they had up.  I hope the Minister will consider this issue because people are being fined, which is completely unfair.</P>
        <P>I would like to finish by talking about the difference between an independent and a party-political candidate.  I am often told that one of the reasons for reimbursement not being provided for is that candidates of political parties may have expenses grouped together which are then posted to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Perhaps the political parties have to do this for nationwide campaigns, but it is very unfair to candidates awaiting reimbursement.  An independent candidate does not have to worry about this because there is no political party dealing with the commission.  As Fianna F&aacute;il candidates, we often allocate some money to the party to spend on a national campaign.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister when he states he wants Ireland to be in line with countries such as New Zealand and Denmark which have one Member per 35,000 population.  However, it does not immediately follow that because these countries have only one Chamber, we should do the same.  We should look at the idea of having a stronger committee system before we do away with the Seanad.  We should not vote to abolish it until we improve the committee system.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="511"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The first issue I would like to address is that of having a bicameral parliament.  Today we have been debating the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill 2010 which has already passed through the Seanad.  At the request of the Minister, we have made a great amount of amendments, very few of which have anything to do with the change of Government, as many are technical.  If we did not have a bicameral system, we would have the passed the law as it was presented in the Seanad and which the Minister now claims is technically flawed.  Therefore, we should be very careful in giving in to popular sentiment without understanding how legislation put through the Oireachtas allows the Opposition to make its case in two Houses and the Minister to make necessary amendments that come to light as a Bill goes through.</P>
        <P>In respect of the Presidential campaign, if there is to be a reimbursement level of &euro;200,000, the total spend should not be inordinately above this.  Otherwise, it will provide a major advantage for those who belong to strong parties or have a lot of wealth over those with more modest means.  While I welcome what the Government has done, it does not go far enough.  We do not charge for television coverage in Ireland, with which I totally agree.  I abhor the American system of buying advertisements on television and trying to swing the public vote.  There is not a great need for a lot of money to be spend in a Presidential campaign and I the issue should be examined again by the Government and the figure reduced.</P>
        <P>I would like to talk about the proposals in respect of D&aacute;il elections.  Either the Government should do it properly, or not at all.  The Minister has found out that population growth, allied with constitutional provisions, means any change in the number of Deputies in the D&aacute;il will be quite small.  Technically, it cannot be more than 13.  However, if we make changes at the lower end, we will find that in a country with a rapidly rising population every time we set up a commission it will have to change the constituencies radically, even if the population rises uniformly across the State.  We all know the difficulties and challenges this poses for aspiring politicians and the electorate alike.  The electorate likes constituencies to stay more or less the same and it does not like constituency changes that are forced on it owing to changing demographics.  Answering the problem by making changes at the lower end, where we hit the 30,000 mark and will be forced to make more radical changes during each revision, will deliver little benefit.  If the population rises in the intercensal period, we will arrive back at 166 Deputies in the D&aacute;il very quickly.  However, we will have had to change constituencies much more radically than if we had stuck with 164 to 168 Deputies &mdash; the margin that was given previously &mdash; and not unnecessarily changed constituencies.  This is important because, as we know, the more radical the constituency review, the more upset among the public.</P>
        <P>The other issue is the number of people we represent.  The Constitution, in a technical sense, talks about us representing 30,000 people but, to a point, that is nominal.  The reality is that each of us represents all the people in our constituencies.  Even though we might not have been elected by all of them, all of them have a right to call on us.  In a geographical sense, the population of the territory we represent is five times the number of population per seat.  If we take it at approximately 30,000, in a five-seat constituency, we represent 150,000.  However, when we compare that to single seat systems, we are comparing apples and oranges in terms of the physical area we represent.</P>
        <P>A further difficulty which arises is that with more Deputies chasing around, one must go to everything for fear that someone else will go to them.  Any Deputy in a multi-seat constituency will testify to that.  If one was the only representative in a constituency, one might stay at home the odd time.  However, we all labour under this paranoia that if one does not go, one of the other four might go and where would one be then because people will say one did not go.</P><Col N="512"/>
        <P>I looked at the terms of reference of the previous commission and what is states is amazing.  It states that it should endeavour to maintain continuity.  The Government will give these terms of reference again but it is destroying continuity by virtue of trying to change things in a minor way, namely, trying to change the number of Deputies just for the optics.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference also state the commission should have regard to the extent and identity of population in each constituency.  I often wonder if the commission ever read that.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, lives in the neighbouring county to the Taoiseach, who lives in County Mayo.  Geographically, County Mayo must be the largest constituency in the country and one of the most sparsely populated parts of Ireland.  There is only one decent town in the county in terms of population, Castlebar, and it is only a geospail&iacute;n of a town, again may I stress, in population terms.</P>
        <P>If one looks at the problem in Connacht, even Galway with a population of 60,000 or 70,000 is hardly a city in international terms.  There are very few towns.  Galway West is a large constituency with offshore islands, the large Connemara area and a large area east of the city.  It is a pity there has not been more regard to the extent of these constituencies.</P>
        <P>My prediction is that if we persist with this, counties Donegal and Kerry, some of the most sparsely areas in the country, will become five-seat constituencies.  That gives a lie to what the Minister is trying to do.  One of the terms of reference gets thrown out because continuity is destroyed and another gets thrown out because the commission has often come up with very large constituencies in rural areas.</P>
        <P>The breaching of county boundaries is inevitable because of the tolerance ruling of the Supreme Court but I have always held the view that if we are going to breach them, breach them well and at least take a slice of a county that is big enough to elect someone.  Where the real grief starts is where we take a little bit of a county and throw it into the neighbouring county.  It feels like the cuckoo in the nest.  It does not feel it belongs and it knows it cannot elect someone of its own.</P>
        <P>In regard to the number of Deputies in a constituency, we should make all constituencies three seaters.  It is very interesting that in Northern Ireland all the constituencies have the same number of seats.  Just because having different sized constituencies goes back to the 1920s does not mean it is rational that people in this House have a totally different experience of politics and face a totally different challenge in getting elected by virtue of an independent commission.  I would opt for a smaller sized constituency because of all the rivalries I mentioned.  Every constituency should have the same number of Deputies and I would opt for three because it would reduce the rivalries been Deputies in the same constituency.</P>
        <P>I could speak forever on this subject because it is one at which we really need to look.  My simple message is that if we are not going to change the Constitution, we should not bother doing this because there are more downsides than upsides.  I do not believe the Minister will get any kudos or thanks for what he is doing.  As promised before this Government came in, we need to look at this issue in its totality and have a very open debate about it.</P>
        <P>Contrary to popular myth and despite what the media in Dublin want to happen in this country, I do not believe we will ever get to a situation where people will not want to interact personally with their Deputy.  What happens in other countries is their business.  It is a charming and a good thing that people in this country feel they can go to any Deputy, whether the Taoiseach or an ordinary backbencher.  It stops elites developing and stops privilege because one does not have to go through an intermediary to see one&rsquo;s elected representative, and long may that continue.  However, to counterbalance an overly clientalist approach, which is driven <Col N="513"/>by the four and five-seat constituencies, we would reduce it somewhat by having uniform three-seat constituencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnthonyLawlor"><NameTxt>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome this Bill.  The political system requires major reform and this Bill is a first step in a positive direction to enhance democracy and political effectiveness in this country.  It is especially relevant in light of recent events which precipitated the need to introduce such legislation without delay.  The ruling by the High Court in November 2010 that there was unreasonable delay in holding the Donegal South-West by-election and that the delay was a breach of constitutional rights highlighted the need for such legislation.  Such an occurrence can never happen again.  It came about because common sense did not prevail in the previous Government to fill vacant seats in a timely fashion.</P>
<TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The UK does not need to legislate for writs to be moved because this generally occurs within three to six months of a casual vacancy arising.  In Ireland, however, to ensure history does not repeat itself, a timeframe for the holding of a by-election should be enshrined in our legislation.  I very much agree that by-elections should take place within six months of the vacancy arising.  The electorate deserves to be fairly represented in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann at all times to maintain a democratic balance within a county.  On such a small island one can understand how people can be aggrieved when neighbouring constituents, who often live only a few metres away, have an adequate share of representatives.</P>
        <P>Legislation is urgently required because, constitutionally, there must be one Deputy per 20,000 to 30,000 people in each constituency.  If this ratio is breached and people are denied their quota of representatives, a legal challenge could once more be taken to call a by-election, as occurred in November last year.  This challenge brought before the High Court last year was an unnecessary cost to the State.  This amending legislation is a mechanism for saving such wasted money and unnecessary recourse to the legal system.</P>
        <P>We have two electoral systems on this island in terms of voting for national parliamentarians and both systems have by-elections.  However, our neighbours in the North appear to address the issue of casual vacancies much more efficiently and without recourse to legislation.  This amending legislation will give reassurance to the public that their voice will be heard from both the point of view of representation and their choice of Deputy.  In Ireland we should embrace the fact we can again allow the electorate a choice to fill a causal vacancy.  The holding of a by-election is important in terms of democracy as the people&rsquo;s voice can be heard.</P>
      
        <P>This is unlike Malta, for example, where there is similar electoral system but a count-back system is worked for filling casual vacancies.</P>
        <P>Our European Parliament does not have by-elections for MEPs and there is a substitute list instead for a vacant seat.  However, the replacement MEP may not necessarily have been next in line on the official substitute list at the time of election and candidates lower on the list by default may take a seat in the Parliament.  Is this really fair?  Consequently, the Irish system appears to be fair as it allows the voice of the electorate to be heard.</P>
        <P>There is the question of the need to reduce the number of Deputies in the D&aacute;il.  According to some leading political scientists, Irish figures are comparable internationally per head of population.  The method used determines the appropriate number of representatives per cubic root of population, and based on the method, we should have 166 national politicians.  However, the Bill is correct in decreasing the number of Deputies as Ireland is over-represented in terms of elected personnel, with 1,627 local councillors, along with 166 Deputies and 60 Senators.</P>
        <P>This Government is serious about overall political reform, which must begin at the top with our national Parliament.  Reducing the number of Deputies will decrease the link between local and national issues by focusing the attention on legislation to a greater extent.  As a former <Col N="514"/>county councillor just elected to the D&aacute;il, I know the reduction in the number of Deputies will devolve power to local government and strengthen its role within communities in a move that would be appreciated by all concerned.  It was recently indicated that only 61% of Deputies spend more than six hours per week on legislative work in the D&aacute;il, and we must ensure this time is increased and that legislation becomes the primary focus of all Deputies.</P>
        <P>An argument has been raised that a reduction in the number of Deputies will affect the level of accountability in the Parliament but I argue for the contrary.  The fewer Deputies in the D&aacute;il, the more responsible they will be for their actions and they will hence be more accountable to constituents and society as a whole.</P>
        <P>This Bill is one step in addressing the lack of Government reform by previous Administrations.  The recommendations of a number of independent and Government-backed reports have been discarded in favour of self-interest and this practice will now cease.  We must change how the D&aacute;il works and how we view our role as national elected representatives.  Furthermore, in the current economic climate we cannot ignore the fact that reducing the number of Deputies is a cost-saving measure.</P>

	<P>Overall political reform is required and this Bill is a major step in that direction.  I look forward to the establishment of the electoral commission, which will be tasked with addressing the current discrepancy in the electoral registers, which we all encountered in the recent general election, as well as many other functions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome publication of this Bill after such a short period of this Government in power.  It addresses four key areas, including reducing the spending limit for the presidential election and the level of expenses that can be reimbursed to a candidate after that election.  It also introduces time limits for holding by-elections and revises the terms of reference for constituency commissions.</P>
        <P>The reduction of spending limits from &euro;1.3 million to &euro;750,000 was mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v earlier and contrary to his view, I believe it will be of benefit to smaller parties as it will allow a more level playing field relative to larger and wealthier parties.  Much more important is the reduction by 20% in the amount that will be reimbursed by the State to presidential candidates.  That falls in line with the commitment across all Departments to seek cost savings where possible.</P>
        <P>A third element is the introduction of time limits for holding by-elections.  One of the most regrettable elements of the last Government&rsquo;s term in power was the abuse of democracy in our country by its refusing to hold by-elections for such a long period.  It is to the credit of Deputy Pearse Doherty &mdash; who is in the House &mdash; that he was involved in forcing a High Court case on the matter.  It is unfortunate that we have been forced into a position where we must legislate to protect this D&aacute;il and democracy from a repeat of that abuse in the future.  The six-month time limit must be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v noted that if one cannot do it properly, nothing should be done; with electoral and political reform over the past 14 years, the last Government focused all its energy on not doing anything.  In a brief time in power this Government has committed to an abolition, through referendum, of the Seanad and the reduction in the numbers of Deputies.  As a result, we will see a reduction approaching 30% in the costs and numbers of representatives within the Oireachtas.  Both parties in the Government gave a very clear commitment in advance of the general election that reform, savings and reductions must be delivered from the top down.</P><Col N="515"/>
        <P>By virtue of the mandate which both Government parties received, and contrary to the view expressed by the main Opposition party, our people are ambitious to see real political reform.  Although the new census has limited the option to leave a D&aacute;il with between 152 and 160 Deputies, in addition to the potential reduction with the abolition of the Seanad, there will be enormous reform.</P>
        <P>With regard to the electoral commission to be set up, some constituencies have seen repeated changes in boundaries.  I know the commission will be independent but I would like to see where possible that constituencies which have seen many changes in boundaries in the past would have that factor taken into account.  In my constituency of Cork North-Central there are elements to the north east and north west of the area that have been in three different constituencies in recent years.  There must be an element of continuity.  Where there has been a boundary change, another one should not be foisted on people.  Otherwise, I welcome the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinHeydon"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Heydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to the Bill this evening.  During the recent election campaign I was asked many times, as a new candidate, why I had decided to run in politics.  One of the main reasons was to become involved in political reform.  There is a strong sense of cynicism in the electorate.  People feel politics has failed them in many respects.  I have always believed that the system could be changed but this can only be done from the inside.</P>
        <P>The cynicism I refer to has affected all politics.  Change is so important that we must, as a collective, restore people&rsquo;s faith in politics.  Pope John Paul II once referred to politics as a &ldquo;noble art&rdquo;.  I believe in this sentiment, having grown up with the history of Collins, Cosgrave, Costello and FitzGerald.  I want to see politicians once again in the same light in which those true statesmen are viewed.  To do this we must change how politics work and make it more relevant to people&rsquo;s daily lives.</P>
        <P>How can we best do this?  We must recognise that one amendment will not change everything.  National politics has always been linked with local authorities and local representation.  We cannot change the representation of the D&aacute;il or the role of the Deputy without changing our local councils and the role of councillors.  Prior to the recent general election I met many constituents who expressed their desire that I should deal with national issues, if elected, rather than parish pump politics.  Since my election on 25 February, I have met many constituents who want me to deal with more local issues that affect their lives while pursuing national issues in how they affect my constituency of Kildare South.</P>
        <P>It is vital to balance local and national issues.  A public representative should remain aware of the issues affecting constituents locally while dealing with national issues that affect constituents&rsquo; lives in other less direct ways.  To best do so, the role of the Deputy must be supported by strong local representation in local authorities.  By empowering and adequately funding local government, we can greatly support the Deputy in spending more time on legislative issues.</P>
        <P>This Bill will see the constituency commission charged with relocating constituency boundaries while returning fewer Deputies to the D&aacute;il.  If we are to reduce the number of Deputies, at the same time we must consider the role local authority members can play in the new political landscape.  If the number of Deputies is to be reduced at a time when the population is continuing to increase, the role of the Deputy will have to change to take cognisance of the greater number of people each Deputy will be representing.</P>
        <P>I agree with the recommendation that the commission should try to keep constituencies within county boundaries.  I encourage the commission to act in such a manner.  People have an affinity with where they are from.  It is a great help for them to be able to connect with their public representatives if they share a common bond.  This is already proving to be a reforming <Col N="516"/>D&aacute;il.  A record number of new Members were returned at this year&rsquo;s general election.  There is a great sense of opportunity and possibility at this time.  I feel empowered by the opportunity to change the system.  Some important reforms have taken place since March.  The pay of the Taoiseach and Ministers has been cut.  The arrangements for ministerial cars and drivers have been changed.  Radical changes have been made to the pensions system.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers referred to the old system for organising by-elections with particular reference to the vacancy that arose in Donegal South-West during the previous D&aacute;il.  An important point needs to be made in that context.  I believe it will be addressed.  I would welcome it.  Decisions on representation in this Chamber should not be made at the whim of any Government, including this one.  It is important for such decisions to be taken out of the hands of the Government of the day.  I discovered when the census results were published recently that I represent more than the permitted maximum of 30,000 people.  I look forward to the review of constituencies and boundaries.</P>
        <P>Politics needs to regain credibility.  If this is to happen, we must show the ability to reform.  We must listen to the people who comprise our electorate.  If they have become cynical, it is because politics failed them in the past.  Many of them do not believe politicians have the good of the public at heart.  It is up to us to restore trust and confidence through our actions and hard work.  If we are to regain trust and a belief in honesty and fairness, we must remember we are here to serve.  This Bill is a good starting point.  I hope we can build on the proposals in it to restore a system people will believe in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickDeering"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Deering</NameTxt>
	<P>Like previous speakers, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As others said, it has been introduced as part of the process of reform that has been ongoing since this D&aacute;il first met on 9 March last.  Never before have we seen so much reform in such a short space of time.  On its first day in office, the Government reduced the Taoiseach&rsquo;s salary and introduced a new structure for the transport of Ministers.  It is possible that there will be a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad, which would be important.</P>
        <P>This Bill focuses on three areas, the first of which is the proposal to ensure by-elections are held within six months.  The current arrangements for the holding of by-elections have been abused in the past by most of the large parties, including my party probably.  Politics has been played.  As we saw last November, the only people who win in such circumstances are the legal people in the High Court.  This situation must not be allowed to continue.  I welcome the proposal to provide for a six-month period in which future by-elections must be held.  The second focus of this Bill is the reduction in the amount of money that can be spent during Presidential election campaigns.  This measure must be commended.  I would like to concentrate on the third focus of this Bill, which is the establishment of a boundary commission.</P>
        <P>I listened attentively to Deputy Colreavy when he referred to himself as &ldquo;almost an extinct species as a Deputy who happens to live in County Leitrim&rdquo;.  I have the honour of representing the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency.  As a resident of east Carlow, however, I have to vote in the Wicklow constituency.  Therefore, my family, friends and neighbours are not in a position to vote for me.  I am a proud Carlow man.  It is essential that county boundaries be observed when constituencies are drawn up.  Many organisations, including the IFA, the ICMSA and the GAA, use simple slogans like &ldquo;one club &mdash; one county&rdquo;.  It is essential that county boundaries be maintained as far as possible, especially in rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>It was mentioned earlier that people in rural Ireland, in particular, like to be able to associate with their local Deputies.  They like to be able to talk to us in a positive or negative manner.  It is essential that such contacts be maintained if possible, especially at county level.  We are <Col N="517"/>all very important.  People get disillusioned and disenfranchised when they are not in a position to vote for the people they would like to vote for in their particular areas.  When they are voting for people in one area at local authority elections and in a completely different area at general elections, they see no option.  This issue has to be addressed if we are to get more people involved and interested, rather than completely disillusioned.  It is important that we address such matters as we move into the future.</P>
        <P>It is important for us to address the issues that were raised during the recent general election.  Like previous speakers, I can say that the reform of the political system was raised at every second house I visited during the election campaign.  It is important that we follow through on the reforms to which we committed ourselves.  This Bill is an important step in that process.  We must take into account the reform of local government that will take place in the coming weeks and months.  When taken together, these measures will form the basis of a new Ireland of which we can all be proud.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with pleasure that I stand to address the House on this legislation.  It is very rare that a Deputy speaks on legislation, some of which he had a part in instigating.  I think I can say that in the case of the proposal that by-elections be held within six months.  The reality is that following my victory and that of my party in the High Court last year, it is unlikely that any Government would get away with not holding a by-election within a six-month period, or at least shortly afterwards.  A number of the Fine Gael speakers rightly acknowledged that no Government should have the right to obstruct democracy and delay a by-election for its own selfish reasons.  Some Deputies mentioned that Fianna F&aacute;il is not the only party to have been guilty of such behaviour.  Sometimes we think Fianna F&aacute;il is the only party to act in this way.  Donegal South-West is probably a case in point.  In the 1980s, a Fine Gael-Labour Party Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Deputy is going back a long way.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Yes.  It was the only other by-election that was supposed to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The difference in the 1980s was that nobody had the guts to take the Government to court at that time and to win their case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair play to the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what happened at the time.  The Minister might be able to confirm that the Government was hanging on by one vote at the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was before I was born.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.  I think the Government had a majority of one in the early 1980s.  If the by-election took place &mdash; one of the Coughlans had passed away &mdash; it was likely to be won by Fianna F&aacute;il, which would have resulted in the collapse of the Government.  It is unlikely that the Government will need to delay a by-election during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il in order to stay in office.  The introduction of this legislation by the Minister is the right step and the right thing to do.</P>
        <P>I would like to reiterate one of the first questions I asked the Taoiseach after I was elected to this D&aacute;il.  I asked him whether the previous Government&rsquo;s decision to appeal last year&rsquo;s verdict to the Supreme Court would be halted in light of the likelihood of this legislation being <Col N="518"/>presented.  I should mention a possible conflict of interest, given that the reason for the appeal, which the current Government is continuing to uphold, was the decision I secured in the High Court.  The Government&rsquo;s representatives and my own legal team have had to present themselves in the Supreme Court on a number of occasions.  My team has presented itself there on three separate occasions.  A great deal of work is being done on a weekly basis to prepare for that appeal.  It is listed as a priority case in the Supreme Court.</P>
        <P>Given that legislation is before this House to ensure by-elections are held within six months of the vacancy arising, given that the by-election which was the subject of my case has taken place and given that the D&aacute;il to which I was subsequently elected no longer exists &mdash; a general election has been held since then &mdash; it makes no sense to continue to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.  It is nonsensical for the reasons I have outlined.  If the appeal goes ahead in the Supreme Court &mdash; I do not wish to predetermine the outcome of the judges&rsquo; deliberations &mdash; I suggest the clear decision that was made by the President of the High Court will be upheld.  The arguments that were made last year are as valid today, if not more so in light of the introduction of this legislation, as they were at that time.</P>
        <P>Many members spoke about the need to reform politics and reduce the costs associated with it.  The costs involved in appealing this case to the Supreme Court are absolutely massive, especially at a time when cuts are being imposed in areas like education.  The ongoing health cuts were discussed in the context of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion.  It is more than likely that the cost of this appeal will run into hundreds of thousands of euro.  It will waste the time of the Government&rsquo;s legal representatives and of my legal team, not to mention my own time.  If this section of the Bill is enacted, hopefully the Government will instruct the Attorney General to withdraw the appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
        <P>That said, this measure is to be welcomed and I commend the Minister on speedily introducing this legislation.  The arguments put up by the previous Government simply do not wash.  We should not have the right to postpone democracy for whatever reason.  I do not agree with some listening to the debate who have argued that if there was another election pending in a number of months, we should suspend the by-election.  I believe in a six-month outer limit.</P>
        <P>One can look back, as I did in preparation for the High Court appeal, at the vacancies that were filled during difficult turbulent times in the State&rsquo;s history such as the Civil War where vacancies were filled within a number of weeks of a death arising.  In recent times, it has not been as a result of death but the result of resignation or of Members being elected to higher office, etc.</P>
        <P>There is also an argument being put forward, although not in this legislation, that by-elections are not the best way to deal with this issue and we should adopt one of the other member state&rsquo;s ways of dealing with it, which is, taking the next person on the list, namely the person who has the highest first preference vote afterwards, or the party or independent nominating someone to replace the Member, as happens at local authority level.  I disagree because by-elections are a good barometer of public opinion and the D&aacute;il must be accountable to the people.  We are only here at the whim of the electorate and it is the people of the State who are sovereign.  It is important, in terms of having that barometer, to be able to go to the people to ask who they want to represent them in the constituency and I commend the Minister on this legislation.</P>
        <P>There has been much debate about this reduction in the number of TDs.  I have listened to speakers who have argued for this say that no Government has ever brought in so much political reform.  That is probably the case.  There is much political reform.  I stated on RTE this week that one of the matters on which I commend the Government is that it is bringing <Col N="519"/>forward political reform.  I welcome much of the stuff.  There are some parts of it that I do not like but, in saying that, there is perhaps more that I could support than I would not support.</P>
        <P>On political reform in the context of reducing the number of TDs, I can speak on my party&rsquo;s opinion but I will speak personally.  I have not been convinced by any speaker as to how reducing the number of TDs will make this institution any more effective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Doherty can vote against the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I will vote against the Bill.  I am genuinely engaging; I am not having a go.  We are all on the same page that we want a more effective Parliament.  We want to deliver better.  We should be focused on national issues.  We are legislators and we need to deal with the big issues that affect every person across the State, and that is the parish pump politics as well.  Instead of dealing with the local school that is being closed, let us deal with the legislation that affects that or let us deal with the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Doherty is not too bad at it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the reality.  The question is: how reducing the number of TDs will make this institution any better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>On its own, it will not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not, that is true.  An argument that has been put forward is that it will stop us being more parochial and force us to deal with national legislation in a bigger way.  That is nonsense.  We could have the best institutions and the best reform packages possible, but unless TDs want to step up to the mark, then it makes no difference.  When I started off in electoral politics members of other political parties told me the only way I would get elected in a rural constituency was to attend every funeral and wake.  &ldquo;Not a hope in hell&rdquo;, was my reply.  I was not doing it because it is not my personality nor is it my politics.  My mantra was I can either attend your funeral when you are dead or try to change your life for the better when you are alive.  Thankfully, that viewpoint has resonated with the people.  In the last election I topped the poll.  In the by-election I got elected as well.  It shows that people are not fickle, that they want their representatives to speak on the national issue that affects them locally.  That is the point.  Having 152 TDs will not solve that issue.</P>
        <P>If reducing the number of TDs will not deliver a better system, then the question is why we are doing it.  If the only reason we are doing it is to reduce costs, I presented a Bill to the House, which has passed First Stage, to reduce the cost of TDs.  For example, if we reduce the number of TDs by 14, the maximum allowed under this legislation, the savings on TDs&rsquo; wages would be in the region of &euro;1.8 million.  If the Minister takes the proposal in the Bill that I presented to the House a fortnight ago, which is to cut TDs&rsquo; salaries by 15%, which would still leave them handsomely paid at &euro;75,000 per year, which is nothing to shy away from, he would save in excess of &euro;1 million more than what is being presented under this legislation.  If we want to save costs, that is the way to do it.</P>
        <P>One of the ways we could try to ensure there were more TDs dealing with national legislation is to look at the list system.  Many parties argued for a list system or partial list system in their political reform proposals in the run up to the election, and I am disappointed a partial list system is not included in this legislation.  If we are serious about political reform, why are we cutting the number of TDs which, while popular, will not make the institution any more effective or lead to better government?  Perhaps we should look at the list system for which we all argued beforehand.  Many of us had different views as to how the list system would be elected. <Col N="520"/> Sinn F&eacute;in favours a mixed system where two thirds would be elected through PR-STV and one third would be elected via the list system.  I put that to the Minister as something he may look at in future legislation.</P>
        <P>Others have argued against the multi-seat constituencies but I think it is important to keep them because it is the best way of ensuring the minority view in a constituency has a representative in the House.  We cannot have a Parliament that is dominated by larger parties.  This House represents a more balanced view of the public between the four larger parties and a large number of Independents, and that is healthy for democracy.  The limitation placed on the constituency commission that the maximum number of seats in any constituency is five is something that should be looked at.  I would like to hear the arguments why we do not allow the commission to look at a six-seat constituency.  For example, if there was a six-seat constituency, it would probably mean that Donegal would be one constituency.  Coming up to election time, I would not thank the Minister that I would have to travel all the way to Malin Head.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Would Deputy Doherty settle for a five-seater?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither would Deputy Mac Lochlainn thank the Minister for it.  For example, if my proposal of a partial list system were to be enacted, then Donegal would have to be a single constituency and that poses major challenges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Very parochial.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not good from the point of view of a candidate or an elected representative, but it is the best way of dealing with it.  Having a larger constituency with more seats ensures the minority view will get heard and, one hopes, be represented in Parliament while ensuring at the same time that the majority view is returned in enough numbers to form a Government.  The issue of six-seat or seven-seat constituencies is something we should look at.</P>
        <P>I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on a constitutional change.  The 30,000 person limit in the Constitution is something that probably needs to be changed.  It is likely that this limit will have to be amended in the coming months or years ahead.  We should do it now.  It is something that was developed a long time ago and it puts too many constraints on the commission.  While constituencies should be broadly in line with each other with each TD representing so many constituents, because of the population growth in the State, it is placing too many constraints on the constituency commission which results in our dividing, dissecting and putting pieces of counties here, there and everywhere.  Other Deputies have referred to people&rsquo;s identity, their association with their county and the identity we have with our parish which stems from the Gaelic Athletic Association.  Everyone likes to wear their county jersey but in future some Deputies may have to wear three or four jerseys and that would be awkward for them.  I am keen to hear the arguments in this regard.</P>
        <P>My argument against cutting the number of Deputies is simply because I am not convinced it will make the House any better.  I accept there is an issue in respect of what happens to backbenchers.  Last week, I listened to a maiden speech given by a Deputy some four months after the election.  It was a good speech and the Deputy had a good deal of knowledge on the issue before the House.  This shows up a real issue: what is a backbencher to do?  What does a person do who is part of a larger party in which, generally, the speaking time is divided between the Front Bench and Ministers of State?  These people do not have the option or chance to get involved in the legislation although they may wish to get involved in the nuts and bolts of it but cannot because of these constraints.  There are ways to deal with this through reform of the committees, some of which is underway.  Other changes need to take place within the <Col N="521"/>House.  People are constrained under Standing Orders in respect of the type of questioning in which they can engage.</P>
        <P>I wish to advert to several other things not included in the legislation.  I call on the Minister to examine one issue of concern to me in respect of which someone might end up going to the High Court if it is repeated in future.  At the last election, people were denied their vote because of the rules.  People from many of the islands vote on a different day from the mainland.  I refer to the example of Arranmore Island off the coast of Donegal.  A person working on Arranmore Island but away from home would not be there to cast his or her vote on election day and should be entitled under legislation to a postal vote because he or she is working away from home.  The vote should be stamped from the employer or, if the person is self employed, he or she fills in the appropriate form.  A problem arose at the last election in the case of a person working away from home on the island.  A person was unable to fill in the required form because the form had to be with the local authority, in this case Donegal County Council, before a certain date.  The person had to indicate on the form that he or she would be working away from home on the date of the election.  However, the election date was not set until after the deadline for the postal vote form.  This is a real issue and there are several ways to address it.  I sent an appeal on radio for someone to come forward and go to the High Court but no one has come forward so far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy indemnify the costs of the plaintiff?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I had not thought about it.  The right to cast one&rsquo;s vote is important.  I asked the ferryman providing a service to Arranmore Island to tell me the number of days during the course of last year he was unable to get in and out of the island.  He put it to me that he was able to get in and out of the island every day last year.  That is the norm.  The practice of having a different day for voting on the island can be a problem.  I realise there are smaller islands without proper piers and so on but we should examine that problem.</P>
        <P>Another issue is the option of automatic registration and especially the provision of registration days in colleges.  Simple measures could be carried out.  There is much talk of political reform and cutting the number of Deputies.  Among the most effective things we could do are to allow people to register up until the day of the vote, with appropriate safeguards in place; have registration days in colleges; and get the Garda to go into colleges on certain days to register people for postal votes.  At present, the timeframes involved are too tight and cumbersome and people are unable to get to Garda stations on time.  I call on the Minister to deal with the issue of postal votes in rural areas whereby one must go to a Garda station but where the Garda station is only open for a number of hours.  This is causing people to be unable to register on the supplementary register and for a postal vote and they are being disenfranchised as a result.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact the Minister is legislating in respect of by-elections.  I do not welcome the proposed reduction in the number of Deputies because it does not lead to political reform.  If the Minister intends to push through this legislation and if he succeeds in attaining a reduction of approximately 14 Deputies, since there will be empty chairs he may consider allowing northern representation.  We could fill the gaps with representatives from the North, as agreed at the time of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldNash"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerald Nash</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Kevin Humphreys, White and Moloney.  During the last election all parties represented in the House spoke of the need for electoral reform.  As reflected in the electoral outcome it is clear there is an appetite for political change.  I welcome the proposals outlined in the Bill but I would be concerned were we to <Col N="522"/>consider the job complete if and when the Bill is passed.  Otherwise, we would have missed a golden opportunity to make a lasting, effective and positive change to our political landscape and processes.</P>
        <P>The reductions in spending limits for the presidential election as reflected in the Bill make a good deal of sense.  These reductions should be extended to all elections and to spending prior to elections for a greater period than is the case at present.  Political participation whether at local or national level should not be the exclusive preserve of the rich, the well-connected and those in the best position to finance an election campaign.</P>
        <P>The introduction a time limit of six months for the holding of by-elections makes sense as well.  Never again should we encounter the farcical situation whereby the Government is dragged through the courts at great expense to the taxpayer to force the calling of a by-election, a matter reflected on in considerable detail by Deputy Doherty.  I note from my observation of the monitor earlier that he was not behind the door when it came to congratulating himself on several occasions for embarking on that particular journey but in fairness to him, credit is due.  I add the caveat that we should consider the wisdom of being required to hold by-elections at all.  By-elections tend to be dominated by local issues and personalities.  Alternatively, they can become a referendum on a given Government&rsquo;s popularity at a given time.  The record of Government parties in by-elections during the past 30 years speaks for itself.  Is it sensible to decide the make up a Government following a national general election and then allow its stability to be chipped away by a succession of by-elections?  This is not likely to be an issue in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il but it has been in the past and inevitably it will be in the future.  There is a strong argument in favour of considering a substitution system following the departure of a Member from the House.</P>
        <P>The reduction in the number of Deputies makes sense but it should be tied into the larger scenario of reform of local and national government.  In essence reform should redefine the roles and demands made on local and national politicians.  Merely tinkering with the number of Deputies is not enough.  It is clear from the census results that a significant reduction in numbers cannot be achieved without amending the Constitution.  This is a personal opinion but we should proceed and amend it to reflect a different scenario with, possibly, a greater reduction in the number of Deputies.  This could be done with relatively little expense and at the time of the presidential election and it is worth considering.</P>
        <P>It is imperative that the message goes out from this House that politicians are not seen to be in the business of self-preservation.  Everyone will agree this would reflect badly on the business of politics, a profession already badly damaged in recent years.  The number of Deputies is almost irrelevant unless we tie it to changes in local government.  I realise the Minister is keen to embark on a process of reform of local government which will better reflect the situation in which we find ourselves at present.  We have a system more akin to local administration than local government.  There is a strong case for potentially halving the number of local authorities, consolidating the number of councillors, giving them real and meaningful jobs to do and providing them with more powerful roles.  I imagine the Minister will be keen to get his teeth into these matters at a later stage in this D&aacute;il term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy trying to get rid of me already?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldNash"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerald Nash</NameTxt>
	<P>When we are discussing local elections and local authorities we tend to stick rigidly to maps drawn 500 years ago by an English Queen.  While county boundaries determine the colour of the jersey one wears on Sunday, they should not act as impediments to the development of places such as my home town of Drogheda, which I represent and which <Col N="523"/>is seriously constrained by the position in which it finds itself.  Waterford is in a similar position, as is Athlone, but I note action has been taken in respect of Limerick.  Moreover, while consideration might be given to making membership of a local authority a full-time occupation, this should be examined as part of the entire spectrum of political reform.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill as a highly positive step and a start on electoral reform for the Government.  It will send a strong message that the Government is serious about what it is doing, that it is not business as usual and that the system will be reformed and made more effective.  There is an opportunity to make a real difference to the political system during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il and I believe all sides of the House wish to see progress in this regard.  This has been reflected in much of what I have heard during today&rsquo;s debate and I look forward to hearing the views of other Deputies, as well as considering other elements of this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KevinHumphreys"><NameTxt>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</NameTxt>
	<P>Having listened to Deputy Nash&rsquo;s contribution, I now discern the reason we are members of the same political party.  First, I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill so swiftly.  It is a down payment on what must be done with regard to reform.  The Minister has worked exceptionally hard to bring this legislation before the House and I congratulate him.</P>
        <P>The first point I wish to consider is the reduction in spending limits for the presidential election.  I consider the reduction of this limit to &euro;750,000 to be highly positive although personally, I would prefer it to be reduced further.  I am open to considering this point on Committee Stage and intend to make a submission in this regard at that stage.</P>
        <P>In itself, this reduction in spending limits will produce savings because the maximum reimbursement to a candidate will be reduced by &euro;60,000.  Were three candidates to qualify for such a reimbursement, the total saving would be &euro;180,000, which in these days of austerity, equates to two classrooms.  This point should not be undermined and this example should be made.  Costs must be contained and the influence of money must be minimised in the exercise of democracy.  Much remains to be done in this regard and the issue of corporate donations must be tackled and transparency must be increased.  While this measure constitutes a major part of a move in the right direction, one must continue to push forward in this regard.</P>
        <P>The second major provision all Members can welcome concerns the creation of a six-month limit on by-elections.  This issue brought the House into great disrepute during the last D&aacute;il and as Deputy Nash observed, the previous Government should be ashamed of its idea that one can block a by-election.  This six-month limit is an excellent idea and I congratulate Deputy Pearse Doherty on taking this issue to court.  In this context, Members must consider and discuss whether the existing method of holding by-elections should be retained or whether consideration should be given to adopting the co-option system used in local Government to fill vacancies.  I welcome that this measure will bring back dignity to the House, in that a defined structure will be in place on how Members who either leave the House or pass away may be replaced.</P>
        <P>Deputy Pearse Doherty nodded when the Minister stated previously that this is the first step, which in itself is insufficient and that Members must go much further.  Deputy Nash made the point clearly on how the strengthening and reform of local Government will bring about real reform and will allow for a great deal more time to be left to concentrate on legislation in this House.  The vast majority of Members in this D&aacute;il have been concentrating on legislation and one may observe the welcome engagement in committee of the new Deputies.</P>
        <P>As for the reduction in the number of D&aacute;il Deputies, each Member in this House has a vested interest in not voting for this measure.</P>

If they ask the rest of the country to accept cuts and reductions, they also must lead in that regard.  I was present in the Chamber this morning and was struck by the number of matters raised under Standing Order 32 on purely parochial and local issues.  This measure will shift the balance in this regard, as local government, rather than the national Parliament, should deal with local issues.</P>
        <P>As the Government tackles the massive challenges of closing the deficit, reducing spending and getting Ireland back to work, it is critical that Members lead by example.  This measure is an important symbol of the changes being brought about by the Government in respect of the way Members and society as a whole work.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s bravery and the effort he has made in pushing through this measure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2011.  It constitutes an important advance and as other speakers have noted, it forms a single element of a highly ambitious programme of reform the Government has set out to achieve and introduce.  It is important that Members bear this point in mind.</P>
        <P>One of the most important measures that has been agreed in the programme for Government is the establishment of a constitutional convention.  I heard Deputies Pearse Doherty and &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v making a number of points earlier that I thought had great validity such as, for example, a suggestion about a list system.  In addition to a number of suggestions from other speakers, such a change could only be dealt with or addressed through constitutional change, which is the reason it will be extremely important for the Government to turn its attention as quickly as possible, hopefully later this year, to establishing the constitutional convention once it has got through the more immediate proposals regarding constitutional change and the referendums that already are on the blocks.  It is only when such a constitutional convention is established that it will be possible to consider all these issues in the round.  It will be possible to consider matters more widely.</P>
        <P>Electoral reform and the electoral system for the D&aacute;il is one of the priority items in the programme for Government the constitutional convention is to address.  It will provide the opportunity to deal with questions such as whether there should be a list system, the broader question of elections or perhaps the establishment of a permanent electoral commission.  In itself, that measure would not require a constitutional change but broad questions on what electoral system it is best to have or how best to elect people to this Parliament can be addressed in the context of a constitutional convention.  I hope such a convention is brought forward as early as possible in the autumn.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, simply because one states it is necessary to have a broader debate on such issues and on how to have constitutional change, this does not mean there are no measures that can be taken now.  One should not allow the perfect be the enemy of the possible or the more immediately achievable measures such as those contained in this legislation.  It contains three discrete items, each of which can and should be dealt with at this time and which should <Col N="525"/>not be obliged to wait for the broader programme or agenda.  The question of by-elections manifestly should be dealt with as quickly as possible and it is good the Minister has brought forward this measure so quickly.  The Government may consider itself to be under a certain amount of pressure on foot of the High Court decision but notwithstanding that, it still is commendable that the Government has brought forward this proposal as quickly as it has.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;fighting what would have been my second by-election within the lifetime of the previous D&aacute;il.  However, it is important to get away from the temptation that exists for all governments but which was particularly unacceptable and remarkable during the last D&aacute;il, when for naked political advantage, there was a clear attempt to avoid facing the people and to avoid being obliged to face a position in this Chamber in which the Government&rsquo;s majority manifestly would be threatened if not brought down.  This measure is highly important and I congratulate the Minister for bringing it forward so quickly by way of legislation.</P>
        <P>There has been much debate recently on the relationship between the Executive, the Parliament, the courts and the Judiciary but it should never be necessary in a democracy for any citizen to be obliged to apply to the courts to vindicate what is the most fundamental democratic right he or she has, which is the right to cast a vote and be represented in Parliament.  It really should never be necessary.  The Minister referred in his speech to the choice between three, four or seven months and, in my view, the choice of a six-month period is correct.  It is also wise to maintain the current system for that six months, in other words, that parties are allowed to maintain the convention of bringing forward the writ within a six-month period and, if this is not done, the mechanism is triggered as per the legislation.</P>
        <P>As regards the number of Deputies, I admit that I am sceptical about the reduction in numbers.  I will support the proposal but I hope the commission will find it necessary and appropriate to err towards the higher number of the interval proposed by the Minister.  I understand all the arguments about change from the top and cost but the level of representation of the people in Parliament is extremely important and we must ensure a level of representation.  The Minister referred to the numbers in the combined Houses, the D&aacute;il and Seanad, of 226 Members and he applied this number to the population of 4.5 million.  Realistically it should be computed on the basis of the D&aacute;il.  The Seanad is an important Chamber and we will have to deal with the question of whether it is to be retained.  However, it is not representative in the way this House is.  If we were to choose the median number of 157 Members, it would end up that the ratio would be one Member to approximately 30,000.  This is equivalent to the representation in Denmark and New Zealand and these other countries to which the Minister referred.  I maintain my scepticism but I support the Minister on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonnMaloney"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamonn Maloney</NameTxt>
	<P>Like others in the Labour Party, I welcome the Bill, which is long overdue.  The issues to be dealt with are, among others, the issues debated during the general election, and the Minister has taken action in this regard by presenting the Bill to the House.</P>
        <P>I am at one with the other speakers on the proposals for by-elections and for the expenditure limits in presidential elections.  I welcome and look forward to the establishment of the commission which will provide a great opportunity for citizens who have much to say and have opinions on how this country should be reformed and modernised.  This is an opportunity presented by this Government to the population.</P><Col N="526"/>
        <P>I have been a life-long opponent of the Seanad because it has its roots in elitism and in the outgoing British authorities and their discussions with the incoming new Irish establishment and not one, but two, churches.  I have never had any time for the Seanad, aside from the fact that people talk about how much money its abolition will save, be that &euro;7 million or &euro;8 million.  In recent times I hear people talking about how important for democracy it is to preserve the Upper House.  I have never heard one of these people referring to the representation of one of the largest sections of Irish society, the almost 500,000 unemployed people.  I did not hear a single person during the Seanad elections talk about having someone in the Seanad who is unemployed.  I look forward to the establishment of the commission and to the abolition of the Seanad.  In case the Minister is nervous about reducing the number of TDs, I was out in Kildare Street earlier and I did not see thousands of Irish people with their placards so it is obvious the Minister is doing the right thing.  On the other hand, I would be bringing the Minister a different message if he were to propose to increase the number of TDs, and the situation outside these large granite walls with their large black railings would be different.</P>
        <P>I must make it clear that some Members of the Seanad have done some very good things.  I can think of one good Member&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>There may be others from Cork.  We were in the council together so I always admired this man&rsquo;s contribution.  I hate to disagree with my Labour Party colleagues but, in my view, the Minister did not go far enough.  One of the best examples is that great Cork man, Se&aacute;n Moylan, from north Cork, a former IRA man, former Sinn F&eacute;in man, and, dare I say, a former Fianna F&aacute;il man.  He had very independent views about the size of this House because of the size of the nation and I agree with him entirely.  I could count on one hand the number of times I have been in agreement with a Fianna F&aacute;il man but Se&aacute;n Moylan was right.  He thought the D&aacute;il had too many Members for a new nation and things could not be done.  I regret it was not a Labour man or a Fine Gael man who said it but I agree with the Cork man.  If the Minister were to reduce the numbers even further, I would have no qualms about that.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Joan Collins.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and to comment on some matters raised during the course of the debate.  I welcome the provision in the Bill whereby by-elections will take place within six months of the vacancy arising.  We are agreed the situation was completely unacceptable and almost anti-democratic, especially the almost two-year delay in the case of Donegal South-West by-election and the almost year-long delay before the by-elections in Waterford and Dublin South were held.  The six-month period is correct.</P>
        <P>I do not understand the reason the previous Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government had allowed this matter to go to the courts for adjudication.  Deputy Doherty won that court case but I do not understand why an appeal was lodged nor do I understand why the current Government appears to be continuing that appeal.  I am assuming that once this Bill is passed, the appeal will be withdrawn.</P>
        <P>The proposals for the spending limits for the presidential election are welcome but whether they go far enough is a matter for debate.  I would like to see a further reduction in the limits.  The Minister should have taken the opportunity to include proposals for spending limits in other elections, in particular, D&aacute;il elections.  There is room for significant reductions in spending <Col N="527"/>on general elections.  The very narrow timescale included for election expenditure from the date of the announcement of the election to the election day is much too short a timescale.  Other spending through the course of the previous 12 months should be included in election expenditure.  It is quite clear there is much expenditure in the period before the election which should be regarded as election expenditure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichelleMulherin"><NameTxt>Deputy Michelle Mulherin</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the Minister&rsquo;s announcement last week of the merger of the vocational education committees of Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim, I ask him to consider locating the newly created organisation&rsquo;s headquarters in the town of Ballina in Mayo.  The announcement of the restructuring of the country&rsquo;s VECs has been expected for some time.  The educational needs of schoolchildren and adult learners in all three counties will be best served by establishing a completely new headquarters.  I call on the Minister to ensure that it is located in Ballina where the VEC already has a strong base. </P>
        <P>The new VEC will serve a huge geographical area.  Ballina is the natural choice.  It is the most central large town because it is as accessible to Ballinrobe to Ballinamore or Ballinode.  The transition from three organisations to one will involve a considerable challenge for the new partners but the overriding concern must be the educational needs of students.  The transition must be swift and smooth.  The first challenge will be to quickly assemble a team that has the skills and experience to deal with such a large area with many diverse educational needs.</P>
        <P>Mayo VEC, which is the biggest of the three VECs, has 750 teachers and administrative staff compared to Sligo which has 170 and Leitrim which has 110.  Therefore, Mayo VEC has proven itself capable of operating a quality education and training service with great success to a vast county that caters for people of all ages, from 12 year olds entering secondary school for the first time to doctorate students through its close relationship with GMIT in Castlebar and the Institute&rsquo;s governing body to which it appoints a member.</P>
        <P>It offers a wide variety of opportunities for educational attachments to people including post-leaving certificate courses, vocational training and opportunities, Youthreach and back to education initiatives, to name but a few.  It also offers programmes aimed at helping the unemployed, marginalised and underprivileged and those whose early experience of education was not very good.  Some 2,500 day pupils and 4,500 adults attend the eight Mayo VEC centres of learning throughout the county.</P>
        <P>The logistics involved in dealing effectively with this merger are enormous and if it is poorly managed the excellent level of service to which we are accustomed will suffer.  With its broad geographical and educational reach, in combination with the experience and dedication of its staff, its existing infrastructure and organisational systems which have already been tried and <Col N="528"/>tested, Mayo VEC is well capable of taking the lead in the transition and with the new headquarters operating from Ballina will quickly overcome the challenges.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I welcome this opportunity to outline the decision taken by the Government to revise the configuration of VECs and to set out the factors the Minister will consider in deciding on the location of the headquarters of the new entities.  </P>
        <P>Specifically regarding the matter raised by the Deputy, in arriving at a decision on the location of the headquarters the Minister will consider a range of factors.  These include the need to ensure that the location of a VEC headquarters will, to the greatest extent possible, facilitate staff redeployment under a redeployment scheme within the context of the Croke Park agreement and the need to operate at lowest cost, having regard to the accommodation available in existing locations.  Following completion of the Minister&rsquo;s deliberations, the locations of the headquarters will be announced in the coming period.</P>
        <P>On the wider decision to revise the configuration of VECs, I appreciate the significant contribution the VEC sector has made to the development of our education system over the years.  I acknowledge the fine tradition of providing high quality education and of placing a particular emphasis on meeting the needs of the most disadvantaged in our society which characterises the VEC sector.   We are facing challenging times as a country and in the education sector.  We need to build on the strengths of the VEC sector in tackling these challenges.  It is well positioned to play a key role in the transformation of our education system, given its long-standing ability to respond to new challenges in the education sector.</P>
        <P>A reconfigured vocational sector with a reduced number of VECs will provide for a more efficient deployment of resources, a very important issue in the current difficult economic environment.  Importantly, it will provide strengthened capacity at VEC level to drive improvements in our education system.  Last week, the Government announced its decision to proceed with a reduction in the number of VECs from 33 to 16 and to consolidate the existing nine vocational education Acts into one new Bill.  Deputies have details of the revised new entities.</P>
        <P>In the Programme for National Recovery 2011-2016, this Government is committed to local devolution of administrative functions relating to maintenance, school building projects and coordination of support services currently carried out by principals.  VEC rationalisation will enable and support such devolution without adversely affecting the delivery or quality of front line education provision.  In addition, the new VEC entities will be well positioned to bring enhanced purchasing power, through leveraging, to bear in securing value for money for schools and the wider provision of education providers in all levels of the school system.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy Mulherin for affording me the opportunity to respond to the House on this matter.  The Minister for Education and Skills will announce shortly the location for the headquarters.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been raising this issue for some time with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I tabled a parliamentary question in recent weeks.  An incident over the week prompted me to raise this as an Adjournment matter.  </P>
        <P>I refer to the case of two garda&iacute; being called to a domestic incident in Dublin city centre.  Shortly after arrival one of them was doused with burning fat.  This is one of many incidents <Col N="529"/>that have taken place in our cities, towns and streets in recent times.  It is unacceptable, to say the least.  There is a huge risk to life and limb, not just to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but to members of the emergency services.  It serves a very ugly reminder to us that are thugs out there who have no regard for law and order and have less regard for life and limb.  It is important that the State responds to incidents like this.</P>
        <P>More than 800 garda&iacute; are assaulted each year, and the figure is rising annually.  From 2005-2007 there was an 84% increase in the number of recorded assaults on garda&iacute; which included a rise of 113% in serious assaults and 76% in simple assaults.  The rate of assaults on nurses in accident and emergency units is also known to be extremely high.  In the UK an estimated that 1,000 health and emergency workers are assaulted every week, although the real figure is thought to be higher because many cases go unreported.</P>
        <P>In the particularly tragic case of the late garda Robbie McCallion two years ago, the presiding judge issued an instruction to the jury that it was not to let fact that the man was a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to colour its thinking.  The judge had no choice but to apply the law as it prevails.  We as a State must send out a strong signal that the role of young men and women in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other emergency services is valued.  We should take particular cognisance of the risk to their well-being and safety given the manner in which they discharge their public duties, particularly at ungodly hours during the weekends and dealing with people who have no regard for law and order.  Statutory instruments need to be introduced immediately to protect garda&iacute; and emergency workers and act as a deterrent to offenders.  One thing the figures teach us is that the current legal framework does not serve as a deterrent to offenders.  An attack on a garda is not just an attack on an ordinary individual, it is an assault on democracy.  For example, an ordinary person is not obliged to stand in front of a car being driven at high speed, but a garda might be obliged to do so in the course of his or her duties.  We should be cognisant of this.  In Britain it is a criminal offence to assault a police constable in the execution of his or her duties.  It is also an offence to resist or wilfully obstruct a constable in the execution of his or her duties.  An assault on a police officer is punishable by a sentence of up to six months imprisonment, and obstruction by up to one month in prison.  As recently as March, the sentencing council in the United Kingdom published guidelines for judges and magistrates which included a recommendation that anyone found guilty of merely pushing or shoving a police officer should be punished by a sentence of up to 26 weeks imprisonment.  Similarly, the Emergency Workers Obstruction Act 2006 makes it an offence to obstruct or assault an emergency worker.  It covers firefighters, paramedics, members of the coastguard service and the crew of an RNLI vessel or any other lifeboat.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Australia a criminal court Act implements a three-month minimum sentence for certain serious assaults on police and public officers, including ambulance officers.  It acts as a deterrent to offenders while protecting police officers.</P>
        <P>In May I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice and Equality, inquiring whether there were any plans to introduce legislative changes to protect garda&iacute; in the line of duty, following the case of the late Garda McCallion.  The Minister said he would keep the matter under review.  In the light of the incident that took place in Dublin city over the weekend, I urge him to review the matter.  He should send a strong signal to those who have no regard for life or limb.  We should also send a strong message that the State cares about its emergency workers and that we will do our utmost to ensure their safety and that security is paramount.  The State must respond to incidents where such workers are under attack.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  The Minister for Justice and Equality utterly and unequivocally condemns the recent attack on a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who was responding to a domestic dispute in Dublin last Sunday.  While <Col N="530"/>he cannot comment on the details of any case that may be before the courts or anticipate what charges may appropriately be brought in any case, it is important to make the point that no attack on any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or any other emergency service will be tolerated and that the full rigour of the law will be brought to bear on the perpetrators of any such attack.  The Minister wishes the member in question a speedy recovery and return to duty.</P>
        <P>Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other emergency services carry out their duties on a daily basis providing assistance for members of the public.  They do so willingly and each and every day hundreds, if not thousands, of people interact with them.  In so doing they are acting at the request of the public and it is utterly unacceptable for any person to assault these officers or seek to prevent them from doing their duty.</P>
        <P>It is very important for everyone to understand legislation specifically protects garda&iacute; and other emergency workers from such attacks.  Section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, as amended by section 185 of the 2006 Act, provides that any person who assaults or threatens to assault a peace officer acting in the execution of his or her duty, knowing that he or she is, or being reckless as to whether he or she is, a peace officer so acting, shall be guilty of an offence.  In this context, &ldquo;peace officer&rdquo; includes a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as other emergency workers.  A person found guilty of such an offence is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 and-or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both.  The penalty on conviction on indictment is a fine determined by the court or a term of imprisonment not exceeding seven years, or both.  Similarly, any person who resists or wilfully obstructs a peace officer in the execution of his or her duty is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a class C fine not exceeding &euro;2,500 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both.  It is a matter for the courts, where a person is convicted of these offences, to impose penalties that are appropriate in each case.</P>
        <P>While the Minister cannot comment on a particular case, it is important for everyone to understand and realise the serious penalties that any attack on a garda or other emergency worker can attract.  It is absolutely right that the criminal law should afford garda&iacute; such specific protection and if further measures are necessary in this regard, the Minister will not hesitate in bringing forward appropriate proposals.</P>
        <P>The Minister thanks the Deputy for raising this matter on Adjournment, as it affords him an opportunity to condemn the attack in no uncertain terms, to wish the member a speedy recovery and, once more, to bring to the attention of all concerned the very strong protections provided for in the criminal law against attacks on garda&iacute;.</P>

	<P>I thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, is here to reply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For many decades there was a GP service in Ballinagh, County Cavan, where I understand from local residents a quality GP service was always delivered.  In recent years the service was provided by Dr. Prior and his colleagues.  The local community very much appreciate his work, as well as the dedication and commitment of the practice.  Unfortunately, a number of weeks ago the GP service provided from the health centre ceased temporarily.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The absence of a GP service which was provided four days a week is a source of major concern.  About two weeks ago the local community organised a public meeting.  The main organiser was Mrs. Brigid Delaney, whom I compliment on organising the meeting which <Col N="531"/>attracted a large attendance which included other public representatives and myself.  The meeting was well structured and gave members of the community an opportunity to outline their concerns about the delay in having a GP service restored to the health centre.  A number of years ago Mr. Cian Murtagh established a successful pharmacy in the town.  The local community appreciates the excellent service provided in what is a relatively small town but which, however, has a wide rural catchment area.  We all realise a GP practice in close proximity to a pharmacy can play a vital role in ensuring the long-term viability of that pharmacy business.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some time ago a county councillor for the area, Mr. Charlie Fleming, highlighted to me and Senator Diarmuid Wilson the inadequacy of the old clinic premises on Crossdoney Road.  Senator Wilson and I successfully lobbied the HSE and the then Minister for Health and Children to agree to the provision of a new health centre in the town.  There was a major investment of &euro;1.3 million in a state-of-the-art health centre.  I had the privilege of performing the official opening in February 2008.  That investment was widely welcomed and supported by the local community as it provided for new facilities for the GP practice, as well as nursing care and other health services.</P>
        <P>It is a source of serious disappointment to the local community that the GP service has ceased temporarily.  In correspondence to me, locals have said they are anxious that the GP service be restored without delay.  I have received numerous letters and telephone calls from many senior citizens who are concerned that the temporary cessation of the GP service could ultimately lead to its long-term loss.  That will not be tolerated by the local community in Ballinagh.  Therefore, I urge the Minister of State, through her Department and the HSE, to insist that the GP service be restored without delay.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Local people expressed their genuine concerns at the recent public meeting and it was noticeable that concern was being expressed by senior members of the local community who had to avail of GP services on a regular basis.  They need to travel to the health centre regularly.  Many of the people who spoke at the meeting do not have cars and if required to travel four or five miles to an alternative centre will be dependant on family, friends or taxis to do so, which is not feasible in the long run.  Also prominent at the meeting were the parents of many young children who, as we all know, often have to attend a general practitioner.  They forcefully advocated that this service needs to be restored without delay.  If the service is not restored imminently, people will have to travel a number of miles to Cavan town, Kilnaleck or Killeshandra to practices that are already under pressure.  All of us in this House support the provision of more services in the community.  In my county, we have been fortunate to have had in recent years an excellent primary care centre provided in Virginia alongside a nursing unit.  The situation is similar in Ballyconnell and others are being developed throughout the county.</P>
        <P>These new state-of-the-art facilities must be used to the maximum.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, to ensure, through the HSE, that the general practitioner practice is resumed in Ballinagh without delay.  In this regard, I am conveying the strong wishes of the local community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Smith for raising this issue.  The general practice at Ballinagh health centre has a substantial number of General Medical Services, GMS, clients.  Currently, there is only one GMS general practitioner within the practice as one resigned recently on health grounds and another has been on long-term leave.  The suspension of general practitioner services in Ballinagh health centre is a short-term measure pending the sourcing of the services of a locum.  There are almost 2,300 general practitioners contracted by the HSE to provide general practitioner services under the GMS scheme to more than 1.6 million medical card holders and 120,000 general practitioner visit card holders.</P><Col N="532"/>
        <P>The EU-IMF programme provides for the introduction of legislative changes to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors by the end of the third quarter in 2011.  This includes eliminating restrictions on general practitioners wishing to treat public patients.  The Deputy will be aware the current system has been in place for some time.  It is a system whereby access to the GMS is only available to new general practitioners if an existing general practitioner retires or dies.  The intention is that will change, namely, that the HSE will be in a position to take a much more proactive role in terms of ensuring adequate coverage of general practitioners in the country.  Unfortunately, under current arrangements, that is not possible.  However, we are moving towards a new situation.</P>
        <P>The Government recently agreed to the preparation of heads of a Bill which will eliminate current restrictions on fully qualified and trained general practitioners wishing to obtain contracts to treat public patients under the GMS contract and empower the Minister for Health to set entry terms based on public health interest considerations.  This proposed legislation will result in medical card and general practitioner visit card patients having a greater choice of general practitioners under the GMS scheme.  It will also help to ensure private patients of new general practitioner contract holders, who qualify for a medical card or general practitioner visit card, will not have to change their general practitioner.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to establishing a strong system of primary care in Ireland.  My appointment as the dedicated Minister of State for primary care is a clear indication of the Government&rsquo;s intentions in this regard.  The development of primary care teams and primary care centres is a priority under the programme for Government.  This will significantly increase health and social care in local communities, which will be achieved by redirecting services away from acute hospitals.  Modern, well-equipped primary care centres will be central to the effective functioning of primary care teams.  The centres will allow multidisciplinary services, provided by general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others, to be made available on a single site, providing a single point of access for the user and will encourage closer co-ordination between providers.  The new centres will greatly assist in the provision of modern services, in particular the provision of chronic disease management by multidisciplinary teams.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the developments that will take place later on this year, when access to the GMS will be opened up for general practitioners generally.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.</P>

	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; m&eacute; f&iacute;or bhu&iacute;och d&iacute;ot, a Cheann Comhairle, as seans a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  Beidh m&eacute; ag caint faoi dhruga&iacute; agus daoine bochta at&aacute; faoi bhr&uacute; ag druga&iacute;.</P>
        <P>Several weeks ago, Councillor Paddy McQuillan and I visited the Louth community drug and alcohol team in Drogheda.  We met the staff, members of the north-east regional drugs task force and a group of addicts who are on methadone to control their heroin addiction.  I was impressed by the commitment and professionalism of the staff who provide a first class service with limited resources and who are struggling to meet the needs of a growing number of drug and alcohol addicts.  I commend and thank them for their work.</P>
        <P>Drug and alcohol misuse has taken up to eight lives in the Drogheda area in recent years.  The former heroin users whom I met were young men and one young woman.  They were honest about the dreadful impact the drug has had on them and their families and the connection between heroin and drug addiction and crime.  One former user described the experience <Col N="533"/>as being like groundhog day, chasing the money, chasing the dealers and chasing the drug.  When that cycle is complete, they begin the process all over again.</P>
        <P>The drug and alcohol team in Drogheda has only been in place since last April.  I have no doubt from my conversation with the former heroin users that the centre has been a lifeline for them.  The project consists of one co-ordinator, one project worker, one community employment support staff member and one counsellor who provides six sessions a week.  According to statistics for 2010 from the Health Research Board, 76 individuals presented for treatment at the centre.  Of these 60% suffered heroin addiction, 28% had issues with alcohol, 17% with cannabis and 7% with cocaine.  Some 71% of the above have been identified as early school leavers and 60% use more than one drug.  Some 33% are injecting drug users and 8% began injecting under the age of 19 years.</P>
        <P>There are obviously policing and other issues around the availability of illegal drugs.  These statistics only scratch the surface of the problem.  We will return to that another day.  The reality is that many individuals who initially presented with one problem actually have more than one.  Some are addicted to up to four substances.  Those with whom I spoke told of many more users in the area who have not sought help.</P>
        <P>The Louth community drug and alcohol team work hard to provide a service which helps those affected by drug and alcohol misuse.  The biggest gap in current services lies in the absence of a second level 2 methadone prescribing general practitioner.  There is only one methadone prescribing general practitioner and, consequently, the waiting list for methadone treatment in Louth stands at 18 months compared with ten days in Dublin, which discourages individuals going on the list.  Even if an addict manages to get on the list, he or she is expected &mdash; this is the way the system works &mdash; to maintain his or her drug using lifestyle to qualify for treatment.  This means that the current system is encouraging ongoing heartache, illness, further family breakdown, crime and, in some cases, overdose which can lead to death or suicide.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to appoint a second level 2 methadone prescribing general practitioner quickly.  This would have an immediate and beneficial affect on the management of heroin treatment in Louth.  The community drug and alcohol team also needs a dedicated project worker who can provide the essential family support that is part of dealing with drug misuse in the community.  The problem of heroin misuse is severe and requires urgent attention and additional financial support.  I urge the Minister to take these simple measures and enhance the work of a dedicated group of professional health workers who are making a significant contribution to society and to assist those recovering addicts who are confronting their problems and need help to put them behind them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  The HSE provides methadone as an opiate replacement to support those who are addressing their heroin misuse problem.  Methadone is a controlled drug regulated under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1998.  Only GPs who are trained as level 1 or level 2 for methadone prescribing are permitted to participate.  The HSE, through the Irish College of General Practitioners, facilitates GPs to train at level 1 and 2.  Level 1 GPs can provide methadone in a community-based setting to stabilised patients who do not require methadone clinic services.  The HSE encourages all GPs to take part in this training.  Level 2 GPs are trained to offer the full range of treatment services to opium dependent patients including assessment, initiation of treatment when appropriate and stabilising a drug user.</P>
        <P>Persons receiving methadone treatment are registered on the central treatment list, operated by the Drug Treatment Centre Board.  At end April 2011, the central treatment list recorded 9,289 patients attending treatment in clinical facilities within the HSE Dublin north east region. <Col N="534"/> There has been a focus over the past year or two on increasing the availability of drug treatment services outside Dublin.  Significant progress is now being made by the HSE.  Additional services have been provided in the south east at Wexford town, Waterford and Kilkenny, in the southern area at Cork and Tralee, in the mid-west at Limerick city and in the north east at Dundalk.  The HSE is progressing plans to provide methadone facilities in the midlands, Drogheda and Wexford county to address waiting lists and times in these areas.</P>
        <P>Approximately two-thirds of those in receipt of methadone continue to receive their service in clinics, with the remainder under the care of GPs.  I would like to see an increasing transfer of clients from clinics to GPs in coming years, subject to the agreement of the service users and adherence to good clinical practice.  The acquisition of GPs for the methadone treatment programme is not an easy task.  The HSE has advised that it has identified two potential level 2 GPs who are available to commence in the Drogheda area.  An additional level 1 GP has also been identified and the HSE is awaiting return of a signed contract from the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The Louth Community Drug and Alcohol Team is funded by the Department of Health through the north east regional drugs taskforce.  The taskforce has allocated just over &euro;116,000 in 2011 to the Louth Community Drug and Alcohol Team.  This funding enables it to employ two members of staff.  Both staff members are actively involved in one-to-one work with individuals with an alcohol and-or substance use issue, and this also includes working with family members and concerned persons.  Louth Community Drug and Alcohol Team provides services and supports for people in active addiction, particularly those who are hoping to stabilise, reduce or become totally drug or alcohol free.  Working from a harm reduction perspective through individual supports and group programmes the service also supports the delivery of a needle exchange service in Drogheda.  It also strives to provide families with adequate information and support on addiction related issues, including the provision of information to the wider community.  The two full-time staff work alongside sessional counsellors, trainees, volunteers and placement students to provide a low-threshold tier 2 or 3 service.  Unfortunately, there is no funding available to support an additional family support worker.  I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</P>

I have no plans at this time to renew this relief.</P>

	<P>Taxation in the European Treaties is a sovereign issue for Member States and taxation matters at a European level can only be decided on the basis of unanimity.  For this reason, Ireland is aware of the attitude of other Member States, including France, to our corporation tax rate.  Corporation tax policy is critical to the Irish economic growth model.  The foreign-owned sector is currently the main source of growth in the Irish economy.  One recent report ranked Ireland as the top creator of employment, relative to population size, from foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>I have had discussions with the French Finance Minister and sought to explain the Irish perspective and to understand the French position on this issue.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 43 and 45 together. </P>
        <P>Data on earnings in the public sector is sourced from the Revenue Commissioners and similar data to that sought was supplied in response to Parliamentary Questions, Reference Nos. 2785/2786/2787 and 2788, of 18 January 2011.  On the basis of the available tax-based data it is not possible to identify and exclude income from public sources to groups that would not normally be regarded as employed within the public service or to distinguish the earnings of employees associated with atypical work patterns.  Accordingly, it is not possible from this data to estimate the total cost to the State of all earnings in excess of &euro;100,000.</P>
        <P>However, the total savings to the Exchequer in a full financial year arising from a cap of &euro;100,000 on public sector salaries is estimated at &euro;265m.  The estimate takes account of the reductions in pay arising from the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act, 2009, but does not take account of any offsetting reductions in taxes and levies.  As the combined effect of the estimated marginal tax rate and the pension related reduction at a pay level for a public servant of &euro;100,000 p.a. or higher is at least 62.5%, the estimated net savings would be reduced to less than &euro;100m.</P>
        <P>There are an estimated 7,000 persons currently employed by the State on pay rates in excess of &euro;100,000 per year.  The placing of a 45% levy on earnings above &euro;100,000 per year for those working in the public service is not proposed nor will I speculate on any legal considerations that might arise in the event of such a proposal being brought forward.</P>
        <P>The estimates do not include staff of commercial State-sponsored bodies since the Minister for Finance is not responsible for setting the rate of pay for employees (other than CEOs) in the commercial state sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 41 together. </P>
        <P Just="Left">There are currently 144 staff employed in the Valuation Office which is a statutory office headed by the Commissioner of Valuation. The Commissioner is responsible for all valuation matters under the Valuation Act 2001.  I should point out that the Commissioner is independent under the Act and that I, as Minister for Finance, have no function in decisions in this regard.</P>
        <P>As I explained in response to recent Questions, the revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area where it was completed in 2007.  It has since been completed in the Fingal County Council area in 2009 and in D&uacute;n Laoghaire &mdash; Rathdown in 2010.  The revaluation of the Dublin City Council area was commenced in May this year having been postponed for well over a year because of the volatility and conditions in the property market.  The Dublin City part of the programme will entail the valuation of approximately 25,000 properties and the new list will be published in 2013.</P>
        <P>It is intended to roll out the revaluation programme to other local authority areas shortly and preparatory work has already taken place in relation to the Waterford local authority areas and Limerick City.</P>
        <P>Following the completion of the Dublin City revaluation, approaching 50% of the national valuation base, in terms of monetary values, will have been completed.  This represents some 26% of the national total in terms of the number of properties to be valued.</P>
        <P>As you will appreciate, the revaluation programme is a major project in nature and scale, all the more so, given that such a nationwide exercise has not been undertaken since the mid-1800s and it has required new systems and processes to be developed and tested.  However, notwithstanding the improvements that have been made, it is the case that the programme is taking considerably longer than expected.  I understand from the Commissioner of Valuation that the specific options he is examining with a view to speeding up the work are outsourcing, introduction of a system of self-assessment or updating the values on existing lists through a system of indexation based on market analysis.  All of these options raise issues that require detailed examination which is ongoing.  No decision has yet been made.</P>
        <P>I should point out also that the purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system.  Revaluation will lead to a redistribution of the commercial rates burden between businesses depending on the relative shift of rental values between locations and categories of properties.  Even though property values have fallen generally not every ratepayer will gain from revaluation &mdash; there will be losers as well as winners.  It depends on how the rental value of each property changes relative to other property values and sectors.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned previously, my Departmental officials are reviewing various provisions of the Valuation Act with a view to achieving greater efficiencies, including streamlining the appeals process.</P>

	<P>I have indicated to the House that, consistent with Government policy, I will raise the issue of burden sharing which will allow for the imposition of loses on unguaranteed and unsecured senior bondholders in Anglo and INBS with the IMF and EU authorities in the autumn.  The Government will not take any unilateral action in this area, but will work with our  external partners to explain our perspective and hear their views.   While legislation is in place to provide for burden sharing with subordinated debt holders under the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 there are currently no provisions on the statute book to specifically provide for burden sharing with senior bondholders.  If action is to be taken on this matter I will of course bring forward legislation to facilitate the imposition of losses on the senior bondholders of Anglo Irish Bank and INBS.</P>
        <P>I would emphasise that Government policy remains that all senior bondholders in AIB/EBS, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life and Permanent will be repaid in full.</P>

	<P>The focus of Government is to work with our partners in the Euro Area and the broader EU to maintain and enhance the stability of the Euro.  This is also the aim and intention of the wider international community including the IMF.  Our actions support this.   Financial support measures were put in place for Greece, and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, (the EFSM), and the European Financial Stability Facility, (the EFSF), were established.  The permanent stability facility &mdash; the European Stability Mechanism &mdash; was agreed at the European Council.  In addition to this, economic governance in the Euro Area has been enhanced with measures such as the Euro Plus pact.  The European semester &mdash; for budgetary and economic policy monitoring and co-ordination is already in operation.  A further significant step that all Member States are taking is to ensure <Col N="539"/>and enhance fiscal sustainability.  That is why difficult decisions are being taken right across Europe by responsible Governments.  Restoring growth potential and improving the public finances is the way forward.  Suggesting otherwise is misleading. </P>
        <P>All these measures are concrete evidence of the determination of the Euro Area members to protect the currency, and also of their willingness and ability to do so.  It is in the nature of modern economies and financial systems that difficulties will arise from time to time.  The appropriate response to such difficulties is to take the measures necessary to defend an institution that has served its members &mdash; the Euro Area Member states, including Ireland &mdash; very well.   This is the approach that all major economies take &mdash; they defend their currency &mdash; they do not abandon it at the first sign of difficulty.</P>
        <P>The recent votes in the Greek Parliament, which were difficult for all concerned, are to be welcomed.  We look forward to working with our European partners, including Greece to develop and safeguard the Euro.</P>

	<P>The revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) was issued to all mortgage lenders in December 2010 and has been effective since 1 January 2011.  The CCMA sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears.  The CCMA requires that each lending branch must have at least one person with specific responsibility for dealing with arrears and pre-arrears cases.  It also requires frontline staff to be made aware of the lender&rsquo;s policy for dealing with arrears and pre-arrears cases and the relevant contact person and process.  The revised CCMA also introduced the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) framework for handling of arrears and pre- arrears cases. </P>
        <P>Provision 9 of the revised CCMA states that &ldquo;<i>Lenders are restricted from imposing charges and or surcharge interest on arrears arising on a mortgage account in arrears to which this Code applies and in respect of which a borrower is co-operating reasonably and honestly with the lender in the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process.  (Lenders will have been notified individually of the charges to which this applies)</i> .&rdquo;</P><Col N="540"/>
        <P>The Central Bank issued Letters of Direction in December 2010 to mortgage lenders prohibiting them from imposing specific arrears charges or surcharge interest on mortgage accounts in arrears to which the revised CCMA applies and in respect of which a borrower is co-operating reasonably and honestly with the lender in the MARP from 1 January 2011.</P>
        <P>With regard to monitoring compliance with the consumer protection codes, the Central Bank carries out themed inspections and mystery-shopping exercises.  On 1st July 2011 the Central Bank published the findings of a themed inspection of mortgage lenders which examined compliance with Provision 9 of the revised CCMA and the Letters of Direction.  This themed inspection was carried out across six mortgage lenders including credit institutions and retail credit firms.  655 customer mortgage account statements were reviewed during the course of the themed inspection.

	<P>As I stated in my reply to questions on the same subject on 29 June 2011 (Ref. Nos. 17942/11 and 17943/11) the search for a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at Allied Irish Banks (AIB) is on-going.  I am keen that a successful outcome is achieved shortly as AIB is a fundamental part of the announced Government strategy to restructure the banking sector and any proposed appointee would play a pivotal part in this process.  Additionally, I am anxious that the situation whereby the Executive Chairman combines both positions of Chairman and CEO, as instituted by the previous Government, is resolved as it does not accord with good corporate governance practice.  </P>
        <P>The bank has indicated that, in their opinion, based on their search to date the salary cap applying to the post is causing difficulties in attracting suitably qualified candidates to the position and a higher figure may have to be contemplated.  I am aware that this view is held by others who have an interest in this matter.  However, it would be the intention of the Government that the cap of &euro;500,000 would be honoured.  No formal proposal from AIB to pay a particular amount or appoint a particular candidate is in front of the Government or Minister.</P>
        <P>As has been stated publicly by the Taoiseach, a compelling case would have to be made for the Government to consider setting aside this cap taking account of the recent decision on the <Col N="541"/>pay ceilings for CEOs of Semi States and Senior Public Sector posts and the need for social solidarity to be shown by all individuals and sectors for the good of the nation and its recovery from the present challenging circumstances</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to inform the Deputy that there are a number of measures in place to assist mortgage holders who are in genuine difficulties with regard to the payment of their mortgages.  The Deputy will be aware of the work of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt.  This Group published its final Report in November 2010.  All of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations are listed in Chapter 2 of the Report which can be accessed at <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i> .  </P>
        <P>One of the recommendations of the Group was that lenders should offer a Deferred Interest Scheme (DIS) to borrowers.  Under this Scheme, borrowers are allowed, subject to certain criteria being satisfied, to pay at least 66% of their mortgage interest but less than 100%.  Payment of the balance may be deferred for up to 5 years.  Lenders representing the majority of the market have already indicated their willingness to implement the Group&rsquo;s proposals for a DIS or a variation of it.  While the scheme is voluntary for all lenders, those who have signed up in support of the scheme will be monitored by the Central Bank to ensure compliance.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Central Bank that the following mortgage lenders have agreed to sign up for the DIS, but with varying dates for its availability around end June/beginning July:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />AIB and AIB Mortgage Bank,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Bank of Ireland and ICS Building Society,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />EBS and Haven Mortgages,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Permanent TSB,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Irish Nationwide Building Society,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Springboard Mortgages,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Start Mortgages hope to have a scheme in place by end 2011.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Since the publication of the Group&rsquo;s Report, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) has been revised by the Central Bank to reflect many of the recommendations, including key recommendations relating to the introduction by all regulated lenders of a standardised Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  The most significant changes in the revised CCMA include:</P><Col N="542"/>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Penalty interest charges may not be imposed on borrowers in arrears who co-operate with the MARP,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Harassment of borrowers through unsolicited communications is outlawed,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Borrowers in financial difficulties, but not in arrears, are allowed to come under the MARP,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />When a lender is determining the 12 month period the lender must wait before applying to the courts to commence legal action, the lender must <i>exclude</i>  any time period during which a borrower is complying with the terms of an alternative repayment arrangement, making an appeal to the internal appeals board or making a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The revised CCMA came into effect on 1 January 2011 and can be accessed at <i>www.centralbank.ie</i>.  Lenders are required to comply with the CCMA as a matter of law and, with effect from 30 June 2011, they must have in place the requisite systems and trained staff necessary to support the implementation of the MARP.</P>
        <P>The recommendation of the Group to amend the local authority needs assessment process has been implemented by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Local authorities have been provided with guidance on the treatment of applicants for social housing support whose mortgages have been deemed unsustainable.  Discussions are on-going between that Department and the Irish Bankers&rsquo; Federation to enable borrowers whose properties are to be repossessed to remain in their homes for a period of time pending the sourcing of appropriate accommodation by the housing authority.</P>
        <P>As regards the recommendations of the Group in relation to the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme (MIS), I have been informed by the Department of Social Protection that the implementation of these recommendations will require changes to both primary and secondary legislation.  That Department is currently finalising an implementation plan that will set out a framework for the future of the MIS.</P>
        <P>Finally, people in debt or in danger of getting into debt can avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  This is a national, free, confidential and independent service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information furnished on tax returns does not generally require the yield from a particular sector or sub-sector of economic activity to be identified.  In these circumstances the amount of tax revenues relating to works of art cannot be separately identified.  There is, therefore, no statistical basis on which the information requested by the Deputy could be estimated.  With regard to the VAT treatment of the supply of works of art, I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that different treatments for VAT purposes may apply.  Works of art such as paintings, drawings, engravings and sculptures are normally liable at the 13.5% reduced rate.  Other works such as tapestries, ceramics, enamels and some photographs are normally liable at the standard rate of 21%. However, the reduced rate may apply in certain circumstances (principally to imports from outside the EU and the supply by the original artist). <Col N="543"/> This is part of the rates strategy in the EU VAT Directive designed to encourage the flow of works of art into the EU. </P>
        <P>Where a work of art is sold under the margin scheme for taxable dealers or special auction scheme, the sale is liable at the standard VAT rate on the margin.  The operation of these schemes is explained in Revenue&rsquo;s VAT Information Leaflets entitled &ldquo;Margin Scheme &mdash; Second-Hand Goods&rdquo; and &ldquo;Auctioneering&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In relation to the capital gains tax treatment of works of art, works of art are assets for capital gains tax purposes and are thus within the charge to that tax if the person disposing of those assets is Irish-resident.  There is, however, an exemption from capital gains tax for a disposal of a work of art that has been loaned to an approved gallery for a period of not less than 10 years and has been on display to the public in that gallery.  In order to qualify for this exemption, a work of art must have a face value of at least &euro;31,750 at the time it was loaned to the gallery.  If the person disposing of works of art is trading in such goods, any profit on sale will be liable to income tax instead of capital gains tax.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to change these taxation arrangements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>NAMA has a commercial remit and a statutory objective to generate a return for the taxpayer.  However, within the context of its commercial remit and consistent with section 2 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, NAMA is at all times open to considering proposals aimed at contributing to broader social and economic objectives.  Thus NAMA is open to facilitating the work of public bodies in the creation of vibrant sustainable communities where this is possible. The NAMA Board has committed to giving first option to State bodies on the purchase of property which may be suitable for their purposes where these bodies have requirements such as schools, hospitals, parks, and so on.  I understand that officials of NAMA have already had contact with officials of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, local authorities and other public bodies to explore the scope for such arrangements.     Section 55 of the National Asset Management Agency Act makes extensive provision for quarterly reporting by NAMA on a wide range of matters, including details in relation to loans.  For instance, the quarterly report includes, among other things, information <Col N="544"/>on the number of loans being foreclosed or otherwise enforced and the amount of money recovered by NAMA through the sale of property.  These reporting arrangements allow for transparent reporting to the extent that it does not breach the obligation placed on the agency to respect the confidentiality of customers.  To date, four quarterly reports, the most recent of which was for the fourth quarter of 2010, have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Apart from the statutory reporting mechanisms that are designed to enhance the transparency of NAMA operations, the agency is aware of the need to enhance the availability of information with regard to properties.  In that regard, under an initiative currently in preparation, NAMA will include on its website a database of properties which are under the control of receivers appointed to enforce against NAMA debtors. This will provide a single source of information on NAMA assets which are for sale and it will be updated on a very regular basis.  NAMA expects to launch the site by the end of the month.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>While the underlying economic and fiscal situations in Ireland and Greece are very different, both countries clearly have to restore their economy to health and their public finances to a sustainable position. For example, the EU Commission Spring Forecasts project that Irish General Government Debt will be 112% of GDP at end-2011, while Greek General Government Debt will be some 158% of GDP.  Despite the constant reporting of opposition to the necessary austerity measures in Greece, it is not widely recognised that the Greek Government has taken significant steps to date.  I am confident that there is political will in Greece to proceed with implementing the Programme measures it has undertaken to complete and, in so doing, to bring its public sector debt under control.  </P>
        <P>In our case, Ireland is meeting its targets under the EU/IMF Programme and the troika teams have concluded that we have made a strong start.  Nevertheless, yields on Ireland&rsquo;s sovereign bonds are remaining at elevated levels, although not as high as those of Greece, and it is clear that this position is being exacerbated by the ongoing uncertainties arising from the wider situation in Europe. Clearly, the current market view of Ireland as illustrated by our sovereign bond spreads is not what we would wish it to be.  However, based on conservative projections of our funding needs and taking account of funding possibilities, there is no urgency about a return to the markets and Ireland has not issued bonds at these elevated yields.  Indeed, the purpose of a programme such as the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland is to provide the space necessary for economic and fiscal adjustment to take place, while providing a secure source of funding which the State can avail of.  Based on current projections and without going back to the markets in the meantime, Ireland has access to sufficient funds for its needs well into the second half of 2013.  We are barely half a year into our Programme, so <Col N="546"/>it is still very early in this process.  However, as I have already said, we are meeting our targets and, as long as we continue to do so, we expect that the Programme will achieve its objectives.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide any evidence currently held by him to support the conclusion that reducing VAT in the tourism sector will create jobs and the mechanisms in place to measure the impact of this VAT reduction on job creation and retention. </Quest>

	<P>As provided for in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011, a second reduced VAT rate of 9% came into effect on a temporary basis in respect of certain services and goods mainly related to tourism on 1 July 2011 for the period up to end 2013.  Specifically the 9% rate will apply to restaurant and catering services; hotel and holiday accommodation; various entertainment services such as admissions to cinemas, theatres, certain musical performances, museums, art gallery exhibitions and fairgrounds/amusement parks, the use of sporting facilities; hairdressing services; and printed matter such as brochures, maps, programmes, leaflets, catalogues, newspapers and magazines.  In reducing the VAT burden on activities related to the tourism industry, this measure is aimed at contributing towards boosting tourism and the creation of additional jobs in that sector.     </P>
        <P>While the programme for Government included a commitment to lower the reduced VAT rate to 12% for all goods and services at that rate, the Government decided to introduce a more focused reduction.  In this context, where the VAT reduction is targeted to a more select range of economic activity, a greater reduction in the VAT rate can be applied and hence increase the potential boost to that economic activity.</P>
        <P>The VAT change announced in the Jobs Initiative will be kept under review and evaluated before end 2012 in order to determine its effectiveness in aiding the industry.  Statistics are published quarterly by the CSO as part of the Quarterly National Household Survey, in relation to the numbers of persons employed in the State by gender and employment sector.  These statistics, inter alia, provide details of employment levels in the accommodation and food services sector.</P>
        <P>If it is shown that the VAT reduction has little or no effect in aiding the industry then the measure is open to being reformed or abolished.</P>

        <Quest> his plans to introduce specific measures to assist mortgage holders in advance of budget 2012 and if the programme for Government commitment to increase the mortgage interest relief to those who bought between 2004 and 2008 still stands. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government is fully aware of the difficulties that many homeowners, through no fault of their own, are having in meeting their mortgage repayments in respect of their principal private residence.  There are a number of existing measures in place to assist homeowners in difficulty. These measures include the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the services provided by the Money Advice Budgeting Services and the Mortgage Interest Supplement.  </P>
        <P>The Mortgage Interest Supplement is managed by the Department of Social Protection and provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person&rsquo;s home.  The Deputy will be aware of the important support provided by the Money Advice and Budgeting Services.  MABS pro<Col N="547"/>vides a national, free, confidential and independent service operating from 53 offices nationwide.  I would encourage anyone who is in financial difficulty to contact their local MABS office.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears has been substantially revised to implement the recommendations of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert Group which published its final Report in November 2010.  The Code sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears with due regard to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  An important recommendation of the Expert Group was that lenders would make available a Deferred Interest Scheme (DIS) to borrowers who cannot afford to pay the full interest on their mortgages but can pay at least 66% of the amount due.  The borrower would have to pay the deferred interest at some agreed future date.  Lenders representing the majority of the market have already indicated their willingness to make available deferred interest schemes. These are Allied Irish Bank, AIB Mortgage Bank, Bank of Ireland, ICS Building Society, EBS, Haven Mortgages, Irish Nationwide Building Society, Permanent TSB, Springboard Mortgages and Start Mortgages. While the making available of Deferred Interest Schemes is voluntary for all lenders, those who have signed up in support of the scheme will be monitored by the Central Bank to ensure compliance.</P>
        <P>Another key recommendation of the Group relates to the requirement of all regulated lenders to introduce a standardized Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  Borrowers who are in arrears and who co-operate with the MARP will not be charge penalty interest charges.  A lender must establish a centralised and dedicated Arrears Support Unit which must be adequately staffed to manage cases under the MARP.  Under the MARP, lenders must agree appropriate forbearance with each borrower following as assessment of the full circumstances and characteristics of each borrower.  It is important to point out that borrowers who are in financial difficulties, but not in arrears, are allowed to come under the MARP.</P>
        <P>In addition to these existing measures, the Government is considering the further necessary actions required to alleviate the increasing problem of mortgage over-indebtedness.  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to help homeowners who are facing difficulty with their mortgage repayments and the Government will examine a number of proposals in relation to this commitment.  In this context, the Government Economic Management Council recently asked that further work be carried out to address the situation of over indebted mortgage holders with a view to identifying a range of responses appropriate to individual circumstances.  The work concerned will be carried out by a group chaired by Mr. Declan Keane, an accountant seconded to the Department of Finance and will report by end September.  The Group has yet to be decided but may include officials from the Department of Finance, the Central Bank of Ireland, officials from other Government Departments and may also use expertise from within the banking system.  Any changes to mortgage interest relief will be considered in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process</P>

I <Col N="548"/>am confident she is aware of our position but the IMF has no direct role in the decision on the interest rate for EU funds. As the Deputy is aware Ireland supported the appointment of Christine Lagarde to the post of Managing Director of the Fund and I look forward to a fruitful working relationship with her in that role.</P>
        <P>I have indicated to the House that, consistent with Government policy, I will raise the issue of burden sharing to allow for the imposition of loses on unguaranteed and unsecured senior bondholders in Anglo and INBS with the IMF and EU authorities in the autumn.  The Government will not take any unilateral action in this area, but will work with our external partners to explain our perspective and hear their views.</P>

	<P>The Jobs Initiative 2011 brought forward a number of sectoral measures and tax/PRSI changes. The purpose of these measures is to assist in employment generation, to provide opportunities for those who have lost their jobs and thus generate confidence in the economy. The Jobs Initiative should be viewed as one element of a wider strategy to support economic activity.   The Finance (No. 2) Act 2011, which was passed by the Oireachtas in June, put into effect the changes to tax legislation necessary to implement the Jobs Initiative tax policy measures. As regards expenditure, the changes to departmental expenditure lines and profiles have been effected and will be published in a set of Revised Estimates in the coming days. The budgetary impact of the Jobs Initiative measures will be visible through the performance of Departments&rsquo; expenditure issues against profile and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will monitor and review progress in this regard. My Department will in turn monitor the effect of the revenue measures which will begin to impact upon the Exchequer Returns in the coming months.</P>
        <P>In relation to the sectoral measures which have been introduced, it will be a matter for the relevant Ministers and their Departments to monitor the delivery and effectiveness of the initiatives within their remit.</P>
        <P>The Jobs Initiative is designed to support a return to economic growth and strengthen its foundations. It is of course extremely difficult to separate out the increase in economic activity that is attributable to specific initiatives. Nonetheless, the Jobs Initiative is an important part of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to establish the correct conditions to allow our economy to recover, while at the same time respecting the requirement to return our public finances to a sustainable position. Repairing the banking system is another part of the Government&rsquo;s strategy. If we deliver on these goals, the impact of the Jobs Initiative will be evident in the increased confidence, economic activity and, ultimately, employment levels, which we will enjoy.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I recently announced this Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative. The Initiative provided for a further &euro;30 million for school works and associated works in 2011 over the existing allocation. Some &euro;20 million of this is being reallocated by the Minister for Education and Skills from within his own Department&rsquo;s allocation. A further &euro;10 million of Exchequer funding has been made available to the Department from the proceeds of the new pension levy also announced in the Initiative.  This <Col N="550"/>is to be allocated to immediately-ready projects to be delivered by schools.   The Initiative also provided for an additional &euro;60 million to be reallocated from within the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport&rsquo;s overall allocation to invest in our regional and local roads to carry out much-needed surface restoration and road reconstruction works. This important remedial work is overdue and the additional money invested will allow local authorities to bring forward important projects to 2011 that had previously been pushed back to 2012.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The main channel through which the Greek sovereign debt crisis is impacting on Ireland is through a widening of sovereign bond spreads. It must be remembered, however, that Ireland is not dependent upon market financing at the moment, so that higher yields are simply notional as opposed to actual costs.   In the various discussions that I have had with our EU partners, I have stressed the importance of clear communication regarding the need to support countries that are implementing their programmes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also worth pointing to the recent change to the ESM Treaty &mdash; agreed by Finance Ministers in June &mdash; to ensure that any bonds issued in the future by the ESM on behalf of programme countries will not enjoy preferred creditor status.  In addition, the euro area Heads of State or Government have reiterated their commitment to do whatever is necessary to ensure the financial stability of the euro area as a whole, as evident from the Council Conclusions from the June European Council meeting.</P>
        <P>These, I think, demonstrate the willingness of our EU partners to support programme countries that are delivering and will help these countries &mdash; including Ireland &mdash; return to market-based funding as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.</P>
        <P>As part of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality of the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, actions for the fifth review or to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 include the presentation of a Budget for 2012 to include budgetary consolidation measures amounting to at least &euro;3.6 billion.</P>
        <P>The revised MOU noted that in relation to budgetary consolidation measures for 2012 the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland agreed in December 2010 provided for revenue measures to yield &euro;1.5 billion in a full year along with a reduction in expenditure of &euro;2.1 billion.  As previously stated, the Government is committed to the overall level of budgetary adjustment.  However, the precise nature of the measures to be implemented in 2012 will be decided upon in advance of Budget 2012 in light of more up-to-date economic and fiscal data and the outcome of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, which is currently underway.</P>

	<P>The gradual reduction from marginal to standard rate tax relief on pension contributions commencing in 2012 forms part of the fiscal consolidation measures in the agreement with the EU, IMF and the ECB over the period 2011 to 2014.  When introducing the temporary pension scheme levy to pay for the Jobs Initiative on 10 May last, I gave a commitment to examine the issue of reducing the tax relief on pension contributions to the standard rate.</P>
        <P>The Government has initiated a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in order to provide it with a set of decision options to meet the overall fiscal consolidation objectives and re-align spending with the Programme for Government priorities.  The Review is due to be completed by end September 2011.  The Government will then examine the findings and, in consultation with the EU, IMF and ECB, will introduce fiscally neutral changes to the detail of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland while maintaining the overall commitment to fiscal consolidation.  I will examine the scope for any change to the proposed standard rating of tax relief on pension contributions in that context.</P>

	<P>This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  Section 161 of the Finance Act 2010 provides for a voluntary scheme that enables members of the Judiciary to make a gift to the State of an equivalent amount to the pension related deduction imposed on State employees under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  Subsection (8) of that Section provides that, inter alia, the Revenue Commissioners shall publish for each year of assessment details of the number of donors who avail of this scheme in the year. I understand that the Revenue Commissioners published information in their Annual Report for 2010, in accordance with Subsection (8), which shows that 126 Judges participated in the Scheme in 2010.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Minister for Finance I met with the NAMA Board on 13 April 2011 when I explained that I expect the agency to comply with the Government commitment to the highest standards of transparency to the maximum extent possible.  This is an issue which I will be following closely.  There are a range of statutory reporting requirements which ensure transparency of NAMA operations.  Apart from the statutory reporting mechanisms, NAMA advises me that it is seeking to enhance the availability of information with regard to properties. In that regard, under an initiative currently in preparation, NAMA will include on its website a database of properties which are under the control <Col N="557"/>of receivers. This will provide a single source of information on NAMA assets which are for sale and it will be updated on a monthly basis.  NAMA expects to launch the site later this month.</P>
        <P>Excluding &euro;30m in due diligence costs which were borne by the participating institutions, NAMA costs in 2010 were &euro;46m.  &euro;17m of this was expended on salary and other direct costs (including office rent and audit fees) associated with running the Agency.  Another &euro;15m was payment to about 500 staff in participating institutions that carry out the day-to-day administration of loans on behalf of NAMA.  The residual costs of &euro;14m are one-off payments associated with setting up the agency.</P>
        <P>NAMA advises me that if one-off due diligence and other costs are excluded, core costs &mdash; &euro;32m &mdash; are only 0.1% of the acquisition price paid for acquired loans. I have been assured by the Chairman and Chief Executive of NAMA that they are very conscious of the need to keep costs to the absolute minimum and to ensure that value for money is achieved.</P>
        <P>As regards decision making in NAMA, the agency has directed all participating institutions to ensure that credit applications are forwarded to it within ten business days of being received from debtors.  NAMA, in turn, aims to respond to applications within ten business days of receiving them from institutions. Accordingly, in normal circumstances, a debtor credit application should be processed within twenty business days of being submitted by the debtor to the institution and, in the case of letters of release, this process would be further expedited.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have asked the NAMA Board to consider initiatives which would help to get the property market moving again in a sustainable manner.  One such proposal is currently being considered by officials from my Department, in conjunction with officials from NAMA and from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>

        <Quest> if the explicit permission of the European Commission, the ECB and IMF has been received to allow the State to use any remaining balance of the &euro;35 billion, originally earmarked for the banking system, to fund the Exchequer once the bank recapitalisation scheme has been completed. </Quest>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the EU &mdash; IMF support programme provides for a total of &euro;85 billion in financial support from both internal and external sources &mdash; with &euro;17.5 billion of this being provided from our own resources.  When the programme was announced &euro;50 billion was identified as being available for the exchequer funding with the remaining &euro;35 billion identified as being for the banking sector.  Following the recent banking stress tests carried out by the Central Bank &mdash; the amount identified as being required for the banking sector was reduced to &euro;24 billion including &euro;3 billion of funds which take the form of contingent capital. However, it is anticipated that mitigating actions, such as burden sharing, will mean that up to &euro;5 billion of this &euro;24 billion will come from private sector sources.</P>
        <P>The budgetary forecasts contained in the recently published Stability Programme Update (SPU) prudently assume that an additional &euro;20 billion in State support to the banking sector will be required. On that basis, some &euro;15 billion of the funding originally earmarked for the banking sector is available for use for sovereign purposes, bringing the potential total available under the Programme for exchequer funding purposes to &euro;65 billion.  The release and use of <Col N="559"/>all externally provided funding is dependent on the continued satisfaction of the programme conditions &mdash; as verified by the quarterly review process.</P>
        <P>During the course of the forthcoming quarterly review, the financing plan for the remainder of the Programme of Support will be discussed with the Troika and the question of how to use any remaining balance taking account of the lower banking recapitalisation cost will be addressed in that context.</P>

        <Quest> if, in view of the high fuel prices which have a knock on affect on the cost of living and the cost of getting to work, he will consider adjusting excise rates downwards to address same; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[18531/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland, as with other countries, has experienced an increase in the cost of petrol and auto-diesel. The increase in fuel prices is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions. However, the price of oil has decreased somewhat recently.  The excise rates (including the carbon charge) in Ireland on motor fuels are 57.6 cent on a litre of petrol and 46.6 cent on a litre of auto-diesel. Ireland&rsquo;s excise rates are the ninth and third highest in the EU27 for petrol and auto-diesel respectively. However, our rates remain lower than many of our main trading partners and significantly lower than our nearest neighbour the UK.</P>
        <P>The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.</P>
        <P>It is on this latter basis that there are often demands to reduce taxes on fuel. However, I would point-out that the Exchequer gain may be limited because:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. the increase in petrol and diesel prices reduces the quantity of such fuels being purchased,</P>
        <P LI="1">2. spending in the economy is likely to be re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and</P>
        <P LI="1">3. the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">It should also be noted that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel. For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system. VAT on petrol cannot be deducted/reclaimed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are no plans for temporary taxation adjustments, as to do so could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer. The issue of rising fuel prices was recently briefly discussed by EU Finance Ministers at an ECOFIN meeting and they reconfirmed the approach taken in 2005 and again in 2008, when oil prices were very high, which endorsed a coordinated approach towards not making distortionary fiscal adjustments.</P>

	<P>A total of 4,854 census enumerators were recruited to assist with the field work on the 2011 census.  All of the recruitment for the census field operation was carried out by the CSO under licence by the Commission for Public Service Appointments and complied with their strict recruitment principles regarding fairness, equality, openness and transparency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to note that all applicants for enumerator positions were assessed at interview on their availability for census work (given the need to make frequent calls to households at different times of the day).  Availability was one but not the only criterion used in accessing candidates, but clearly those in full-time work would have been assessed as having low availability and therefore this would have had a negative effect on their candidature.  It was not open to the CSO to exclude candidates on the basis of their employment status.</P>
        <P>The following table indicates the employment situation and live register status of the 4,854 enumerators, prior to their employment on the census, detailed by the 44 census regions. Information on whether persons were previously self-employed, the sectors in which they previously worked and, if applicable, their pension arrangements is not collated as part of the recruitment process and so is unavailable.  Information on the number of retired public servants employed as enumerators as requested by the Deputy is not available.</P>

	<P>My functions in relation to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) were delegated to the Government Chief Whip, Minister of State Paul Kehoe T.D., on the 22 March 2011 under the Statistics (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) Order 2011, as per section 2(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1977 (No. 28 of 1977).</P>
        <P>It is my understanding that Minister Kehoe has met with the CSO twice in relation tocensus 2011.</P>
        <P>The Census which took place on Sunday 10 April was a very successful operation. Enumerators were in the field for a period of 10 weeks from Friday 11 March to Friday 13 May. Forms were delivered to and collected from 1.7 million occupied dwellings. In addition enumerators accounted for the dwelling status of all dwellings in the state as to whether they were occupied, vacant, a vacant holiday home or temporarily absent on Census night.</P>
        <P>The reception at the doorstep to the Census was generally very good due to the success of the Census Publicity campaign which focused on the community value of Census data.</P>
        <P>All Census field staff had finished work by Friday 3rd June at which stage all forms, materials and equipment was back at base in CSO.</P>
        <P>The field operation finished up on time and well within budget.  The preliminary count of the Census based on a clerical summary prepared by Enumerators was published on 30th June which is very good by international standards.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Approximately 6,400 households which were considered to have been occupied on Census Night failed to return a completed census form for a variety of reasons. The reasons included householders who moved or died before the enumerator returned to collect the Census Form. </P>
        <P>There were a small number of householders who refused to complete a Census Form, a number of which are being examined with a view to prosecution under the Statistics Act 1993.</P>
        <P>In all cases where the enumerator was sure a dwelling was occupied on Census Night but the enumerator failed to get a completed Census Form, enumerators were instructed to record the approximate age, sex and nationality of the occupants by making discrete enquiries locally.  The estimated number of persons in these households which failed to make a return was 13,800 representing less than a third of one percent of the total population.</P>
        <P>This number ranks very well by international standards and results from a very tight field operation with 440 field supervisors and 4,854 census enumerators on the ground for a period of five weeks both before and after Census day.</P>

	<P>It has not been the practice for formal meeings to take place in this Department between the Taoiseach and the Management Advisory Committee, having regard to the small size of the Department and the nature of its work.   I have, however, met with all of the staff of the Department, both together and in the various sections and divisions of the Department.   I discuss the work of the Department on a daily basis with the Secretary General, who advises me on issues considered by the MAC and I also meet frequently with the three Assistant Secretaries, who are the other members of the MAC.   As a result, I am satisfied that the MAC is focused on adapting the Department to the role it will play in supporting the Government in implementing its Programme.</P>
        <P>I envisage that I will meet the MAC on a formal basis, from time to time, to review progress in achieving our objectives in support of the working of Government, the operation of Cabinet Committees and the other responsibilities which the Department discharges in support of my role as Head of Government and member of the European Council.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 96 together. </P>
        <P>All Passport applications are processed under the provisions of the Passports Act, 2008.  This Act provides, inter alia, that the Department must be satisfied as to the identity of each individual from his/her witnessed application and photographs as well any submitted supporting documents.  In the Department&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to combat passport and identity fraud, additional photo identity such as a driver&rsquo;s licence is now required for first-time adult applicants or those persons who have lost or had their passports stolen.  This is in addition to the standard requirement of birth certificates.</P>
        <P>The Act also makes provision for the name in which a passport is to issue.  It is the Department&rsquo;s policy that a person&rsquo;s legal name is that by which he/she is commonly known as through use and repute.  For the majority of people, names will be based on the registered details with the General Registrar&rsquo;s Office (GRO) which is evidenced by issued birth certificates.  In cases where a name change has occurred as a result of marriage, such details will be recorded by the GRO and evidenced by marriage certificates.</P>
        <P>In other situations where a name that is requested to appear on a passport is different, other than by marriage, from details on a birth certificate, the Department seeks documentary evidence under the Passports Act, 2008 of the use of that name over a two year period.  As access to PPS numbers and birth certificate registration numbers are not available to international border control authorities, alternative measures must be put in place.  In this context, therefore, those applicants, who supply documentary evidence as to the use of the Irish form of their name over two years, receive their passports in that name without difficulty.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the Department may exercise discretion in regard to the application of the two year proof of usage requirement of a new name.  These cases are considered on a case by case basis.  However, such considerations must take into account that a passport is primarily an international travel identity document and that name change requests must therefore be balanced with the Department&rsquo;s obligations to uphold the integrity of the Irish passport among the international community and to protect against identity switching and identity fraud.  In those cases where the Department accepts that there are exceptional reasons for a name change from English to Irish or the reverse, a passport will be produced in the new name without the two year proof of usage.  However, an observation will be printed on page three of the passport stating the person&rsquo;s birth name or if appropriate his/her previous passport name.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the majority of name change requests received relate to a request for a new English name.  I should therefore stress that the procedure in operation must be applied in the same way for all name change requests, including from the English to the Irish form of the name.</P>
        <P>I would like to re-assure the Deputy that the Department&rsquo;s policies and practices are intended to ensure that our citizens receive their passport in their known and established identities, thus ensuring their safe and unhindered travel abroad.  I believe that these arrangements <Col N="568"/>are fair and maintain an appropriate balance between the need to protect the reputation of the Irish passport and a citizen&rsquo;s wish to have an alternative name appear on their passport.</P>

        <Quest>  if he has made or intends to make an official statement regarding the recent unlawful killing of 15 Syrian citizens who were peacefully protesting in the towns of Homs and Kiswa south of Damascus; and if he will ask the Syrian Government to enter into negotiations with Syrian pro-democracy groups whose main aim is to bring Syria to a democracy status.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am deeply concerned about the current situation in Syria and the violent repression against large numbers of people in Syria who have been simply trying to exercise their right to freedom of expression, whether in the street or online. After Friday prayers on 24 June, Syrian armed forces once again opened fire on unarmed protestors in several cities, killing a further 15 people. The death toll now numbers more than 1400, with thousands more detained. I am appalled by the Syrian Government&rsquo;s shocking use of lethal force. Such actions are completely unacceptable and a violation of the Syrian Government&rsquo;s responsibility and international obligations to protect its citizens.    The European Council discussed the situation in Syria at its meeting on 23-24 June and condemned in the strongest terms the ongoing repression. Heads of State and Government, including the Taoiseach, noted that by choosing a path of repression instead of fulfilling its own promises on broad reforms, the Syrian regime is calling its own legitimacy into question. The Council was also strongly supportive of diplomatic efforts aimed at ensuring that the UN Security Council can assume its responsibility and give an adequate response to the situation in Syria. The EU has also adopted a third round of sanctions against leading instigators of the repression, including President Assad. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Furthermore, the EU has strongly and consistently called for the start of a genuine and inclusive dialogue, including with pro-democracy groups, and fundamental reforms in response to the demands of the Syrian people. I note the fact that President Assad has announced that a national dialogue will commence and that opposition figures met publicly for the first time in Damascus on 27 June. However, I also note that many opposition figures refuse to enter talks with the government while it continues to instruct its army to fire on unarmed protestors.</P>
        <P>Ireland and the EU will continue to use all economic and political means to actively seek a change in policy in Syria until this cycle of appalling and ruinous violence ends.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The position in regard to passport entitlement in this case was outlined by my predecessor in his reply to your question 317 of 17 November, 2009, namely that the evidence of residence in Ireland in respect of the person in question, which was submitted in support of her daughter&rsquo;s passport application, was insufficient to demonstrate her child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship under section 6B(2) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004 (the 2004 Act).   I can confirm that in the interim no correspondence or evidence has been submitted to the Passport Service by the person in question to demonstrate her daughter&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship under section 6B(2) of the 2004 Act.  However, as stated in the reply of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to your question 145 of 20 May, 2010, it remains open to this person to make an application for a certificate of naturalisation on behalf of her daughter under section 15 of the 1956 Act, when the child has 5 years reckonable residency in the State.</P>
        <P>In the meantime as entitlement to Irish citizenship for this person&rsquo;s daughter has not been demonstrated to date, the Passport Service is unable to issue a passport to her under the Passports Act, 2008.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s aid programme, which is administered by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp; Trade, is concentrated on the least developed countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Botswana is not one of the priority countries for the aid programme.  However, since 2001, just over &euro;680,000 has been provided in assistance for development work in the country by Non-Governmental Organisations and missionaries.  The grants have included support for people living with HIV/AIDS, for primary health care and basic education and for the protection of human rights. </P>

        <P FLI="0">If an Irish citizen is brought before the Australian courts, they may request assistance from the Embassy. The Embassy cannot provide legal advice, but can provide information, including regarding legal aid and how to locate a local lawyer.  The role of the Embassy is to ensure that the citizen is not disadvantaged, but is able to avail of all protections which would apply to an Australian citizen in the same circumstances. The Consular Services Section in Dublin can liaise with family at home and can request the Embassy/Consulate to raise any issues of concern that they may have with the authorities.</P>
        <P>The huge geographical reach of the mission means that, of necessity, much of its consular assistance is provided to Irish citizens over the phone and by e-mail. I am satisfied that there <Col N="571"/>is ease of access to consular assistance, including outside regular office hours, where both the Embassy and the Consulate provide an out of hours telephone answering service.</P>
        <P>In emergencies, the Embassy works closely with Irish citizens in distress in Australia and where necessary, the Consular Assistance Section in Dublin liaises with their families at home. The Embassy and Consulate assist in providing linkages with contacts in Federal, State and local authorities across Australia. The Embassy can also, on request, link citizens with Irish community organisations in their area.</P>
        <P>On an ongoing basis, the Embassy provides Irish citizens in Australia with advice and direction to services available from the Australian authorities.</P>
        <P>While we do not have a physical presence in the major cities, I am pleased to have the opportunity to acknowledge the excellent support work undertaken across Australia by the Irish Welfare Bureaus, Support Associations and Irish Clubs, many of whom are supported by my Department&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme. We have provided grants in this regard to groups in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and Wollongong. These groups complement the work of the Embassy and Consulate and provide support and local advice to visiting Irish citizens and to those experiencing difficulty while in Australia.</P>

	<P>The passport in question was printed on 01 July and has been sent to the Passport Office in London for onward dispatch to the applicant.  The applicant should receive her passport by the middle of this week.   During the peak summer period, application processing times can lengthen for all passport services.  I very much regret that the volume of applications received so far this year has given rise to increased delays, particularly in the case of applications submitted from overseas.   Measures have been taken with the recruitment of temporary staff and the use of overtime to bring turnaround times back to normal levels at the earliest opportunity.</P>

	<P>The Government attaches importance to developing our trade and bilateral links with China. The latest available data shows that Ireland has a modest trade surplus with China, a dramatic turnaround from the position as recently as in 2006, when we had a trade deficit of &euro;2.9 billion.   We will be building on the excellent bilateral relations that exist between our two countries to further enhance our trade, investment, education and tourism links with China.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach hopes to lead a Trade Mission to China later this year and contact is continuing, including through our Embassy in Beijing, to arrange mutually acceptable dates.  The Taoiseach will, of course, be accompanied by other relevant Ministers on that Mission, in order to maximise its trade and other benefits for Ireland.  The recently launched Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015, entitled <i>Trading and Investing in a Smart <Col N="572"/>Economy</i>, has identified China as a key high-growth and high-potential market for Ireland, and the local market team set up under the Strategy and chaired by our Ambassador is already active.  A local market plan for China has been prepared and its implementation will be reviewed by the Export Trade Council, which I will chair, and which will hold its inaugural meeting later this month.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the importance of our partnership with China, we have in addition to our Embassy in Beijing, a Consulate General in Shanghai which is a key commercial centre.  Enterprise Ireland is co-located with both the Embassy and the Consulate General.</P>
        <P>China is also one of the small number of countries with which Ireland has a Joint Economic Commission.  The last meeting of the JEC took place in Beijing last October and provided an opportunity for intensive bilateral discussions on a range of issues that have the potential to deepen our economic engagement.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In assessing the demand profile since 2009, it should be noted that industrial action in 2010 distorted to some degree the demand profile in the early part of that year. Therefore, it is reasonable to compare the first half annual demands in 2011 with 2009 to establish in real terms the growth of passport services. The details in the table above show a 12% increase over 2009. This has resulted in a temporary backlog of approximately 5 days in the processing of Passport Express applications and about 2 to 3 weeks delay in applications made by general mail. The Passport Service regrets the delay and any difficulties caused in this regard.  Notice of the current extended turnaround time and its likely duration has been published on the Passport Service website <i>www.passport.ie</i> since 18 April 2011. It is regularly updated.  The Passport Service has also informed An Post so that customers can be advised of the situation at the point of application</P>
        <P>The exceptional peak season demand on all passport services is being tackled by the recruitment of 85 additional temporary staff and the use of overtime.  The ongoing efforts in this <Col N="573"/>regard will see the Passport Service bring processing times back to normal levels in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern regarding continuing abuses of the rights of citizens in Zimbabwe. Violence, intimidation and ongoing arrests demonstrate a disregard of human rights. Lack of rule of law and accountable governance remain fundamental challenges.  The hope of the Global Political Agreement, upon which the Government is based, was to permit Zimbabweans to live in peace and free from violence and to be empowered to elect their representatives in parliament and Government through democratic elections.   On the positive side, the conclusions of the Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government of SADC countries held in Sandton on 12 June 2011 on Zimbabwe, were encouraging. Ireland and its EU partners commend SADC, and in particular President Zuma, the SADC facilitator on Zimbabwe, on the progress made in their facilitation efforts. The Sandton Summit is another step towards the full implementation of the Global Political Agreement, a new Constitution, and laying the foundations for democratic reforms and elections in Zimbabwe.</P>
        <P>The question of when elections should be held is related to the progress which is made, under SADC facilitation, toward agreement on a roadmap to the achievement of a new Constitution and democratic reforms. Such reforms are necessary to provide a measure of trust and an environment which is as free from violence and intimidation as possible. We shall continue to support the efforts of SADC to achieve this agreement, and to urge the parties in Government in Zimbabwe to work in good faith to that end.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is deeply concerned about the continued high level and gravity of human rights violations in Iran, including the mistreatment of democracy activists and other detainees in prisons in Iran. Issues of particular concern in relation to detainees include widespread torture and other ill-treatment in detention, coerced confessions, the failure to uphold detainees&rsquo; right to legal counsel and family visits, failure to observe proper procedure during the trial process and the frequent and arbitrary application of the death penalty.    The EU has sought to raise human rights issues in Iran relating to detainees and the judicial process, as well as the application of the death penalty, with the Iranian authorities on several recent occasions. On 6 June, Hungary carried out a demarche on behalf of the EU to the head of the Human Rights Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ali Bahreini, on a number of detainees. This follows an earlier demarche in April regarding detained human rights defenders (Javid Houtan Kian and 6 others).</P>
        <P>In a further effort to increase the EU&rsquo;s impact on human rights in Iran, including the rights of detainees, the Foreign Affairs Council in April adopted a travel ban and asset freeze against <Col N="574"/>a number of serious human rights offenders in Iran. This sends an important political signal to those in the judicial system and elsewhere in the Iranian regime who perpetrate human rights abuses.</P>
        <P>At UN level, Ireland was active in ensuring the successful adoption at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in March of a decision providing for appointment of a Special Rapporteur to examine Iran&rsquo;s human rights situation. We call upon the Government of Iran to extend the utmost cooperation to the Special Rapporteur.</P>
        <P>At a bilateral level, my Department engages in ongoing dialogue with the Iranian Ambassador and his Embassy on these issues. My officials have already held a number of meetings with the Ambassador since the start of this year to convey our grave concerns at the human rights situation in Iran. Ireland will continue to raise human rights in Iran, including the rights of activists and other detainees, bilaterally and at the EU and UN, at all appropriate occasions.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the UN peace keeping mandate in the country; the action being taken at EU and UN level to address the ongoing extreme level of human rights abuses and sexual violence there; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The international community is following closely the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as the country recovers from the effects of the 1996-2003 civil war.  Since the 2002 Sun City peace accords, progress has been made in establishing a democratic system of government in the DRC.  However, while much of the country has achieved a degree of stability, several localised conflicts have continued, in particular in the east of the country. These conflicts have in many cases been characterised by an appalling degree of brutality, with large-scale attacks on the civilian population and widespread sexual violence. The humanitarian situation in eastern DRC, where more than a million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the effects of ongoing conflict, remains a cause of deep concern.     The United Nations has sought to enhance stability in the DRC through the work of MONUSCO, formerly MONUC, the UN&rsquo;s largest peacekeeping mission.  MONUSCO&rsquo;s current strength is just under 20,000 troops, military observers and police, along with 3,767 international and local civilian staff and 616 UN volunteers. 49 countries, including Ireland, contribute military personnel to the mission.  MONUSCO is a Chapter VII mission under the UN Charter, which means it is authorised to use all necessary means to carry out its protection mandate, including the effective protection of civilians, humanitarian personnel and human rights defenders under imminent threat of physical violence, as well as the protection of United Nations personnel, facilities, installations and equipment.  On 28 June, the mandate of the mission was extended until 30 June 2012.  </P>
        <P>The EU has also been active in supporting efforts to address ongoing instability in the DRC. Two missions are currently active in DRC as part of the European Security and Defence Policy: EUSEC, a Security Sector Reform mission supporting the Congolese authorities in the key task of providing advice and assistance for security sector reform, and EUPOL, a policing mission monitoring, mentoring and advising the Congolese police. These missions underline the EU&rsquo;s commitment to the Congolese people and the importance of consolidating the rule of law, security and stability in the DRC.</P>
        <P>Successfully conducted elections are absolutely critical to the consolidation of peace and security in the DRC and in the Great Lakes Region as a whole.  The current major focus of MONUSCO is to provide logistical support for the 28 November Presidential elections, with <Col N="575"/>voter registration already completed in four of the eleven provinces and over 80% of registration completed in the remaining provinces.  Ireland and its EU partners are investing heavily in ensuring that the forthcoming elections are successful, given the major organisational challenge they represent for a country the size of western Europe with extremely poor basic infrastructure and ongoing security problems.  The EU recently confirmed that it will provide funding of &euro;47.5 million for the elections and last month sent an EU exploratory mission to assess political and security conditions for the deployment of election observers, as was the case during the 2006 elections.</P>
        <P>The issue of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict is of serious concern to Ireland and we have sought to address it in the context of our work on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.  This Resolution, with its associated Resolution, 1820, recognises a direct relationship between the widespread and systematic use of sexual violence as an instrument of conflict and the maintenance of international peace and security.  It commits the Security Council to taking action to end such atrocities and to punishing their perpetrators.  In 2010, Ireland co-sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1888 which led to the appointment of Margot Wallstr&ouml;m as the United Nations Secretary General&rsquo;s first Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict.   The Special Representative has played an important role in leading a stronger international response to this critical issue, and has taken an active interest in the situation in the DRC.</P>
        <P>The DRC will continue to face considerable challenges in the post-election period and it will be important for the international community to remain engaged.  The country ranks among the world&rsquo;s least developed countries, with a position of 176 out of 182 countries on the UN&rsquo;s 2010 Human Development Index.  The EU is the largest humanitarian donor to the DRC and in 2010 gave almost &euro;47 million through its humanitarian assistance office (ECHO) to address the needs of vulnerable populations there.</P>
        <P>Since 2010, Ireland has disbursed more than &euro;13 million in response to the needs of the population  in the DRC.  To date in 2011, Ireland has allocated a total of over &euro;4.5 million in emergency funding to the DRC via the UN administered pooled fund and through our NGO partners. Of this &euro;1 million has been allocated to NGO partners.  With our partners in the EU and the wider international community, Ireland will continue to work to bring an end to the conflicts which persist in the DRC, to address immediate humanitarian needs, and to help develop the capacity of the Congolese state to govern and protect its people.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 113 together. </P>
        <P>The Government is determined to restore Ireland&rsquo;s standing as a respected and influential member of the European Union.  To this end the Government is engaging at senior levels with fellow EU Member States.  We are making clear the economic and financial realities confronting us and the steps which we have taken to get the public finances in order, to repair the banking sector and to restore growth.  We are emphasising our determination to see this process through to a successful conclusion.  We count on the continuing solidarity of partners.  We seek to inform and to persuade, pointing to the benefit for the euro area and EU as a whole of Irish success.</P>
        <P>Members of the Government avail of every appropriate opportunity to meet their EU counterparts, including those who are members of the euro area.</P>
        <P>The most time-efficient and cost-efficient way in which to meet EU Ministerial counterparts has proved to be in the margins of the European meetings that we attend and this is where the majority of such meetings have taken place &mdash; in the case of the Minister of State for European Affairs and myself, at the Foreign Affairs Council and the General Affairs Council.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, both Minister Creighton and I have also met our counterparts from the euro area on other occasions.  These meetings have taken place either as part of a wider programme during bilateral visits to the countries concerned or in the margins of other multilateral or international meetings.  The following tables provide details of these meetings and include a visit that I will undertake later this week to Berlin, during which time I will meet the German Foreign Minister, Dr. Guido Westerwelle.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of mineral oil tax and for tackling the illicit trade in fuel products, that they are very conscious of the ongoing threat to the Exchequer posed by the laundering of markers from mineral oil and the onward sale and supply of the laundered product as auto diesel.    I wish to inform the Deputy that a multi-agency Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group (CBFFEG) was established in 2008 specifically to deal with the illicit trade in mineral oil in the border area.  State representatives on this group include the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;ochana, Criminal Assets Bureau and the Department of the Environment.  Our Northern Ireland colleagues include HM Revenue &amp; Customs, UK Border Agency, Police Service of Northern Ireland, Serious Organised Crime Agency and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.  A total of twelve meetings of the group have taken place to date with multiple meetings of subgroup members at regular intervals.  </P>
        <P>Since its inception, this combined force has successfully targeted a number of illegal operators in the border area. In one such cross-border operation on the Monaghan/Armagh border in April 2009, three oil laundering plants, oil laundering equipment, over 100,000 litres of fuel, cash and a number of vehicles were seized. These multi-agency operations are planned to supplement the normal ongoing level of Revenue detection and enforcement strategy.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners also inform me that they employ a broad range of compliance and enforcement strategies and methods to monitor and detect illicit practices involving mineral oils.  These include the monitoring and auditing of trade and retail activity, random physical sampling at road checkpoints and intelligence driven operations, using covert surveillance to identify oil laundry locations and their times of activity.  The Commissioners are determined to apply all the resources required to counteract this threat to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>In 2010, Revenue Enforcement Officers detected four oil laundering plants and seized a total of 268,000 litres of laundered fuel.  Also in 2010, nine retailers were found dealing in laundered oil and eight haulage companies were detected using laundered oil. There were four convictions for other laundering offences.  Already in the period January to June of this year, five oil laundry operations have been detected and approximately 140,300 litres of laundered fuel have been seized.  Seven retailers and three haulage companies have also been detected in respect of laundered oil offences. In all of these cases, criminal proceedings have been taken or are being considered against individuals where sufficient evidence of involvement has been established.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Persons operating as unlicensed moneylenders are in breach of the law. Any evidence of their activities should be brought to the attention of An Garda Siochana. If legislation is required to deal with unlicensed moneylenders, that will be a matter, in the first instance, for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality. I will consider any subsequent follow-up regulatory requirements, so as to implement, in the full, the commitment in the Programme for Government.   The Deputy may wish to know that there is already a  comprehensive regulatory licensing system in place for moneylenders.  Moneylenders have to apply to the Central Bank annually to have their licences renewed.  Section 93 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (as amended) sets out the Central Bank&rsquo;s powers in relation to the grant or refusal of a moneylender&rsquo;s licence. The appropriate moneylending application form (new or renewal) must be completed and returned to the Central Bank with a number of items, for review and consideration.</P>
        <P>In addition to the licensing system, the Central Bank has in place a <i>Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders</i>   (the Code).  The Central Bank has power to impose sanctions on moneylenders for a contravention of the Code.  The Code sets out General Principles with which a moneylender must comply.  For example, a moneylender must act honestly and professionally, with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of consumers.  The Code also places requirements on moneylenders in relation to the provision of information to the consumer, preservation of a consumer&rsquo;s rights, knowing the consumer, suitability, unsolicited contact (cold calling), disclosure, errors, handling complaints, consumer records, unsolicited credit facilities, arrears and guarantees, debt collection and the contents and presentation of advertisements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 18 February 2011, the Central Bank published the results of a themed inspection of licensed moneylenders. The inspection showed a high level of compliance with the requirements of the Code among firms. Inspections were conducted in 11 of the 46 licensed moneylenders currently operating in Ireland. The inspections focused on whether consumers were being charged in accordance with the moneylenders&rsquo; authorised APRs (Annual Percentage Rates) and costs of credit as set out in the moneylenders&rsquo; licences. It also examined whether firms had their licences on display and, if they indicated the high-cost nature of loans on loan documentation issued to consumers, as required by the Code. Overall the inspections found a high level of compliance with the requirements and that consumers were been charged in accordance with the moneylenders&rsquo; authorised APRs and costs of credit. In addition, firms had their licences on display and indicated the high-cost nature of loans on loan documentation issued to consumers.</P>
        <P>I would expect that, in future, the Annual Regulatory Performance Statement of the Central Bank will refer to the regulation of moneylenders</P>

        <Quest> the context of developing our own domestic renewable energy sector, particularly wood biomass and wind-generated electricity, as well as reducing our over-dependence on imported fossil fuels, when the sections of the Finance Act 2010 which apply the carbon tax to solid fuels will commence; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The section in the Finance Act 2010 that provides for the application of the carbon tax to solid fuels (coal and commercial peat) is <Col N="580"/>subject to a Ministerial Commencement Order. This approach was primarily adopted by the previous Government in order to allow time for a robust mechanism to be put in place to improve the control of high sulphur coal being sourced from Northern Ireland suppliers.   As the Deputy may be aware, in that context the Department of the Environment in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) proposed new regulations for coal which would effectively extend the existing voluntary agreement for low sulphur coal to the entire State on a regulatory basis.  A stakeholder committee was established to provide an input into the proposed regulations. Under EU law dealing with technical barriers to trade, Member States are required to notify the European Commission of all draft technical regulations concerning products before they are adopted in national law. Formal notification of the proposed new standard for coal issued from NSAI to the EU Commission in November 2010.</P>
        <P>Following acceptance of the proposal by the EU Commission, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has recently introduced a new specification for the sulphur content of coal placed on the market for residential use in Ireland. This has been given legal effect through the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) (Amendment) Regulations 2011.</P>
        <P>In light of these developments, the issue of coal with a high sulphur content potentially being sourced from Northern Ireland has been addressed. In those circumstances the timing of the application of the carbon tax to solid fuels, as had been planned, will be considered.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124, 126, 128 and 150 to 153, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>The ECB is independent and this independence is set out in Article 282(3) of the Treaty, which states that the European Central Bank &ldquo;shall be independent in the exercise of its powers and in the management of its finances&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Executive Board of the European Central Bank comprises the President, the Vice-President and four other members. This is set out in Article 283(2) of the Treaty and Article 11 of the Statute of the ECB.  The members of the Board are appointed by the Heads of State or Government of the euro area Member States, acting by a qualified majority, &ldquo;from among persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters&rdquo;. They must be a national of a euro area Member State. They are independent and their term of office is eight years and is not renewable.</P>
        <P>The appointment procedure is as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">1) the Ecofin Council makes a <i>recommendation</i> (only euro area Member States voting) to the European Council, following agreement at the Eurogroup meeting; </P>
        <P LI="1">2) the European Parliament and the ECB are <i>consulted</i>; and</P>
        <P LI="1">3) the European Council (only euro area Member States voting) adopt the <i>decision</i>.</P>
        <P FLI="0">On the 17th May the Ecofin Council made a Recommendation to appoint Mr Mario Draghi as the President of the European Central Bank for a term of office of eight years, with effect from 1 November 2011.</P>
        <P>On 9th June the European Central Bank stated that they had no objection to the Council&rsquo;s Recommendation to appointment Mr. Mario Draghi as the President of the ECB.</P>
        <P>On 23rd June MEPs endorsed the nomination of Mr. Draghi as incoming President of the European Central Bank.</P>
        <P>On the 24th June the European Council formally appointed Mr. Mario Draghi to be the next president of the European Central Bank.</P>
        <P>I have had no discussions with nominees and have not tabled any proposals regarding the work of the European Central Bank as part of the discussions regarding the appointment of its next president.  This issue was discussed during the Eurogroup meeting on 16th May, which I attended, with the European Council making the final decision at its meeting on the 24th June.</P>

	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the recently published Commission proposals on the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework for the EU post 2013. The negotiation of the next Multi-annual Financial Framework will be one <Col N="583"/>of the key engagements for the Government at EU level over the next few years. Engagement in the negotiations will be an ongoing process and we will work effectively with partners to ensure the best outcome for the EU and Ireland. Ireland&rsquo;s approach will be guided by the following principles:  <b></b></P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />The overall size of the EU Budget as a percent of EU Gross National Income (GNI) should reflect the agreed policy priorities of the Union, while keeping in mind the budgetary consolidation imperative faced by all Member States including Ireland;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />There should be a gradual evolution of the EU Budget expenditure rather than radical changes;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />The need for continued food security and safety would warrant only gradual changes to the Common Agriculture Policy; in this regard, Ireland is committed to maintaining a strong and effective CAP which will support a vigorous consumer-focused agricultural production base in Europe;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />We will be working to identify all possibilities for benefitting from available EU funds, especially in the Europe 2020 areas including competitiveness, productivity enhancing actions/measures (including R&amp;D etc), cohesion and employment, climate change and energy, etc.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />In terms of financing, Ireland along with all other Member States will look carefully at the Commission proposals on alternative financing arrangements (&ldquo;own resources&rdquo;). Our view has always been that the GNI key provides the fairest and most effective base.</P>
        <P FLI="0">At this early stage, it must be acknowledged that the very detailed and comprehensive proposals set out by the Commission last week will be examined thoroughly by all over the months ahead.  In this regard we will be studying these proposals very closely, listening to the views of all other parties concerned and seeking to achieve the best possible outcome for Ireland and the EU.  In so doing we will work with all other Member States in a constructive manner on this important dossier.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 176 together.</P>
        <P>Performance-related pay has been an integral part of the NTMA approach to remuneration, reflecting the approach to remuneration in the private sector organisations with which the NTMA competes for staff. At the same time, public sector organisations must operate having due regard to the wider public policy context, which includes general economic circumstances. Accordingly, it is my intention to examine the approach to remuneration in the NTMA in more detail in the coming months following consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I will then see what changes, if any, might be appropriate in relation to the remuneration of all staff in the NTMA, having regard to the changing economic circumstances of the State and the need for transparency in public expenditure.   The legislation which established the NTMA in 1990 deliberately positioned it outside of the wider public service structures with operational freedom to negotiate market-competitive salaries so that it would have, for example, the flexibility to recruit specialists in mid-career from the private sector. Under the NTMA business model, its remuneration structure is such that there are no general pay grades and no pay scales and all staff are on individually-negotiated contracts.</P>
        <P>This business model has allowed the NTMA to staff itself with the necessary technical expertise to carry out the financial and risk management functions which have been assigned to it by Government since its initial establishment as a single-function agency managing the National Debt. These additional functions include the State Claims Agency, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the National Development Finance Agency and the National Asset Management Agency.</P>
        <P>The NTMA Advisory Committee, the members of which are appointed by the Minister for Finance, formally advises the NTMA on remuneration, including performance-related pay, on an ongoing basis. The remuneration of the Chief Executive, including any performance related payments, is determined by me after consultation with the Committee. The Advisory Committee makes recommendations to the Chief Executive on the specific remuneration of the other members of the senior management team and on general remuneration policy in the NTMA.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the members of NTMA&rsquo;s senior management team waived their performance-related payments due for 2010 in view of the serious economic situation facing the country.</P>
        <P>Turning to the point the Deputy raises regarding transparency, detailed information on salaries by salary band was furnished by the NTMA to my Department and included in my response to a parliamentary question from the Deputy  last week. Similar information was previously provided to the Committee of Public Accounts. In addition, in line with the requirements of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, full details of the remuneration of the Chief Executives of the NTMA, NAMA and NDFA will be published on an annual basis in the respective agencies&rsquo; Annual Reports.</P>

	<P>I would like to inform the Deputy that I, as Minister for Finance, have no responsibility with regard to the provision or refusal of a mortgage to a particular individual.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code is a set of general principles combined with more detailed requirements in certain areas. It requires financial institutions to act in the best interests of their customers by selling them products that are suitable, explaining why the products offered are suitable and treating customers fairly if things go wrong.  A financial institution must comply with the general principals of the Code in all its dealings with customers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer Process&rsquo;, set out in the Code, involves, inter alia, gathering relevant information from consumers about their financial situation, their individual circum<Col N="586"/>stances and needs.  Based on this information the financial institution is required to complete a Suitability Process where only products suitable to that particular consumer are offered.  While affordability is a prime component of suitability, a fuller consideration of a consumer&rsquo;s individual circumstances and needs would be required in order to comply with the &lsquo;Suitability Process&rsquo;. In this regard, when assessing suitability in relation to mortgage products, the Central Bank has informed me that it is of the opinion that factors such as, but not limited to employment, income and repayment capacity, purpose of   borrowings, type and length of loan, plans for early redemption, attitude to fixed/variable interest, age, savings track record, loan to value ratio, should be considered.  As suitability is specific to the circumstances and needs of each individual consumer, financial institutions should be satisfied that written statements reflect an assessment of each individual consumer&rsquo;s specific circumstances and needs, thereby the financial institution may meet the  &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer&rsquo; process,  i.e. requirements of the Code.</P>
        <P>If a consumer feels that he or she has been improperly treated, or that he or she has grounds for complaint for some other reason, then a complaint may be made directly to the financial institution concerned. If the consumer is not satisfied with the response received from the institution, there may be grounds to forward the complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO), who has the statutory powers to investigate complaints against financial services providers. The FSO will only consider a case once the internal complaints procedure within the financial institution concerned has been followed.  The Code outlines the complaints handling process up to and including the role of the FSO.</P>

OPW understands that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will formally consider the scheme on completion of the EIS, which the Council expects towards the end of 2011.  Pending the completion of the scheme design and the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it is not possible to confirm the cost of the scheme or when works can be commenced.  Progression of the scheme will also have to have regard to the Government's review of capital expenditure.</P>

	<P>The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act 2001 and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole prerogative. The statute does not accord me, as Minister for Finance, any function in this regard.   The Valuation Act 2001 provides for the exemption from <Col N="587"/>rates of land that is developed for sport such as playing pitches, land on golf courses, tennis courts, etc. The Act also provides that community halls such as sports clubhouses which are not licensed to sell alcohol and whose facilities are not used primarily for profit or gain are not rateable.  However, the Act provides that where a club is licensed to sell alcohol and is registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904, it is no longer deemed to be a community hall and therefore the premises occupied by that club are rateable.</P>
        <P>The sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and licensed club premises are competing with other licensed premises. The effect of removing any category of rateable property from the valuation base would be to increase the rates burden on other ratepayers.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to provide for special treatment of licensed clubs under the Valuation Act 2001, which maintains the long-standing principle that all properties are valued in a fair and equitable manner.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Finance, I have no statutory role in the setting of interest rates charged or paid by regulated financial institutions, including the institution mentioned by the Deputy.   The Central Bank of Ireland has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. Each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors such as cost of funds and commercial considerations (such as competition, risk pricing and the impact on deposit rates).</P>
        <P>In February 2011, the Central Bank advised mortgage lenders that it expects them to notify affected consumers, in writing, at least one month in advance of any increases in their standard variable rate.  This notification must include:</P>
        <P LI="1">a) the date from which the new rate will apply,</P>
        <P LI="1">b) the details of the old and new rates,</P>
        <P LI="1">c) the revised repayment amount, and</P>
        <P LI="1">d) an invitation for the consumer to contact the lender if he/she anticipates difficulties meeting the higher repayments.</P><Col N="588"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="0">With regard to consumers in arrears or in danger of getting into financial difficulty and/or concerned about going into mortgage arrears, the revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) offers increased protections to these consumers.  The revised CCMA was issued to mortgage lenders on 6 December 2010 and has been effective since 1 January 2011.  It builds on the provisions of the previous version, but includes more detailed requirements, including the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP). Other examples of significant changes are:</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />pre-arrears cases must be treated in accordance with the MARP,</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />arrears have been defined,</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />the primary residences which can be protected by the CCMA have been defined, and</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />an appeals process under the CCMA replaces the complaints process under the Consumer Protection Code.  The Central Bank has also published a guide for consumers on mortgage arrears &lsquo;Mortgage Arrears &mdash; A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender&rsquo;   and this is available on the Central Bank website: <i>http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/Documents/Consumer%20Booklet%20-%20FINAL%20Feb%202011.pdf</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">With regard to monitoring compliance with the consumer protection codes, the Central Bank carries out themed inspections and mystery-shopping exercises.  On 1st of July 2011, the Central Bank published the findings of a themed inspection of mortgage lenders which examined compliance with the requirement of the revised CCMA specifically relating to charges on mortgage accounts in arrears, and the related Letter of Direction (&lsquo;Direction&rsquo;) issued by the Bank.  The Direction instructed mortgage lenders to refrain from imposing interest surcharge on arrears and other specific charges arising on a mortgage account in arrears to which the revised CCMA applies and in respect of which a borrower is co-operating reasonably and honestly with the lender in the MARP from 1 January 2011.  Provision 9 of the CCMA refers to the restriction on imposing such charges.  Lenders were individually notified of the charges to which this Provision applies in the Direction that issued in December 2010.  This themed inspection was carried out across six mortgage lenders including credit institutions and retail credit firms.  655 customer mortgage account statements were reviewed during the course of the themed inspection.

	<P>Each mortgage provider is responsible for evaluating the capacity of the borrower to manage and repay the loan and it would be normal that the employment status of the applicant would be one factor taken into account. The mortgage provider must have regard to the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code (the Code) which is a set of general principles combined with more detailed requirements in certain areas. It requires financial institutions to act in the best interests of their customers by selling them products that are suitable, explaining why the products offered are suitable and treating customers fairly if things go wrong. The lending institution must comply with the general principles of the Code in all its dealings with customers.    When providing a product or service to the consumer, a financial institution must comply with the &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer&rsquo; and &lsquo;Suitability Provisions&rsquo; of the Code. </P>
        <P>The Knowing the Consumer process involves, inter alia, gathering relevant information from the consumer about his/her financial situation, individual circumstances and needs.  Based on this information the financial institution is required to complete a suitability assessment where only products suitable to that particular consumer are offered.</P>
        <P>While affordability is a prime component of suitability, a fuller consideration of a consumer&rsquo;s individual circumstances and needs would be required in order to comply with the Suitability Provisions of the Code.  In this regard, when assessing suitability in relation to mortgage products, the Central Bank is of the opinion that factors such as &mdash; but not limited to &mdash; employment, income and repayment capacity, purpose of borrowings, type and length of loan, plans for early redemption, attitude to fixed/variable interest, age, savings track record and loan to value ratio,  should be considered.  As suitability is specific to the circumstances and needs of each individual consumer, financial institutions should be satisfied that written statements reflect an assessment of each individual consumer&rsquo;s specific circumstances and needs, thereby meeting the Knowing the Consumer requirements of the Code.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the Code is currently being reviewed and a second consultation on the review of the Code is now underway.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not plan to introduce an independent appeals mechanism specifically for applicants who have been refused home mortgages by Irish banks.   I believe that mortgage lending must be undertaken on a sustainable and prudential basis by financial institutions and conform fully with regulatory requirements both in relation to the financial institution itself and also the safeguarding of the consumer&rsquo;s interests.</P>
        <P>The decision on whether or not to grant individual mortgages must remain a commercial decision for individual lending institutions. It is important that each lending institution is allowed to assess properly and independently the individual risks that it is considering accepting.</P>
        <P>The Government must maintain a balance between the support provided for individual banks and financial service providers generally through the bank guarantee scheme, other financial support incentives and broader public policy provisions, while at the same time ensuring that the day to day running of these institutions has regard to competition, market conditions and <Col N="592"/>the need to develop stable commercial enterprises to meet the long term credit needs of households and businesses in the Irish economy.  Consequently outside pressure should not be put on mortgage lenders to accept or reject individual mortgage applications.</P>
        <P>However, if a consumer feels that he or she has been improperly treated, or that he or she has grounds for complaint for some other reason, then a complaint may be made directly to the financial institution concerned. If the consumer is not satisfied with the response received from the institution, there may be grounds to forward the complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO), who has statutory powers to investigate complaints against financial service providers. The FSO will only consider a case once the internal complaints procedure within the financial institution concerned has been followed.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The assessment of the impact of changes in the interest margin on our EU loans is based on a number of assumptions about the level of the reduction, the date on which it applies and the amount of the loan to which it applies. Each of these elements has been changing in the past number of months.  Because of this, the figures provided for any interest rate reduction are qualified as being illustrative and the precise position will not be known until the actual arrangement is finally agreed.   Also, a decision to grant a reduction in the interest margin is a political one at EU level and is decided on a case by case basis. No change has yet been agreed for Ireland.   In mid-May, the Eurogroup decided on the margins for the EU financial assistance to Portugal which &mdash; if applied to Ireland&rsquo;s EU funding &mdash; would amount to a reduction of about 0.6%.  This crystallised the level of reduction likely to be available to Ireland.  My understanding at that time also was that the benefit of any reduction would not apply retrospectively.  More recently, I have received clarification that, if we were to get the benefit of the arrangements that apply to Greece, retrospection would not apply to any interest payments made before the decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is, therefore, a range of options in terms of the value of a reduction and this depends on the terms granted, which are decided on a case by case basis.  The following estimates of the likely impact illustrate the extent of this range. If the same interest rate reduction as Portugal&rsquo;s is applied (i.e. the equivalent to about 0.6% off Ireland&rsquo;s margin) to the coupons on future disbursements from the EU funds only (i.e. all the funds available to us under the EFSF and the EFSM) then the savings would be approximately &euro;150 million per annum.   Similarly, if the same interest rate reduction as Portugal&rsquo;s (i.e. the equivalent to about 0.6% off Ireland&rsquo;s margin) was applied to all future coupons on those EU funds (EFSF and EFSM) then the saving could be up to &euro;240 million per annum. The upper end of this range of options referred to earlier would be a 1% reduction applied to all future coupons for both the EU funds and the bilateral loans from EU partners, which would provide savings of the order of &euro;450 million per year, assuming all the funds are drawn down and that Ireland would pay a lower interest rate than that applied for Portugal recently. Although no decision has yet been made on an interest rate reduction for Ireland, based on the latest information available as set out, any benefit is unlikely to be at the higher end of the range outlined.</P><Col N="593"/>
        <P Just="Left">In that context, for illustrative purposes, applying the saving for the middle range outlined  for the 7.5 year average maturity envisaged for the overall programme funding, would give cumulative savings of approximately &euro;1.8 billion. The prospective savings from any putative 2% or 3% reduction would be pro rata to the amounts outlined above.  It must be noted, however, that a reduction of 3% would result in an interest rate below the cost of funds to the EFSF and the EFSM.</P>
        <P>The value of any interest rate reduction granted to Ireland will be known if and when a decision is taken on granting such a reduction, and on the terms and conditions on which it is to be granted.  We will continue to press our case for such reduction.  We will also continue to press the case for a larger reduction in the interest rate for all programme countries.</P>

The essential point in these replies was that the application of the reduction to the person&rsquo;s pension is in accordance with the provisions of Oireachtas legislation which was enacted to deal with the financial emergency prevailing.  Replies have now issued to both the Deputy and the person in question. Correspondence since then has asked for an elaboration of previous replies which I am happy to give as follows. As you know, the PSPR is in place since 1 January 2011, and was legislated for in the <i>Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010</i>.  Section 2 of that Act provides that the public service pension of a pensioner (as defined) is reduced.  Section 2(2) specifically provides, among other things, that the reduction &ldquo;<i>has effect notwithstanding . . . any circular or instrument or other document, any written agreement or contractual arrangement  . . .</i>&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The PSPR applies to public service pensions generally, including those of retired Ministers, Judges and other senior public servants.  Any reduction in pension payments is, of course, a serious step.  However, the grave state of the public finances and the threat to Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being provide the context for exceptional measures such as the PSPR.  In this connection, you will be aware that Ireland is availing of financial assistance programmes provided by the IMF and the EU and has undertaken to meet fiscal targets in that regard.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the first &euro;12,000 of pension is exempt from the reduction, and that the bands and rates of the reduction are progressively structured so that persons on lower pensions are proportionately less affected than those on higher pensions.</P>
        <P>Section 6 of the Act gives the Minister power to exempt a class or group of pensioners from the imposition of some or all of the reduction, if he is satisfied that they are materially distinguished by some particular aspect of their pension position from others who are subject to the reduction and the Minister considers it just and equitable to do so.</P>
        <P>The person in question may wish to make a formal application for exemption under Section 6, and the matter will be given consideration.  The delay in replying to the later letters is regretted and I have asked my Department to convey these regrets to the correspondent.</P>

 </tgroup><P Just="Left">* These are net disbursement figures.  Gross borrowing will be higher due to the credit enhancement measures required under EFSF arrangements.</P>
</table>
        
        <P FLI="0">The funds to be sourced from the EU include an estimated &euro;4.8 billion of bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark.  Under the bilateral agreement with the UK, which provides funding amounting to Stg&pound;3.2 billion (&euro;3.8 billion, based on the conversion rates prevailing in November 2010, is the assumed value in the table above), the funds should be disbursed in eight equal tranches starting in the third quarter of 2011.</P>
        <P>The bilateral loan agreements, including the disbursement profiles, with Sweden and Denmark are being finalized.  The current expectation is that the combined &euro;1 billion from these sources will be split equally over 2012 and 2013.</P>
        <P>The interest cost of future loan tranches from the EFSM and EFSF will be set on the disbursement date for each particular tranche but will be fixed for the term of the loan. All IMF monies have the same floating interest rate and margin adjustments. However, IMF monies drawn down to date have been hedged by the NTMA into fixed rate euro. The pricing structure for the EFSM, EFSF, the IMF and the bilateral loans is set out below:</P>
        <P>EFSM: Loans are priced on the basis of the issuance yield on the bonds sold by the European Commission to fund the loan plus a margin of 292.5 basis points.  The total interest cost will also include issuance costs incurred by the Commission.</P>
        <P>EFSF: The basic interest cost of EFSF loans is calculated as the issuance yield payable by the EFSF on the bonds it has sold to fund the loan, plus a margin of 247 basis points.  However, in its current form, the EFSF is required to undertake a number of credit enhancement measures to ensure it maintains the highest possible rating from the credit rating agencies.  These measures include a Loan Specific Cash Buffer and the prepayment of the margin due on the loan.  Under the Loan Specific Cash Buffer measure, the EFSF retains and invests a portion of monies it raises from the bonds it has issued to fund a specific loan.  The borrower has to pay the difference between the yield on the bond issued and the return earned by the EFSF from its investment of this money. The prepayment of the margin of 247 basis points is done on a net present value basis.  Accordingly, the coupons payable by the borrower over the term of the loan only relate to the cost of funds borne by the EFSF.  This structure is unwieldy and agreement has been reached to amend it, including the pricing mechanism, and this will end the requirement for a Loan Specific Cash Buffer and the prepayment of the entire margin.  Legislation is being prepared for the Oireachtas to ratify these amendments.</P>
        <P>IMF: Interest is paid quarterly at the IMF&rsquo;s standard interest rate for drawings under its Extended Fund Facility.   This rate is set by reference to the IMF&rsquo;s basic rate of charge plus <Col N="596"/>surcharges which are based on the size of the outstanding loans relative to the country&rsquo;s IMF quota.</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />For borrowings up to three times quota the interest rate is the weekly SDR rate (latest is 0.55%) plus 1% surcharge, i.e. 1.55%.</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />Borrowings above the threshold of three times quota are charged an additional 2% i.e. 3.55%</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />From 18 January 2014, the third anniversary of the availability of the 1st disbursement of the IMF funds to Ireland, an additional 1% is charged on borrowings over 3 times quota i.e. 4.55%</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />In addition to the interest charge there is a once off up front handling fee of 0.5% for all draw downs. This equates to about 0.07% per annum over the weighted average life of the loans of 7.5 years. The SDR interest rate is reset weekly and is based on a weighted average of the three-month Eurepo rate, three-month Japanese Treasury Discount bills, three-month UK Treasury bills, and three-month US Treasury bills. It should be noted that the NTMA has converted the floating rate cost of IMF borrowing into fixed rate euro.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Bilateral Loans: To date there have been no draw downs from the bilateral partners.  The UK loan agreement, which has been finalised for some time, stipulates that the interest rate on the amounts drawn down will be based on the Sterling Pound mid-market semi-annual swap rate at the time of drawdown plus a margin of 2.29%.  The Danish and Swedish loan facilities have not yet been signed but are near completion. It is proposed that the interest rate on each will be based on the 3-month Euribor interest rate, a market reference rate of good standing, plus a margin yet to be agreed.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of &euro;30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of &euro;16-20bn over this period. In each bank, a team of senior managers will be dedicated to the task of ensuring lending continues to grow to support economic growth.  This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks&rsquo; deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.</P><Col N="598"/>
        <P>Both pillar banks provide my Department with monthly figures on balance sheet volumes, sanctioned facilities and geographic and industrial breakdowns of their SME lending. The Deputy may also be aware that under the terms of the government recapitalisation, both banks also produce a quarterly report which incorporates figures for sanctions and drawdowns by SMEs. The data contained in these reports will continue to be reviewed and analysed by my Department and the Credit Review Office to ensure that the banks are compliant with the terms of the Government recapitalisation as it relates to the provision of credit for SMEs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I have said before, the Credit Review Office will, on application from the borrower, carry out an independent and impartial review of a bank&rsquo;s decision to refuse or reduce credit.

I would strongly advise anyone who has unsuccessfully appealed through the bank&rsquo;s own internal appeals process to seek a review by the Credit Review Office.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland is working with both banks to develop staff who are well versed in the issues facing exporters especially in the emerging sectors and are capable of cashflow based lending.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest Quarterly National Household Survey data revealed that in seasonally adjusted terms there were 296,000 people unemployed in the first quarter of 2011, resulting in an unemployment rate of 14 per cent. The data also highlighted the volatile nature of quarterly Irish economic data. Reflecting this, my Department&rsquo;s labour market forecasts are based on annual averages rather than quarterly figures. On this basis, my Department currently anticipates that the unemployment rate will average 14.4 per cent in 2011, while the number of unemployed will average 305,000. Underpinning this forecast is an assumption that there will be net outward migration of around 45,000 during the year.   These forecasts were set out in the Irish Stability Programme Update which was published at the end of April. Subsequently, the Central Statistics Office has revised down unemployment rates at the start of the year, and as a result the risks to the above forecasts are on the downside. My Department will continue to analyse the situation in light of later data and will produce revised economic forecasts prior to the Budget in the Pre-Budget Outlook.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the labour market remains weak. This was highlighted once again by last week&rsquo;s live register data which revealed that there were almost 460,000 people signing on in June. As is widely recognised, there is a significant difference between those signing on the live register and those classified as unemployed under the Quarterly National Household Survey. The Central Statistics Office note that the former is not designed to measure unemployment, however, as it includes part time workers, seasonal and casual workers. Recovery in the labour market typically lags recovery in economic growth, as firms adopt a wait and see approach and achieve higher levels of output by using existing resources more productively. As a result, net employment is expected to decline once again this year &mdash; albeit at a much slower pace than in previous years &mdash; before starting to expand once again in 2012.</P>
        <P>The measures announced in the Jobs Initiative represent the government&rsquo;s first steps to increase competitiveness in important sectors of the economy and improve the functioning of our labour market. In the high value added tourism sector, for example, the introduction of a new temporary second reduced rate of VAT and reduction of the air travel tax to zero will <Col N="599"/>have a positive effect on both costs and sentiment. Accordingly, while it is very difficult to quantify the exact number of jobs that the Initiative will deliver by the end of the year, the measures will play a role in sustaining and generating employment throughout the economy.</P>

This will occur when market conditions are right and when adequate regulatory structures have been established to protect consumer interests. Following publication of the Report of the Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities in April, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform asked Departments to give their considered views on the Review Group&rsquo;s recommendations. I understand that Minister Howlin&rsquo;s Department is considering these views and will bring proposals to Government shortly on the matter.

	<P>The taxation of energy products is to a certain extent harmonized at EU level. Directive 2003/96/EC known as the Energy Tax Directive (ETD) refers. The current ETD provides for minimum excise rates of taxation for energy products based on the volume of a product released for consumption. Member States must respect the minimum rates and not tax products below those rates, but are free to set higher rates for individual fuels as they see fit. The current Irish national rates are generally well above the EU minimum rates.  The aim of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal is to revise the ETD to bring it in line with wider EU climate change and energy policy to which all Members States have signed up. Ireland broadly supports the principle of the proposal and welcomes the introduction of the carbon tax into the EU minimum rates; it will serve to lessen competitiveness concerns arising from Ireland being a lead country in the area of carbon taxes.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s proposal essentially involves a provision for energy taxation to consist of two components, CO<sub>2</sub>-related taxation and general energy related taxation. The EU minimum rates would no longer be based on the volume of the product, but instead be a combination of the CO<sub>2</sub> and energy contents of the product.  In relation to fuel for uses covered by Article 8 of the ETD (which includes the use for agriculture), as with other fuels covered by the ETD, there would under the proposal be a change to how the minimum rate is calculated i.e. the split in CO<sub>2</sub> and energy content. It is also proposed to increase the EU minimum rate from 2013.   However, the revised minimum rate would remain below our current national rate.  It should be noted that discussions on the Commission&rsquo;s proposal are at a very early stage. Ireland, as well as a significant number of other countries, has reservations with some of the specific technical and administrative provisions the Commission has included in its proposal.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on individual cases.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the work of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt which published its final Report last November.  Since the publication of the Group&rsquo;s Report, the Central Bank has revised its Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to reflect many of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations including key recommendations relating to the introduction by all regulated lenders of a standardized Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  It is important to point out that borrowers who are in financial difficulties, but not in arrears, are allowed to come under the MARP.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also refer the Deputy to the Expert Group&rsquo;s comments on the potential to improve the position of some mortgage holders who are in negative equity where households would be willing to trade-down.  Trading down would produce a reduction in mortgage debt and more affordable monthly payments.  The Group noted that <i>&ldquo;for some mortgage holders who are in negative equity, trading down would produce a reduction in mortgage debt and more affordable monthly payments. The Group recommends that further consideration should be given by lenders to facilitating trading down by borrowers in this situation. Such options would have to meet relevant prudential standards, with appropriate controls in place, and be in the customers&rsquo; best interest.&rdquo;</i></P>
        <P>Trading down involves selling a current property and buying a cheaper one. Trading down may be an option to reduce the level of mortgage repayments, resulting in more affordable monthly repayments.  The Group&rsquo;s recommendation was aimed at helping mortgage holders remain as home owners while reducing their level of repayments. There will also be situations where mortgage holders in negative equity may wish to move home, for example, to take up new employment opportunities. There is merit in facilitating house moves by those in negative equity in certain situations and subject to certain criteria set down by the Central Bank. Ultimately, these are matters for lenders and the Central Bank to decide upon. Any lender planning to provide a negative equity type product must notify the Central Bank in advance to ensure that appropriate measures and controls are taken, as the Central Bank must be satisfied that such a product meets relevant prudential standards and does not lead to consumers being over exposed.</P>

	<P>The current arrangements in place regarding established civil servants wishing to take a career break in 2011 are set out in civil service circular no. 18/98 &mdash; Special leave without pay for career breaks and were amended in letter to Personnel Officers of 3 March 2008 &mdash; available on <i>www.personnelcode.gov.ie</i>.  This scheme allows for established civil servants, who have satisfactorily completed two years&rsquo; continuous service to apply for special leave without pay for a career break, provided they have not reached retirement age and the duration of a career break may not extend beyond retirement age.  (Periods of special leave without pay which have been taken in accordance with Maternity Protection Legislation, Adoptive and Carer&rsquo;s Leave and Parental Leave are not considered to break continuity of service for this purpose).</P>
        <P>A career break consists of special leave without pay for a period of not less than six months and not more than five years.  A career break may be extended by periods of six months or more up to a period of five years.  Eligible staff may, in general, avail of three career breaks in the Civil Service.  A second and third career break may not normally be taken until the officer has been back at work for a period equal to the duration of the initial or second career break.  The total period of the career breaks should not exceed ten years in all and no one period of absence should exceed five years.  There is no plan to amend this scheme.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Special Civil Service Incentive Career Break Scheme, this scheme was introduced as a once-off measure in the Supplementary Budget on 7 April 2009.  The measure was extended to staff in different areas of the public service, including the local government sector and the HSE.  The closing date for participation in this scheme has expired and there is no current proposal to extend the scheme.</P>

        <Quest> his consideration of extending tax breaks to the Eircom Employee Share Ownership Trust scheduled to end in 2014, if he has considered the contingent/potential cost to the tax payer for any shortfall in the pension fund over and above that provided by the company at the time of privatisation in respect of members of staff of the former Department of the Post and Telegraph; the cost in relation to this pension <Col N="602"/>issue and the cost of extending the tax breaks; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to my conditional undertaking to bring forward legislative changes to provide for an extension in the time period in which ex-employees can benefit from the tax treatment available for shares allocated via an Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT).  If this change is implemented, it would apply to all ESOTs.  The introduction of the extension would effectively have little or no cost.  This is because, in the absence of the extension, the ESOTs would merely allocate the shares they already hold in advance of the existing deadline.  Thus, the measure, if implemented, would defer the cost to the Exchequer of the scheme rather than impose an additional cost.  In relation to the pension fund at Eircom, I would not necessarily see any significant link between the two issues.  The Eircom No. 2 Pension Fund is to provide for the pension liabilities arising from the pre-vesting day service of former civil servants who were employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, many of whom are not members of the Eircom ESOT.  As regards the Fund, my Department maintains contact with the trustees and would be cognisant of the potential cost to the Exchequer in the event of a shortfall in the fund over and above what was provided following the privatisation of the company in 1999.  No shortfall is anticipated to arise in the medium term.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will keep the matter under review in consultation with the trustees of the scheme.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>VAT is charged on the supply of goods and services.  The rate applying is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  While many tourist-related services were made subject to a new temporary lower reduced VAT rate of 9% from 1 July, it is not possible to extend this treatment to the goods and services that remain subject to the 13.5% rate.  This arises from the fact that many of the goods and services to which Ireland applies a reduced rate of VAT, including dry cleaning and laundry services, have their basis under an EU derogation that provides that as we applied a reduced rate to these items on 1 January 1991, we are entitled to continue applying that reduced rate to those items.  However, this continuation of reduced rate application is conditional on the rate being no less than 12%.  These are known as &lsquo;parked&rsquo; items, and are provided for under Article 118 of the EU VAT Directive.  As laundry and dry cleaning services are such parked items, it is not possible for Ireland to apply the rate of 9% to them.  It is for this reason that the Jobs Initiative introduced a 9% VAT rate in respect of tourist activities such as restaurant and hotel accommodation services, while other tourist activities such as tour guide services and the short-term hire of cars, boats, caravans and mobile homes remain liable to VAT at the 13.5%.  However, it should be noted that in the majority of EU Member States dry cleaning and laundry services apply at their standard VAT rate of up to 25% in some cases, compared to 13.5% in Ireland.</P>

	<P>The financial institutions referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question have advised me of the following summary information:</P>
<P><i>Bank of Ireland</i></P>
        <P>On 18 June 2011, Bank of Ireland published a Prospectus which outlined that the estimated expenses to generate the &euro;4.2 billion Core Tier 1 capital and &euro;1 billion of contingent capital required to meet regulatory requirements by 31 July 2011 would amount to circa &euro;150 million.  Details of fees payable under the Transaction Agreement (where the NPRFC/Minister for Finance has agreed to underwrite the Rights issue and to subscribe for the potential State Placing and the Contingent Capital instrument) are set out in the Prospectus.  BOI has agreed to pay the following fees to the NPRFC and/or the Minister in consideration for the NPRFC and the Minister&rsquo;s obligation under the Transaction Agreement, including the underwriting of the Rights Issue, the State Placing and the subscription for the Contingent Capital instrument:</P>
        <P LI="1">An underwriting fee of 4% of the gross proceeds of the Rights Issue (including in respect of those securities that the NPRFC is entitled to take up pursuant to its proportionate entitlement);</P>
        <P LI="1">A placing fee of 1.5% of the gross proceeds of the State Placing;</P>
        <P LI="1">A corporate finance fee of &euro;3 million; and</P>
        <P LI="1">A fee of 1.5% of the amount of the Contingent Capital Instrument, i.e. &euro;15 million.</P>
        <P FLI="0">BOI has also agreed to pay all costs and expenses of the State, or in connection with the Debt for Equity Offers, the Rights Issue, the State Placing, the EGC, the entry into the Transaction Agreement, the issue of the New Ordinary Stock and the issue of the Contingent Capital Instrument in the amount of &euro;4 million.  In addition, BOI has agreed to pay the Joint Sponsors and the Joint Bookrunners the following fees in consideration of their services under the Transaction Agreement, including in respect or procuring places under the Rump Placing:</P>
        <P LI="1">A fixed fee of 0.4% of the gross proceeds of the Rights Issue (excluding in respect ofthose securities that the NPRFC is entitled to take up pursuant to its proportionate entitlement);</P>
        <P LI="1">An incentive fee of 1% of the gross proceeds of the New Ordinary Stock taken up in the Rights Issue or to the Rump Placing by 31 July 2011, but excluding any New Ordinary Stock subscribed for by the NPRFC pursuant to the Rights Issue, its underwriting commitments or taken up pursuant to the State Placing;</P>
        <P LI="1">A transaction co-ordinator / financial adviser fee of &euro;4 million; and</P>
        <P LI="1">A sponsor fee of &euro;1 million.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Bank of Ireland has agreed to pay the Joint Sponsors and Joint Bookrunners&rsquo; costs and expenses of, or in connection with, the Rump Placing.  As in normal procurement matters, Bank of Ireland applied value for money principles in determining the expenses of the capital raising.  When it is negotiating fees or expenses, Bank of Ireland takes into account market precedent, benchmarking and includes appropriate incentivisation.</P><Col N="604"/>
<P><i>Allied Irish Banks</i></P>
        <P>Allied Irish Banks have informed me that, to date, their capital raising fees total circa &euro;6.25 million which includes fees for the bank&rsquo;s Liability Management Exercise.  AIB&rsquo;s capital raising is not complete so further unquantified fees will be incurred.  The bank has advised that it has and continues to maintain the cost of professional fees in line with market norms.</P>
<P><i>EBS</i></P>
        <P>The EBS has advised that to date, that in the context of its capital raising measures, the company has spent c. &euro;270,000 on legal fees, c. &euro;6,000 on accountancy fees, c. &euro;6,000 on Investment bank and c. &euro;150.000 on trustees/tender agents.  EBS advised that the company received fee quotes from a number of investment banks and therefore ensured that fees paid were competitive, indeed the fees charged by the investment bank chosen were lower than all other quotes.  Regarding the other advisers, it was more cost efficient to use the previous legal advisors on the transaction as they were familiar with the structure.  If other firms had been used it would have cost considerably more.</P>
<P><i>Irish Life and Permanent</i></P>
        <P>Irish Life and Permanent has advised me that to date, it has spent &euro;2 million on lawyers, investment  advisors and underwriters as part of the institution&rsquo;s efforts to raise capital.  There will be further significant amounts due in relation to the IPO and the disposal of the Life Assurance company and other banking businesses.  I am advised by ILP that the institution effectively tendered the business to reputable firms and in some instances set a fixed price on the contacts to ensure value for money and to guard against a potential &lsquo;drift&rsquo; in variable fees.</P>

Fees of up to &euro;7.8 million may be payable to Goldman Sachs depending on the completion of transactions and performance.  In addition, following a competitive tender evaluation process, the NTMA has in place a legal panel comprising A&amp;L Goodbody, Arthur Cox and Matheson Ormsby Prentice from which to draw general legal services, at significantly discounted fees, required by the NTMA Banking Unit.  These general legal services include the provision of legal services required as part of the oversight of the banks&rsquo; capital-raising exercises.</P>

	<P>Any decision on whether to grant credit facilities is a commercial decision for an individual lending institution.  It is important that each lending institution is allowed to assess properly and independently the individual risks it is considering accepting.  However, if a consumer feels he or she has been improperly treated, or has grounds for complaint for some other reason, a complaint may be made directly to the financial institution concerned.  If the consumer is not satisfied with the response received from the institution, there may be grounds to forward the complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman, which has statutory powers to investigate complaints against financial service providers.  The Financial Services Ombudsman will only consider a case once the internal complaints procedure within the financial institution concerned has been followed.  The Credit Review Office was established in March 2010 by my predecessor.  The purpose of the office is to ensure the credit system is operating effectively for small and medium sized enterprises, including sole traders and farm enterprises.  The office will, on application from a borrower who is a farmer or a small or medium sized enterprise, carry out an independent review of a NAMA participating bank&rsquo;s decision to refuse or reduce credit.  The office will not hear appeals from those not engaged in business.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 and 174 together. </P>
        <P>In late May, I met a number of bodies representing the pension fund industry to discuss the 0.6% levy on pension scheme assets introduced to pay for the Jobs Initiative.  I outlined my contention at those meetings that the cost of the levy be absorbed by a reduction in the fees and charges made by their members.  In June, I wrote to the same representative bodies reiterating my contention and asking for their comments.  I have received a response from one of the representative bodies concerned.  The response indicates that the question of the absorption of the cost of the levy into existing fees and charges is a matter for individual companies in respect of the pension schemes and personal pension plans to which they provide services.  The <Col N="606"/>letter went on to say that the scope for those companies to absorb the levy is extremely limited.  I will await developments in the coming months to see if the pension fund administrators and providers have absorbed any of the pension fund levy this year.  In the light of those developments, I intend to pursue the matter further with them in the Autumn.  As regards a public awareness campaign, the recently enacted Bill giving effect to the levy was substantially debated in this House and in the Seanad as well as being widely reported on in the media.  I see no need for a media campaign and I have no plans for such.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government is conscious of the difficulties many homeowners are having in meeting their mortgage repayments in respect of their principal private residence.  There are a number of existing measures in place to support those homeowners struggling with their repayments.  These measures include the Mortgage Interest Supplement, the Money Advice Budgeting Services and the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.  The Mortgage Interest Supplement is managed by the Department of Social Protection and provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person&rsquo;s home.  The Deputy will be aware of the important support provided by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).  MABS provides a national, free, confidential and independent service operating from 53 offices nationwide.  I encourage anyone who is in financial difficulty to contact their local MABS office.  </P>
        <P>The Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears has been substantially revised to implement the recommendations of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert Group which published its final report in November 2010.  The code sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears with due regard to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  An important recommendation of the Expert Group was that lenders would make available a Deferred Interest Scheme to borrowers who cannot afford to pay the full interest on their mortgages but can pay at least 66% of the amount due.  The borrower would have to pay the deferred interest at an agreed future date.  Lenders representing the majority of the market have indicated their willingness to make available deferred interest schemes.  These are Allied Irish Bank, AIB Mortgage Bank, Bank of Ireland, ICS Building Society, EBS, Haven Mortgages, Irish Nationwide Building Society, Permanent TSB, Springboard Mortgages and Start Mortgages.  While the making available of Deferred Interest Schemes is voluntary for all lenders, those who have signed up in support of the scheme will be monitored by the Central Bank to ensure compliance.</P>
        <P>Another key recommendation of the Group relates to the requirement of all regulated lenders to introduce a standardised Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  Borrowers who are in arrears and who co-operate with the MARP will not be charge penalty interest charges.  A lender must establish a centralised and dedicated Arrears Support Unit which must be adequately staffed to manage cases under the MARP.  Under the MARP, lenders must agree appropriate forbearance with each borrower following as assessment of the full circumstances and characteristics of each borrower.  It is important to point out that borrowers who are in financial difficulties, but not in arrears, are allowed to come under the MARP.  In addition to <Col N="607"/>these existing measures, the Government is considering the further necessary actions required to alleviate the increasing problem of mortgage over-indebtedness.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to help homeowners who are facing difficulty with their mortgage repayments.  The Government will examine a number of proposals in relation to this commitment.  In this context, the Government Economic Management Council recently asked that further work be carried out to address the situation of over-indebted mortgage holders with a view to identifying a range of responses appropriate to individual circumstances.  The work concerned will be carried out by a group chaired by Mr. Declan Keane, an accountant seconded to the Department of Finance.  The group will produce a report by the end of September.  The composition of the group has yet to be decided but may include officials from the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and other Government Departments.  It may also use expertise from within the banking system.  As part of the restructuring and recapitalisation of the banks, the banks are engaging in ambitious cost reduction plans which are well under way.  The effect of these cost reductions will be to improve operating margins and permit the banks to better absorb funding costs.  The Government remains in consultation with the banks in connection with the more significant parts of these plans including a significant reduction of employee numbers.</P>

	<P>The NTMA has had detailed discussions with the pensions and insurance industries and with other stakeholders regarding the details of the bonds to be issued and the optimum timing for such issuance so as to best meet the needs of the pensions industry as a whole and the interest of the Exchequer.  The NTMA will issue the bonds when it is satisfied from its discussions with the market participants that there is a demand for them.  This will depend in part on conditions in the overall market for Irish Government bonds and on the detailed guidelines and decisions of the Pensions Board.  The NTMA will continue to monitor the position very closely with a view to finalising its issuance plans as soon as conditions are appropriate.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 to 184, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as statistics on income tax and corporation tax receipts do not generally distinguish between the yields from different sources of income, the figures of tax yields from stallion stud profits are not separately identifiable. Figures of the profits earned from the provision of stallion stud services were required to be returned in income tax and corporation tax returns for the year 2009. The figures thus entered were &euro;0.5 million for Income Tax and &euro;4.0 million for Corporation Tax. However, it is not possible to infer from these figures the amount of tax that would be generated as they would be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs.</P>
        <P>The current scheme for the taxation of stallion profits and gains was introduced with effect from 1 August 2008 and replaced the exemption for stallion stud fees which terminated on 31 July 2008.</P><Col N="611"/>
        <P>Under the exemption scheme, profits or gains arising to an owner or part owner of a stallion from the sale of services of mares within the State by the stallion or from the sale of rights to such services were exempt from income and corporation tax.</P>
        <P>Under the current scheme, stallions are treated as stock in trade which means that income from stud fees and profits or gains on the sale of the stallions are fully taxable in the hands of both corporate and individual owners.</P>
        <P>When the current scheme was introduced, it was suggested by the then Minister for Finance that the horse racing and bloodstock industry was (and continues to be) of enormous benefit to this country, not just economically but also from the social and sporting point of view as well.</P>
        <P>In computing profits, a write-off over 4 years of the &ldquo;initial value&rdquo; of the stallion is allowed as a deduction for tax purposes. It is not the case that this provision is a loophole. It reflects the fact that some stallions have a short nomination life and also takes into account that the majority of stallions are unsuccessful at stud. The impact of the deduction on taxable profits during the write-off period is directly related to the success, or otherwise, of the stallion. Without this provision the cost of a stallion would, under normal rules, be allowed as a deduction upon its disposal or death.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;initial value&rdquo; of a stallion is its market value on the later of 1 August 2008 (i.e. the date the new scheme commenced) or when it is purchased for, or appropriated to, stud activities. For this purpose, &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is the price the stallion would fetch on the open market or, where the purchaser and vendor are not connected and the transaction is at arm&rsquo;s length, the price actually paid.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;initial value&rdquo; of a stallion standing at stud before 1 August 2008 was set at the market value of the animal as of that date on the basis that any alternative arrangement could have resulted in the sale overseas of top quality stallions and a freeze in the acquisition of new stallions in the period prior to the termination of the exemption scheme. As the value of many stallions purchased before 1 August 2008 would have declined by that date, the use of market value at 1 August 2008 would have reflected that reduction. On this basis I do not accept that this measure constitutes a significant tax shelter for many stallion owners.</P>
        <P>As regards whether I will close off this provision, I would advise Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in that, like all proposals for new tax or expenditure measures, this will fall to be considered in the context of the ongoing development of budgetary and economic policy. However, as advised above, if this provision was discontinued, the cost of a stallion would be allowed as a deduction upon its disposal or death under normal rules. As the benefit of the 4 year write-off is largely one of timing, its abolition would not be expected to give rise to gains to the Exchequer in the long run, as any resultant annual gains would be offset by increased tax deductions in the year of disposal or death of the stallion.</P>
        <P>In relation to the amounts of tax revenue foregone in each of the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, I wish to reiterate the advice to me from the Revenue Commissioners that the figures of tax yields from stallion stud profits are not separately identifiable as statistics on income tax and corporation tax receipts do not generally differentiate between the yields from different sources of income. Figures of the profits earned from the provision of stallion stud services for the year 2009 are as set out earlier. However, as they would be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs, it is not possible to deduce from these figures the amount of tax that may have been foregone.</P>

	<P>The position is that I have not, as yet, directed the Revenue Commissioners to examine the feasibility of a single business tax as outlined in the Programme for Government.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Programme for Government is a comprehensive document containing many proposals and commitments to be fulfilled over the lifetime of the Government.    Among the first commitments in the Programme which we promised to deliver within the first 100 days of Government was the Jobs Initiative. This has been delivered on time in the past few weeks. I intend, over the coming weeks and months, to turn my attention to the other aspects of Programme for Government that are within my area of responsibility.  This will include the proposal to examine the feasibility of a single business tax.</P>

	<P>As I said in a reply to a question from Deputy Flanagan on 21 June, ensuring that a strategic investment bank is operating in the domestic banking market, providing finance to large capital projects and acting as a conduit for venture capital as well as a lender to SMEs, is an objective in the Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive programme of bank recapitalisation and restructuring is currently underway following my statement on the future banking landscape in Ireland at the end of March last.  The essential detailed assessment and planning work to meet this objective will be accelerated once the Government&rsquo;s key immediate objectives for the repair of the banking system have been completed. This assessment will include the bank&rsquo;s relationship with the two pillar banks and the time line for its establishment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 to 192, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The functions of the Registrar of Credit Unions under the Credit Union Act 1997 are to regulate credit unions with a view to the protection by each credit union of the funds of its members and the maintenance of the financial stability and well being of credit unions generally.  While the terms of reference of the Commission on Credit Unions allow for an examination of the governance and regulatory framework for credit unions, I have no intention of altering the current independent position of the Registrar as part of the independent Central Bank structure.</P>
        <P>When making recommendations on, inter alia, the governance, regulatory and legislative framework for credit unions, the Commission is required to take into account the philosophy and ethos of the credit unions.</P>
        <P>Under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, the Central Bank of Ireland is required to prepare a statement relating to its performance in regulating financial services, including credit unions.  This performance statement is provided to me, as Minister for Finance, each year before 30 April and I am required to lay this statement before each House of the Oireachtas within one month of its receipt.  The report received this April deals with credit unions on pages 20 and 21 and was laid before this House on 27 May 2011.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Credit Unions was established by Government on 31 May 2011 and has begun its programme of work.  It met for the first time on 20 June 2011 and had a subsequent meeting on 24 June 2011.  The Commission may decide on its own consultation arrangements.</P>
        <P>The Commission will make initial recommendations on the strengthening of the regulatory framework by 30 September 2011 and will submit a final report to me, as Minister for Finance, by 31 March 2012.</P>
        <P>Membership of the Commission is as follows:</P>
        <P><i>Chairman</i></P>
        <P>Professor Donal McKillop (Professor of Financial Services, School of Management, Queens University, Belfast) and Member of the Credit Union Advisory Committee.</P>

        <P>The Government agreed the terms of reference of the Commission on Credit Unions and these are as follows:</P>
        <P>Having regard to the commitments</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />in the Programme for National Government 2011-2016 to review the future of the credit union movement and to make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for credit unions, and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />under the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland to design a strategy for the future evolution of the credit union sector, to assist credit unions with a strengthened regulatory framework including more effective governance and regulatory requirements and to make recommendations to the Minister on legislation to be submitted to the Oireachtas by end-2011; and</P>
        <P LI="1">taking into account</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />the not-for-profit mandate of credit unions, their volunteer ethos and community focus, paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors&rsquo; savings and financial stability,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />the comprehensive strategy to enhance the viability of the credit union sector prepared under the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />international best practice in the structure, organisation and regulation of credit unions or analogous entities; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />the strengths and weaknesses of the sector as set out in work done in the Strategic Review of the Credit Union Sector in Ireland;</P>
        <P LI="1">the Commission on Credit Unions is invited to:</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>1. Define the role of credit unions in the context of a restructured financial services sector. </i>  This will focus on the credit union as a cooperative, owned and run by its members and providing its members with the financial services that they require. Consideration will also be given to the role of the credit union in relation to the community in general. In particular, the objects of a credit union as set out under section 6 of the Credit Union Act 1997 will be examined including the function of the common bond in the context of modern financial services systems. The Commission should also consider the question of the prudential supervision of loan societies and credit cooperatives registered under the Friendly Societies Act 1896 and the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893 that engage in taking deposits from and providing loans to their members and make recommendations in this regard.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>2. Propose a model for modern credit unions and define the structure/parameters </i>  within which financially viable credit unions will operate. At the same time, the Commission will examine how credit unions may continue to provide the services required by their members while meeting regulatory requirements sufficient to protect the savings of depositors and the financial stability of the credit union sector as a whole. This should examine how the size of a credit union, the variety and complexity of the services it provides and the competencies of its management and staff influence its viability. The question of credit unions competing with the larger financial institutions should be studied.</P><Col N="618"/>
        <P LI="1"><i>3. Options for restructuring. </i>The Commission will make recommendations on the possibility of voluntary consolidation or restructuring of the credit union sector over time, recognising the need to maintain local presence and taking into account the not for-profit mandate, the volunteer ethos and community focus of credit unions. In this consideration, due regard must be given to the need to protect depositors savings and financial stability. Central Bank of Ireland proposals in relation to possible restructuring of some credit unions should be examined and recommendations made to the Minister for Finance as these may arise over the term of the Commission. The Commission is required to engage with the Department of Finance, make recommendations and exchange information on legislative proposals during the course of its deliberations.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>4. Shared services. </i>The Commission will examine the options for groups of credit unions to share services on a formal basis and the extent to which this model is appropriate. The Commission should consider which services are most suitable for delivery by a separate entity, e.g. purchasing, auditing, compliance, credit control, legal, marketing, human resource management, administration and training. Progress in relation to the introduction of modern information technology and management information systems for and in credit unions will be examined and recommendations made in this regard.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>5. Determine and set out the basic governance and regulatory requirements that must be met. </i>  The Commission will focus on a set of benchmarks that credit unions should meet if they are to be registered to operate in the State. These benchmarks should include capital requirements, sizes of loan books and of loans, competencies of directors and staff, investments policy, fitness and probity and governance standards. Recommendations will be made in relation to management reporting arrangements both internally and with the Registry of Credit Unions.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>6. Make recommendations for legislative change. </i>  The Commission will examine the existing legislation and in particular the Credit Union Act 1997 and make recommendations on changes required to implement their findings. The Commission should make initial recommendations required to strengthen the regulatory framework of credit unions by 30 September 2011. A final report should be submitted to the Minister for Finance by 31 March 2012.</P>

	<P>The revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears,  (CCMA) was issued to all mortgage lenders and came into effect on 1 January 2011.</P>
        <P>The CCMA sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears.  The CCMA requires that each lending branch must have at least one person with specific responsibility for dealing with arrears and pre-arrears cases. It also requires frontline staff to be made aware of the lender&rsquo;s policy for dealing with arrears and pre-arrears cases and the relevant contact person and process.   The revised CCMA also introduced the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) framework for the handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases.  Provision 9 of the revised CCMA states that &ldquo;Lenders are restricted from imposing charges and or surcharge interest on arrears arising on a mortgage account in arrears to which this Code applies and in respect of which a borrower is co-operating reasonably and honestly with the lender in the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process.  (Lenders will have been notified individually of the charges to which this applies).&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Central Bank issued Letters of Direction in December 2010 to mortgage lenders prohibiting them from imposing specific arrears charges or surcharge interest on mortgage accounts in arrears to which the revised CCMA applies and in respect of which a borrower is co-operating reasonably and honestly with the lender in the MARP from 1 January 2011.  With regard to monitoring compliance with the consumer protection codes, the Central Bank carries out themed inspections and mystery-shopping exercises.  On 1st July 2011 the Central Bank published the findings of a themed inspection of mortgage lenders which examined compliance with Provision 9 of the revised CCMA and the Letters of  Direction.  This themed inspection was carried out across six mortgage lenders including credit institutions and retail credit firms.  655 customer mortgage account statements were reviewed during the course of the themed inspection.

        <P>However, all mortgage lenders are obliged to adhere to the requirements of the  revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) which is effective from 1 January 2011.  The Code sets out specific requirements mortgage lenders must adhere to when dealing with customers in arrears and those at risk of falling into arrears.  The CCMA requires that each branch must have at least one person with specific responsibility for dealing with arrears and pre-arrears cases.  It also requires frontline staff to be made aware of the lender&rsquo;s policy for dealing with <Col N="620"/>arrears and pre-arrears cases and the relevant contact person and process involved.  The revised CCMA also introduced the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process framework for the handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware from my Statement on Banking on 31 March 2011 that the future of Ireland&rsquo;s banking landscape will be built around the two pillar banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB.  Each of these banks has already begun to reorganise their operations into core and non-core functions and to implement a carefully managed programme of deleveraging.  Both Bank of Ireland and AIB have submitted revised deleveraging plans for consideration by the Central Bank of Ireland.  In my Statement on Banking, I said that the Irish banking system needs to be reduced to a size appropriate to our economy.  Our banks will become smaller, more focused on core operations, better funded and better capitalised.  In that context I announced that the operations of AIB and EBS would be combined to build a second pillar bank from the strengths of both institutions.  The Deputy will be aware that I signed the acquisition agreement on 26 May 2011 and the acquisition was completed on 1 July 2011. The Deputy will be aware that the Memorandum of Understanding <Col N="621"/>between the Irish Government and the EU-IMF requires that the legal merger procedure be completed not later than end September 2011.</P>
        <P>In addition, also on 1 July 2011 the High Court granted a Transfer Order under the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 to transfer with immediate effect the assets and liabilities of Irish Nationwide Building Society to Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited. The granting of the Transfer Order combined with the EU Commission&rsquo;s approval of the Joint Restructuring and Work Out Plan for Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society on 29 June 2011 are significant milestones in removing these banks from the Irish banking system.  The removal of these banks from the system is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s restructuring of the Irish banking system.  The purpose of the merger is to ensure a concentrated and vigorous work out of the existing loans.</P>
        <P>Irish Life and Permanent is being radically restructured by selling its life insurance subsidiary and deleveraging its banking activities with a continuous assessment of sales opportunities in the market over time.  A Direction Order was granted by the High Court on 9 June 2011, to allow ILP take the necessary steps to prepare its life insurance business for disposal by way of initial public offering or private sale. Irish Life and Permanent are required to submit their restructuring plan to the European Commission for approval by 31 July 2011.</P>
        <P>A fundamental element of Government strategy has been to restore a functioning banking system and the Government has made particular commitments to recapitalising the banks and restructuring the banking sector as part of its programme for Government.  This radical restructuring of the banking system is designed to put our banking system on a firm footing which is essential to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.</P>

	<P>As I said in my Statement on Banking in March, the PCAR bank stress tests carried out by the Central Bank are certainly among the most thorough and demanding such tests ever performed in Ireland and or indeed anywhere.  The detailed results methodology and assumptions underlying these stress tests have been published, emphasising Ireland&rsquo;s firm commitment for this critical exercise to be fully open and transparent.  In specific terms I am satisfied on the basis of the results of the PCAR assessment carried out by the Central Bank which have been endorsed by the external authorities that the loan loss assumptions made reflects a high degree of conservatism and underpin the robustness and credibility of the exercise overall.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank of Ireland has advised me that the EU-wide bank stress test process is still underway and is expected to be completed shortly.  As regards the robustness of the stress test, the European Banking Authority is working with national banking supervisors and other European stakeholders, such as the European Commission, European Central Bank, and European Systemic Risk Board, to ensure there is consistent and conservative application of the stress test to all participating banks.</P>

        <Quest> the degree or extent to which it has been possible to identify any inflationary factors in the economy in each of the past three <Col N="622"/>years to date in 2011; the issues now emerging as acquiring attention in this regard; the means by which it is likely to become possible to address these issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that through 2009 and 2010, there were few inflationary pressures. Indeed, price levels fell, with the CPI declining by 4.5% in 2009 and 1% in 2010, and HICP falling by 1.7% and 1.6% respectively.  In the latter months of 2010 and to date in 2011, the drivers of inflation have been insurance premium hikes and increases in the price of commodities on the back of rising global demand and supply side issues, namely the political instability in the Middle East and North Africa.  The CPI has also been affected by increases in mortgage rates.  In May 2011, the annual rate of increase in the CPI was 2.7% and 1.2% in the HICP.</P>
        <P>Looking further out the horizon, the main inflationary risks are likely to come from the external side in the form of further commodity price increases, ECB policy rate increases and domestically from administered prices.  In terms of limiting the impact of inflationary pressures, the Deputy will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s recent initiative to reduce the rate of VAT for a range of services connected to the hospitality and tourism sectors.  The overall picture remains one where muted domestic demand and considerable spare capacity in the economy are expected to keep underlying Irish inflation in check for some time to come.  Therefore, modest price rises will assist in restoring our relative competitive position globally.</P>

	<P>It is customary for jurisdictions to continually update and amend their tax regimes to reflect changes and developments in both the structure of companies and current practices in domestic and international trade and commerce.  The tax offering of any jurisdiction is critical to its attractiveness to international business and all jurisdictions compete on the tax front for foreign direct investment. Such tax competition is quite legitimate and there are mechanisms and controls in place at both EU and OECD level to ensure that such competition does not migrate into the sphere of unfair tax competition.  In that respect my Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners keep a watching brief on all significant developments in competing jurisdictions which could feed into our own policy considerations.</P>

	<P>The Implementation Body for the <i>Public Service Agreement 2010 &mdash; 2014</i> published its first progress report on 15th June last.  The body found that, over the 12 months to end March 2011, sustainable Exchequer pay bill savings in the order of &euro;289 million had been achieved, driven primarily by a reduction in public service staff numbers of 5,349 over the period.  Public service pension costs have increased over the period.  However, this is not a direct function of or causally linked to the Croke Park agreement but, rather, represents costs which would arise in any event.  The cost increase is not due to the Croke Park agreement but is essentially caused by increased longevity (i.e. fewer pensioners dying) and more people retiring normally.</P>
        <P>The body&rsquo;s report, correctly, foot-noted the pension increase over the period but, equally correctly, did not seek to relate it to the Croke Park reform process.  The body&rsquo;s report also footnotes the costs associated with the voluntary early retirement and redundancy schemes which were offered in the HSE last year.  It should be noted that any voluntary early retirement scheme incurs up-front once-off costs while the savings remain sustainable into the future.</P>
        <P>As regards the payments to those who left under the most recent exit mechanisms, i.e. the HSE scheme and the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER), the total amounts paid out in terms of lump sum and severance, including statutory redundancy, was of the order of &euro;106 million.  The associated ongoing annual pension cost is of the order of &euro;46 million.  Increased pension costs associated with the schemes decline over time as early retirees reach the age at which they would have retired in any event. In addition, some of those who retired under these schemes did so outside the relevant period within which the Croke Park agreement was in operation, i.e. before March 2010.</P>

	<P>Springboard is a specific initiative targeted at unemployed people who have lost jobs in sectors where employment levels will not return and who will need new qualifications and skills to re-enter employment as the economy recovers.  To be eligible for a place on a Springboard course an applicant must have been unemployed for a minimum of six months when the course starts. At the time of starting a Springboard course an applicant also must be in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or One Parent Family Payment or be signing for contribution credits and be available and actively seeking employment. The rationale for applying a six months waiting criteria to the initiative is to ensure that the limited resources available for Springboard are directed at unemployed people, who may be most in need of upskilling or reskilling in order to get back into employment.  In calculating the qualifying period of six months unemployed, time in receipt of any of the following allowances will also be taken into account:  &mdash; Disability Allowance &mdash; Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) &mdash; Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) &mdash; VTOS training allowance &mdash; F&Aacute;S Training Allowance.</P>

	<P>The following table sets out the position in relation to the realisation of the &euro;128 million contribution due from the eighteen congregations under the 2002 indemnity agreement. The completion of the legal arrangements in the case of 24 properties, valued at &euro;23.34 million, remain outstanding, although the physical transfers of these properties have taken place. The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office continues to pursue the legal requirements issue under the indemnity agreement. In addition, a potential shortfall of &euro;160,000 has been projected between the value of properties to be transferred and the total amounts due under the agreement. However, this is subject to change if good and marketable title cannot be realised on certain properties and the final shortfall or surplus will not be known until all properties are completed under the terms of the indemnity agreement.  In accordance with the terms of the agreement, &euro;12.7m of the fund was used to provide an educational grants scheme for former residents and their families.  This fund continues to be administered by the Education Finance Board who, at the end of 2010, still had a balance of approximately &euro;3.64 million remaining in the fund.  The remaining cash balance was lodged in the special account and used to offset the cost of the payment of redress awards.</P>
        <P>Section 7(iv) of the indemnity agreement provides that part of the contribution of the congregations shall comprise &ldquo;counselling and other support services for former residents of institutions and their families already provided or to be provided to the extent that the value of the same amounts to &euro;10 million&rdquo;.  My Department received confirmation from Faoiseamh, an organisation providing counselling and psychotherapy referral service for people abused by <Col N="625"/>priests or religious, that it received contributions amounting to &euro;13.9m from the contributing congregations between 11th May 1999 and December 2009.  This represents compliance with their obligations in terms of this aspect of the indemnity agreement.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the question of further contributions from the congregations towards meeting the costs of the response to residential institutional abuse is also being pursued.</P>

I wish to inform the Deputy that school transport arrangements under the Closed School Rule originated from the last major amalgamation of schools in the late 1960&rsquo;s. Under the Closed School Rule, transport is generally provided to the school of amalgamation for pupils who reside in a closed school area.  However, over the course of the last 42 years, many parts of Ireland have experienced changes in population, the number of schools in an area may have increased and private transport is more widely available.  My Department must always seek to ensure that every service that is funded by the public is operated in a manner that delivers for pupils, parents and taxpayers alike.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.  The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and are currently in the process of informing schools of their annual SNA allocation for the coming school year.</P><Col N="627"/>
        <P>In relation to applications for Resource teaching support, Circular 37/2011 provides information to schools regarding the arrangements which are being put in place for the 2011-12 school year for the allocation of Resource Teaching hours for children with assessed special educational needs.  The main elements of the arrangements outlined in the Circular are that for the coming 2011-12 school year, an allocation of 90% of valid identified resource teaching allocations will be made to schools, in the first instance, to provide schools with the majority of their allocation, while also preserving enough capacity to deal with late applications and ensure that the Department of Education and Skills can remain within Employment Control Framework obligations. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) have now notified schools of their allocations for the coming school year. Schools have also been asked to forward as soon as possible any outstanding applications, or additional outstanding materials to support incomplete applications, to the NCSE for consideration, but in any event by no later than 16th September 2011.  Following consideration of all of the applications received, if the level of demand permits, the initial 90% allocation may be revisited and increased.</P>

	<P>I wish to clarify for the Deputy that pupils with Down&rsquo;s syndrome may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil&rsquo;s educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department&rsquo;s Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</P>
        <P>Pupils with Down&rsquo;s syndrome who have care needs may also receive access to Special Needs Assistant support.

The issue of whether Down&rsquo;s syndrome should be classified as a low incidence disability in all instances was considered as part of this review. The recommendations of the review will be considered in the context of the Departments Employment Control Framework obligations and competing demands on teacher numbers and educational resources.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are allocated to schools to enable them to support the care needs of pupils with disabilities who also have a significant medical need or a significant impairment of physical or sensory impairment. Students with an assessed special educational need who present with significantly challenging behaviour may also qualify for some SNA support.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which was established under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004 (EPSEN Act) has responsibility for processing resource applications, including applications for SNA support, for children with disabilities who have special educational needs through its regional Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs). The NCSE also has responsibility for planning and co-ordinating the <Col N="628"/>provision of education and support services for students with special educational needs, in accordance with my Department&rsquo;s policy.</P>
        <P>The NCSE may seek the advice of my Departments inspectorate division, if required, on educational matters concerning children with special educational needs. However it is the responsibility of the NCSE to allocate SNA posts to schools and to ensure that SNAs are best placed to meet the care needs of eligible pupils.</P>
        <P>The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating supports which now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts. The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of SNA support to eligible schools.  The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March 2011 and are currently in the process of informing schools of their annual SNA allocation for the coming school year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216, to 219, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>The level of student intake to the state funded Colleges of Education is determined annually by my Department and it takes account of the supply of, and demand for, primary teachers. The level of intake to these Colleges has decreased in recent years in light of available resources and factors impacting on demand.  Approximately 1,350 students will graduate from the State-funded Colleges in 2011.</P>
        <P>The Graduate Diploma in Primary Education offered by Hibernia College has been recognised for the purpose of qualification as a primary teacher for almost ten years. As Hibernia College is a privately-owned institution providing a privately run course, neither my Department, nor any other State body, has a role in regulating the number of students enrolled.  It is estimated that over 650 students will graduate in 2011.</P>
        <P>The process of allocating teaching resources to schools for 2011/2012 and the arrangements for filling vacant or new teaching posts, including temporary posts, takes place in the context of the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland and the Public Service Agreement 2010/2014. It is necessary for my Department to exercise additional control and reporting measures this year to ensure that the numbers of teachers employed in schools is consistent with the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland.  This requires that all permanent and fixed term positions <Col N="629"/>are in the first instance made available to those surplus teachers with either permanent contracts or contracts of indefinite duration.</P>
        <P>It is the intention of the Department to restore recruitment from fixed-term teachers on the main panels, supplementary panels or public advertisement at the earliest possible opportunity, after all the surplus permanent teachers have been redeployed.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently advised schools that they can proceed to fill fixed-term vacancies subject to a contingency being held for possible future redeployment of any remaining surplus permanent teachers.  These fixed-term vacancies and remaining permanent vacancies that are not required for the redeployment of surplus permanent teachers will create opportunities for fixed-term teachers and newly qualified teaching graduates.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> 2009:  &euro;39m  (Primary &euro;36m/Post-Primary &euro;3m);</P>

        <P>Schools are also required to hold a list of appropriately qualified registered teachers who have notified the school that they are available for substitute work.  This list must not include the names of registered teachers in receipt of a pension.  Where it is not possible to source a registered teacher from a national service such as TextaSub or SubSearch or from the school&rsquo;s list of registered teachers then there is an obligation on the principal of the school to record in writing that a registered teacher who is not in receipt of a pension could not be employed and the reasons for this.  The principal is also required to report to the Board of Management on a regular basis where it has been necessary to employ a retired teacher or an unregistered person in place of a teacher.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 and 227 together.</P>
        <P>The change to the student grants scheme to which the Deputy refers &mdash; the removal of the automatic entitlement of mature students to the non-adjacent rate of grant &mdash; was introduced by his Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; Green Party Government under Budget 2011.   It is estimated that some 6,900 mature students qualifying for grant support live 45 kilometres or less from their institution.  From September 2011, students qualifying for the maintenance element of the student grant in this cohort will receive the adjacent rate of grant together with payment of their fees or student contribution as appropriate.  A full year saving of &euro;13m has been estimated from this measure.</P>
        <P>A statistical breakdown for independent mature students with dependent children is not available.  The economic circumstances of the country are such that I am not in a position to reverse or vary any of these changes.  A costing is not, therefore, available for a child-care allowance for independent mature students.</P><Col N="632"/>
        <P>However, all students, including independent mature students, on particularly low incomes will continue to receive a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; in the special rate of maintenance grant and the Student Assistance Fund at some &euro;5m continues to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need. In such circumstances, child care costs can be supported under this fund.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 260 together.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputies that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for <Col N="633"/>processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports. This includes the allocation of resource teaching hours to schools as well as the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required and the discontinuation of such classes where the need no longer exists.</P>
        <P>The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such supports.  In respect of special classes, schools are required to observe Department policy in enrolling children to these classes. This includes having a professional assessment confirming that the child&rsquo;s attainment levels meet the Department&rsquo;s criteria and a recommendation for special class placement. Schools are eligible for resources for special classes when the pupils enrolled meet the Department&rsquo;s criteria and where there are enough eligible pupils to retain a class.</P>
        <P>In respect of pupils with mild general learning disability enrolled in the class being suppressed due to reduced pupil numbers, these pupils will have access to additional teaching support through the teaching resources allocated to the school under the General Allocation Model (GAM). Schools in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) programme with Band 1 status, including the school in question, receive beneficial GAM allocations in addition to enhanced pupil-teacher ratios.</P>
        <P>There may be instances where children who are enrolled in a MGLD class fall within the low incidence disability category. These children may qualify for individual resource teaching support through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and it is open to schools to liaise with the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 231 and 257 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with special needs, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs.  The expansion in the network of autism-specific special classes in schools is reflective of the recent commitment to educational provision for children with special educational needs and this commitment remains a key Government priority. The Deputy will be aware that there has been unprecedented investment in providing supports for pupils with special needs in recent years, with over &euro;1 billion being spent this year in supporting special educational provision.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for co-ordinating special needs education provision at local level and arranging for the delivery of special educational services. The SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs. Another specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.   Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved <Col N="634"/>in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs.   SENOs are a valuable resource to parents and in particular at times of transition for children including for example to post primary level where an element of forward planning may be required. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact SENOs directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that enrolment issues are a matter in the first instance for the parents of children and the Boards of Management of schools where they wish to have their children enrolled. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which assists parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will try to help parents to find an alternative school placement if their child has been unable to secure a placement to date.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</P>
        <P>The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.</P>
        <P>The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and are currently in the process of informing schools of their annual SNA allocation for the coming school year.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that SNA allocations are not permanent, as the level of SNA support allocated to a school may be increased or decreased as pupils who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school. They are also decreased where a child&rsquo;s care needs may have diminished over time.</P>
        <P>The qualifying criteria for the allocation of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support is outlined in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 07/02. The recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.</P>
        <P>Changes to school transport services relating to the Closed School Rule were announced in the 2011 Budget by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the scheme.  It is important to stress that there are a number of dimensions to the cessation of the Closed School Rule (CSR).  The first of these, which will be implemented from September 2011, involves the uniform application of the distance criterion to all pupils travelling under the primary transport scheme, including those travelling under the CSR. This means that children residing less than 3.2 kilometres from their school of amalgamation will be deemed ineligible for school transport. In such cases, these children may apply for concessionary transport.</P>
        <P>The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date. This second element will restrict school transport eligibility for those pupils entering in September 2012, to pupils who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school.  Available statistics, based on sampling undertaken as part of the Value for Money Review, indicate that the impact of this change will be limited as the majority of pupils categorised under the CSR are in fact attending their nearest school and will not be affected by this change.  Before implementing this second main change which is proposed for 2012, my Department has requested Bus &Eacute;ireann to conduct a detailed analysis of the &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; impact for individual schools and the rural communities they serve. This analysis will be based on the most up to date information available on current school transport usage patterns and I expect to have this information available to me this summer. I will then have ample opportunity to carefully examine the likely affects of this change and act on it, if necessary, well in advance of the 2012 implementation date.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 237 and 238 together.</P>
        <P>Since September 2010 a total of 535 primary school teachers in 70 primary schools have received school-based support in the following areas:</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE)</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE)</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />Child Protection Guidelines</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />School policy planning including Code of Behaviour &amp; Anti-Bullying Policy formation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">School-based support is given by PDST in response to schools&rsquo; requests for support and may include support in relation to bullying depending on the needs identified. Usually the issue of anti-bullying is treated in a more in-depth manner in support for school policy planning including Code of Behaviour &amp; Anti-Bullying Policy formation, although this depends of the circum<Col N="637"/>stances of individual schools.  It is worth noting that supports in these areas have been available to schools for a number of years prior to 2010.</P>
        <P>In addition to this support, the Child Abuse Prevention Programme (CAPP) provided training in the Staysafe programme, which has an element related to anti-bullying, to almost 2,400 teachers in the last school year. Since 2007, CAPP have provided training to almost 20,000 teachers. PDST provides a wide range of continuing professional development supports to primary and post primary school teachers. The approach of the PDST is to work on a cross-sectoral basis and steps have been taken to achieve this aim, while also addressing the individual needs of each sector. Planning for the next school year is currently underway.</P>
        <P>In relation to experience in anti-bullying, there are ten full time people on the PDST team who have particular expertise and training in the areas where anti-bullying content is likely to arise such as Social Personal and Health Education, Relationships and Sexuality Education, Child Protection and Policy Development including Code of Behaviour and Anti-Bullying.</P>
        <P>It is acknowledged that the level of resources available to support services have been reduced in recent years in line with the changed economic situation. Accordingly, schools may experience some delay in accessing supports. Needs identified by schools are responded to as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>I consider these supports to be adequate, particularly given the overall range of priorities that the teacher support services aim to address on an ongoing basis.</P>

        <P>I have asked that my officials arrange a meeting with representatives of the centre in question, which I hope will take place later this week.</P>
        <P>My Department has taken a decision not to provide funding to support the centre referred to by the Deputies as the proposal submitted was not in line with my Department&rsquo;s policy on educational provision for children with autism.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware my Department&rsquo;s policy is focused on ensuring that all children, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</P>
        <P>As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met. My Department&rsquo;s policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated. Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school. Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports. In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios. Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.</P>

	<P>The NCCA has been asked to review the junior certificate and advise on the scope for reform designed to strengthen literacy and numeracy, embed key skills, promote active learning and enhanced creativity and innovation, and ensure appropriate ways of generating evidence of learning. Concerns have also been raised about curriculum overload, and rote learning. </P>
        <P>The Council has completed a public consultation process and has published a report of the consultation findings on its website <i>www.ncca.ie</i>. The Council is currently finalising its advice <Col N="639"/>to me on the direction of reform, in consultation with the partners in education. I expect the Council&rsquo;s advice in the Autumn.</P>
        <P>I am aware that teachers of history and geography have raised concerns that their subjects will no longer be compulsory.  The requirement to study history and geography in a secondary school but to have different options in vocational schools is a historical anomaly which is no longer appropriate. I believe that students should have as wide a choice as is feasible in their schools given the overall level of student demand and interest, the teaching resources available, and the qualifications profile of staff. They should also acquire a range of knowledge, essential skills and values which will contribute to lifelong learning, and effective social and economic participation. The importance of history and geography in promoting critical analysis skills, interculturalism, an understanding of human development, democracy, past and current world issues, and the skills for an environmentally sustainable life are fully appreciated. I will be guided by the NCCA&rsquo;s advice in this matter.</P>

        <P>However, over the course of the last forty two years, many parts of Ireland have experienced changes in population, the number of schools in an area may have increased and private transport is more widely available.</P><Col N="640"/>
        <P>My Department must always seek to ensure that every service that is funded by the public is operated in a manner that delivers for pupils, parents and taxpayers alike.</P>

	<P>I recently announced that 20 new primary and 20 new post-primary schools are to be established in the next six years.  Of the 40 new schools, one new post-primary school will be located in the general Ballinteer/Stepaside area of South Dublin.  I also announced the introduction of new arrangements for the recognition of both primary and post-primary schools that will provide an opportunity for all patrons to seek to apply for patronage of these schools. My Department will shortly inform patron bodies of the details of the first schools that are to be established.  Applications for patronage of the new schools will then be sought.</P>

	<P>I understand the question to relate to the probationary process for primary teachers. </P>
        <P>The Teaching Council has been informed that the relevant sections of the Teaching Council Act 2001 will be commenced no later than 1 September 2012. The Council has begun to consider the procedures and criteria for the induction and probation of primary and post-primary teachers that the Council would wish to implement.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements for probation of primary teachers were put in place by my Department last year. These are set out in Circular 58/2010. I hope that these arrangements will make it easier for newly qualified teachers to complete probation.</P>
        <P>If a registered teacher is unable to complete the requirements of a registration condition within the specified period, the teacher may apply to the Council for an extension to that period in the year in which it is due to expire. Information on this process is available on the Teaching Council website.</P>

        <P>The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and are currently in the process of informing schools of their annual SNA allocation for the coming school year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 and 254 together.</P>
        <P>The changes relating to the Primary School Transport Scheme derive from decisions of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government to implement recommendations in the School Transport Value for Money review and the need to obtain savings under the four year national recovery plan.</P>
        <P>The decisions announced cover the uniform application of the distance requirement, cessation of the Closed/Central School Rule (CSR), the minimum number of eligible children required to establish and retain services and the introduction of charges for eligible primary pupils.</P>
        <P>It is essential to stress that the wider context within which all these changes are taking place, is a situation of the most serious financial difficulties. Under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of &euro;17 million on the school transport budget and these measures are an integral part of this.</P>

	<P>The scheme to which the Deputy refers is the July Provision Scheme. Participation in the scheme is an option for all special schools and mainstream primary schools with special classes catering for children with autism or severe to profound general learning disability that choose to extend their education services through the month of  July. Home based tuition of 10 hours per week for the four weeks in question is provided to children who attend schools which choose not to participate in the scheme. For home based provision my Department&rsquo;s preference is that the tuition be undertaken by a fully qualified teacher. However where parents have difficulties in sourcing fully qualified teachers my Department accepts some tutors with alternative qualifications and modifies the rate of payment accordingly.</P>
        <P>Officials in my Department have contacted the parent to whom the Deputy refers and have advised her with regard to her application for home based provision.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that 10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts are being provided for SNA support for the coming school year. This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number. </P>
        <P>It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</P>
        <P>The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.</P>
        <P>The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and are currently in the process of informing schools of their annual SNA allocation for the coming school year. As this process is ongoing, it is not possible to provide details of the level of allocation of SNAs in any given area</P>

	<P>In September 2005, my Department announced the allocation of funding of &euro;300 million for an Education PPP Programme comprising of 23 new post primary schools and 4 new primary schools under a major expansion of the Government&rsquo;s Public Private Partnership Programme.  The provision of the proposed new secondary school in Skibbereen was included in that announcement. A site has been acquired for the new amalgamated school.  </P>
        <P>As part of the Jobs Initiative announcement I confirmed that I am developing two further bundles of PPP schools.  The provision of the school in Skibbereen will be considered for inclusion in this context.  The make up and timing of school bundles in my Department&rsquo;s PPP school building programme will be determined by in consultation with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA).  The issues to be considered in the timing and bundling of these schools include site availability for each school, geographical spread and the estimated total cost of the proposed school bundle.  The normal time scale for the provision of the accommodation from the time of the announcement of a bundle of schools, is 4 years approximately.</P>

	<P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  </P>
        <P>Under section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a  Vocational Education Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance,  where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. My Department has no authority  to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</P>
        <P>A Section 29 appeal recently took place in respect of a refusal to enrol this  child to the school in question. This appeal was not upheld. Following the  receipt of the Appeal Committee&rsquo;s determination, the Secretary General wrote to both parties advising them of the outcome of the appeal.</P>
        <P>This letter was copied to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The NEWB is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB has indicated that it will treat children for whom an appeal under Section 29 has been unsuccessful as priority cases in offering such assistance. The contact details for the NEWB in the area in question is NEWB, Block 3, Floor 1, Grove Court,  Blanchardstown Dublin 15, Tel: 01 8103261.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 and 265 together.</P>
        <P>Based on my Department&rsquo;s most recent statistics, it is expected that enrolments will increase nationally from a current enrolment at primary level of circa 509,652 pupils to circa 552,800 pupils by 2017 and at post-primary level from a current enrolment of circa 317,432 pupils to circa 342,300 pupils by 2017.  My Department is currently examining all areas of the country to determine where additional provision will be required at both primary and post-primary level up to 2017.</P>
        <P>It is within this context that I recently announced that up to 40 new schools are to be established within the next six years, comprising of twenty new primary schools and twenty new post-primary schools. Of the 40 new schools, 17 will be in the Dublin area with a further twelve in the commuter belt of Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and Louth. Six new schools will be established in Cork, three in Galway and one each in Wexford and Cavan.</P>
        <P>In addition, it will be necessary to extend the capacity of many existing schools to meet the demand for increased pupil places. Should the demand for increased pupil places emerge in County Kerry, it may be necessary to increase the capacity of schools in the area.</P>
        <P>The current status of all projects on the school building programme, including those in County Kerry, may be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i> and this will be updated regularly throughout the year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 270 and 271 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the concern expressed by many parents and organisations in relation to the high cost of school books and the frequent rate of revisions made by book publishers.  I previously indicated to the House that I would meet with book publishers and representatives of parents to discuss this important issue in greater detail.  I can confirm to the Deputy that I met recently with these groups, including representatives of the St. Vincent de Paul.  I emphasised to book publishers the need to minimise the amount of changes they make in textbooks and the avoidance of new editions, where only minor changes are involved.  I also urged them to consider closely the cost of books they supply to the market.</P>
        <P>I also raised concerns from sections of the visually impaired community about the level of co-operation between book publishers and the National Braille Production Centre.  The educational publishers have agreed to reflect on the concerns I raised with them and I am currently awaiting a formal response from them in response to our recent meeting.  I sympathise with parents who are experiencing difficulty in paying for school books.  The harsh economic reality in Ireland means money is tight for many parents.  It is precisely for that reason that I will continue to encourage schools to establish book rental schemes as the most effective means of lowering the cost of books for all students.</P>
        <P>Many schools are already using the funding for books provided by my Department to operate successful rental schemes, however there remains room for improvement across the wider education system.  I am currently examining how best to encourage schools to establish book rental schemes and I have asked the National Parents Councils to provide me with examples of best practice that they have encountered in this area and I will disseminate these to schools.</P>

	<P>A major project for the school referred to by the Deputy was included on the list of projects on the work programme for 2011, which was announced on 24 January last.  A technical assessment of the school has been completed and my Department has agreed the Overall Schedule of Accommodation with the school authority.  The material referred to by the Deputy is currently being prepared and will be forwarded to the school when finalised.  Thereafter, the process for the appointment of a Design Team will commence.  All large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase are being progressed in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme and the available financial resources. </P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.  This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.  The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year.  A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and are currently in the process of informing schools of their annual SNA allocation for the coming school year. </P>

Under the agreed rules which are published on my Department&rsquo;s website, teachers who do not respond to an offer of panel rights within a specified time forfeit their panel rights.</P>

        <P>The measurement of the distances in question is a matter for grant awarding bodies.  It is not possible, therefore, for me to say what the distance calculation for an individual student will or should be.  However, the shortest most direct route to college is measured.  I understand that a range of mechanisms can be used, for example, online mapping such as AA route planner and Google maps.  If there is a dispute it may be necessary to carry out a physical measurement.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department, either directly or through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), provides for a range of supports in schools to enable them cater for students with special educational needs including additional teachers, Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and specialist equipment.  The precise model of provision made will depend on the pupil&rsquo;s assessed disability.  </P>
        <P>The SNA scheme provides additional supports to schools to enable them to support pupils with significant care needs.  SNAs are allocated to schools by the NCSE through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs).  The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.  This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</P>
        <P>The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising them of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year.  A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.</P>
        <P>The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and are currently in the process of informing schools of their annual SNA allocation for the coming school year.</P>
        <P>I understand that the pupil referred to by the Deputy has been included as eligible for SNA support provision for the coming school year.  All mainstream Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model (GAM), introduced in September 2005 to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs.  In addition, schools can apply to the NCSE for additional resource teaching supports for pupils with assessed low incidence special educational needs.</P>
        <P>In relation to applications for individual resource teaching support, Circular 37/2011 provides information to schools regarding the arrangements which are being put in place for the 2011/12 school year.</P>
        <P>The main elements of the arrangements outlined in the Circular are that for the coming 2011/12 school year, an allocation of 90% of valid identified resource teaching allocations will be made to schools, in the first instance, to provide  schools with the majority of their allocation, while also preserving enough  capacity to deal with late applications and ensure that the Department of  Education and Skills can remain within Employment Control Framework  obligations.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) have now notified schools of their allocations for the coming school year. Schools have also been asked to forward as soon as possible any outstanding applications, or additional outstanding materials to support incomplete applications, to the NCSE for consideration, but in any event by no later than 16th September 2011.  Following consideration of all of the applications received, if the level of demand permits, the initial 90% allocation may be revisited and increased.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides for special class and special school placements for students who have special educational needs such that they may need aspecial school/class placement.  Health and Therapy support services are also provided for students in schools in some instances, by the Health Service Executive.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Following are two tables for the information of the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Table No. 1. sets out details in relation to numbers of second level pupils,  places funded by my Department in Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses,  Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS), Youthreach, Senior Traveller  Training Centres and participants in Back to Education Initiative, Adult  Literacy and Community Education in each VEC.</P>
        <P>Table No. 2 sets out details in relation to numbers of Second level schools and further education centres. Details of the number of facilities where literacy, community education and Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) programmes are operated are not available.  While VTOS is offered in PLC centres, in core groups in schools and in stand alone core centres, the tables only show the number of stand alone core centres to avoid double counting.</P>
        <P>The Government decision to reconfigure the VEC sector will not impact on schools and other educational centres managed and operated by the VECs and will not affect teaching or other posts outside of head office functions in the merging VECs.</P>

        <Quest> if he will detail the specific financial savings he has projected for his planned vocational education committee rationalisation; and the way this differs from previous plans. </Quest>

	<P>The new VEC structure fits with the Government&rsquo;s policy of reducing the number of agencies and is consistent with the strategic objectives of the transforming public service agenda through service delivery by a smaller <Col N="665"/>number of agencies, each benefiting from efficiencies of greater scale.  This change will better position the sector for future development and will facilitate the required reductions, under the public service Employment Control Framework, of administrative staff employed in VECs, while protecting the services provided by VECs.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes considered that the number of VECs could be reduced from 33 to 22 and suggested that savings of &euro;3 million could be realised.</P>
        <P>Some of the likely savings from the restructuring of the VECs will come from the sale of existing VEC buildings.  The potential revenue to be raised from the sale of these assets, however, is closely linked to the current state of the property market and it may not be possible to dispose of such properties satisfactorily in the short term.  Savings in administrative staffing costs are linked to natural wastage, the operating of the moratorium on recruitment and redeployment of surplus staff.</P>
        <P>The reconfiguration can, over time, yield savings in the recurrent cost of the headquarter functions of VECs which, at present, is of the order of &euro;40 million in total.  The Government&rsquo;s decision to keep the number of new entities at 16 will assist in meeting the savings projected by the Special Group.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that this decision impacts on the administrative HQ costs of the VECs.  The range of programmes delivered by VECs are not impacted by this decision.</P>
        <P>On entering office, I invited the Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA) to submit alternative rationalisation proposals following their expression of concerns regarding the configuration of the revised entities decided by the previous government.  The IVEA subsequently submitted a proposal that involved a reduction to 20 in the number of VECs.  While I am satisfied that having  regard to cost and critical mass considerations, a reduction to 16 new entities  is appropriate, the new configuration takes account of the IVEA submission to  the greatest extent possible.</P>

        <AskConj><b> </b>asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the outsourcing of administrative tasks by State bodies and agencies to other countries; his further views that this is a counter-productive practice in terms of job creation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Outsourcing &mdash; or the contracting out of services to an external provider &mdash; is a well established business model for the streamlining of functions and services within an organisation.  As the Deputy knows, under this model, those processes that can be performed better or with less cost by an external service provider are identified and competitive tenders are sought for delivering the required services. This principle applies both to the public and the private sector.  The internal market for goods and services within the EU &mdash; and the wider globalised economy &mdash; of course holds open the possibility of goods and services being provided from outside the jurisdiction.  Equally, this presents opportunities for Irish-based companies to provide goods and services to customers abroad, e.g. the Irish Financial Services Centre. </P>
        <P>Within the public sector at present, there are a number of expenditure and strategic reviews under way which are aimed at identifying the core services that each organisation should be delivering and at optimising resources to ensure that these services are delivered with greater efficiency and effectiveness and with a more focused customer orientation. These are designed, in the context of the Croke Park Agreement, to result in a public sector that is optimised for delivery of outcomes and value for money.</P>
        <P>There is no predetermined or ideological position within the Government on outsourcing of functions currently undertaken within the public service.  I would expect that any decision to outsource Government administrative functions would take account of the best economic return to the Exchequer, taking account of a wide range of factors, including the nature of the work being outsourced and the value to be obtained from the competitive tendering competitions for those services.</P>

        <Quest> the steps that have been taken to persuade a company (details supplied) to reverse a recent decision to cut 130 of its Irish workforce and to move the jobs to off-shore locations in Egypt and India; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very concerned about the job losses that have been announced and of the impact that they have had on the workers concerned and their families as well as the communities affected.  </P>
        <P>I understand that Vodafone Ireland, which is not an IDA or EI client, has announced this as a part of a review of its European operations and which will also impact on its operations in other EU Member States.  I am advised, as part of this process, that the company has been in discussions with unions and its Irish Call Centre contract partner, Rigney Dolphin.  I am <Col N="667"/>aware that Vodafone has decided that a portion of the existing contracted call centre operations in Dundalk and Dublin will be moved to other locations &mdash; Egypt and India &mdash; within the Vodafone Group and to other specialist contractors in Ireland.</P>
        <P>This decision will impact 45 Vodafone roles and 139 in Rigney Dolphin &mdash; the 139 staff are employed by Rigney Dolphin but are in-sourced to Vodafone and are based at its sites in Dublin and Dundalk.  I have been assured that Rigney Dolphin will work through the implications of the redundancies with their employees.</P>
        <P>I also understand that all impacted Vodafone employees will be offered the opportunity to transfer to alternative roles within Vodafone Ireland, and voluntary redundancy packages will be offered.  A consultation process is now underway with all Vodafone employees affected by the decision to finalise the alternatives available. The changes to Vodafone Call Centre operations will take place in late 2011 and early 2012.</P>
        <P>My officials and Minister of State Sean Sherlock recently met with Vodafone.  The company explained that in the current market environment, cost efficiencies are a prerequisite so as to ensure their continued ability to compete in the Irish market where they employ over 1,000 people.  In particular, this includes being in a position to make major funding investments in Ireland that will be required in the future to compete in the market. I have also this week met with the Communications Workers Union to discuss their concerns.</P>
        <P>Job creation is central to economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.  The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate both job creation and job retention.  The programmes supported by my Department and its agencies will be critical in achieving economic growth through promoting the export potential of enterprise in Ireland and driving our Smart Economy.</P>

	<P>Since 2009, Central Government Departments have been obliged to pay their suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice. This 15 day prompt payment rule was introduced to Government Departments on an administrative basis only and does not alter the current legal position on late payments as covered by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 388 of 2002). These 2002 Regulations transposed EU Directive 2000/35/EC on Late Payment in Commercial Transactions into Irish law. </P><Col N="668"/>
        <P>Details in relation to the payment performance of Central Departments in respect of suppliers are collated by my Department on the basis of individual quarterly returns submitted by the Departments.

	<P>I am very concerned about the job losses that have been announced and of the impact that they have had on the workers concerned and their families as well as the communities affected.</P>
        <P>I understand that Vodafone Ireland, which is not an IDA or EI client, has announced this as a part of a review of its European operations and which will also impact on its operations in other EU Member States.  I am advised, as part of this process, that the company has been in discussions with unions and its Irish Call Centre contract partner, Rigney Dolphin.  I am aware that Vodafone has decided that a portion of the existing contracted call centre operations in Dundalk and Dublin will be moved to other locations &mdash; Egypt and India &mdash; within the Vodafone Group and to other specialist contractors in Ireland.</P>
        <P>This decision will impact 45 Vodafone roles and 139 in Rigney Dolphin &mdash; the 139 staff are employed by Rigney Dolphin but are in-sourced to Vodafone and are based at its sites in Dublin and Dundalk.  I have been assured that Rigney Dolphin will work through the implications of the redundancies with their employees.</P>
        <P>I also understand that all impacted Vodafone employees will be offered the opportunity to transfer to alternative roles within Vodafone Ireland, and voluntary redundancy packages will be offered.  A consultation process is now underway with all Vodafone employees affected by <Col N="669"/>the decision to finalise the alternatives available. The changes to Vodafone Call Centre operations will take place in late 2011 and early 2012.</P>
        <P>My officials and Minister of State Sean Sherlock recently met with Vodafone.  The company explained that in the current market environment, cost efficiencies are a prerequisite so as to ensure their continued ability to compete in the Irish market where they employ over 1,000 people.  In particular, this includes being in a position to make major funding investments in Ireland that will be required in the future to compete in the market. I have also this week met with the Communications Workers Union to discuss their concerns.</P>
        <P>Job creation is central to economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.  The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate both job creation and job retention.  The programmes supported by my Department and its agencies will be critical in achieving economic growth through promoting the export potential of enterprise in Ireland and driving our Smart Economy.</P>

	<P>The location of IDA&rsquo;s regional offices throughout the country is a day-to-day operational matter for the IDA and I have no function in this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am informed by the IDA that its offices around the country operate on a regional rather than a local basis. I understand that Tallaght is part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s East Region and the regional office is located in Wilton Place, Dublin where Tallaght and its environs are actively marketed as a location for FDI. IDA Ireland has no plans to open an office in Tallaght.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</askee>
        <Quest> the number of allocated grants to date this year by agencies (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>An annual Exchequer allocation is provided each year for the operation of the CEBs. The Exchequer allocation is made in the context of the overall public finances and in 2011 amounts to &euro;27.242m, of which &euro;15m in Capital is available for direct grants and training, mentoring and advice services to micro-enterprise clients.  The bulk of the non-capital allocation to each CEB pays the salaries of the Business Advisors and other staff who provide direct advice and mentoring to client companies. This represents a strong investment in the micro-enterprise sector, notwithstanding the additional level of demand on CEB services generated in the current difficult economic climate. </P>
        <P>The CEB Central Coordination Unit (within Enterprise Ireland) works closely with the CEBs throughout the year reviewing individual expenditures to ensure that the funding allocated to the CEBs is utilised to the maximum extent possible.  It is a matter in the first instance for individual CEBs to determine how they will use allocated funds.  Some Boards may choose to commit all of their available funding as projects present themselves, even if this means that their funding is committed relatively early in the year, while others may choose to reserve some <Col N="670"/>funding until later in the year so that they are in a position to support other high quality projects that emerge at that time.  Should it arise during the year that some Boards are not in a position to spend all of their annual allocation, for example where an approved grant is decommitted late in the year if the project has not started, it is reallocated to any Boards that are in a position to spend additional funds within the year.</P>
        <P>There is undoubtedly a high level of demand on CEBs resources at present and the matter will continue to be monitored by the CEB Central Coordination Unit.  While there are no current plans to provide additional funding to the CEBs this year, the majority are still in a position to approve further grants between now and the end of the year.  In addition, while a high percentage of the total funding has been committed at this stage, approved commitments are not always drawn down by enterprises, for a variety of reasons.  Experience shows that grant decommittals in the second half of a given year usually result in some additional funding, within the overall annual allocation, being made available for further grant allocations.</P>

Given the fact that the United States is our biggest single Merchandise export market, it is very important that regular engagement with that country is maintained to build on this successful position and maintain the momentum there for Irish companies. Accordingly, it is hoped that a Ministerial-led trade mission to the USA will be organised for early Autumn &mdash; this time to some of the South Eastern States, which would include events in Atlanta, Charlotte and New Orleans.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that a commitment was given under the Programme for Government to implement a temporary, partial credit guarantee scheme.  </P>
        <P>As part of the Jobs Initiative announced in this House on 10 May 2011, both the Minister for Finance and I confirmed the Government commitment to initiating a tendering process for the development of a temporary partial credit guarantee scheme.  A call for competition for the design of a scheme was published on e-tenders on 15 June 2011 with a closing date of 7 July 2011.</P>
        <P>The design of the scheme will draw from international experience to support new lending that would not otherwise have been extended by the banks.  In this way, the scheme will be <Col N="672"/>limited in its scope and will complement, rather than be a substitute for, existing lending activities by the main financial institutions.  It will be designed to encourage banks to lend to these new or expanding commercially viable SMEs so that they can grow their company, develop new products or expand into new markets.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment will be for an initial period of one year.  Specific performance criteria will be set down that allow for review and revision of the scheme at the end of that initial period before any commitment to a roll-over of the scheme for subsequent years.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the Scheme will be in place in the autumn.</P>

        <Quest> the reason the back to education allowance is only for those who want to upgrade their skills and not for those who want to retrain for a new industry, currently the allowance is curtailed to those who want to do training at a level higher than what they already have, that is persons with diplomas who want to do a degree; if the scheme will be made available to those who already have a higher qualification in one area but want to train in a different area at a lower level, considering that certain industries such as construction have been extremely badly hit by the recession it makes sense that construction engineers, architects and so on should be allowed to retrain for completely new industries albeit starting at a lower qualification level. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The back to education allowance (BTEA) is one of a range of activation supports and policies with the objective of assisting social welfare recipients to improve their life chances by facilitating access to employment, work experience, education and training.  The focus of BTEA is to assist those who are most marginalised and distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system.  The BTEA scheme can offer participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held. </P>
        <P>A person wishing to pursue BTEA will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others.</P>
        <P>Progression has always been a fundamental condition of BTEA.  State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one.  This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level.</P>
        <P>On May 10th, as part of the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative, 20,900 new and additional places were announced in training, education and work experience programmes.  As part of this Initiative a new fund, entitled Springboard, which is being managed by the Higher Education Authority (HEA), will provide education and training opportunities to support unemployed people. The primary objective of Springboard is to help unemployed people to remain as close as possible to the labour market by accessing part-time flexible higher education and training opportunities to upskill or reskill in areas where sustainable employment opportunities may arise as the economy recovers.  The target group for this programme include unemployed people, including those in circumstances outlined in the question, with a previous history of employment who already hold a higher level qualification at NFQ Levels 6 to 9, who may also require additional upskilling or reskilling in order to re-enter employment.  Included in this initiative will be part-time Masters courses and, via the part-time education option, unemployed people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments will be facilitated in retaining these, subject to continuing entitlement, within the broader back-to-education framework.</P>
        <P>The BTEA, in conjunction with other employment support schemes, was considered under the Programme for Government 2011-2016 and will be monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  The role of money advisors is to help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors.</P>
        <P>There are 52 independent MABS companies operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country, with national support provided by the MABS NDL.  In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at <i>www.mabs.ie</i>.  Some 90% of clients presenting to MABS are assisted through the telephone helpline, which provides assisted self-help to ensure clients take steps to assess and address their situation.</P>
        <P>The Citizens Information Board (CIB), who has responsibility for MABS, compiles information on the waiting times in each MABS office on a quarterly basis and posts it to the <i>www.mabs.ie</i>  website.  The most recent statistics available record that the average waiting time from first point of contact to first appointment with a money advisor is some 6 weeks.  This is the average nationally and there are fluctuations between offices.</P>
        <P>The focus of MABS is in ensuring clients get the level of support they need and as such client assessments and effective case management are important components of the overall approach.  During the waiting period, clients are assessed and those in need of immediate assistance are given a priority appointment, others are provided with assisted self-help to ensure <Col N="675"/>that they have taken steps to assess their situation and if appropriate they are supported to take holding action with their creditors.</P>
        <P>Since April, the CIB have put a new organisational structure in place, which enables CIB regional managers to get a greater insight into the nature of supports required by MABS companies on the ground to deliver an effective service.  In addition the CIB is currently looking at the processes being used by MABS companies with a view to a consistent approach being taken to managing waiting times, taking account of service capacity across the network of companies.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to expand MABS to deal with wating times.  I am satisfied that the changes being implemented by CIB will ensure that customers requiring assistance will receive the supports they require in a timely and effective manner.</P>

	<P>The provision to remain in employment beyond the maximum retirement age was one of the new superannuation and retirement provisions introduced under the Public Service Superannuation Act 2004, and applies only to new civil servants appointed on or after 1st April 2004.  This does not apply to staff appointed prior to 1st April 2004.  The officer in question was appointed to the Civil Service on 1st March 2004.</P>
        <P>The only basis on which this officer could be retained beyond age 65 is on hardship grounds.  Under the Department of Finance Circular 13/75 &ldquo;Retention of Civil Servants beyond the normal retirement age&rdquo;, hardship is deemed to exist where the officer&rsquo;s potential income from all sources at retirement age falls below  the limits as set out under the terms of the Department of Finance Circular 2/2008.</P>
        <P>The officer&rsquo;s potential income was examined (civil service occupational pension, State pension (transition) and spouse&rsquo;s income) and it was found that his income including the spouse&rsquo;s <Col N="677"/>income does not fall below the specified limits.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 322, 368 and 380 together.</P>
        <P>Creating jobs and tackling poverty are two of the key challenges that we face.  It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these issues and ensure that work is worthwhile.  To this end, I recently set up an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare. The first meeting of the Group, which is chaired by Ita Mangan, Barrister, took place on 30 June. While the Programme for Government proposes to establish a commission on taxation and social welfare, it was considered that the term &lsquo;advisory group&rsquo; better reflects the purpose and working methods of the group than the term &lsquo;commission&rsquo;.  Given that the Advisory Group is not a statutory body, no legislation was required to establish it.</P>
        <P>The main rationale for setting up the group is to harness expert opinion and experience to address a number of specific issues around the operation and interaction of the tax and social protection systems. The Group will also be tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes, and with identifying the specific practical institutional and administrative improvements to their operation.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 323 and 327 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware there are several commitments contained in the Programme for Government in relation to the rent supplement scheme including removing barriers to employment.</P>
        <P>The most appropriate way for this to happen is for local authorities to take over responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of these individuals. In this regard the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning on the 16th June 2011 announced a new housing policy framework statement reflecting the content of the Programme for Government (Government for National Recovery 2011 &mdash; 2016) and setting out the principles to underpin the development of housing policy into the medium term.  This policy framework statement contained an announcement in relation to the transfer of responsibility for providing for the housing needs of long term rent supplement recipients to housing authorities on a phased basis.</P>
        <P>This transfer of tenants from rent supplement to the local authorities will help achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and return rent supplement to its original intention of a short&mdash;term income support payment. Officials are currently considering what legislative changes, if any, will be needed to bring about this change.</P>
        <P>Removing the 30 hour rule for the rent and mortgage interest supplement schemes would require a change to legislation.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the social protection system with a view to identifying and eliminating poverty traps including activating people on a reduced week who refuse extra day(s) employment.</P>
        <P>A fundamental qualifying condition for both the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.</P>
        <P>To satisfy this condition, it is necessary for the person to demonstrate that he or she has taken some positive action and is making genuine efforts to secure employment. If a person fails to satisfy this condition his/her claim will be disallowed. In addition, an unreasonable refusal to accept an offer of suitable employment may also lead to a disallowance.</P>
        <P>A key objective of the Government is to offer a high level of appropriate employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment.  This will be achieved <Col N="680"/>through the use of proactive activation approaches and modern case management systems. As one pillar of this overall approach, reduced rates for failure to co-operate with the activation process<b> </b>were provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2010.  Such measures will encourage jobseekers to improve their skills, in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed, and help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis. The intent of the reduced rates, commenced in April, is to ensure compliance with the activation processes.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the programme for Government I recently set up an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare. The first meeting of the Group, which is chaired by Ita Mangan, Barrister, took place on 30 June. While the programme for Government proposes to establish a commission on taxation and social welfare, it was considered that the term &lsquo;advisory group&rsquo; better reflects the purpose and working methods of the group than the term &lsquo;commission&rsquo;. Given that the Advisory Group is not a statutory body; no legislation was required to establish it.</P>
        <P>The main rationale for setting up the group is to harness expert opinion and experience to address a number of specific issues around the operation and interaction of the tax and social protection systems. The Group will also be tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes, and with identifying the specific practical institutional and administrative improvements to their operation. While the terms of reference include a number of specific issues, including social insurance cover for self-employed persons, the Group will initially prioritise the area of family and child income supports.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the Group&rsquo;s work programme will be based, where possible, on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified above in line with a timetable agreed by myself, in consultation with the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget/estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support.</P>

	<P>Any such change would require legislation. The proposal for ending the contingency of lone parenthood and introducing a parental allowance to replace the OFP was contained in the Government Discussion Paper, <i>&ldquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents&rdquo;</i>, which was published in 2006.  It was envisaged that this allowance would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner) with young children on a low income.  It was proposed that payments would be individualised, with no limitation &mdash; therefore, the family would receive two full payments where the household means test was met.  This would reduce but not eliminate the disincentive to forming relationships or declaring same.   The recommendation to replace the OFP with a parental allowance has not been implemented due, in part, to the current economic climate.  Such a move would have involved significant costs as the rate of payment for a couple would have been equivalent to two single rates of payment.  </P>

        <P>From 1 January 2011 policy and funding responsibility for F&Aacute;S functions in relation to employment and community services was transferred to the Department in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010. This is a transitional arrangement only.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010 provides for the transfer of all employment and community services including staff and other resources from F&Aacute;S to the Department.  The relevant provisions will be subject to a Commencement Order as it is envisaged that any further legislation will be required, however the details of the service model for the National Employment and Entitlements Service are being developed, any further necessary legislative provisions relating to its establishment will be put in place.</P>

	<P>Since the commitment to which the Deputy refers was made, the Department has made 9 additional appointments to the Social Welfare Appeals Office from within its own resources.  These assignments augment the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers serving in the office to 29.   In addition, since July 2010, 8 retired Appeals Officers, equating to 3 further full-time officers, have been assisting on a strictly part-time basis with the backlogs of appeals and it is intended that they will be employed until the end of the year. </P>
        <P>The need for further resources, if any, will be kept under continuous review in the light of the extent to which the backlog is reduced over the coming months.</P>
        <P>Later this year the Community Welfare Service will be merging with the Department of Social Protection.  In that regard, the Community Welfare Service appeals system and the Social Welfare Appeals Office will be consolidated into a single appeals service once the formal transfer takes place.  Enabling legislation to provide for this is contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2008.</P>

	<P>As part of its agreed programme, the Government is committed to raising the issue of payment of Child Benefit in respect of non-resident children at EU level, and to seek to have the entitlement modified to reflect the cost of living where a child is resident. </P>
        <P>The provisions relating to the payment of child benefit for non-resident children are not part of Irish domestic legislation but are a feature of EU regulations governing the co-ordination of social security systems.  Accordingly, any change to the system will require a change in EU regulations.  Only the EU Commission, and not individual Member States, can propose new legislation.  At Council level, the Regulation would require a qualified majority of Member States and it would also require the agreement of the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>I raised the possibility of a change to the EU regulations informally with EU Commissioner Andor on his recent visit to Dublin, and it is clear from that meeting that it will be difficult to persuade the Commission to propose the necessary legislation.  However, I am continuing to raise the issue with appropriate Ministers from other EU countries.</P>

Humanitarian Aid payments were made, both in the immediate aftermath of the flooding and subsequently to enable eligible households to resume living at their home.

Discussions took place with representatives of the insurance industry regarding giving households access to appropriate house insurance at a reasonable cost.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case.</P>
        <P>There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.</P>
        <P>While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person&rsquo;s oral hearing will be heard, but s/he will be informed when arrangements have been made.</P>
        <P>The overall average waiting time for an appeal dealt with by way of a summary decision in 2010 was 27.4 weeks, while the average time to process an oral hearing was 45.6 weeks.  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.</P>
        <P>In an effort to reduce these processing times, the Department has made 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.  These assignments will augment the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers serving in the office to 29.   In addition, since July 2010, 8 retired Appeals Officers, equating to a further 3 full-time officers, <Col N="685"/>have been assisting on a strictly part-time basis with the backlogs of appeals and it is intended that they will be employed until the end of the year.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Chief Appeals Officer that some 3,000 cases, registered prior to 31/12/10, have been ring fenced and a team of 10 of the Office&rsquo;s most experienced Appeals Officers have been freed from all other work in the Office and will concentrate on clearing this backlog.   This project commenced on July 1st.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

	<P>T&uacute;s is a community work placement initiative which will provide up to 5,000 short-term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  Some &euro;30 million has been provided in the Department&rsquo;s Estimates in 2011 to fund the roll-out of the initiative.  This initiative is being delivered through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas.  </P>
        <P>South West Mayo Development Company has been allocated 60 participant and three supervisory positions.  The recruitment to two supervisory positions has been completed and staff members are currently in place.  The random selection of eligible participants is currently underway and the first 40 participants are expected to begin work within the next three weeks.  With respect to work placements, South West Mayo Development has conducted an extensive programme of advertising and community information.  The company is currently identifying and profiling suitable work opportunities for T&uacute;s participants.  Applications for work at the sites detailed by the Deputy are being considered by the company and the heritage services of Mayo County Council.  The Deputy may wish to note that both sites are currently in receipt of services from the Rural Social Scheme.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that a disability allowance appeal, by the person concerned, was registered in that office on 26 January 2011.  It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  These papers were received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 21 March 2011 and the appeal will, in due course, be referred to an Appeals Officer who will decide whether the case can be decided on a summary basis or whether to list it for oral hearing.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware the Government has provided various types of support to people affected by the November 2009 flooding. Humanitarian Aid payments were made, both in the immediate aftermath of the flooding and subsequently to enable eligible households to resume living at their home. Flood relief works were also undertaken in some of the affected areas and other works are at an advanced state of preparation. Discussions took place with representatives of the insurance industry regarding giving households access to appropriate house insurance at a reasonable cost.</P>
        <P>Subject to certain conditions the Government also decided to provide support to a small number of families who are continuing to experience significant housing problems as a result of the November 2009 flooding and are considering the possibility of relocating rather than resuming living at their original home.</P>
        <P>The household in question and all of the other households have been visited by officials from the Department and reports of their individual circumstances have been completed. The Department is also in discussions with the Office of Public Works in relation to any remedial works it is undertaking in the areas in question and the impact these works will have in the <Col N="687"/>event of any future flooding. The Department expects to be in a position to make a decision on these cases in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who <Col N="691"/>proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case.   There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.  In the context of dealing with the considerable number of appeals now on hand, the Department has made a further 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.  </P>
        <P>While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person&rsquo;s oral hearing will be heard, but s/he will be informed when arrangements have been made.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

	<P>Access to civil registration records is governed by section 61 of the Civil Registration Act 2004. Section 61 provides that a person, following an application in writing to an tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir (Registrar General), a Superintendent Registrar, a registrar or an authorised officer, and on payment of the prescribed fee, may search an index to a register of births, marriages and deaths, and on payment of the prescribed fee obtain a certified copy, a certified extract or a photocopy of a specified entry. The General Register Office maintains a dedicated research facility in central Dublin where members of the public may search manual indexes to the registers and obtain copies of entries in the registers.</P>
        <P>Options are being considered as to how the service might be developed in the future, but it is too early at this stage to say what measures might eventually be taken. Any proposed measures which are outside the scope of the Civil Registration Act 2004 will require legislative change. In addition, developments will be dependent on the availability of staffing, ICT and financial resources. It is important to bear in mind that any proposals to extend access to registration data to members of the public will involve data protection and privacy consider<Col N="692"/>ations, as a large number of records contain sensitive information where, for example, register entries have been amended.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is payable to people who are unable to meet the cost of renting private accommodation and is intended as a short-term support. Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the state.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that the person concerned has been awarded rent supplement as an exceptional measure until 31 August 2011 in respect of accommodation which is in excess of the rent limit for his family size. The HSE further advised that the person concerned has been requested to use this period to secure accommodation that is more appropriate to his needs and where the rent charged is not more than &euro;550 per month.</P>

	<P>I am committed to combating fraud and abuse of the social welfare system, and in this regard, I attended the meeting of the joint high level group of the Department and the Revenue Commissioners in May last.  The purpose of the group is to ensure and enhance ongoing collaboration and interaction between the organisations, including in relation to social welfare fraud and tax non-compliance. </P>
        <P>Both organisations have highlighted the importance of a focused multi-agency approach to dealing with the hidden economy.  In this context, the risk inherent in hidden economy activity <Col N="693"/>has been identified by both the Department and Revenue as being a key corporate priority to be tackled in 2011 and plans have been devised to combat both tax non-compliance and social welfare fraud.</P>
        <P>Both organisations work together to combat fraud by using a combination of risk analysis, intelligence collation, assurance checks and outdoor operations including audit and investigation. For certain types of businesses, specific sectoral approaches have been devised.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit conducts a wide range of control activities and projects to investigate social welfare fraud and abuse, some of which are carried out jointly with the Revenue Commissioner and with the National Employment and Rights Authority.  This Unit also participates in multi-agency vehicle checkpoints with other agencies, including the Garda&iacute;, Traffic Corps and the Taxi Regulator.  This year, the Unit&rsquo;s focus will include the hidden economy, cases of concurrent working and claiming, multiple claiming and personation cases.</P>
        <P>I am committed to putting in place a strategic fraud and control plan to ensure a targeted response to high risk sectors and to ensure an integrated approach to the prevention, deterrence and detection of social welfare abuse across the Department&rsquo;s services.</P>

	<P>The volume of applications for refunds of PRSI has increased significantly in recent years rising from 9,000 applications in 2007 to 23,000 applications in 2010.  This has inevitably given rise to delays in processing applications.  </P>
        <P>In order to speed up the processing of claims for PRSI refunds, the Department has reviewed the relevant processes and procedures and appropriate changes have been implemented.

Accordingly, her invalidity pension payment was terminated from the 5th November 2009.</P>
        <P>The claimant appealed this decision and was referred for a second examination, which was carried out by a different medical assessor.  The opinion of the second medical assessor also was that the claimant did not satisfy the medical criteria.</P>
        <P>Following this medical examination and having considered all the evidence, the appeals officer disallowed the appeal for the person concerned. The customer was notified of this decision and the reason for it in writing on the 26th October 2010.   The decision of an appeals officer is final and conclusive in the absence of fresh facts or evidence.</P>
        <P>The person concerned subsequently submitted further medical evidence which was referred to a medical assessor. The opinion of this medical assessor was also that the further medical evidence provided did not satisfy the medical criteria for Invalidity Pension. All medical evidence submitted by the person concerned has been referred to a medical assessor for their opinion and has been examined sufficiently.</P>

	<P>My Department has provided funding under the local authority conservation grants scheme to provide assistance for the conservation of buildings protected under the provisions of Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  This scheme has been administered by the local authorities.  My Department has also administered a Civic Structures Conservation Grants Scheme to assist with the conservation of structures in civic or public ownership and, generally, open to the public. Due to the significant reduction for 2011 in the budgetary allocation to the built heritage within the Vote of my Department, the operation of both grant schemes has been suspended.</P>
        <P>Limited funding of &euro;650,000 is being provided through a &ldquo;Structures at Risk Fund&rdquo; in 2011 to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2010.

The average grant offered was &euro;21,386. No application was received in respect of the project referred to by the Deputy for funding under the Structures at Risk Fund.</P><Col N="701"/>

The international acclaim for institutions such as the Science Gallery in Trinity College Dublin demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s potential as a leader in the field of art, science and technology convergence.  A range of players, including my Department and the Arts Council, have been coordinating with the organisers of the event, including the Government&rsquo;s Chief Scientific Adviser, the Royal Irish Academy and others, to develop plans for cultural events to tie in specifically with the week of the ESOF conference, and more generally through the year.  A call for proposals for public engagement projects, including cultural projects, has just been completed by Dublin City of Science, and the relevant cultural projects to be selected as part of this scheme will also form an important part of the artistic and cultural programme to mark the year.</P>

	<P>Plans for the 2011 culture night are well under way and discussions are also ongoing as to the most appropriate way to build on its success and popularity for the future.  These discussions include the feasibility of making Culture Night a twice yearly event as proposed in the Programme for Government.  The Deputy will appreciate that these discussions must have regard to the resources available to my Department and to the many competing demands on these resources.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival is currently the primary cultural festival during the Spring and there may be scope for the development of an audience-focused cultural initiative as part of these festivities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The Programme for Government commits to the establishment of a New Economy and Recovery Authority (NewERA).  I have been given special responsibility for the NewERA project.  NewERA will be established as a dedicated entity to oversee investment as referred to below.  It is proposed that streamlined and restructured semi-States will make significant additional investments, over and above current plans, over the next four years in &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; infrastructures in energy, broadband, forestry and water.</P>
        <P>Proposals are being developed for the Government&rsquo;s consideration on the formal establishment of the NewERA.  Intensive cross-Departmental engagement is under way on developing the optimum structure for the Authority.  An initial presentation in the matter has been made to the Taoiseach and to Ministers, and urgent follow-up of work on the structure and scope of the entity is being processed.</P>
        <P>I am committed to ensuring that speedy progress is made in establishing the NewERA Authority.  As stated above, one of the key objectives of NewERA is the leveraging of additional investment and employment from streamlined and restructured Commercial State Bodies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has made clear its intention to ensure that State Companies play a full role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  The Energy State Companies are already engaged in significant programmes of infrastructure investment.  We must ensure that all the investment programmes of the State Companies are cost effective, strategic and subject to rigorous shareholder scrutiny and where appropriate regulatory oversight.  NewERA will have a key role to play in this regard on behalf of the Government&rsquo;s shareholder interests in the State Companies.</P>
        <P>NewERA also commits the Government to co-invest with the Private Sector in the rollout of high speed broadband throughout the country.  The first meeting of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, attended by myself and Minister Rabbitte, and by all the CEOs of the leading telecommunications companies in Ireland was held on Monday 13th  June last.  This forum will intensively consider all elements that impact on the rollout of high speed broadband and will assist in informing the strategy to implement the NewERA commitment on broadband.</P>
        <P>I am confident that concrete progress will emerge over the coming weeks, which will allow for the formal establishment shortly of a core NewERA structure with all the necessary expertise to progress the NewERA objectives and with the flexibility to develop and deepen the role over time.</P>

The Chief Executive of Bord na M&oacute;na has written to the Chairman of Bord na M&oacute;na, voluntarily waiving any performance related pay for the year 2010/2011.  The CEO of Bord na M&oacute;na received a Performance Related Award of &euro;70,000 in 2009.</P>
        <P>The Chairman of An Post has confirmed that the Chief Executive of An Post has voluntarily waived his right to payment under the Performance Related Incentive Payment Scheme since 2008.</P>

        <P>The operation of the fishery in question is governed by the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations (No. 2) of 2010 and the Conservation of Salmon and Sea Trout (Draft Nets and Snap Nets) Bye Law No. 882, 2011.  I understand that the only licensed fishing engine for commercial salmon fishing for the Ballyshannon District (the River Eany/Inver Bay) is a draft net.</P>
        <P>The fishery in Inver Bay harvests fish stocks from the River Eany.  According to the scientific advice, its Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is limited to 194 fish in 2011, reflecting the deteriorating performance of the river&rsquo;s stock since 2007 when the TAC was 950 fish.</P>

	<P>The Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 require that with effect from 7 June 2011 all bituminous coal placed on the market for residential use must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%.  This has the effect of placing the main provision of the existing Voluntary Agreement between my Department and the Solid Fuel Trade Group (SFTG), representing the majority of major coal importers, on a statutory footing.  The new Regulations will consolidate the environmental benefits achieved by the Voluntary Agreement, which has been in place since 2002.</P>
        <P>To support local authority enforcement, the Regulations also require coal bagging operators and suppliers to register with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Persons or bodies placing coal on the market are required to hold records which certify that their product complies with the 0.7% sulphur standard.  All bags of coal placed on sale must be sealed.</P>
        <P>Compliance with the 0.7% sulphur standard will be demonstrated through an auditing and certification system, which was developed in consultation with key stakeholders and which will be overseen by the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that the enforcement of the Regulations will be further supported by increases in penalties under the Air Pollution Act 1987 that are being introduced by the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The primary environmental objective of the new Regulations is to maintain good air quality standards in order to protect human health from noxious emissions to air which result from the use of bituminous coal in residential dwellings.  The Regulations were also developed to facilitate the application of the carbon tax to coal used in residential dwellings.  This is subject to a commencement order by the Minister for Finance to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large scale sourcing of more polluting high sulphur coal from Northern Ireland.  This robust mechanism is now in place.</P>
        <P>The development of the renewable energy sector is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>

Work on the drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill to further improve the foreshore consent process is also progressing.  It is intended that the Bill will,<i> inter alia,</i>  integrate the foreshore consent process for major infrastructure projects within the strategic consent process operated by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, while the foreshore consent process for non-strategic infrastructure projects will be integrated within the wider planning consent process operated by the local authorities.</P>
        <P>31 foreshores leases/licence applications were approved in 2010 following the transfer of functions into my Department with a further 31 applications decided to date in 2011; 30 leases/ licences have been executed.</P>
        <P>27 foreshore lease/licence applications were received by my Department in 2010 with a further 31 received to date in 2011.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the scheme of priorities for foreshore applications developed by my Department, all applications for a foreshore licence for sewerage schemes have been given a priority 1 status and are being progressed through the foreshore consent process on this basis.</P>

	<P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented residential sector. My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 with a specific emphasis on whether the Act best supports the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions <Col N="713"/>and on whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.  The outcomes of the review were announced by my predecessor as Minister of State and, in April 2010, the Government approved the preparation of the Heads of a Bill to deliver on the review&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>The incorrect retention of deposits by landlords was identified in that review process as one of a range of issues that merited specific attention. I am at present evaluating the review recommendations and associated legislative proposals and I intend to submit proposals in that regard to Government in the near future.</P>
        <P>I have already met with the PRTB which has engaged in some research as to the viability of a separate deposit retention scheme pursuant to its function, under section 151(1) of the Act, to provide advice to the Minister concerning policy in relation to the private rented sector.  On foot of that meeting, I have asked the PRTB to carry out further research on how best to address the issue of deposit retention and this research will further inform my thinking on this matter.</P>

	<P>My Department continues to work closely with Dundalk Town Council in progressing a number of improvement works and regeneration projects across the town council area. My Department made the following allocations in respect of these projects this year:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Cox&rsquo;s Demesne Regeneration &mdash; &euro;500,000</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Muirhevnamor Remedial and Energy Efficiency Works &mdash; &euro;600,000</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the case of Cox&rsquo;s Demesne, the funding will be used to support the completion of the master-planning process and to provide continued support for social inclusion and environmental works, e.g. provision of a community warden, and improvements to public lighting among others. It will also provide for the commencement of works on an energy efficiency pilot project in the Aisling Park area.  This pilot project, which is being undertaken in partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the ESB, will see energy efficiency improvement <Col N="714"/>works delivered to 126 houses in the area this year.  The master plan, once completed, will set out a roadmap for subsequent phases of the regeneration, detailing the actions needed to achieve the social, economic, and physical regeneration of the area.  It is expected that this plan will be completed later this year.</P>
        <P>In the case of Muirhevnamor, my Department is currently working with the Council on two separate projects, an energy efficiency improvement works project and a remedial works project.  The energy efficiency project, which commenced last year, has resulted in the improvement of some 150 houses in the estate with works to a further 30 houses under way.  A revised submission in respect of the planning stage of the remedial works project was received in my Department in May and is currently being assessed.</P>

        <P>My Department indicated that alternatives to the full integration of CDPs with their respective Local Development Companies under the LCDP would be considered if such alternatives met a range of criteria, including reduced structures, better integrated delivery of services, and achievement of administrative efficiencies.</P>
        <P>In this context, my Department has agreed two new LCDP delivery models for the offshore Islands; one for the Galway/Mayo Islands and another for the Islands off the coast of Cork.  I understand that the relevant CDPs are in the process of merging to form two new companies (in place of the former five separate companies), which will deliver LCDP activities on the basis of Service Level Agreements with Comhar na nOile&aacute;n Teo.</P>

        <P>It is a matter for Dublin City Council, within their capital allocation, to determine their improvements works programme.

	<P>The Sustainable Communities Fund (SCF) provides revenue funding to local authorities for initiatives focused on estate renewal and regeneration, as well as for initiatives that contribute to the development and support of sustainable communities.  Funding for a 3-year period was approved for the projects in question under the first call for proposals under the SCF in 2007, and was recouped to Sligo Borough Council over the period 2008 to 2010.  In February 2011, local authorities were invited to submit project proposals for improvements to their social housing stock and for a further tranche of funding under the SCF.  No application was received from the Borough Council for additional SCF funding for these projects.

The Section also places a duty on people on such premises to conduct themselves in such as way as to ensure that, as far as reasonably practicable, other people on the premises are not exposed to danger from fire as a consequence of any act or omission of theirs.  Section 22 of the Act empowers fire authorities to inspect any land or building, including apartment buildings, for the purpose of the Act, including enforcement of fire safety matters.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform introduced the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011.  Under Section 3 of the Act, it is a condition of sale of an apartment in a Multi-Unit Development that a certificate be furnished from a suitably qualified person confirming that the relevant parts of the multi-unit development have been constructed in compliance with the fire safety certificate issued pursuant to Building Control legislation.</P>
        <P>I do not have plans to introduce additional legislation in relation to fire safety in apartment buildings.</P>

	<P>It is open to any person or household to apply to a housing authority for an assessment of their housing need.  It is a matter solely for the housing authority concerned to determine whether an applicant for social housing support is eligible for and in need of that support in accordance with the provisions of section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, regulations made under that section, and having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.</P>
        <P>The allocation of social housing support is a matter for the housing authority concerned in accordance with an allocation scheme made by the authority under section 22 of the 2009 Act.  Section 22 allows a housing authority to include in its allocation scheme a provision to set aside a proportion of dwellings for allocation to particular groups based on a particular identified housing need in the authority&rsquo;s functional area.  It is a matter for the housing authority, however, to determine whether such a provision is required and which household groups e.g. persons with a disability, older persons, single adult households, should be targeted.</P>

	<P>Provision was made in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 to allow purchasers under the new Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements to re-mortgage or top-up their mortgage without triggering the clawback.  However, the Act does not provide this facility for purchasers under existing affordable housing or shared ownership arrangements.

	<P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented residential sector.  My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 with a specific emphasis on whether the Act best supports the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions and on whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.  The outcomes of the review were announced by my predecessor as Minister of State and, in April 2010, the Government approved the preparation of the Heads of a Bill to deliver on the review&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>I am at present evaluating the review recommendations, details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>, and associated legislative proposals and I intend to submit proposals in that regard to Government in the near future.</P>

The Government recently approved the urgent drafting of a Bill to provide for the establishment of a new system for inspecting and monitoring of the performance of septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems.  The Bill will be published as soon as possible and my intention will be to pursue its early enactment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In so far as support for the upgrading of septic tanks is concerned, the introduction of a grants scheme for any purpose must be managed within current budgetary constraints.

	<P>My Department has allocated some &euro;78 million in 2011 to local authorities for the maintenance and improvement of their stock, and these improvement works programmes include remedial action necessary to convert bed-sits.  It is a matter for Dublin City Council and other authorities, within their own improvement works allocation, to determine their improvements works programme including any remedial works to convert bed-sits.</P>
        <P>My Department received a proposal under the Capital Assistance Scheme in October 2008 with regard to a proposed development at Ballygall Road East, for which the Department had a number of design and cost queries, and approval was not provided to proceed with this proposal at that time.  In the current economic climate Dublin City Council decided that alternative means to upgrade the development be explored, and it is my understanding that Dublin City Council is currently in discussions with a voluntary housing body with a view to refurbishing the complex, and will submit details to my Department shortly.</P><Col N="725"/>
        <P>I understand that proposals for a project at Mellowes Court are at a very early stage in Dublin City Council, and my Department has yet to receive any proposal for such works from the Council.</P>

        <P>Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which provides for the allocation of dwellings by a housing authority, was commenced in June 2010 and replaces the previous requirements which had governed the making of local authority allocation schemes (or schemes of letting priorities).  Allocation schemes made by housing authorities under section 22 do not require Ministerial approval.  The housing authority must submit a draft of the scheme to the Minister, who retains the power to direct the authority to change the scheme if it contains anything contrary to Government policy, but assuming no such direction issues, the authority can proceed to have the scheme adopted by the Council.</P>

	<P>On 16 June I launched the Government&rsquo;s new housing policy statement which will serve as a framework for a sequence of legislative and policy initiatives in the short to medium term.  Based on a number of fundamental principles and goals that will form the foundation of a substantial reform programme, the new framework for housing policy responds to current and emerging conditions in the housing sector, taking account of the dramatic cycle of rapid growth and sudden collapse in the residential property market.</P>
        <P>In terms of the delivery of social housing, the policy statement clearly identifies that the main focus in terms of supports provided by Government will be on meeting the most acute needs &mdash; the housing support needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from own resources.</P>
        <P>The financial parameters which will apply over the coming years rule out a return to very large capital funded construction programmes by local authorities.<b><i> </i></b> Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as RAS and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.</P>
        <P>As part of the process of improving the regulatory framework within which approved housing bodies operate, thereby facilitating such bodies&rsquo; access to loan financing options, I am considering making amendments to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992.  Such amendments would relate to the methodology by which bodies are designated as approved housing bodies and to the process by which guidelines might be issued to such bodies.</P>

	<P>On 9 June 2011, I published the Final Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments, entitled Resolving Ireland&rsquo;s Unfinished Housing Developments, together with my Department&rsquo;s response to the recommendations.   Both reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website &mdash; <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The main recommendations of the Advisory Group were in respect of:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />driving a more co-ordinated and partnership approach between stakeholders;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />tackling public safety as an immediate priority;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />strengthening the legislative and policy framework to incentivise real engagement by developers, site owners and funders in working with local authorities and residents in resolving unfinished housing developments; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />building confidence in the housing sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In my Department&rsquo;s policy response, I have outlined a range of actions to address these objectives, including the urgent resolution of public safety and other critical issues seriously impacting on the living conditions and quality of life for residents of unfinished developments; the development of formal liaison protocols between the various stakeholders &mdash; developers, financial institutions, residents, local authorities,  approved housing bodies and my Department &mdash; to facilitate the sharing of information; and the prioritisation by local authorities of a number of unfinished developments to act as lead projects to demonstrate what can be achieved, building on the best practice Guidance Manual on Managing and Resolving Unfinished Housing Developments, which will be published shortly.</P>
        <P>On 28 June, I chaired the first meeting of the National Co-ordination Committee which I have established to oversee implementation of the Advisory Group Report and the Government&rsquo;s response.  The National Asset Management Agency is among the key stakeholders participating on the Committee which also includes representatives from my Department, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, financial institutions and the construction sector. The Committee will be meeting on an ongoing regular basis to oversee implementation with the aim of publishing a report on progress achieved within the next 12 months.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to note that progress is already being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.  To date, I have made allocations totalling some &euro;1.3 million to fifteen local authorities from the &euro;5 million funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues.  The reduction in drawdown from this fund from previous provisional allocations reflects the fact that planning authorities are already making progress in securing the co-operation of developers, financial institutions and/or bond holders, thereby obviating the need to use Exchequer resources to fund such work.  The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting, and other works to secure sites.  I will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed by my Department.</P>

The requirements for obtaining Irish citizenship are clearly set out in that reply and as the Deputy will appreciate, in the absence of <Col N="731"/>an application for naturalisation to my Department, it would not be possible to determine if the person in question meets the criteria for the granting of citizenship.</P>
        <P><i>Reply to Parliamentary Question 145 of 20 May 2010</i></P>
        <P>Section 6A of the Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004 provides that a person born in the island of Ireland shall not be entitled to be an Irish citizen unless a parent of that person has, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person&rsquo;s birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years.  The section does not apply to certain persons including those born to parents one of whom is at the time of the persons birth an Irish citizen, British citizen or a person entitled to reside without restriction. For the purpose of calculating reckonable residence under section 6A certain residence is excluded from consideration including unlawful residence, residence covered by a permission granted under Section 4 of the Immigration Act, 2004 for the purpose of study and residence covered by a provisional permission granted pending  determination of an asylum application. Upon application for a passport, the Passport Office of the Department of Foreign Affairs assesses the child&rsquo;s entitlement to citizenship based upon the parent&rsquo;s reckonable residency. If the parents do not have sufficient residency the child does not have an entitlement to citizenship. It remains open to the parent of the child to make an application for a certificate of naturalisation on their behalf under section 15 of the 1956 Act, when the child has 5 years reckonable residency in the State.</P>

        <P>In that context,  I can inform the Deputy that I recently announced a series of measures within my Department to provide for speedier processing of citizenship applications to bring about a substantial reduction in the processing timescale. The new arrangements include improved application forms that came into force on Friday, 24th June 2011, and are currently available online with an associated online residence checker, streamlined and accelerated procedures for certain types of application and plans to recruit interns under the new Internship Programme. These measures are targeted at clearing the backlog of applications awaiting a decision in excess of six months by spring of next year and from that time on the aim is, save in exceptional circumstances, that persons applying for citizenship will be given a decision on their application within six months.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply below to Parliamentary Question No. 164 of 16 June, 2011. The position is unchanged since then.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><i>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person referred to by the Deputy has no application pending for residency. The person concerned is the subject of a  Deportation Order, signed on 10 September 2009, following a comprehensive and thorough examination of his asylum claim, and a detailed examination of the representations he submitted for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). He has been evading his deportation since 6 October 2009 and should he come to the notice of the Garda <Col N="737"/>authorities, he would be liable to arrest and detention. He should, therefore, present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau without any further delay.</i></P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that the applicant &lsquo;<i>. . . has never been served with a deportation order and is not aware of its existence</i>&rsquo;,  the Deportation Order was sent on 16 September, 2009 by registered post to the applicant&rsquo;s last notified address and copied to his legal representatives. In representations submitted by the applicant under cover of a letter from his legal representatives dated 4 August 2009, the applicant provided the address which the Deportation Order was sent to just over one month later on 16 September 2009 and is the same address referred to by the Deputy in his question.</P>
        <P>The registered post was returned to the Department. The reason for non delivery was that &lsquo;the applicant was unknown at the address&rsquo;. It is the responsibility of the individual concerned to notify me of any change of address. The Deportation Order was sent by registered post to the applicant at the address which he had notified my Department of just over one month previously and copied to his legal representative and therefore the Deportation Order was served on him. It requires him to remove himself from the State or else present himself without further delay to the Garda National Immigration Bureau to arrange for his deportation.</P>
        <P>I should<b> </b>remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

	<P>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service that the person referred to by the Deputy has no application for a visa to remain in the state, as no such visa exists.  The person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order signed on the 8 March, 2011, notified to him by registered post on 16 March 2011 and copied to his legal representative on the same date. As a result of this, he is not eligible to apply for any type of Irish visa and is instead required to remove himself from the State and remain thereafter outside the State. If he fails to remove himself from the State, he should contact the Garda National Immigration Bureau without further delay to arrange his deportation.</P>
        <P>I should<b> </b>remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the person concerned was granted permission to remain in the State on 17 November, 2005 under the revised arrangements for the non-EEA parents of children born in Ireland prior to 1 January, 2005, known as the IBC/05 Scheme. The permission to remain was renewed for a further three years in 2007 until 17 November 2010. However, I have been informed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) that the person concerned (and his spouse) attended on 24 January, 2011, for the purpose of complying with the obligation to register as a non-national.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The person (and his spouse) presented documentation during this process, which, on examination, was discovered not to contain certain security features which should be affixed to appropriately issued documentation. Consequently, possession was taken of the said documentation for the purpose of being subjected to more detailed examination and it has transpired that the documents, while genuine, had been altered since they were issued. Accordingly, GNIB cannot register the person concerned (and his spouse) with the permission to remain granted under the IBC/05 Scheme. The case files of the person concerned (and his spouse) will now be considered by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service with a view to deciding on their future status in the State, which will be conveyed in writing to them in due course.</P>

	<P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 4th December, 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006. </P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection and, following the consideration of this application, it was determined that the person concerned was not eligible for Subsidiary Protection.

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in October 2009.  The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>In that context,  I can inform the Deputy that I recently announced a series of measures within my Department to provide for speedier processing of citizenship applications to bring about a substantial reduction in the processing timescale. The new arrangements include improved application forms that came into force on Friday, 24th June 2011, and are currently available online with an associated online residence checker, streamlined and accelerated procedures for certain types of application and plans to recruit interns under the new Internship Programme. These measures are targeted at clearing the backlog of applications awaiting a decision in excess of six months by spring of next year and from that time on the aim is, save in exceptional circumstances, that persons applying for citizenship will be given a decision on their application within six months.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union <Col N="740"/>level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that an application for vetting in respect of the person to whom the Deputy refers was processed by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) and a response was returned to the registered organisation in March 2010.</P>
        <P>In the vetting process, in response to a written request from a registered organisation, the Garda authorities will release criminal history information in respect of the person who is the subject of the vetting application.  A vetting application may only be made with the written consent of the subject of the vetting application authorising the Garda authorities to furnish a statement that there are no convictions recorded against the subject in the State or elsewhere or a statement of any convictions recorded against the subject as the case may be or a statement of all prosecutions, successful or unsuccessful, pending or completed in the State or elsewhere as the case may be.</P>
        <P>Garda vetting is only one element which feeds into the overall recruitment and selection process.  There is a range of other factors which a recruiting/selecting body or organisation may take into account when coming to a decision on a person&rsquo;s suitability.

	<P>The Reception &amp; Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers while their protection applications are being processed.  By way of background to this question, as of today RIA has 45 asylum seeker accommodation centres across 18 counties accommodating almost 5,800 residents. The system is a constantly evolving one, taking account of the ebb and flow of residents and of the financial resources available to RIA. The numbers needing to be accommodated by RIA have declined by 7% in the past year and this trend is continuing downwards. The 2011 estimates provision for RIA is &euro;67.5 million, down &euro;10 million (13%) from last year.  Added to this is the requirement by RIA &mdash; as recommended in last year&rsquo;s Value for Money (VFM) Report &mdash; to maintain an overall operational &lsquo;spare capacity&rsquo; of less than 10%.  Accordingly, because of a decline in demand, the number of asylum accommodation centres is necessarily falling.  Five centres closed in 2008, six in 2009, eight in 2010 and more will be closed or downsized later this year.</P>
        <P>The centre referred to in this question is operated by a commercial firm with whom RIA has a contract to provide accommodation services for 55 persons.  Its current contract ends on 18 July, 2011. The contract is not being renewed by RIA, not because of any unhappiness with the running of the centre but rather because of the falling numbers of asylum seekers and the need to keep costs to a minimum. The centre had originally been contracted to RIA from 2 July, 2001 to 22 December, 2005.  It closed but re-opened again on 24 July, 2007 and, as stated, its current contract ends on 18 July, 2011.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that in the period 2001 to 2010 some 96,536 applications for naturalisation were received by my Department and in the same period 23,728 certificates of naturalisation were issued. I should make the point that over 50,000 applications have been lodged in the past two years many of which are currently being processed. </P>
        <P>The compilation of data relating to the average processing time for applications for each of the past ten years would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where all available resources are being directed towards dealing with the existing backlog of naturalisation applications.</P>
        <P>In that context, I can inform the Deputy that I recently announced a series of measures within my Department to provide for speedier processing of citizenship applications to bring about a substantial reduction in the processing timescale. The new arrangements include improved application forms that came into force on Friday, 24th June 2011, and are currently available online with an associated online residence checker, streamlined and accelerated procedures for certain types of application and plans to recruit interns under the new Internship Programme. These measures are targeted at clearing the backlog of applications awaiting a decision in excess of six months by spring of next year and from that time on the aim is, save in exceptional circumstances, that persons applying for citizenship will be given a decision on their application within six months.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>

	<P>Extradition arrangements between the Member States of the European Union (EU) are governed by the provisions of the Euro<Col N="746"/>pean Arrest Warrant Act 2003, as amended, and, insofar as arrangements between Ireland and other states are concerned, by the Extradition Act 1965, as amended. In each instance, the decision in relation to seeking extradition rests with the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). </P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, a court may, upon application made by or on behalf of the DPP, issue a European Arrest Warrant in respect of a person where it is satisfied, <i>inter alia</i>, that a domestic warrant has been issued for the arrest of that person but has not been executed and the person may not be in the State. In relation to a person outside the EU, a request for extradition can only arise where the DPP has decided that an individual should be prosecuted in the first instance. As the Deputy will appreciate, the DPP is completely independent in the exercise of his functions.</P>

        <P LI="1"><i>&ldquo;Like all public service organisations, the Board has also been subject to the public service recruitment embargo and the employee control framework. While the Board had a full staff sanction of 384, the current staffing is in the region of 350. The Board has sought to maintain its front line staffing to the greatest extent possible.</i></P>
        <P LI="1"><i>The Board has taken a range of measures with a view to addressing the increasing demand for services in a resource constrained environment. These include:</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Increasing the number of cases referred to private solicitors for the purpose of providing a service.</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>An advice-only service which facilitates an earlier, brief, meeting with a solicitor where applicants are likely to  have to wait in excess of four months for a substantive appointment.</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>An integration of the delivery of all services with a view to ensuring the most effective deployment of resources.</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>The recent introduction of a pilot integrated mediation initiative in Dublin involving the Board co-locating and  cooperating with the Family Mediation Service and the Courts Service. The purpose of the initiative is to offer  applicants for legal services alternatives to litigation in the Courts as a better (and from the State&rsquo;s point of view) a more cost-effective means of resolving family law disputes.</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>The creation of specialist units for medical negligence and childcare services.</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>The current development of a new legal case management system that is likely to improve the efficiency of   service delivery, the management of risk in the organisation and provide for on-line applications.</i></P><Col N="750"/>
        <P LI="1"><i>The Board has also made use of a very limited exemption from the moratorium in relation to a small number of temporary front-line service delivery positions.</i></P>
        <P LI="1"><i>The Board has been operating a work placement scheme in co-operation with F&Aacute;S over the past two years and has also utilised a small number of solicitors who have sought experience on a voluntary basis. Under the Work Placement Scheme the Board has engaged up to 10 solicitors at any one time. The placements are for a maximum of 9 months and consist of a commitment to a 30 hours per week. The Board is very prepared to utilise all avenues available in addressing the huge surge in demand for services including the intern scheme referred to.</i></P>
        <P LI="1"><i>I intend to have a conversation with the Chairperson of the Legal Aid Board regarding the utilisation of the new National Internship Scheme which is due to commence on 1 July 2011, to temporarily assist in reducing the backlog currently affecting the law centres.&rdquo;</i></P>

        <P>In this context I should say that already, earlier this year, I received sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for the filling of six senior Garda posts which resulted in the Government appointing one Deputy Commissioner, one Assistant Commissioner, one Chief Superintendent and three Superintendents. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the current personnel strength of Garda Superintendents is 164 and that three more Superintendents have notified the Commissioner of their intention to retire before the end of 2011.

	<P>The Reserve Defence Force&rsquo;s primary role is to support the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) in its contingency defence roles in an emergency situation. In peacetime, the main function of the Reserve centres on training and preparing for these contingency roles.  Over the past number of years, the Defence Forces have met operational requirements from within the capacity and resources of the Permanent Defence Force without the need to call up the Reserve Defence Force. Consequently the primary focus of the Reserve has been on training and preparation. Apart from training activities, members of the Reserve Defence Force participate in a range of ceremonial events such as the 1916 commemoration. </P>
        <P>In addition, the military authorities have informed me that there are a range of other activities that members of Reserve Units voluntarily undertake in support of their local communities such as charity collections and stewarding.</P>

	<P>The Defence Forces are primarily deployed on overseas missions in support of international peace and security under UN mandates. On 20 December 2001, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1386 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, authorising the establishment of an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. Ireland has participated in the NATO&mdash;led UN mandated mission since 5 July 2002, following the Government Decision of 2 July 2002, authorising the provision of seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the force.  Since 2002, the Government has reviewed and approved, on an annual basis, the continued participation by seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF. On 28 June 2011, the Government agreed to continue to provide seven members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with ISAF for a further period from July 2011, subject to ongoing review by the Minister for Defence.  Throughout the years, Ireland has and continues to contribute highly <Col N="754"/>qualified Defence Forces personnel to UN mandated missions in small numbers or for short durations. This is a tangible and visible expression of Ireland&rsquo;s continued support for organisations such as the   United Nations and the European Union. Examples of such contributions include the Defence Forces contribution to the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) and to the United Nations Mission in Ivory Coast (UNOCI), with three (3) and two (2) personnel respectively. Also, five personnel were deployed last year to EUTM Somalia, the EU mission to contribute to the training of Somali security forces. </P>
        <P>In the case of the seven Defence Forces personnel currently participating in ISAF, I am satisfied that the work carried out by these personnel at ISAF headquarters, particularly by those in the Counter Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) cell, represents an important contribution to this UN mandated mission.</P>
        <P>The annual additional cost to the Defence Vote arising from participation by the Defence Forces in ISAF is approximately &euro;320,000.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 515 and 516 together.</P>
        <P>Emergency Planning in this country is structured around the &lsquo;Lead Department&rsquo; principle, which means that the Department that is responsible for an activity in normal conditions will maintain that responsibility in an emergency. It is a model that is followed in many countries and it means that the lead Department is responsible for assessing risks, making plans and leading the emergency response. In 2008 the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning agreed a &lsquo;Roles and Responsibilities&rsquo; document that identifies the Lead Department and the supporting Departments and Agencies in over 40 emergency scenarios.</P>
        <P>While there is no one national emergency response plan, there are robust processes in place for inter-agency cooperation at the national, regional and local levels. At the national-level, the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning provides strategic direction and coordination of emergency planning. The Task Force (which I chair) was established after the 9/11 attacks and is comprised of Ministers and/or senior officials from all Government Departments and key public bodies. The Task Force provides a means for keeping emergency planning high on the agenda of all Government Departments and it examines crosscutting issues that impact across Government. It is a forum for sharing of information and, from time to time, receiving expert advice on any emerging emergency planning issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Also, the Framework for Major Emergency Management is the document that sets out a structure enabling the Principal Response Agencies (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health Service Executive and Local Authorities) to prepare for, and make a coordinated response to, major emergencies resulting from events such as fires, transport accidents, hazardous substance incidents and severe weather. There are arrangements in place for raising the response from the <Col N="755"/>local or regional level to the national level and for activating the National Emergency Coordination Centre when a &lsquo;Whole of Government&rsquo; response is required. In addition, there are specific plans in place to deal with specific types of emergencies such as a nuclear accident or an influenza pandemic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Every Department is responsible for keeping the public up-to-date and informed of its emergency planning and response arrangements and this is done through its website or through other means, as appropriate. The Office of Emergency Planning&rsquo;s website <i>emergencyplanning.ie</i> outlines the structures that are in place and the key emergency planning contact points across the relevant Government Departments and Agencies. In 2008, as part of a national public information and awareness campaign on emergency planning, the Office of Emergency Planning distributed a handbook &lsquo;Preparing for Major Emergencies&rsquo; to every household in the country. A copy of the handbook is available on the website.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order, 1945 provided for members of the Defence Forces who had deserted or absented themselves without leave during the Emergency period commencing on 3 September 1939, for a period of not less than 180 days, to stand dismissed from the Defence Forces for desertion in a time of national emergency.      </P>
        <P>In common with armies throughout the world, desertion from the Irish Defence Forces is regarded as a very serious offence.  This was especially the case at a time when the world was at war and our troops were on standby to defend our country from invasion.  In any consideration of the matter, we must also bear in mind the principle that such decisions cannot be left to the individual discretion of individual soldiers on active service and all soldiers must accept that there are consequences for desertion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members of the Defence Forces who served during the &ldquo;Emergency&rdquo; were engaged in important service for their country and it is crucial that no decisions are made that would in any way diminish or undervalue their loyalty to the State and the service given by them to the State.  However, I accept that many of those who deserted, went on to fight against fascism in World War II and did so out of a sense of idealism and with a commitment to protect democracies from tyranny and totalitarianism.  Had there been a different outcome to World War II there is no reason to believe that this State would have been immune to invasion.</P>
        <P>I am giving active consideration to the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The Department is engaged in ongoing capital building and maintenance programmes designed to modernise and enhance the living, training, operational and accommodation facilities available to members of the Defence Forces.     </P><Col N="756"/>
        <P>The capital building programme focuses mainly on infrastructural projects comprising the construction of new buildings and the refurbishment of existing buildings. The ongoing maintenance programme ensures that necessary repairs are carried out at all military installations.</P>
        <P>Under both programmes there has been considerable investment in the military installations in the Eastern Brigade over the over the last number of years with in excess of &euro;16m having been spent on various projects. Details of the main projects undertaken in the years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 are set out in the tabular statement below. Numerous other smaller projects have also been undertaken during that time.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that there has been adequate investment in infrastructure and maintenance in the Eastern Brigade in recent years and that there is sufficient funding available to allow a continuation of the programmes outlined above to ensure that members of the Defence Forces have the best possible facilities available to meet their needs.</P>

The Army Pensions Board is located in St. Bricin&rsquo;s Hospital. The Defence Forces Canteen Board is located in McKee Barracks. Both locations form part of the Defence property portfolio and the question of rent does not arise.</P>
        <P>In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure. The company has been inactive since that decision. Prior to the discontinuation of the national sail training scheme, the offices of Coiste an Asgard were located with the Department of Defence in Col&aacute;iste Caoimh&iacute;n, Glasnevin.</P>
        <P>The Irish Red Cross Society is an independent statute based charitable organisation which manages and administers its affairs through its governing body, the Central Council.

	<P>The reason for maintaining a ban on the sale of raw milk for human consumption is to protect public health.  This is based on strong advice from both food safety and public health professionals.  There have been very serious health issues associated with the drinking of raw milk in Ireland and in a number of other countries. </P>
        <P>The introduction of S.I. No. 910 of 2005 to implement the EU Food and Feed Hygiene Regulations in 2006 had the effect of removing the existing legal basis for the prohibition of the sale of raw cows milk for direct human consumption under S.I. No. 9 of 1996.  Consideration was then given to extending the ban to cover goats and sheep milk.  A consultation process was held during 2008 to determine public views on the proposal to extend the ban to include goats and sheep milk.  Seventeen responses were received.  Neither my Department nor the Food Safety Authority of Ireland were convinced that the submissions received provided any justification to oppose the expert advice that the extended ban should be supported in legislation.</P><Col N="759"/>
        <P>While public health is the overriding consideration, it is also worth noting that legislation required to allow the sale of raw milk on a restricted basis would be much more complicated and would impose very significant extra cost on my Department in relation to oversight and enforcement.  Failure to adequately oversee such high-risk business operations could result in serious national and international reputational risk, for instance in the event of an outbreak of TB being linked to the consumption of raw milk purchased from an establishment approved by the competent authority.  It should be noted that the prevalence of TB in herds in Ireland puts us in a different position to most other Member States in the EU where the disease has been eradicated.  It is inappropriate that Ireland should adopt the same approach to the consumption of raw milk as countries that do not have the same difficulty with TB and therefore have no associated risk.</P>
        <P>In all the circumstances I am satisfied that a ban on the sale of raw milk for human consumption is fully justified.  I do not propose to ban the sale of cheese or other products manufactured from raw milk, as the same risk to public health does not arise.</P>
        <P>Article 10 (8) of EU Regulation 853 of 2004 provides that a Member State may, of its own initiative and subject to the general provisions of the Treaty, maintain or establish national rules prohibiting or restricting the placing on the market within its territory of raw milk or raw cream intended for direct human consumption.  Section 54 of the Health Act of 1947 (as amended by Section 25 of the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006) has been identified as the appropriate primary legislation for this purpose and the Department of Health has agreed to promote a Statutory Instrument under that Act on behalf of my Department.  The latest indicative timeframe for the introduction of the S.I. is end 2011, which includes allowance for a 3-month EU notification period.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason for maintaining a ban on the sale of raw milk for human consumption is to protect public health. This is based on strong advice from both food safety and public health professionals. There have been very serious health issues associated with the drinking of raw milk in Ireland and in a number of other countries. </P>
        <P>The introduction of S.I. No. 910 of 2005 to implement the EU Food and Feed Hygiene Regulations in 2006 had the effect of removing the existing legal basis for the prohibition of <Col N="762"/>the sale of raw cows milk for direct human consumption under S.I. No. 9 of 1996. Consideration was then given to extending the ban to cover goats and sheep milk. A consultation process was held during 2008 to determine public views on the proposal to extend the ban to include goats and sheep milk. Seventeen responses were received. Neither my Department nor the Food Safety Authority of Ireland were convinced that the submissions received provided any justification to oppose the expert advice that the extended ban should be supported in legislation.</P>
        <P>While public health is the overriding consideration, it is also worth noting that legislation required to allow the sale of raw milk on a restricted basis would be much more complicated and would impose very significant extra cost on my Department in relation to oversight and enforcement. Failure to adequately oversee such high-risk business operations could result in serious national and international reputational risk, for instance in the event of an outbreak of TB being linked to the consumption of raw milk purchased from an establishment approved by the competent authority. It should be noted that the prevalence of TB in herds in Ireland puts us in a different position to most other Member States in the EU where the disease has been eradicated. It is inappropriate that Ireland should adopt the same approach to the consumption of raw milk as countries that do not have the same difficulty with TB and therefore have no associated risk.</P>
        <P>In all the circumstances I am satisfied that a ban on the sale of raw milk for human consumption is fully justified. I do not propose to ban the sale of cheese or other products manufactured from raw milk, as the same risk to public health does not arise.</P>
        <P>Article 10(8) of EU Regulation 853 of 2004 provides that a Member State may, of its own initiative and subject to the general provisions of the Treaty, maintain or establish national rules prohibiting or restricting the placing on the market within its territory of raw milk or raw cream intended for direct human consumption. Section 54 of the Health Act of 1947 (as amended by Section 25 of the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006) has been identified as the appropriate primary legislation for this purpose and the Department of Health has agreed to promote a Statutory Instrument under that Act on behalf of my Department. The latest indicative timeframe for the introduction of the S.I. is end 2011, which includes allowance for a 3-month EU notification period.</P>

	<P>Tackling child poverty is a priority for the Government and is a key goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007- 2016 which is co-ordinated by the Department of Social Protection.  Children are more likely to be poor if they live in unemployed households or households where there is a low level of paid employment.  The Departments of Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise, and Innovation, and Education and Skills, are working to deliver a range of measures aimed at getting people back to work.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, improving children&rsquo;s outcomes is a priority concern.  Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are important priorities in my Department to enhance children&rsquo;s opportunities for social and educational development and to support parents.  The network of 107 family resource centres and other services that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of my Department, also have an important role in this regard.</P>
        <P>These programmes and the results of pilot projects to enhance children&rsquo;s development in Tallaght, Northside and Ballymun, which are jointly funded by my Department with a philanthropic organisation, will inform the Government&rsquo;s plans to develop a new area based approach to child poverty.  Any requirements for legislation to underpin the approach will be considered in the deliberative process by Government.</P>

	<P>The issue of local authority commercial rates comes within the remit of the Department of Finance, which has responsibility for fiscal policy, and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which has responsibility for the local authorities.  Local authorities are obliged to collect rates on any property that is entered on the valuation lists and which is used for commercial purposes.  Valuation lists are prepared by the independent Valuation Office in accordance with the Valuation Act 2001.</P>
        <P>In July of last year the Valuation Office clarified that certain services participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will be considered exempt from commercial rates.  The exemption applies to services which are solely and exclusively used for the provision of educational services which are available to the general public, and where the expenses incurred in providing these services are defrayed wholly by the State.  With the exception of community not for profit child care services which may, on a case by case basis be exempted from commercial rates, child care services which do not meet the conditions of the exemption continue to be liable to commercial rates.</P>
        <P>I recently raised the issue of commercial rates on child care facilities with the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.  He has informed my Department that in line with the existing legislative framework local authorities have no discretion in the collection of commercial rates and are required to levy rates on any property on the Valuation List.</P>

	<P>I understand that the Review referred to by the Deputy was commissioned following commitments made by both the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties in their 2010 Election Manifestos to deal with the issue of commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood.  This commitment was subsequently reflected in the Coalition Agreement.  The resulting Report of the Review &ldquo;Letting Children be Children&rdquo; was published in June 2011.</P>
        <P>At present there are no plans to conduct a similar review in Ireland.  However, I have asked my Department to examine any key findings in the Report which could help inform policy approach in respect of this area.</P>

	<P>I am very aware of the threat of psychoactive substances being sold via the internet.  In May 2010 the Government made an Order declaring over 200 psychoactive substances that had been on sale in &lsquo;head shops&rsquo; to be controlled drugs for the purposes of the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  Under these <Col N="769"/>regulations it is an offence to manufacture, produce, import, export, sell, supply, or possess these substances.</P>
        <P>In addition, under the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 which came into force in August 2010, it is a criminal offence to sell or supply substances which may not be controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts but which have psychoactive effects on humans.</P>
        <P>These regulations apply to the supply and purchase of products through the internet in the same way as they apply generally.  The sale of psychoactive substances over the internet is a global problem that poses serious ongoing risks.  The enforcement of the legal provisions applying is carried out by Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, both of whom work closely together and with their international counterparts to address the problem.  The Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also liaise closely with the Irish Medicines Board in this area. Furthermore, as new products come on the market, my Department will control further products under the Misuse of Drugs Acts and, indeed, arrangements to schedule additional psychoactive substances are currently being finalised.</P>

This replaced all existing early retirement schemes, and no others were available after the closing date of the ISER, until the introduction of the Voluntary Early Retirement and Voluntary Redundancy schemes which were announced on 1 November 2010.</P>
        <P>The Government decided in November 2010 that in view of the need to achieve a permanent reduction in the number employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards, and to facilitate public health reform, that targeted voluntary early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes should be introduced for certain grades in the health sector.  As these schemes post dated the retirement date of the person in question, the terms were not, unfortunately, available to him.  As the Deputy will be aware, these two schemes have now been completed, access is no longer available and persons availing have left the system.</P>
        <P>The ISER was a voluntary scheme and the individual concerned made a decision to avail of the scheme, based on the terms of that scheme, which included the immediate payment of pension without actuarial reduction, and the payment of 10% lump sum at time of retirement, with the balance of 90% payable when the retiree reaches normal preserved pension age.</P><Col N="772"/>

	<P>The National Ambulance Service (NAS) has undergone significant change in order to ensure quality, safety and value for money. In line with other clinical areas, this process is ongoing as clinical needs and standards develop. I believe that these developments are in the best interests of patients, and that they are a key part of the Government&rsquo;s work to ensure high quality emergency care.</P>
        <P>In 2003, the Health Board Executive established a project group to oversee implementation of recommendations on the command and control function of the ambulance services within the health board structure.  In September 2004, the project steering group appointed Mason Communications to undertake a technical review of the existing command and control infrastructure for ambulance services in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The recommendations from this report guided a reduction in the number of control centres from 22 in 1993 to 14 by 2005.  Supported by my Department and by HIQA, the NAS is working to improve the management and integration of its services. This includes a reduction to two ambulance control centres nationally, with appropriate technology, a clinical lead for pre-hospital care, development and implementation of new performance indicators for pre-hospital care and development of standard national criteria in relation to non-emergency patient transport.</P>
        <P>All current control rooms are now equipped with the Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System (AMPDS), which allows the most appropriate deployment of pre-hospital services &mdash; in particular of advanced paramedics &mdash; and it has been used nationwide since late 2010.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 564 and 565 together.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s National Clinical Programme for Diabetes &mdash; which includes the care of children and adolescents with diabetes, has estimated that there are between 3,000 and 4,000 children and young adults with diabetes in this country. It was established by the HSE in 2010 with the express aim of defining the way diabetic clinical services should be delivered, resourced and <Col N="774"/>measured.  One of the key priorities is to facilitate future organised care and screening for diabetes related complications.</P>
        <P>Type 1 diabetes is a particularly complex condition in children and young adults and so it is recommended that their care be delivered in a multidisciplinary setting with access to a consultant paediatric endocrinologist and other diabetes healthcare specialists.  One proposed national model of diabetes care is based on 8-10 regional networks, with the 3 existing Dublin centres acting as a tertiary hub of excellence and continuing to see one third of the national paediatric/adolescent diabetes population.  This model has been proposed by the Diabetes Federation of Ireland.  The second model came from the Expert Advisory Group, chaired by Dr Colm Costigan, Paediatric Endocrinologist in Crumlin Hospital.  This proposes that care be centralised for each region in a dedicated paediatric/adolescent diabetes centre looking after at least 150 children/adolescents.  Ideally the centre should be in a regional hospital that has an adult diabetes centre to facilitate transition to adulthood.</P>
        <P>The national clinical leads for diabetes and paediatrics are to meet in the next couple of weeks to assess current services across the country; to agree a model of care; and to standardise these across the country.  They will also develop criteria for use of CSII therapy (insulin infusion) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and work on policy to prevent and aid the early detection of diabetes in young children and adolescents.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, the function of the HSE National Programme for diabetes, among others, is to consider which model is most appropriate and it is working to this end. In parallel, my Department and the HSE will be meeting the Diabetes Federation of Ireland with a view to progressing the issues around the appropriate model of care for children and adolescents with diabetes.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy may wish to note the following important developments in this area:</P>
        <P LI="1">1.   The National Diabetes Programme is continuing the development of a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme.  While retinopathy screening is continuing in the Northwest region, the intention is that services be rolled-out nationally &mdash; probably during 2012. This programme is significant because Diabetic Retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness and serious visual impairment in Ireland.  90% of people with diabetes will develop retinopathy while 10% will be sight threatening if undetected and not treated;</P>
        <P LI="1">2.   A national foot care model has been agreed. The aim for 2011 is to establish 16 specialist multidisciplinary foot care teams across the country in line with indicative National Hospital Reconfiguration will have different levels of care for patients depending on their risk of diabetic foot disease.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 567 and 595 together.</P>
        <P>Public health risks of potential international concern, including radionuclear risks, are notified by the WHO to all Member States.  In addition, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) has been receiving information on the situation at the Fukushima site and the consequences of the accident since its occurrence on  11 March from the IAEA  (International Atomic Energy Agency) and the EC through the European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange (ECURIE) system.  Regular situation updates and meetings of the Nuclear National Co-ordinating Group which is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have also taken place.</P>
        <P>The RPII&rsquo;s monitoring systems are designed to detect radioactivity at levels far below those that could have health impacts and the RPII has detected trace amounts of radioactivity in air, rainwater and milk samples.  The levels measures were very low and far below those which would cause concern for public health.  They were comparable to levels found in other European countries, including at those observed from the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation (CBTO) European monitoring stations.  The RPII issued a series of statements on their monitoring results after Fukushima and also provides access to their environmental data on their website (<i>www.rpii.ie</i>), including live data from their national radiation monitoring network.  Data from the CTBTO monitoring stations in Germany, Japan and elsewhere are publicly available via the German radiation protection authority&rsquo;s website at <i>http://www.bfs.de/de/ion/imis/ctbto_aktivitaetskonzentrationen_jod.gif</i>.</P>

	<P>Agencies established under the remit of my Department are required to comply with my Department&rsquo;s Frameworks for Corporate and Financial Governance.  The two Frameworks (one for regulatory bodies under the aegis of my Department and one for the agencies funded by my Department) are supplementary  to statutory requirements and to Government approved guidelines including the <i>Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.</i></P>
        <P>All Agencies meet their legal and financial obligations with regard to control, compliance and internal risk processes linked to their requirements to publish Audited Accounts.  Broader agency best practice relating to non-statutory governance provisions are in place to varying but increasingly improved standards.  Officials of my Department ensure that the Frameworks for health sector agencies is adhered to by monitoring progress on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>EU Directive 2004/23/EC on the Quality and Safety of Tissues and Cells and the Regulations made under the Directive (S.I. No.158 of 2006) set standards of quality and safety for human tissues and cells which are intended for human applications.  These Regulations apply to the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells when intended for human applications. They also apply to manufactured products derived from human tissues and cells intended for human applications.</P>
        <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority under the Regulations. All tissue establishments, including companies which procure stem cells for human applications, must be authorised to carry out their activities and are subject to regular inspections.  The organisation to which the Deputy refers is authorised by the Irish Medicines Board as a tissue establishment and may therefore collect cord blood once it complies with any governance arrangements which may be in place in any particular hospital.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 584 and 585 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has centralised the processing of all new medical card applications and renewals at the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Finglas, Dublin with effect from 1st July.</P>
        <P>About 90 staff have moved to the PCRS to cope with the increased workload and the HSE is seeking redeployment, under the terms of the Public Service Agreement, to increase this number to 150.  I have raised this issue directly with the PCRS and I am advised that they hope to have the full complement of staff in place within the next six to eight weeks.  The previous system of locally based processing required some 400 staff and the balance will be freed up for redeployment to key front-line services around the country.</P>
        <P>Pending the completion of the ongoing redeployment process, the HSE intends to re-assign staff from other duties within the PCRS as required in order to deal with medical card applications and renewals.  If these internal arrangements prove inadequate, the HSE has an arrangement in place to avail of the services of a company with which it has a contract to provide customer support services.  The number of outside staff required will  become clear as the project progresses over the coming weeks, with the ability  to expand and reduce the number as necessary to ensure continuity of service delivery.</P>
        <P>During and after this changeover period, every effort will  be made to ensure that the system is responsive to queries from the public and public representatives.</P>

	<P>I am committed to ensuring that acute hospital services at national, regional and local level are provided in a clinically appropriate and efficient manner.  In particular I want to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely in smaller, local hospitals.  I have also made it clear that patient safety must be the overriding <Col N="790"/>priority. I want patients to be treated at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, and efficient and as near to home as possible. </P>
        <P>The configuration of services is constantly reviewed and from time to time re-arranged to improve access and quality of service and minimise risk to patients.  This programme of realignment of services has received recent impetus from HIQA in relation to the need to implement the recommendations from the Ennis and Mallow reports.  The reports deal in particular with the type of services that can safely be provided in smaller hospitals and the structures required for good governance and accountability.  The HSE must ensure that this happens and I will be monitoring the situation closely in conjunction with HIQA</P>
        <P>The HSE has now put an implementation team in place to ensure that the recommendations of both the Ennis and Mallow reports are implemented in a speedy, systematic and consistent manner and I have asked for regular progress reports on this important initiative.</P>
        <P>This Government is strongly committed to developing the role of smaller hospitals in Ireland so that they play a key part in the services provided to local communities.  Patients should only have to travel to the larger hospitals for more complex services.  The HIQA reports are entirely in keeping with this approach.  I can assure the public that no hospitals will close, regardless of the difficult economic situation we find ourselves in. However, ongoing reform of the system will require some changes in how care is delivered in some locations across our health system.</P>

	<P>Since becoming the Minister for Health, I have met with the HSE on over thirty separate occasions to discuss various aspects of the health services, including the relocation of orthopaedic services in Cork.  I have instructed the HSE not to withdraw any services from acute hospitals unless and until I receive a full briefing on the details of what is proposed, the alternative arrangements to be put in place, and the overall implications for patients. </P><Col N="794"/>
        <P>I can confirm that a number of meetings with the HSE, including senior clinicians, as well as discussions with local representatives, focused on the relocation.  I am satisfied that the implementation of the initiatives planned by the HSE South will greatly improve the quality and quantity of orthopaedic services for patients in the region, including the recommencement of paediatric orthopaedic services in Cork and an increased level of elective surgery.</P>
        <P>Full engagement with the staff of St. Mary&rsquo;s in relation to their relocation is essential, to address any clinical or other concerns that they have.  I have asked the HSE South to begin this process immediately.</P>

	<P>GP out-of-hours co-operatives are now in place in all HSE areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties.  In 2010, there were over 924,000 contacts with GP out-of-hours co-operatives and the total cost of funding the service was over &euro;89 million.  Over 2000 GPs provide services in the co-ops.  The fees and allowances paid by the HSE to GPs were reduced in 2009 and 2010 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  &ldquo;Distance from the GP&rsquo;s surgery&rdquo; was removed as a factor in calculating out-of-hours fees as part of the 2010 reductions.  Neither the Department of Justice and Equality or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has indicated to me or my officials any difficulty concerning the availability of doctors, to attend to test drivers who are suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as a result of these reductions.</P>

	<P>I am committed to ensuring that acute hospital services at national, regional and local level are provided in a clinically appropriate and efficient manner. In particular I want to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely in smaller, local hospitals.  I have also made it clear that patient safety must be the overriding priority.  I want patients to be treated at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, and efficient and as near to home as possible.  However, ongoing reform of the system will require some changes in how care is delivered in some locations across our health system.</P><Col N="797"/>
        <P>I am conscious of the Deputy&rsquo;s concern in relation to the retention of services at Tullamore and Portlaoise in advance of the next rotation of Non-Consultant Hospitals Doctors (NCHDs).  The position is, however, that the shortage of suitable NCHDs is an issue in many European countries.  In this context I am working with the HSE and other stakeholders to ensure the filling of as many as possible of some 475 NCHD posts which are due to be filled from 11th July 2011.  The HSE conducted an extensive recruitment drive in India and Pakistan in recent months and succeeded in identifying 439 potential candidates for NCHD positions in Ireland.  I have held meetings involving my Department, the Medical Council, medical training bodies and the HSE with a view to identifying measures to facilitate the appointment of suitably-qualified doctors from abroad.  Drafting of a Bill to amend the Medical Practitioners Act, 2007, to enable the Medical Council to register doctors in supervised posts for a defined period, is being finalised.</P>
        <P>The HSE is focusing on addressing particular staffing issues in a number of hospitals including the Midlands Regional Hospitals at Mullingar, Tullamore and Portlaoise.  Notwithstanding this, it is unlikely that all NCHD vacancies can be filled by 11th July.  Hospital management are working with Clinical Directors in a planned way to devise contingency arrangements which can be implemented, if required, to ensure that any resulting impact on services is minimised and that safe delivery of hospital services is assured.  There is currently no plan to reduce services in these hospitals on foot of any NCHD shortage.</P>

	<P>CervicalCheck, the National Cervical Screening Programme, provides free smear tests to women aged 25-60.  The HSE has contractual agreements in place with 2,055 contract-holders for the provision of smeartaking services as part of CervicalCheck.  They include doctors (clinically responsible doctors) and clinics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Within each practice or clinic, there are a number of smeartakers who are registered by the clinically responsible doctor as qualified persons to take smear tests.  In total there are 4,979 smeartakers registered as part of the programme, including both doctors and practice nurses.  Under the terms of the contract with the HSE, the clinically responsible doctor is responsible for ensuring those he or she has registered as &ldquo;qualified persons&rdquo; are adequately qualified to take smear tests.  To support smeartakers in practice, CervicalCheck offers regular free training and clinical updates to smeartakers registered with the programme.  In so doing, it partners with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) and the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP).  In the academic year 2010-2011, training and education was provided for over 1,000 health professionals.</P>
        <P>Under the contract between the HSE and the clinically responsible doctor, the practice or clinic where a CervicalCheck smear test is taken is solely responsible for ensuring delivery of the smear test sample to the designated cytology laboratory for analysis. No woman who has a smear test as part of the CervicalCheck programme should pay for postage.  I am advised by the HSE that, since the introduction of CervicalCheck in September 2008, a small number of instances have come to their attention of a woman being asked to post her own smear test sample for analysis.  Any complaint received by the programme, including that referred to by the Deputy, is thoroughly reviewed and followed-up.</P>

      </Qst><Col N="799"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Cord blood is a source of stem cells, which have proven therapeutic benefit for a number of conditions, principally the treatment of blood conditions.  Stem cells may also be obtained from bone marrow.  It is important to note that many potential benefits of stem cells are at very early investigative stages and will require substantiation through clinical trials.</P>
        <P>Ireland does not currently have a public cord blood bank.  At present, when clinically indicated by a consultant overseeing care, collection of cord blood for donation to an identified family member in high risk families is facilitated by HSE hospitals in collaboration with the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  In addition, where an identified clinical need arises, Ireland has access to cord blood stem cells through international stem cell banks and registries and this is also arranged by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.</P>
        <P>Collection of cord blood for private use in low risk families is not provided publicly in Ireland.  While recognising that science in this area is evolving, the HSE sought and considered expert professional clinical opinion as well as legal advice in relation to this matter.  As a result, it has determined that staff at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE should not undertake the procurement of cord blood for commercial entities.  The HSE must ensure that evidence-based, safe, effective and high quality care is provided to patients and their families.  In addition, the contracting of staff employed at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE, to undertake the collection of cord blood on behalf of commercial companies, was outside the cover provided under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.</P>
        <P>Any hospital wishing to accommodate staff directly employed by third party commercial entities to undertake the procurement of cord blood at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE must therefore ensure that all appropriate arrangements are in place within the context of a robust clinical governance framework to control risks associated with the service.  A contract, or service level agreement, should be in place between the third party commercial entity and the hospital concerned.  Policies, procedures and guidelines are required to govern how the service is provided.  Hospitals and their maternity service teams face significant challenges in ensuring a robust clinical governance framework to support a safe and high quality maternity care system.  My Department will keep the emergence of clinical benefits of cord blood banking under constant review.  I am satisfied that the HSE&rsquo;s primary objective is to ensure that there is a safe and high quality maternity service and that it is correct in requiring that appropriate governance arrangements are in place where an individual wishes to collect cord blood in cases where there is no identified clinical need.</P>

	<P>The penalty points system has been designed and structured to ensure that any person who is accused of the commission of a penalty point offence is afforded a significant time period to choose whether or not to allow the matter to proceed to court.  One of the main purposes of introducing the system was to relieve the administrative burden on the courts. Persons accused of committing certain road traffic offences were offered the incentive of paying a fixed charge and accepting a reduced number of penalty points rather than a court appearance.</P>
        <P>For 61 of the 69 offences determined to be penalty points offences in the Road Traffic Act 2002, the accused person is given the option of the payment of a fixed charge together with accepting a reduced number of penalty points.  A person presented with a fixed charge notice is given a period of 56 days in which to make such a payment and accept the reduced number of penalty points.  Once a fixed charge notice has been paid, the offence cannot be subsequently contested in the Courts.  Where a fixed charge notice is not paid, the matter will be dealt with by the Courts and the full number of points, as prescribed by the 2002 Act, will be applied upon conviction.</P>

	<P>I fully recognise the value of Galway Airport in terms of the numbers employed directly and indirectly at the Airport and the role it has played in the economic development of the region.  However, I do not accept the argument that compares the cost of Exchequer support to the airport with the loss of revenue to the Exchequer in the form of taxation arising from the loss of direct employment at Galway Airport, etc. were it to close.  There are other factors at play here, particularly having regard to the overlapping catchment areas of the airports on the western seaboard.</P>
        <P>A Value for Money (VFM) Review on Exchequer Support for the Regional Airports Programme has already been completed and was published by the previous Government last January.

The Review assessed all the regional airports throughout the country.  It recommended that funding for the PSO air services between Dublin and the regional airports at Sligo, Ireland West (Knock), Galway, Kerry and Derry be discontinued when current contracts end in July 2011 and that operational and capital expenditure funding be discontinued for Sligo and Galway airports.  In the case of Galway Airport, this means that much of the potential air travel would divert to Shannon and Ireland West international airports instead.  Others would travel by road or rail instead. </P>
        <P>These recommendations took into account changes in EU legislation, airport performances, the substantial investment in surface transport, overlapping catchment areas, the requirement to make best use of scarce Exchequer resources, and the implications for the regional tourism and business sectors. </P>
        <P>In the circumstances, I have no plans to have further cost benefit assessments carried out on Galway Airport or any of the other regional airports.  Moreover, the recent decision taken by this Government on funding for the regional airports is broadly in line with the Review&rsquo;s recommendations.   </P>
        <P>In that regard, I have secured Government approval for additional funding to be made available to all six regional airports in 2011, including Galway and Sligo, reversing the cut in funding made by the last Government.  However, I will not be able to provide operational or capital funding to Galway or Sligo airports from 2012 onwards.  </P><Col N="804"/>
        <P>This decision is necessary to make best use of scarce Exchequer resources and to ensure the efficient use of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  The Government is aware of the implications for both Galway and Sligo Airports in making this decision.  Clearly, in the current economic difficulties, it is not business as usual and unpopular decisions must be made.  I believe that in continuing to support the other four regional airports beyond 2011, we will ensure that Ireland has a sufficient network of regional airports, while taking into account significant improvement in the road network, short journey times by road and rail and the reduction in passengers flying domestically. </P>
        <P>I would encourage Galway and Sligo Airports, as privately owned entities, to use the opportunity provided by the additional funding  in 2011 to engage with various parties, including business interests, investors and local authorities, to secure their ongoing viability in some form.  My Department will work with those airports over the coming months to ensure the close out of Exchequer support in an orderly way.</P>

	<P>The maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources and are supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  A total of &euro;439.676 million is being provided in regional and local road grants in 2011.  This allocation includes the additional &euro;60 million being provided by the Government under the jobs initiative. Under Sections 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, local authorities may, subject to certain conditions, require the payment of developmental contributions or supplementary development contributions in respect of public infrastructure which benefits a proposed development. </P>
        <P>Heavy trucks, particularly fully laden forestry trucks can cause great damage to road pavements (especially to weak pavements on legacy roads).  Under the Planning and Development Act it is open to local authorities to seek to recoup the cost of certain road strengthening works in appropriate circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to proposals to amend the Eurovignette Directives.  The Directives set a common framework to be implemented where Member States apply tolls and time based road use charges on certain motorways for particular heavy goods vehicles (HGVs); and proposals to amend the Directives provide, among other matters, for an optional additional surcharge on tolls (known as the external cost charge and relating to environmental impacts such as air and noise pollution) are nearing finalisation.  Neither the Directive nor the proposed amendments oblige Member States to apply tolls or charges</P>
        <P>My Department has been involved in EU negotiations on the proposed amending Directive over the past three years, and has had various contacts on the matter with haulage interests.  Road tolls and charges are important for investment in infrastructure in Ireland as in other Member States, and the reality of external costs has to be provided for.  The decision to apply charges is a matter for each Member State, but Eurovignette is about ensuring a common and transparent framework for charges, including how they are calculated and maximum amounts.</P>

The testing function is carried out by Applus+, since January <Col N="809"/>2010, under a contractual arrangement with the RSA.  The award of the contract and the criteria applying thereto is a matter for the RSA. </P>
        <P>There is regular and ongoing contact between the RSA and my Department on matters pertaining to the National Car Testing Service.</P>
        <P>Following the Prime Time Investigates programme Applus+ has undertaken an internal investigation and the seven vehicle inspectors who were identified as a result of the programme and internal analysis were suspended.  Three have now been dismissed.  Applus+ has submitted a number of requests to RTE for information under the Freedom of Information Act.  Primetime has refused to provide the information on the grounds that it is outside Freedom of Information.</P>
        <P>A Garda investigation is currently under way and Applus+ is providing all information and assistance required.  Applus+ is implementing a number of measures to address the issues raised.  While details of many of these must necessarily be kept confidential, they include preventative measures and fraud detection measures based on following up on specific risk areas identified.</P>
        <P>Under its contract with the RSA, Applus+ was already in the process of fitting cameras on every test lane and these are expected to be in place in July.  Some longer term measures are also being considered by Applus+.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these recent issues, the NCTS testing system is computer-controlled and highly automated and provides test security, consistency and accuracy.  Uniform standards are set for what is tested, how the test is carried out and the reasons for failure.</P>
