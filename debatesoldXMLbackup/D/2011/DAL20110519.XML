  <Title>Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy</Title>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was informed earlier this morning of the death of a former colleague and friend, Dr. Garret FitzGerald. As Taoiseach and as leader of the Fine Gael Party, I extend our sympathy to his children John, Mark and Mary and to his extended family.</P>
    <P>Dr. Garret FitzGerald was a truly remarkable man who made a truly remarkable contribution to Ireland. As Taoiseach, Minister and leader of Fine Gael, he made an unparalleled contribution to public life in Ireland. His towering intellect, his enthusiasm for life and his optimism for politics will be missed by everybody, but particularly by those people in the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>Garret was a true patriot; an icon of decency and high honour in public life whose fluency in economics was balanced by the humility, the generosity and the warmth of his personal and family life. A leading academic, Dr. Garret FitzGerald turned his back on private wealth to have not just a career, but a lifetime commitment to public life and to politics here.</P>
    <P Just="Left">His commitment to achieving peace and reconciliation on this island, and between Ireland and Britain, reached its fruition this very week with the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Ireland. I know he had hoped to be present in Dublin Castle yesterday evening, but his illness prevented him from being there. He had a deep understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to influence international affairs through co-operation and partnership. He was particularly and passionately committed to developing his country&rsquo;s role in the European Union, of which he was an avowed supporter over very many years. His contribution, through his column in <i>The Irish Times</i> for more than 50 years, speaks for itself in respect of the spectrum, the breadth and the quality of the analysis of Irish current affairs.</P>
    <P Just="Left">If there is any consolation, it is that his leave-taking was as gentle as his life and the way he lived it. I knew Garret since the mid 1960s as a young lad myself. Speaking from this seat as <Col N="814"/>Taoiseach, he set out his stall for his vision of the equality of recognition of communities here. I know Members will join me in expressing our sympathy and the sympathy of the House to his family, Mark, Mary and John, their children and his grandchildren, and their extended family, on the passing of a truly remarkable man.</P>
    <P Just="Left">A Cheann Comhairle, the House will have an opportunity subsequent to the funeral to make more formal statements. </P>

	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, it was with great sadness that I learned this morning of the death of Dr. Garret FitzGerald, and on behalf of the Labour Party, I join the Taoiseach in expressing our sympathies to John, Mark, Mary and their families.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In the many tributes that will be paid today will be listed the offices of State held by Dr. Garret FitzGerald in a long and distinguished career. He was Senator, Deputy, Minister, Chancellor of the National University of Ireland and twice holder of the office of Taoiseach. Yet, even this list does not do justice to what Dr. FitzGerald became - quite simply, a shining model of citizenship, of service to the nation, of devotion to the ideals of the Republic and to the foundations on which it stands.</P>
    <P>Over many decades and in many roles, he relished the role described by his pseudonym used during his first connection with <i>The Irish Times</i>, &ldquo;Analyst&rdquo;. He was a man driven to understand, to confront problems with evidence, to weigh facts and to reach conclusions. His association with <i>The Irish Times</i> lasted from the 1940s to the present day.</P>
    <P Just="Left">His facility with numbers was legendary. His interests were incredibly broad, from the pattern of the use of the Irish language in 19th century Ireland to the minute detail of election results and local authority elections in the present decade, to the intricacies of public finance. He brought to all these problems the same clarity of thought and the same probing intelligence. However, analysis was never enough. His enormous sense of duty, of service to the Republic, compelled him to turn analysis into action. He sought and was elected to public office, to turn ideas into policy and policy into action.</P>
    <P>The problems of economics were only one of his many concerns. From his earliest days in public life, he was determined to address the then festering sore that was Anglo-Irish relations and the deeply troubled relationship between the two traditions on this island. From his book <i>Towards a New Ireland</i> to his role in negotiating the Anglo-Irish Agreement, he showed unequalled qualities of foresight and statesmanship. At the historic gathering last night in Dublin Castle when the Heads of State of these two islands met in friendship and unity, his absence was palpable for it was he more than any other who was the intellectual and political father on the road we have travelled together.</P>
    <P>Among his many roles, Dr. FitzGerald was an outstanding Minister for Foreign Affairs. During his time in that office he helped to define the scope and nature of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the European Union. He was an architect of our national commitment to exercise national sovereignty in a meaningful way by pooling it with other member states. He was, quite obviously, in his element having been a committed member of the Irish European Movement from its foundation.</P>
    <P>As leader of the Labour Party, I too am conscious of the strong relationship that members of my party had with him when he led two coalition Governments, which, though faced with deep economic difficulties, were radical and transformative. Dr. Garret FitzGerald in the eyes <Col N="815"/>of the nation stood for integrity, for service and for a liberal and tolerant Ireland, for reconciliation between the two traditions on the island.</P>
    <P>On this day, too, it is right to remember with fondness his wife Joan, to whom he was so clearly devoted and who enjoyed the affectionate regard of the Irish people. The public man was a devoted father, grandfather and great-grandfather and however great our loss, we must think of the loss to his family. A great citizen of our Republic is lost to us. A flame is dimmed, but the example that he offered us, the ideals by which he lived, continue to serve us today.</P>

	<P>Do chuir an nuacht gur cailleadh Garret FitzGerald inniu an-bhr&oacute;n orm go pearsanta. Polaiteoir, fear l&eacute;inn agus iriseoir den ch&eacute;ad scoth a bh&iacute; ann. Bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-tiomanta i leith choincheap na seirbh&iacute;se poibl&iacute; agus d&rsquo;fhreastal s&eacute; go stuama agus go gna&iacute;&uacute;il ar son phobal na h&Eacute;ireann. Bh&iacute; suim ar leith aige i ngn&oacute;tha&iacute; eachtracha agus Eorpacha, agus thuig s&eacute; t&aacute;bhacht na hEorpa maidir le todhcha&iacute; na t&iacute;re seo. Rinne s&eacute; an-chuid oibre chun fadhbanna Thuaisceart na h&Eacute;ireann a r&eacute;iteach agus chun na traidisi&uacute;in agus na pobail &eacute;ags&uacute;la ann a thabhairt le ch&eacute;ile.</P>
    <P>I am deeply saddened by the death of Dr. Garret FitzGerald. Dr. Garret FitzGerald has made an enormous contribution to Irish politics and to wider society. He served the Irish people with great intelligence, decency and commitment in a lifetime devoted to public service. He was a hard-working politician of compassion and ability. He was a prolific journalist of insight and understanding. He was a brilliant academic of versatility and knowledge.</P>
    <P>Dr. Garret FitzGerald came from a political family. His parents had been involved in the War of Independence and Garret&rsquo;s father, Mr. Desmond FitzGerald, served as a Minister in the first Irish Free State Government. From his parents, Garret learnt about the value of public service and it was a lesson he did not forget. His entire career &mdash; indeed, his life and times &mdash; have been devoted to an overarching commitment to public service. He worked night and day for the betterment of our people. Dr. Garret FitzGerald was defined by his enormous and sincere interest in public affairs.</P>
    <P>As a politician, a commentator or an academic, he was always open and generous with his time. Unlike many intellectuals, he also had the gift of listening. He was often right, but he was never obsessed with his own views. He always made an effort to listen to others and he was tolerant of those with whom he did not agree so long as they pursued their goals or objectives in an orderly and peaceful manner.</P>
    <P>In his autobiography, he tells the story of how he was known as the &ldquo;child of reconciliation&rdquo;. His father had taken the Free State side in the Civil War, but Garret&rsquo;s godparents were Se&aacute;n and Margaret MacEntee, both prominent republicans, and Se&aacute;n MacEntee was a founder of Fianna F&aacute;il. That lack of bitterness, unusual for its time, had an impact on Dr. Garret FitzGerald and he had a great respect for political opponents.</P>
    <P>On a personal level, as a young student in UCC from the late 1970s on, I developed a huge interest in politics. I first canvassed in the elections where Mr. Charles Haughey and Garret went head to head. These were titanic election battles and for those us who remember them, or who were involved, we will always recall Garret as an iconic figure in Irish politics and a politician whom one could not but help respect and admire.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Dr. Garret FitzGerald served for two terms as Taoiseach in the 1980s during difficult economic days. He started his career in politics in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1965, which, in the context of current debate, we might reflect on, and he was a Deputy for Dublin South-East from 1969 to 1992. An extraordinary vote-getter, he topped the poll in his first election to the D&aacute;il and would do so in every other election up until, and including, 1987.</P><Col N="816"/>
    <P>He was an immense political organiser. He took over Fine Gael when the party was at a low ebb. He built Fine Gael up again, restructuring and growing its organisation, and breathing new vitality and energy into his party. He took it to 70 seats in November 1982, which, at the time, was an unprecedented level of support for the party. That, by any standards, was an immense political achievement from an outstanding politician of his generation.</P>
    <P>As Taoiseach, and prior to that as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Garret FitzGerald was a strong advocate of peace in Northern Ireland and the resolution of its problems was a lifetime passion for him. Inside or outside of politics, he did what he could to foster reconciliation. He was an implacable opponent of those who espoused violence as a means to a lasting political solution on this island and he worked sincerely towards building an Ireland free of conflict.</P>
    <P>He has the distinction of having being intimately involved in the Sunningdale and Anglo-Irish agreements. The child of reconciliation, as he was labelled in the aftermath of the Civil War, had become a politician who made an immense and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation on this island. He passionately opposed sectarianism, opening his autobiography with the story of where, as an innocent child of four or five, he made a derogatory remark about the religion of his father&rsquo;s colleague, Ernest Blythe. Garret was surprised to hear his mother reply that she, too, was a Protestant. That lesson also stayed with him and in his career, he worked assiduously to heal the wounds on this island and bring Catholic, Protestant and dissenter together. In this respect, he was a pluralist republican and a patriot.</P>
    <P>He was a strong supporter of the European Union and he was passionate about the benefits European Union could bring to this country. Even in recent years, although he had long stepped out of the arena of party politics, Garret took to the campaign trail with vigour and determination to help ensure the passing of EU referenda. I remember canvassing with him during the second Nice referendum and his knowledge of the issues was still infallible and immense. He also brought to campaigning an enthusiasm that was infectious and an energy that left this younger man finding it hard to keep up.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I recall also his strong and visionary speech on his final day as Taoiseach in 1987. Following Mr. Charles Haughey&rsquo;s election by the D&aacute;il, Garret quickly came to his feet and extended his congratulations. He said some inspired words that still have relevance to us and our times. That speech, which is on the record, related to the economic and budgetary measures that the incoming Government would have to take and he offered his support for any legislative action required by that Government to implement the appropriate and necessary budgetary provisions. In essence, those words sowed the seeds for the Tallaght strategy that made an important contribution to Ireland getting beyond our last big financial crisis. He perhaps did not receive the credit he deserved for this and for moving beyond the log-jam of adversarial politics. His words were generous and were those of a politician who put the country before politics. It is this type of sentiment that we should all reflect on today. We need this kind of thinking if Ireland is to surmount today&rsquo;s challenges.</P>
    <P>Although my party did not necessarily agree with Garret on every political issue, I greatly admired his integrity, his abilities and his unfailing politeness and courtesy. He was a person who cared deeply about Ireland and he has given distinguished and patriotic service to our people.</P>
    <P>N&iacute; bheidh a leith&eacute;id ann ar&iacute;s. I extend my sympathies and those of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party to his family, to John, Mark and Mary, and to his friends within the Fine Gael Party.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhr&oacute;n a nochtadh le clann Ghear&oacute;id Mhic Gearailt, le Pairt&iacute; Fhine Gael agus go h&aacute;irithe leis an Taoiseach. Bh&iacute; r&oacute;l m&oacute;r ag an Uasal Mhic <Col N="817"/>Gearailt sa saol polait&iacute;ochta agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; d&iacute;cheallach sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; le blianta fada. Nuair a chuala m&eacute;, go luath ar maidin inniu, go raibh s&eacute; tar &eacute;is b&aacute;s a fh&aacute;il bh&iacute; m&eacute; an-bhr&oacute;nach.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I wish to extend sympathy to the family and friends of Dr. Garret FitzGerald. I extend sympathy especially to the Taoiseach and to the Fine Gael Party. As a Taoiseach, Cabinet Minister and long-serving Teachta D&aacute;la, Dr. Garret FitzGerald played a very significant role in Irish politics in the 1970s and 1980s.</P>
    <P>Obviously, Sinn F&eacute;in profoundly disagreed with him on key and fundamental issues, particularly around the issue of partition, the role of the British Government in Ireland, political censorship and the treatment of republican prisoners. However, these differences are widely known and there is no need to dwell on them this morning. His views were genuinely held and he liked a good debate.</P>
    <P>We did agree on other issues, especially on social matters and Garret played a very positive role in seeking to set aside deeply conservative social legislation in this State, such as the denial of the right to divorce. He was clearly and deeply committed to public life, public service and citizenship, something which is widely recognised across the political spectrum and is to be commended. He set a great example of the role older people can play in public affairs and how we should respect and uphold their right to do so and shape our society so we cherish and actively promote the rights of our senior citizens. I believe Dr. Garret FitzGerald would be pleased with that.</P>
    <P>The death of a public figure is always greeted with public comments and reflections but the real loss is private and personal. To the Taoiseach and to Garret&rsquo;s friends and colleagues in Fine Gael I extend our commiserations and solidarity, and also to his family because aside from the public man there is the private person, the husband, father, the daideo, the gar-dhaideo, the very personal figure that all of have in our personal lives. Especially to his friends, his grandchildren, great-grandchildren, his sons and daughter I extend our warmest and kindest solidarity, commiserations and condolences. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Technical Group I wish to join in the sympathy expressed by all parties to the family of Dr. Garret FitzGerald, especially to John, Mark and Mary. I should state the first day I was in the Seanad, Dr. Garret FitzGerald was Taoiseach and he brought his constitutional crusade to the Seanad on that day. That was the initial move in a crusade the culmination of which we saw last night in Dublin Castle and which we have been seeing all week. Dr. Garret Fitzgerald above anybody else initiated the movement for tolerance, an end to sectarianism, non-violence, equality and respect for minorities, North and South in this country. He started that procedure in 1981 and he lighted a fire which, with various setbacks, has climaxed this week. In that sense we should be very proud of him as a Taoiseach who is responsible for what happened in recent days.</P>
    <P>Constitutional changes followed, some controversial, but they had the common ingredient that they challenged the dominance of great institutions in this country which needed to be challenged. He tackled those taboos which for so long had been the curse of Ireland and he is responsible for that.</P>
    <P>On economic policy, perhaps he was not quite so successful but he was above all a conviction politician. At a time of great cynicism in Irish politics, Dr. Garret FitzGerald followed his convictions, often to his own cost. His first Government fell on a political conviction on which many would have given way but he did not, to his cost. He was prepared at one stage, and the Fine Gael Party will be conscious of this, to take a hit in his constituency where he almost lost his seat in his effort to deliver two seats to the party. Thankfully, he did not lose his seat but <Col N="818"/>he was prepared to make that sacrifice and take that risk, a risk which many other politicians for obvious reasons would not be prepared to take.</P>
    <P>Above all, as the Taoiseach, Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Adams have mentioned, he must be remembered for his contribution to Anglo-Irish relations. The Anglo-Irish Agreement, while controversial in its time was a great achievement in his own terms. His contribution to Anglo-Irish relations was not without setbacks. We heard this morning on the radio once again that very famous outburst from the then British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, when she said &ldquo;out, out, out&rdquo;. That was a major setback for his crusade for Anglo-Irish relations, but he took triumph and disaster fairly comfortably and treated those two imposters just the same.</P>
    <P>He was, above all, a person who was not subject to knee-jerk reaction to political events and he was a human being who was not entranced or enchanted by the trappings of office. I think it was Conor Cruise O&rsquo;Brien, who was a friend and opponent of his in many political spats, who wrote of him that Dr. Garret FitzGerald was as nice a person as you can find in politics but no nicer. What he meant by that was that he was a real human being, which is difficult to be in political terms, but he also had around him a ring of steel and he was prepared to take tough political decisions which were not in his own interest.</P>
    <P>The general consensus in the House and the message which is going out today is that Dr. Garret FitzGerald was above all a human being, an intellectual but with a hugely important human side. There are many anecdotal stories of his devotion to his invalid wife, of him going home and cooking her lunch. There are many stories about his own idiosyncrasies, and the one about him wearing odd shoes is one which will live for a long time in the minds of many people who hold him in such great affection.</P>
    <P>The manner of his departure and its timing this week is something about which he and many of us can be in a strange way very content because he must have been, if he was aware of it, very happy to see that this week, the mission which he embarked upon so courageously in 1981 was almost completed.</P>

   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>As the senior Deputy for Dublin South-East, I wish to extend first and foremost my sympathy to the family and the Fine Gael Party, and to tell the House that I first met Dr. Garret FitzGerald in the 1960s when he was a junior lecturer in the economic section and I was a probably fairly obnoxious architectural student in UCD. The first occupation of a university on this island took place in UCD on the grounds of the pursuit of excellence in that we were dissatisfied with the academic standards for which we had paid and the instruction which we were receiving. We confronted the university authorities with the inadequacy of their own institution and he supported us in that particular struggle even though one of his family was intimately involved in the other side.</P>
   
    <P>As was said, Dr. Garret FitzGerald was an intellectual, a politician, a feminist, a liberal, a European and an Irishman and it was my privilege to have served in government with him, as I did with the Ceann Comhairle and other members of this Cabinet. I loved him dearly and I regret his passing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>As a Deputy for Dublin South-East, perhaps not as senior as the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, I join my Taoiseach and colleagues in expressing my sorrow and extending my sincere sympathy to the FitzGerald family, to John, Mark and Mary, and to the extended family on their sad loss.</P><Col N="819"/>
    <P>Dr. Garret FitzGerald inspired me as a young person to become involved and to take an interest in politics. His integrity, his very obvious sincerity and his unparalleled deep belief in genuine public service convinced me that politics is a noble profession. If anybody personified high standards in high places, it was Dr. Garret FitzGerald. In the not too distant past when I came under some pressure for comments I made, he took the time to approach me to say, &ldquo;Lucinda, never ever waiver, always follow your convictions and always stand up for what you believe in.&rdquo; I will carry those words with me in political life and as long as I am a Member of this House.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Three issues marked him out, some of which have already been alluded to. In regard to Northern Ireland, Dr. FitzGerald had vision and courage which marked him out from the rest. His foresight in mainstreaming the concept of consensus and consent in Northern politics was inspired and visionary. His commitment to democracy, as espoused by the Anglo-Irish Agreement, showed that he was most definitely ahead of his time. It took others many years to catch up with him. Unlike the many who did not subscribe to his view of consensus in the North, Dr. FitzGerald actually came from a family steeped in the republican tradition, as Deputy Martin pointed out. As a result of that, he knew and genuinely understood the importance of consensus rather than division in politics on this island.</P>
    <P>For me, what really marked Dr. FitzGerald out was his commitment and devotion to the European project. It was not an unquestioning and blind commitment to the European project but one which was, nonetheless, deeply supportive of the common European cause. I remember meeting him during the Nice treaty and Lisbon treaty campaigns when despite his years, he was sprightly, energetic and enthusiastic and, most important, he brought young people with him in selling the European ideal on this island. He also brought Fine Gael into the Christian Democratic family in Europe and of that I am deeply proud.</P>
    <P Just="Left">His task of making Fine Gael the most professionally organised party on the island was a goal he fulfilled. He was much more than an academic. He knew Fine Gael, its branch structure and every corner of every constituency in an encyclopedic fashion from which we can all learn. While Fine Gael today is very proud to have such a strong leader in Deputy Enda Kenny, we can all acknowledge that Dr. Garret FitzGerald will continue to be a spiritual leader for the party.</P>
    <P>The FitzGerald family and the island of Ireland has lost a true and inspiring statesman, a genuine political leader and somebody who I was very proud to know and to call a friend. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KevinHumphreys"><NameTxt>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</NameTxt>
	<P>Today Ireland has lost a great patriot. I was deeply saddened this morning when I heard on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, had passed away. I extend my sympathy and that of Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who is away on Government business today, to his family and friends. Like many of the previous speakers, we practised our trade in the shadow of a great politician and a great leader.</P>
    <P Just="Left">His legacy lives on this week in the Queen&rsquo;s first state visit to Ireland. It is a potent reminder of Garret&rsquo;s political courage in the Sunningdale and Anglo-Irish Agreements and it is probably apt that he is remembered today. He was always willing to engage in debate and he had a profound interest in the affairs of our country. He campaigned in European referendums and often led the debate domestically in his <i>The Irish Times</i> column.</P>
    <P>Like many, I was amazed to see him in February tallying the votes following the general election, which he enjoyed doing. He said to me that he would not miss it for the world. Having tallied the votes, he told me at an early stage that he would be calling me &ldquo;Deputy&rdquo; the next time he saw me. That was very important. On the first sitting day of the 31st D&aacute;il, he was on <Col N="820"/>RTE imparting his knowledge and in conversation with Mr. Dick Spring on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo;. One could see how enlivened he was by the democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>Today we have lost a great patriot. The people of Dublin South-East will greatly miss him and will be deeply saddened. We should also mention the late Mr. Joe Doyle who was a great friend and colleague during the many years he represented the area. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak and I hope his family will be encouraged and heartened by the sentiments expressed today.</P>

    <P>The European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, signed by the Council, European Parliament and European Commission in 2007, is the comprehensive policy framework governing the European Union&rsquo;s overall humanitarian aid response.</P>
    <P>The Consensus outlines the common objectives, fundamental humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence, and good practices that the European Union as a whole pursues in this domain. It covers the entire spectrum of humanitarian action, from preparedness and disaster risk reduction, to immediate emergency response and life-saving assistance to vulnerable people in crises, through to situations of transition and onwards to recovery and longer-term development.</P>
    <P>In its recent mid-term review of the European Consensus and its accompanying Action Plan, the Commission confirmed good overall progress in the implementation of the Plan, noting, for example, that humanitarian aid has now become a fully-fledged policy area of the European Union, thanks to the new legal basis provided for it in the Lisbon Treaty. The mid-term review also highlighted improved efforts at coordination and advocacy as well as an ongoing effort to review funding approaches and adapt to growing humanitarian needs, not least due to the increase in the frequency and scale of natural disasters.</P><Col N="822"/>
    <P>The review also noted that the EU, especially when acting together, is particularly well placed to ensure that its humanitarian response is appropriate, effective and based on assessed needs, and can play a useful role in influencing the preparedness of the international humanitarian system as a whole. When taken together, the EU (including both the European Commission and the 27 Member States) represents the largest single provider of humanitarian aid in the world, having provided nearly half of all such assistance in the past three and a half years.</P>
    <P>Ireland is working actively to implement its obligations under the Humanitarian Consensus and in relation to the core humanitarian principles, which are enshrined in Irish Aid&rsquo;s own humanitarian relief policy. During its recent co-chairmanship of the Good Humanitarian Donorship (GHD) initiative, Ireland worked to promote donor compliance with these principles. We will continue to ensure that these remain the cornerstone of the planned revised Humanitarian Aid Regulation and any eventual successor to the current European Consensus.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ireland, along with a number of other EU member states, has led the way in the development of innovative funding approaches, with many providing the largest share of contributions to common funds such as the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which provides quick and flexible funding for UN agencies as and when they occur. Ireland is the sixth largest contributor to the CERF, having provided &euro;81 million since 2006.</P>
    <P>Ireland also continues to pay specific attention to so-called &ldquo;forgotten crises&rdquo;, such as those in the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which receive little media or international donor attention.</P>
    <P Just="Left">While much has already been achieved, Ireland and the EU more generally are committed to further joint efforts on aid effectiveness, including through greater burden-sharing and better coordination, coherence. We will also work to ensure consistency between EU humanitarian aid and other policies, as well as a strengthened EU contribution to the international humanitarian system through stronger advocacy for the protection of humanitarian space, including the promotion of international humanitarian law.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security calls for an increase in the participation of women in peacemaking and peace building processes; the protection of women and girls in armed conflict; and the incorporation of a gender perspective into peacekeeping and peace building processes. Since February 2010, an extensive consultation process, led by my Department, on a draft National Action Plan for implementation of this Resolution has taken place between representatives of various Government Departments, the Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, civil society and academia. The final phase of consultation with the Consultative Group which had been established ended on 18 February this year.</P>
    <P>At a meeting which I had on 16 May with representatives of the Consultative Group, I assured the Group of my commitment to ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 is sent to Government for adoption as a matter of priority. This commitment was welcomed by the representatives of the Group. We agreed to move ahead with finalising the draft over the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 to 26, inclusive, together. </P>
    <P>Addressing the situation of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements with the United States are important priorities for the Government in its relationship with the US Administration and Congress.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged by President Obama&rsquo;s continued commitment to addressing the question of immigration reform. Speaking as recently as 10 May, the President, in an address dedicated to the issue of immigration, reiterated his call for comprehensive reform of the system, and particularly called for the passage of the DREAM Act. Under the DREAM Act qualifying undocumented young people seeking to go to college or join the US military, and who were brought illegally to the US as children, would be eligible to seek regularisation of their status. The re-introduction of the DREAM Act to Congress on 11 May is a welcome development and can be seen as an initial step in the process.</P>
    <P>I am very aware of the difficult situation facing those who are undocumented and living in the USA, as well as the distress caused to families in both Ireland and the US. The most realistic long term solution for our undocumented citizens remains through comprehensive immigration reform.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of Ireland in an amended reciprocal E3 visa scheme, which would allow Irish people with a certain level of education to work in the US on a two year renewable visa, is the most effective way of creating new opportunities for Irish citizens in the USA. The introduction of such a scheme, which has attracted support from a number of members of Congress from both parties, will require the passage of legislation in Congress.</P>
    <P>The successful passage of E3 visa legislation would strengthen the human bridge between the two countries, which underpins our excellent existing bilateral relations, and provide a mechanism for Irish nationals seeking to work in the USA in the future. It is the case, however, that the E3 would not provide a solution to the undocumented Irish in the US.</P>
    <P>I discussed the issue of Irish immigration with Secretary of State Clinton during our meeting on 18 March and with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and the Coalition of Irish Centres in New York on 16 March. The Taoiseach raised the issue of the undocumented and the potential for the continued development of Ireland&rsquo;s migration arrangements with the US with President Obama during his St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to Washington. The Taoiseach also met with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform on 5 May during his recent visit to New York.</P>
    <P>I am very aware of the enormous political challenges that face efforts to pass any immigration related legislations at the current time, including the E3 proposal. These difficulties were clearly <Col N="824"/>demonstrated by the failure of efforts to pass the limited DREAM Bill at the end of 2010- a measure that had enjoyed strong public and political support.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and I will meet with President Obama during the course of his visit to Ireland next week and I expect that immigration related issues will be raised in the course of that meeting.</P>
    <P>My Department, and the Embassy in Washington in particular, will continue to work very actively on the issue with the US Administration, Congressional leaders and Irish immigration reform advocates.</P>

	<P>The applications for the two persons concerned were submitted through the ordinary post, a service which receives a lesser priority in processing terms than those submitted through the Passport Express service and does not have a guaranteed turnaround time. At present passports submitted through the ordinary service are taking between 6 and 10 weeks to process, unless these passports are required for urgent travel. It should also be noted that during the peak summer period, application processing times can lengthen for all passport applications. The Passport Service recommends that all citizens use the Passport Express service when applying for a passport as priority is given to applications submitted through this channel.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that passports for the two persons in question issued on 16 May 2011. The Passport Service regrets the delay in this case.</P>

	<P>The Passport Service is experiencing a surge in demand for passports, unprecedented in volume and timing, apparently fuelled by families taking foreign holidays earlier in the year. The situation is further complicated by the number of applicants who are calling to the counter seeking the urgent renewal of their passports in order to enable them to travel on last-minute bookings. The Passport Service regrets the delay and any difficulties caused in this regard. Additional temporary staff have been recruited and are in training. Within a short period, seasonal overtime and the additional output provided by temporary staff will bring processing times back to normal levels.</P>
    <P>The public can also assist the Passport Service by checking the validity of their passports before making bookings to travel abroad. We would urge that a valid passport be the first item on any check list when considering foreign travel, whereas all too often it appears to be the last.</P>

    <asker> Deputy Finian McGrath</asker>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The details supplied with the Deputy&rsquo;s question concern various differences between the retirement benefits payable under Defined <Col N="825"/>Benefit pension scheme arrangements in the private sector and the public sector. I cannot comment on the specific examples given in the details. I would point out, in the first instance, that the maximum benefits payable under an occupational pension scheme to an individual retiring at normal retirement age whether in the private or public sector is a pension not exceeding two-thirds of the individual&rsquo;s final remuneration. </P>
    <P>In the case of employees who are members of <i>private sector defined benefit occupational pension schemes</i>, pension benefits generally accrue at a basic maximum accrual rate of 1/60th of final remuneration for each year&rsquo;s service up to 40 years which equates to the maximum pension of two-thirds of final remuneration. Private sector schemes almost always give members the right to commute i.e. exchange, part of their pension entitlement for a retirement lump sum up to a maximum of 1.5 times final salary.</P>
    <P><i>Public sector defined benefit schemes</i> on the other hand are, in general, structured so as to offer an accrual rate of 1/80th of final remuneration for each year of service, giving rise to a pension entitlement of 40/80ths or half of final salary. As regards the retirement lump sum, public sector schemes do not provide for the commutation option available in private sector schemes. Instead, such schemes provide for a separate retirement gratuity of up to 1.5 times final remuneration after 40 years service accrued at a rate of 3/80ths of final remuneration for each year of service up to 40 years. The public sector pension of half final salary plus the lump sum of 1.5 times final salary is taken to equate to the maximum pension of two-thirds final salary allowed by the legislation.</P>
    <P>In both the private and public sectors, the tax-free lump sum paid from a defined benefit scheme cannot exceed a lifetime limit of &euro;200,000 and the pension paid from the scheme is subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate.</P>
    <P>In addition, in order to close off excessive tax-relieved funding for pensions, a maximum allowable pension fund for tax purposes (the Standard Fund Threshold or SFT) was introduced in 2005 at the level of &euro;5 million. This is a lifetime limit with punitive tax on amounts drawn down in pension benefits in excess of that sum. The SFT was substantially reduced in the last Budget and Finance Act to &euro;2.3 million.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the temporary 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension scheme assets which I announced in this House last week as part of the Jobs Initiative. If the individual&rsquo;s private pension is paid from an occupational pension scheme by way of an annuity i.e. a stream of income purchased by the trustees of a pension scheme in the name of the individual from a life company at the point of the scheme member&rsquo;s retirement, then the levy should not impact on the person mentioned in the details supplied, as an annuity is not a pension fund. However, the details supplied with the question are not sufficient to allow me to be definitive on this point. </P>
    <P>The chargeable persons for the purpose of the pension fund levy will be the scheme administrators, that is the trustees or other persons having the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. Where pension scheme assets are held in the form of contracts of assurance with life offices, the insurer will be the chargeable person. It will be up to those trustees and administrators to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes or pension plans for which they are responsible. In that regard, and as already indicated since the announcement of the levy, legislative provision is being made to allow pension scheme trustees or administrators the option to adjust the benefits payable under pension schemes or plans.</P><Col N="826"/>
    <P>Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011 is being published today and contains, among other things, the provisions which will give effect to the pension fund levy.</P>

    <Quest> the amount of tax foregone to the State in tax reliefs given to those who put moneys into the private pension funds which are to be the subject of a levy to fund the jobs initiative, for the years 2000 to 2010, inclusive, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
    <QRef>[12217/11]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The following tables provide a breakdown of the estimated cost of tax and PRSI reliefs relating to private pension contributions for 2006, 2007 and 2008, the latest year for which the most up-to-date data is available together with estimates of the notional or imputed cost of the tax exemption for the investment income and gains of approved superannuation funds. Corresponding estimates of the cost of tax reliefs are also provided for 2005 to the extent that it has been possible to provide them on a consistent and comparable basis. Figures have been rounded where appropriate. As similar data sources would not be available for the years prior to 2005, it is not possible to provide costings on a similar basis for those years.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that while corresponding updates of the cost figures are not yet available for the tax year 2009 the necessary work of assembling the basic data to enable this to be done is ongoing. No data are available for 2010.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that while the Deputy has asked for data in relation to pension funds to which the pension levy announced in the recent Jobs Initiative would apply, the estimates of the costs of relief on employee pension contributions cover such contributions made by public servants whose pension schemes are largely unfunded as well as private sector employees. It would not be possible to provide a breakdown of those cost estimates as between the public and private sector.</P>
    <P>Finally, it should be borne in mind that the information imparted by the costing of tax and other reliefs in the pensions area is inherently limited. It may suggest a significant notional loss in terms of tax foregone as compared with the savings that might be expected if the tax relief was not available. However, where tax relief arrangements are of such significance, as in this instance, the removal of the reliefs would represent a fundamental adjustment to the current balance of the tax system and would have very significant implications in terms, among other things, of the economic and behavioural impacts which would ensue. These impacts would be difficult to model in advance. For these reasons, the real informational content of the costings of tax reliefs is limited and should be treated with some caution.</P>

    <Quest> the circumstances whereby a person (details supplied) in County Kildare was led to believe they could expect a tax refund under C45 in the region of &euro;22,000 which was subsequently reviewed on audit; if other audits resulted in a similar reduction of expectation; if the case will therefore be further reviewed in an effort to realise the reduction in line with original indications; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax refund in question was reduced following a Revenue audit when deductions incorrectly claimed were identified and withdrawn. Statistics on other similar cases are not readily available. However, inevitably where Revenue detects incorrect claims for deductions, it will seek to recover the tax loss through collection or restriction of repayment, which is what I would expect.</P>

	<P>The changes to school transport services were announced in the 2011 Budget by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government and derive from a recommendation in the Value for Money Review of the scheme. </P>
    <P>This review identified that, in 2008, the unit cost per primary pupil for the provision of school transport (excluding special needs pupils) was &euro;1,020.</P>
    <P>From the beginning of the 2011/12 school year a &euro;50 charge, which applies to eligible primary pupils, is being introduced to ensure that school transport services are fully utilised in a cost efficient manner. Eligible pupils holding medical cards and pupils with special educational needs will be exempt from paying the charge. In addition, the maximum family charge at primary level for eligible pupils will be &euro;110 per annum. Parents will have the option of spreading the annual payments over two instalments in July and December.</P>
    <P>Given the major financial constraints facing the country, I regret that I cannot reverse the changes to school transport as announced by the previous Government. We all have to understand the legacy of economic mismanagement which the last Government gave to the country.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998 the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school.</P>
    <P>It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any pupil attending. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with the parents, teachers and children, to put preventative measures in place to <Col N="830"/>lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring medication, that appropriate treatment is available.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisations representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so. The position is that either the parents of the child should make themselves available to administer medication as required or where they wish the staff in the school to administer it they should indemnify the school.</P>
    <P>It is my Department&rsquo;s experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and teachers of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to administer the type of medicine which may be required.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</P>
    <P>The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.</P>
    <P>The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and intend to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.</P>

    <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> 5,900 places on the Springboard Initiative (HE). </P>
    <P FLI="0">F&Aacute;S Specific Skills Training &mdash; Specific Skills Training provides a wide range of training courses specific to particular industries. These courses allow job seekers or job changers the opportunity to acquire specific job related skills and formal vocational qualifications to facilitate re-entry to the workforce.</P>
    <P>Courses available under Specific Skills Training include engineering, information technology, office and administration, sales, marketing, management, construction, electronics and clothing.</P>
    <P>The courses lead to FETAC Major Awards at levels 4, 5 and 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications and/or industry recognised certification. These courses range in length from 4 weeks to 26 weeks and interested participants should contact their local F&Aacute;S office or visit the F&Aacute;S website <i>www.F&Aacute;S.ie</i>.</P>
    <P>Back to Education and Post Leaving Certificate Courses: The BTEI provides a range of part-time flexible further education options, mainly at Levels 1-4 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). The BTEI is free for any adult over 16 years of age with less than upper second level options, including the unemployed.</P>
    <P>PLC courses are for school leavers and adults returning to education who wish to upskill and improve their employability in order to enter or re-enter the labour market. PLC courses are full-time and of one year&rsquo;s duration, mainly at Levels 5 and 6 of the NFQ.</P>
    <P>Unemployed people can participate in BTEI courses without affecting their welfare entitlements because they are part-time. Unemployed people who wish to participate in PLC courses may be eligible for the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), paid in lieu of their Social Welfare payment. The terms and conditions of the BTEA are a matter for the Department of Social Protection.</P>
    <P>My Department has written to providers (mainly Vocational Education Committees, VECs) to invite applications for the delivery of the additional BTEI and PLC places, to be prioritised for the unemployed. These applications will be considered in the coming period and the places will be available from September of this year.</P>
    <P>3rd level Springboard Programme: Springboard is the new higher education Fund which is being rolled out for the first time in 2011. The intention to establish a new higher education labour market Fund was announced in December 2010, with proposed funding of &euro;5m in 2011. On the basis of recommendations from an independent expert selection panel received in April 2011, the Government decided as part of the Jobs Initiative to support the delivery of a further 2,400 part time places through Springboard which will now deliver 5,900 part-time higher education places with total funding of &euro;7.8m in 2011. These places will be on courses in areas of current and future skills needs as identified by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. Programmes will be available at all higher education levels from certificate to masters degree level (levels 6-9 on NQF) enabling unemployed people with differing levels of qualifications, including Leaving Certificate, PLC or degree level qualifications to participate. Full details of the Springboard programmes will be published on 25 May 2011.</P>

The intention to establish a new higher education labour market Fund was announced in December 2010, with proposed funding of &euro;5m in 2011. On the basis of recommendations from an independent expert selection panel received in April 2011, the Government decided as part of the Jobs Initiative to support the delivery of a further 2,400 part-time places through Springboard which will now deliver 5,900 part-time higher education places with total funding of &euro;7.8m in 2011. These places will be on courses in areas of current and future skills needs as identified by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. Programmes will be available at all higher education levels from certificate to masters degree level (levels 6-9 on NQF) enabling unemployed people with differing levels of qualifications, including Leaving Certificate, PLC or degree level qualifications to participate. Full details of the Springboard programmes will be published on 25 May 2011.</P>

	<P>The &lsquo;Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme&rsquo; was introduced by F&Aacute;S in 2010 to provide work placement opportunities for redundant apprentices to complete their on-the-job training at Phase 3, 5 and 7. The scheme has been broadened in 2011 to include placements with employers in both the private and the public sectors. The scheme, for which &euro;7.3m in funding is being provided, aims to provide work placements for up to 1,000 apprentices in 2011.</P>
    <P>Under the 2010 scheme, the employment costs of the redundant apprentice, which were in line with industry wage norms, were paid by the employer with F&Aacute;S contributing a weekly subsidy of &euro;250. A total of 443 redundant apprentices availed of this measure in 2010.</P>
    <P>Employers in the private sector and, for the first time, the public sector, may participate in the 2011 scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria. The 2011 scheme requires no wage contribution from the employer but instead a standard training allowance of &euro;260 at Phase 3, &euro;350 at Phase 5 and &euro;400 at Phase 7 is paid to the redundant apprentice by F&Aacute;S. Eligible redundant apprentices are referred by F&Aacute;S to approved employers to participate in the scheme. The maximum period of placement is 26 weeks at Phase 3 or 26 weeks at Phase 5 or 12 weeks at Phase 7.</P>
    <P>The &lsquo;Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme&rsquo; scheme was developed by F&Aacute;S based on discussions with representatives of trade unions and employers represented on the National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee. F&Aacute;S also held discussions with representatives of local authorities, the OPW, ESB Networks and other organisations in the development and implementation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>As at 6 May 2011, 694 redundant apprentices were participating in the scheme.</P>

    <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> &euro;2.8m for the 2,400 Higher Education Springboard places.</P>
    <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The average cost per place for 1,000 F&Aacute;S Specific Skills places is &euro;3,500. The average full year cost of 1,000 approved PLC place is &euro;6 million. This does not include the provision for the Back to Education Allowance for qualifying unemployed participants. There is no standard cost per place for Springboard, however the average cost per place overall is &euro;3,400. The Skills Development and Internship Programme announced in Budget 2011 aimed to provide up to 5,000 places to unemployed people who are at least 3 months unemployed with a 12 month internship in an organisation. The Department of Social Protection is now responsible for this Programme. Minister Burton announced details of a New National Internship Scheme in the Jobs Initiative which will replace the Skills Development and Internship.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Work Placement Programme is providing an additional 5,500 places for the unemployed in 2011. 5,000 of the additional places will be provided in the public sector, with a further 500 additional places for graduates in the private sector. This means that the Work Placement Programme has been expanded from 2,000 places to 7,500 places. The programme is voluntary and unpaid, participants on the programme may be able to retain their existing social welfare entitlements for the duration of their placement subject to the rules of the Department of Social Protection. Therefore this programme is cost neutral to the exchequer. Springboard is the new higher education Fund which is being rolled out for the first time in 2011.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 50 together.</P>
    <P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected. Article 42 of the Constitution provides for the right of parents to choose the form of education they provide or to have provided to their children. Primary legislation gives effect to this right and includes the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.</P>
    <P>None of the foregoing legislation specifically distinguishes between parents who act in concert and those who disagree and are separated, divorced or unmarried. However each provides that &ldquo;parent&rdquo; shall be interpreted to include-</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;a foster parent, a guardian appointed under the Guardianship of Children Acts, 1964 to 1997, or other person acting in loco parentis who has a child in his or her care subject to any statutory power or order of a court and, in the case of a child who has been adopted under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1998, or, where the child has been adopted outside the State, means the adopter or adopters or the surviving adopter&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Enrolment of children is, in the first instance, a matter for Boards of Management rather than my Department and Boards must address the circumstances of each case while respecting any order made by the Court in relation to the custody and welfare of the child. In general, it is my Department&rsquo;s view that both parents should be encouraged to take an active interest in their children&rsquo;s education and it is to the benefit of the children and the school when they do. It is appreciated that practical difficulties for schools can arise where parents are separated. However, my Department&rsquo;s approach to the issue of the rights of separated parents to involvement in their children&rsquo;s education is that the rights of both parents should be respected and <Col N="838"/>given meaningful, practical expression in matters such as school reports, attendance at parent/teacher meetings and other school functions and that generally both parents should receive the same information and level of co-operation from the school. A qualification to that approach would arise where the best interest of the child required a different approach.</P>
    <P>Schools are best placed to exercise their own judgements as to what is appropriate in each individual case given their particular knowledge of the individual circumstances and having regard to any order made by the Court in relation to the custody and welfare of the child.</P>

    <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</askee>
    <Quest> if he will provide the Industrial Development Agency with a sat-nav as perhaps then they could find County Kerry, go there and do something about creating some few jobs if possible, as County Kerry also is part of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 15 IDA supported companies in Kerry employing 1,313 people.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland continues to promote Kerry for new inward investment across the ICT, International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sectors. In line with the National Spatial Strategy, the Agency concentrates its efforts on the linked hub locations of Killarney in South Kerry and Tralee in North Kerry.</P>
    <P>In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA works closely with its existing clients in Kerry to encourage them to expand their operations in the county. The Agency also co-operates with educational institutions in the region in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value-added investment, and with F&Aacute;S in developing the skill sets necessary for upskilling the existing workforce.</P>
    <P>As part of its investment offering, IDA markets all available land and buildings in the county including the Agency&rsquo;s 12 acre Business &amp; Technology Park at Tiernaboul, Killarney and the Kerry Technology Park in Tralee, which is owned and managed by Shannon Development in partnership with the Institute of Technology Tralee.</P>
    <P>However, the challenge in achieving an even spread of investment across the country is intensified as the sophistication of investments increase. These investments require a concentration of highly qualified and educated workers, supporting infrastructure and high level business services. Frequently, competition for FDI comes from city regions with populations in excess of one million people. Dublin is the only recognised city region of scale in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In selecting locations to show companies, IDA Ireland seeks to include locations which have been affected by closures/job losses. Typically, a company is shown three or four selected towns, which can meet its requirements for skills, labour, site and/or buildings, infrastructure, etc. While IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of location, the final decision on location is taken in all cases by the promoting company.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also note that the recent Jobs Initiative had a significant focus on Tourism. The VAT rate reduction and abolition of the Travel Tax will provide an important stimulus to tourism businesses in Kerry and around the country.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) was originally established to adjudicate on disputes about redundancy, however, the scope of the Tribunal was extended on several occasions since its establishment and now deals with disputes under 18 pieces of Employment Rights legislation. Members of the EAT panel &mdash; employee nominee Members, employer nominee Members and independent Chair and Vice-Chairs &mdash; are appointed for fixed terms of office and their services are utilised as required. My Department is responsible for the administration of claims referred to <Col N="840"/>the Tribunal through our provision of staffing resources, ICT facilities and accommodation for the EAT.</P>
    <P>The Tribunal has seen a marked increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the significant economic downturn. Between 2007 and 2009, the number of claims coming to the Tribunal trebled, although there was a slight (7%) decrease in new claims lodged in 2010. However, the first quarter of 2011 continues to show a high level of claims being submitted and contested.</P>
    <P>Tribunal Staff are conscious that parties in dispute are anxious to have claims dealt with as early as possible and are working extremely hard to deal with the sizeable increase in claims submitted to the EAT. In that regard, there has been a large increase in the number of claims disposed of by the Tribunal in recent years. These efforts have resulted in a 51% increase in cases disposed of in 2010 over 2008.</P>
    <P>The increased number of cases referred to the EAT in recent times has, nonetheless, had a strong impact on case processing timeframes. I am informed that the longest waiting periods at the end of April 2011 ranged from 50 weeks to 89 weeks, although such figures can be somewhat misleading in terms of the very different nature of claims referred to the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Although the Tribunal conducts hearings in about 36 locations across the State, where the number of cases is relatively small, the Tribunal may wait until a sufficient number of cases is on hand before hearings in certain locations can be listed so as to maximise value for money in relation to the costs of hearings outside Tribunal HQ. Once a critical mass of cases is assembled, 5 days of hearings in a single location can reduce the &ldquo;waiting time&rdquo; in the area concerned by approximately 30 weeks.</P>
    <P>In relation to managing its caseload and costs, I understand that the Tribunal targets areas with the longest waiting period and highest level of claims outstanding, within the resources it currently has available, when scheduling hearings.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Tribunal has been pro-active in driving efficiencies as it addresses the significantly increasing demands for its services at a time of significantly constrained resources. Divisions of the Tribunal are sitting longer, listing more cases per hearing, and seeking to manage the caseload so as to maximise efficiency. These efficiencies have resulted in improvements in the service provided to individual applicants and respondents and have also resulted in an increase in the Tribunal&rsquo;s output. In this connection, over 6,000 claims were processed between January and end-December 2010 &mdash; the highest number on record.</P>
    <P>The Tribunal is also piloting the streaming of certain types of cases in particular, in order to increase the number of cases being dealt with and assist parties in these instances. The Tribunal is also in the processing of developing a &ldquo;fillable&rdquo; electronic form, which will facilitate the more expeditious processing of a claim form once lodged. Furthermore, the Tribunal is piloting a specialist Division to hear claims submitted in relation to redundancy payments which are significant in number and where determinations by the EAT are necessary.</P>
    <P>Most recently, my Department has supported the Tribunal in processing its increased caseload through the assigning of additional Tribunal Secretaries and support from the National Employment Rights Authority of the Department in managing the administration of case logging and document preparation. Such cross-unit support has been a vital support to the Tribunal in tackling its caseload.</P>
    <P>All of these measures are being taken against the backdrop of severe resource constraints &mdash; both monetary and staffing &mdash; and I can assure the Deputy that my Department will keep the <Col N="841"/>workload challenges for the Tribunal under review with a view to assisting it further improve its levels of customer service.</P>

	<P>In order to qualify for Domiciliary Care Allowance a child must have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age. This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living. The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months. </P>
    <P>Eligibility for Domiciliary Care Allowance is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required. No disability automatically qualifies or disqualifies a child for the allowance. Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.</P>
    <P>In the case of an application which is refused on medical grounds, the applicant may submit additional information and/or ask for the case to be reviewed by a different Medical Assessor specially designated for this task.

	<P>The Programme for Government states that a new National Employment and Entitlements Service will be established under the management of the Department of Social Protection. The objective is to integrate the employment support services currently provided directly by the Department of Social Protection with those currently provided by F&Aacute;S into a single service. This service will also process payments in respect of employment related benefits and other benefits payable by the Department of Social Protection. The integration of employment services and related benefit payment services within the Department of Social Protection will provide a &lsquo;one stop shop&rsquo; for people wishing to establish their benefit entitlements, seek employment and / or seek advice about their training options. The focus will be very much on the individual, his / her rights to a payment, his / her access to an opportunity to engage in employment, training or upskilling, as appropriate and his / her responsibility to engage with such opportunities as they are provided. This should improve a person&rsquo;s life chances.  It should be noted that responsibility for skills training undertaken by F&Aacute;S currently resides with the Department of Education and Skills. The future development of the training and skills services of F&Aacute;S is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.</P>
    <P>With regard to the timeline for the development of the National Employment and Entitlements Service, I am determined that this will be completed in the most expeditious manner possible and my officials are already actively engaged in a programme of work towards this end.</P>
    <P>The administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has already been transferred to the Department of Social Protection with the secondment of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive at the beginning of this year. The intention is to have the staff fully transferred into the Department by the end of September this year. This will enable us to integrate the payment of all benefits into one organisation simplifying customer processes.</P>
    <P>Planning for the transfer and integration of the Employment Services and Community Employment Services of F&Aacute;S to the Department has already commenced and it is envisaged that the transfer of staff will commence later this year. Again this will enable us to simplify and integrate the delivery of employment support services to customers.</P>
    <P>A key objective of the Government in relation to the new service is that it will offer users a high level of personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment. This will be achieved through the use of proactive approaches and modern case management systems.  A number of pilot projects have already commenced in relation to the development of case management, the identification of those who are most at risk of falling into long-term unemployment, and the provision of appropriately tailored responses to their needs.  These pilot projects will be completed and evaluated in the coming months after which approaches will be developed for their rollout nationwide as part of the National Employment and Entitlements Service.</P>

	<P>The National Internship Scheme is a key part of the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative. It will provide up to 5,000 unemployed people with an internship opportunity ranging from 6 to 9 months in an organisation in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors. During this time, participants will receive an allowance, which will consist of a &euro;50 per week top up on their existing social welfare entitlements. </P>
    <P>The Internship scheme will assist in breaking that cycle whereby unemployed people cannot get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers whose existing skills will not be appropriate to the types of jobs that will emerge in post- recession Ireland. The scheme will give young people a real opportunity to gain valuable experience to bridge the gap between study and the beginning of their working lives.</P>
    <P>Work is being finalised on the development of the National Internship Scheme so that it will be ready for launch by the beginning of July. The Scheme will have its own website which will facilitate organisations applying online when they have internships to offer. A website will be available shortly on which potential host organisations and potential interns can learn more about the Scheme and can also register expressions of interest.</P>

	<P>There are a number of statutory conditions that must be met by a person to qualify for a lone parent family payment and, accordingly, claims can involve significant processing. He or she must be habitually resident in the State, have the main care and charge of at least one child, must not be cohabiting and must satisfy a means test. It may also be necessary to establish that efforts have been made to obtain maintenance from the former spouse or partner before a decision can be made. Most applications also require a home visit from an inspector.</P>
    <P>The Department aims to award 90% of one parent family payment claims in 10 weeks. Nationally, 45% of decisions meet the target, while in Balbriggan, 24% of claims are decided in 10 weeks. The national average processing time for a one parent family payment claim in <Col N="844"/>April 2011 was 15 weeks, while in Balbriggan it was 30 weeks. The majority of applicants are in receipt of another social welfare payment pending a decision on a one parent family claim.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is a backlog of one parent family claims pending decision in Balbriggan, but am assured that a programme of work is currently underway to address the situation and reduce processing times to a more acceptable level.</P>

	<P>The then Minister for Finance announced the introduction of a community work placement initiative for up to 5,000 people in his Budget Statement to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 7 December 2010. The initiative, known as T&uacute;s, was launched on 21 December 2010. Work on developing the necessary implementation structures, including running trials, has been under way since then. The aim of T&uacute;s is to provide short-term, quality work opportunities for those who have been unemployed for more than a year. The criteria applying to the recruitment of the supervisor or team leader and to the selection of participants for work placements are the same. A candidate must satisfy certain conditions. He or she must be unemployed and in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for at least 12 months; be in receipt of jobseekers allowance; and be fully unemployed. These criteria ensure the focus of T&uacute;s is on those who are long-term unemployed. For this reason, eligibility is confined to those on the Live Register for 12 months and in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. These provisions ensure a targeted approach to those affected by long-term unemployment.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The Government decided in 1997 to approve the redevelopment of Ballymun and a regeneration programme commenced in 1998. The provision of rent supplement in the Ballymun designated area was identified by housing authorities as a risk to the tenure diversity objective of the project which is to achieve a more balanced tenure mix by providing additional private market housing. In response to the concerns about achieving a tenure balance mix, section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pen<Col N="847"/>sions Act 2007 provided that a payment of rent supplement can be refused in respect of accommodation which is situated in an area notified to the Minister for Social Protection by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government as being an area of regeneration.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government advised in 2008 that, on the advice of Dublin City Council, he had decided that the Ballymun area merited designation as an area of regeneration for the purposes of section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007. Accordingly, with effect from 27 November 2008, rent supplement is not paid in respect of accommodation situated in the Ballymun regeneration area, as outlined by the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government. The measures provided for in section 25 are not a blanket refusal of rent supplement in areas of regeneration. Specific provision is made to ensure that people already residing in such areas and in receipt of rent supplement may continue to receive payment; and that people already residing in such areas in private rental accommodation and who may have recourse to rent supplement in the future would not have their entitlement restricted. It is not intended that the section 25 provisions will be open-ended and will be reviewed jointly by the Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government when the Ballymun regeneration is completed in 2012 or earlier, if appropriate.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The primary purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term assistance, rather than to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. Rent limits are set at levels that enable different types of eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State. The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household and market conditions. Furthermore, it is essential that State support for tenants does not give rise to inflated rental prices and overcharging by landlords. Setting or retaining maximum rent limits at a higher level than are justified by the open market can have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels. This in turn may worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with a particularly negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes who are trying to support themselves without State aid. The Department continually monitors current market conditions throughout the country so the existing limits allow eligible households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation. A breakdown of rent supplement expenditure and recipient numbers by local authority is not available. National statistics are provided in the following tabular statement.</P>

	<P>The voluntary bog purchase scheme was closed to new applicants in May 2010. The processing of those applications on hand has been slower than anticipated due to capacity constraints in undertaking the conveyancing work involved. The voluntary bog purchase scheme does not provide for the payment of interest due to delays. The vendor will be contacted as progress is made in advancing the sale. The Government recently announced a number of decisions regarding the future management of peatlands in Ireland and, in particular, the protection of bogs designated as Special Areas of Conservation and Natural Heritage Areas. In addition to the establishment of an independent Peatlands Council, the Government has announced a compensation package for turf cutters in sites where continued turf cutting is no longer possible for reasons of environmental protection. My Department will write to all remaining applicants under the voluntary purchase scheme in the coming weeks to outline their options in light of the availability of alternative compensation arrangements.</P>

	<P>Between 2008 and 2010, St. Finbarre&rsquo;s Cathedral in Cork received &euro;104,000 in funding for conservation works under the Civic Structures Conservation Grants Scheme, which is administered by my Department. In addition, the Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, provided funding of &euro;310,500 for the cathedral under the Significant Places of Public Worship Grants Scheme between 2008 and 2010. I understand that St. Finbarre&rsquo;s Cathedral applied for funding under this scheme in 2011 but was unsuccessful in its application. Due to a significant reduction in the budgetary allocation for built heritage, the operation of the Civic Structures Conservation <Col N="849"/>Grants Scheme has been suspended. Limited funding is being provided through a Structures at Risk Fund in 2011 to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2010. Details of the operation of the fund have been issued to each local authority. The closing date for the receipt of applications under this scheme has passed. No application was received by my Department in respect of St. Finbarre&rsquo;s Cathedral for funding under the Structures at Risk Fund.</P>

	<P>The allocation of specific numbers in the 116 number range of numbers, which are reserved for services of social value, is managed in Ireland by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). In November 2007, ComReg alerted potential service providers, through an advertisement campaign, to the existence of the range of numbers beginning with 116, including the 116000 hotline for missing children. The November 2007 advertisement invited suitable applicants to apply for the setting up of services of social value under the specified numbers. I am advised by ComReg that no organisation has yet applied for the missing children hotline number 116000.</P>
    <P>The revised telecoms package obliges Member States to be more proactive by promoting and encouraging the provision of &ldquo;116&rdquo; services and ensuring that citizens are adequately informed of the existence and use of such services. It also requires Member States not only to reserve the 116000 number but also to make every effort that a service for reporting missing children is actually available in their jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>While my Department does not have a policy function in relation to the provision of services of social value, it is responsible for the transposition of the revised telecoms package and has been engaging with those Departments under which the policy function for such services falls in order to ensure that the Directives are adequately transposed and effected.</P>
    <P>In an effort to make progress on the provision of this service in Ireland, my Department has had discussions with both the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence and Department of Health and Children, which have policy functions in the area of missing children and child protection.</P>

	<P>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the Better Energy programme on behalf of my Department. The fuel poverty strand of Better Energy aims to provide energy efficiency improvements to low-income homes unable to afford the cost of implementing such measures. An additional &euro;10 million was provided for low-income housing retrofits in the recent Jobs Initiative. This will enable over 20,000 low-income homes to benefit from energy efficiency retrofit measures this year.</P>
    <P>The key eligibility criteria for the scheme is that the householder is in receipt of a fuel allowance, invalidity or disability benefit with some additional flexibility allowed for exceptional hardship cases. The fuel allowance is a supplementary allowance available to persons already in receipt of benefits including disability and invalidity benefit. As the fuel allowance is means tested, it is the best available indicator of the lowest income and most vulnerable homes. In addition to utilising the fuel allowance criterion, the SEAI and the community-based organisations work in close partnership with local networks of poverty and community support organisations including public health nurses, MABS and the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul to identify particularly vulnerable homes.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant uptake in applications and interest in the scheme over the last three years. This has resulted in very high volumes of applications which have, in certain instances, led to delays in having works completed. If the Deputy wishes to forward details of specific instances to my office I would be happy to have my officials pursue the matter. Alternatively, queries in relation to individual applications can be addressed to the SEAI hot line &mdash; 1800 250 204 where all queries from scheme applicants and public representatives are dealt with immediately.</P>

    <P>In general, an overall ceiling of &euro;150,000 grant aid per project applies to projects under the LEADER Axes of the RDP and the local action groups delivering the Programme on behalf of my Department are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances local action groups may award grant aid in excess of &euro;150,000 where they get the approval of my Department to do so. It is in this context that my Department is currently examining the project in question.</P>
    <P>Given the level of funding involved and the need to ensure value for money, a full and detailed assessment of such projects is vital. In addition LEADER activities are co-financed by the European Union at a rate of 55% and accordingly come within the remit of a strict regulatory regime.</P>
    <P>The assessment of such projects usually involves detailed consultations with the relevant local action group and frequently necessitates the provision of further documentation or clarifications.

    <Quest> the steps he will take to assist homeowners whose properties have heave inducing pyrite, in terms of the establishment of a taskforce into the quarries which sold the infill, or measures to get the Construction Industry Federation to deal with the fact that Homebond has insufficient cover to deal with potential claims; and the changes he plans to bring to the building regulations to ensure that this does not happen again. </Quest>

   <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The current pyrite problems were first brought to the attention of my Department in mid-2007 and it acted quickly in taking appropriate action to address them.</P><Col N="855"/>
    <P>Following an intervention from my Department, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) published a new amended Standard Recommendation on the use of aggregates as infill for civil engineering and road construction work. The new Standard Recommendation came into effect on 7 December 2007 and it addresses the quality standards of new homes and buildings in so far as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Building Regulations set out the legal requirements for the construction of new buildings, including houses, and the related technical guidance documents provide guidance on how to comply with those regulations. The relevant Technical Guidance Document of the Building Regulations dealing with Site Preparation was amended to incorporate the revised NSAI Standard Recommendation.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am aware that HomeBond, a private company which provides a ten-year structural guarantee for new houses, has included the amended NSAI Standard Recommendation in their published 6th edition of the house building manual.</P>
    <P>I attach a high priority to consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings and I have asked my Department to prioritise the formulation of policy proposals that will enhance compliance with, and enforcement of, the building regulations generally.</P>
    <P>I consider that the actions I have outlined above are appropriate responses in light of my Department&rsquo;s responsibilities and I do not think that the setting up of a task force is warranted or indeed would be useful in providing a resolution to the problem.</P>
    <P>Undertaking remedial works to homes affected by pyrite is a matter for the parties concerned, namely the building owner, the relevant developer and the builder&rsquo;s insurers. Where the construction of a building is the subject of a contract between the client and the builder enforcement is a civil matter.</P>
    <P>I understand that following lengthy court proceedings in relation to a number of homes affected by pyrite in north Dublin, a settlement was recently reached and a trust fund established to enable remedial works to be carried out to those houses. Other legal proceedings are currently in progress.</P>
    <P>The Construction Industry Federation is a representative body for business involved in the construction industry and HomeBond is a private company. I have no function in relation to either of these bodies.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</P>
    <P>The procurement option chosen for any scheme under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 is based on an assessment of the best value for money from a whole life perspective. Each proposal is examined on a case by case basis and local authorities are obliged <Col N="856"/>by the Department to examine all potential options before deciding on an appropriate procurement option.</P>
    <P>The overriding consideration is that all projects must deliver value for money and to this end Department Circular L5/06 of 29 May, 2006 &mdash; <i>&lsquo;Water Services Public Private Partnerships &mdash; Public Sector Benchmark and Post Project Review&rsquo;</i> &mdash; sets out the need for a Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) in each case where Public Private Partnership (PPP) approach is the preferred procurement option. The PSB approach consists of a comprehensive risk adjusted costing of the project elements over the whole life of the project, and enables a comparison to be made on a like for like basis between traditional and PPP &mdash; Design/Build/Operate procurement to ensure that the best value for money procurement option is chosen. This normally relates to projects with a value in excess of &euro;5 million.</P>

    <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
    <askee>Minister for Justice and Equality</askee>
    <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the danger posed by the development of cults within Ireland; if he has a working group or plan on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
    <QRef>[12108/11]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy will appreciate that the word &lsquo;cult&rsquo; is a chameleon-hued word that may get its colours in any given context from the subjective views of the speaker, and that there are no clear, specific, manageable, and universally accepted criteria for identifying cults.</P>
    <P>In our constitutional democracy, as the Deputy knows, we have a firm constitutional guarantee, in Article 44, of freedom of religion and freedom of conscience. A person&rsquo;s convictions about ultimate concerns such as the meaning of life and the purpose of existence and how to live a life of worth and value is a profound part of the privacies of life and existential thought. It is of course a reality that one person&rsquo;s cult may be another person&rsquo;s faith.</P>
    <P>It is self-evident, however, that no one may engage in conduct that is directed at a specific person and causes substantial distress to that person, even for the purposes of forcing that person to join or belong to a religious group. In this connection, it may be helpful to point out that section 10 of the <i>Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997</i> provides for the offence of harassment. Thus, any person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, by any means including by use of the telephone, harasses another by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with him or her, commits the offence of harassment.</P>
    <P>Moreover, a person harasses another when (<i>a</i>) he or she, by his or her acts intentionally or recklessly, seriously interferes with the other&rsquo;s peace and privacy or causes alarm, distress or harm to the other, and (<i>b</i>) his or her acts are such that a reasonable person would realise that the acts would seriously interfere with the other&rsquo;s peace and privacy or cause alarm, distress or harm to the other.</P>
    <P>The Deputy might also note that, under section 10(3) of the 1997 Act, when a person is found guilty of this offence, the court may, in addition to or as an alternative to any other penalty, order that the person must not, for such period as the court may specify, communicate by any means with the other person or that the person shall not approach within such distance as the court shall specify of the place of residence or employment of the other person. To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s second question, I have at the moment no plan to set up a working group to study the subject of cults.</P>

   <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department in August 2004. On examination of the application it was determined that the person concerned did not meet the statutory requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. A letter informing the applicant of this was issued on 28 February 2006.</P>
    <P>A new application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person in question was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department in May 2009. The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>In that context, as I outlined in response to Parliamentary Question Number 69 of 7th April last, I can inform the Deputy that I have initiated steps within my Department to provide for speedier processing of applications to bring about a substantial reduction in the processing timescale. The new arrangements will be publicly announced once my Department is in a position to implement them.</P>
    <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>
    <P>I should<b> </b>remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

    <P LI="2"><i>Level of Funding</i></P>
    <P LI="2" el="0">The cost to the Department for 2010/2011 was approximately &euro;38,000. 59 staff participated in the course for the academic year 2010/2011. A total of 359 staff have now completed the course since it commenced in 2005.</P>
    <P LI="2"><i>Future Plans</i></P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, enforcement of a judgment in a civil matter may be effected by way of an execution order, which would be executed by the sheriff or, if outside Dublin and Cork, the County Registrar in his/her capacity as under-sheriff. On receipt of the execution order, it is then a matter for the sheriff/county registrar to conduct a seizure of the judgment sum and associated fees or <Col N="861"/>goods to that value from the judgment debtor.

	<P>The Short-Stay Visa Waiver Programme provides for visa-free travel to Ireland for the holders of UK visas from certain countries. The Waiver Programme is aimed at people on short trips to the UK who might wish to also visit Ireland and it is expected to cover mainly tourists and business people from the countries concerned. It is also intended to introduce procedures which could cater for, insofar as is possible, citizens of the countries concerned who are long term residents of the UK and who wish to visit Ireland for short stays such as business or tourism and who present an insignificant risk of irregular migration.</P>
    <P>The Waiver Programme will be introduced on a pilot basis from 1 July of this year to October 2012 (to cover London Olympics period and beyond). This start date is based on enacting secondary legislation (by way of Statutory Instrument) to define the categories of people covered by the Waiver Programme.</P>
    <P>The pilot programme will be monitored throughout its running and is capable of being amended or expanded at any point.</P>

	<P>The persons concerned, a husband and wife, were granted permission to remain in the State, on Stamp 4 conditions, initially for a one year period to 26th January, 2006, following the consideration of their respective cases under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). This permission was renewed on a number of subsequent occasions, most recently on 24th June, 2008, when the persons concerned were granted permission to remain in the State for a further three year period, to 24th June, 2011.</P>
    <P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the first named person concerned was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in November, 2002. On examination of the application it was determined that the person concerned did not meet the statutory requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. A letter informing the applicant of this was issued on 1st February, 2005. No new application has since been received.</P>
    <P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the second named person concerned was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in July, 2010. The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In that context, as I outlined in response to Parliamentary Question No. 69 of 7 April last, I can inform the Deputy that I have initiated steps within my Department to provide for the speedier processing of naturalisation applications to bring about a substantial reduction in the processing time-scale. The new arrangements will be publicly announced once my Department is in a position to implement them.</P>
    <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>

   <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>There are several contestable assumptions in the Deputy&rsquo;s question including the overall inference that delays in processing asylum applications are the exclusive responsibility of the State. The reality is rather more complex even if it must be acknowledged that the present legal system is seriously out of date.</P>
    <P>The direct provision system is designed to deliver humane and cost efficient housing for persons who are awaiting determination of their asylum claim. It is my objective to speed up the asylum determination process to the greatest possible extent consistent with natural justice and asylum law.</P>
    <P>It is also my resolve to keep the number of persons housed in this system as low as humanly possible consistent with the needs for temporary accommodation for this group. Any credible report of poor conditions in centres providing this service is investigated promptly by my officials and taken seriously by me. I am advised that many complaints about accommodation around the country are inspired by the desire of residents to be accommodated elsewhere i.e. in large cities like Dublin. This is an understandable perspective but not one to which the State can or should defer.</P>

   <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ireland is currently contributing 129 Defence Forces personnel to 11 different missions throughout the world. The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed, are the EU-led operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 44 personnel and the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 12 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the EU, OSCE and NATO. On foot of a request from the United Nations, the House last month approved the despatch of a Defence Forces contingent of some 440 personnel for service with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. The total number of personnel deployed overseas will amount to approximately 570 when the contingent is fully deployed in late June 2011. This represents a significant contribution to international peacekeeping operations and the obligations Ireland has assumed through its membership of the UN.</P><Col N="869"/>
    <P>In addition, following a request from the Operation Commander for EUFOR Libya, the Government this week approved the despatch of 2 members of the Defence Forces to serve in the Operational headquarters for the mission which is based in Rome. The staff will be engaged in the development of plans and options in relation to a possible EU mission to support the delivery of humanitarian assistance in the region. This operation will be distinct and separate from the current NATO-led operation. A further Council decision would be required to launch the operation, which will only be undertaken should the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs request assistance from the EU.</P>
    <P>Apart from the above requests, no other deployments are planned or envisaged at this time.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to overseas operations is important, primarily in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to international peace and security and the protection of people caught in conflict, but also in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation and credibility, its commitment to the UN and the development and maintenance of Defence Forces capabilities. I am committed to ensuring that the Defence Forces continue to contribute in a meaningful way to overseas operations, at an appropriate level which is sustainable within the resources available for Defence.</P>
    <P>In terms of discussions at EU and the UN, since I have taken up office, I have not, as yet, had an opportunity to meet with my EU colleagues to discuss issues relating to the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Development Policy. However, officials in my Department and Military representatives regularly attend meetings that cover a wide range of issues in this area, including current operations, cooperation with other international organisations, including the United Nations and NATO in relation to peace support operations, and the development of EU military and civilian capabilities for crisis management operations. I am regularly updated in this regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 130 together.</P>
    <P>During the CAP Health Check negotiations, agreement was reached on the use of unspent funds under the single payment scheme; the sheep sector was identified as vulnerable and in need of specific supports. This scheme, which focuses on those flocks with breeding ewes, is designed to assist in the maintenance of the national breeding flock, thereby acting as a real incentive to farmers anxious to maintain their production levels, which are essential for the future of a viable sheep industry in this country<i>. </i> The Scheme will operate for three years, 2010, 2011 and 2012, with a total budget of &euro;54 million, i.e. &euro;18 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Under the 2010 scheme, 3,825 applications were received from persons in County Mayo and, to date, payment has issued in respect of 3,489 of these. Processing of the remaining 336 cases is currently nearing conclusion, with a view to payments issuing shortly, where eligibility is confirmed.</P>

	<P>The format of the EU Pet Passport is laid down in Commission Decision 2003/803/EC. The passport contains the unique identification of the dog or cat with information on vaccinations and additional treatments. It is used in a similar manner to passports for humans i.e. it accompanies the pet on all travel between countries to assist in border control. There is no expiry date and in most cases a passport would last the lifetime of the animal. Thus it would not be possible to print one unique destination on a passport.</P>

    <QRef>[12221/11]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>In June 2006, the Report of a Working Group on haemochromatosis was published. It examined the nature and extent of haemochromatosis in Ireland and advised on the actions necessary to address the problems caused by it. The Report makes a series of recommendations relating to the management and treatment of haemochromatosis. The report was circulated to the HSE and other relevant organisations for implementation.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The HSE is currently formulating a programme to ensure that everyone with haemochromatosis will have early access to diagnosis and treatment in every part of the country. This approach will include a programme of awareness among primary and secondary care clinicians including GPs, hospital doctors, nurses in primary, secondary and community care roles, nutritionists and physiotherapists. It is envisaged that access to quality care will be provided by an integrated programme of community-based and hospital-based diagnostic and regular review services. This will be combined with easy-access community-based phlebotomy clinics in appropriate locations throughout the country. Many people with haemochromatosis are eligible to become blood donors, and many already do so both at regular blood donation clinics and especially at a specific clinic held every week by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. This <Col N="873"/>has been a very successful and welcome development, and it is expected that increased access of donors with haemochromatosis to regular blood donation clinics will form part of the programme.</P>
    <P>In addition, a sum of &euro;100,000 was granted to the Irish Haemochromatosis Association, from my Department&rsquo;s National Lottery funding, in December 2010 to support the Association in raising awareness about the condition. The Association, which has around 1,600 members, has an informative website and publishes regular newsletters. With the additional funding it intends to publish and circulate information to GPs, practice nurses and newly diagnosed patients and to create greater awareness of the condition among medical professionals and the general public.</P>

	<P>With effect from 1 May 2011, functions relating to the co-ordination of the National Drugs Strategy, including responsibility for the drugs initiative budget transferred to the Department of Health and Children from the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs. In excess of &euro;33m has been made available for the Drugs Initiative this year, of which &euro;9.7m has been allocated to support some 134 community-based drugs projects in Regional Drugs Task Force areas. </P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government (Government for National Recovery 2011-2016), this Government has committed itself to supporting the principles and objectives of a national strategy to deal with issues relating to the misuse of both drugs and alcohol.</P>
    <P>A Steering Group has been working to develop proposals and make recommendations on the alcohol aspects of a National Substance Misuse Strategy. The drugs element of the Strategy is already in place in the National Drugs Strategy 2009-16 which was published in 2009.</P>
    <P>The work of the Steering Group is well advanced and I expect that the report and its recommendations will be finalised as quickly as possible. On completion, the Report of the Steering Group will be submitted for consideration and proposals are likely to be put to Government thereafter.</P>

	<P>The free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 as a universal programme to provide children with a free preschool year, normally in the year before <Col N="874"/>they commence primary school. There is no entitlement under the ECCE programme for a second year of free preschool provision. Where a child has special needs, his or her parents can apply to have the preschool year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the scheme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year. However, I understand that the pro-rata option has not been availed of in the case referred to by the Deputy and the child in question will have availed of the full free preschool provision at the end of this academic year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147, 150 and 151 together. </P>
    <P>The issue of consent for the treatment of children is not governed by specific legislation. What is required in a given situation falls to be determined on the basis of the facts of an individual case. In medical emergencies, for example, urgent treatment may be provided to a child in the absence of express consents where it is necessary to save the life of the child. The age of the child is also relevant with this issue being provided for in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 for children over 16 years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s questions suggest that there is a lack of consistency with regard to the issue of consent for separated parents between national guidelines developed by the HSE and those being operated by individual hospitals at local level. My Department is advised by the HSE that the issues raised by the Deputy have been the subject of specific consideration with a view to developing guidance on how the complexities of these matters may be addressed. The HSE sought and obtained legal advice on these matters and this is currently under consideration within the Executive.</P>
    <P>The legal framework for guardianship is set out in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 and is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>With regard to contact between children and parents with whom they do not live, the Health Service Executive, the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Ballymun Regeneration Limited, the Family Support Agency and Pobal have recently concluded an agreement <Col N="875"/>to progress the development of a co-funded Child and Family Contact Centre Initiative. The purpose of the initiative is to provide, for a specified period, a child and family contact centre service, to evaluate the impact on children and families of the service and to inform the development of any future child and family contact centre services in the Irish context.</P>

	<P>When the case was received by HSE, it was assessed using the Investigation Procedure and Toolkit under the HSE established National Incident Management Protocol. The level of the investigation was decided by reference to the National Incident Protocol in light of the information on the case received by HSE. The case has therefore been investigated under that protocol by the HSE. Factors that contributed to this maternal death were identified in this review. To address these contributory factors and to prevent future harm arising from them 11 actions were recommended. The hospital has indicated that 8 of the 11 recommendations have been implemented. Work on the outstanding 3 recommendations is in progress and due for completion shortly.</P>

	<P>Unaccompanied minors seeking asylum are in need of care and protection under the Child Care Act 1991 and are entitled to the same treatment and rights as indigenous young people. The immediate and the ongoing needs of separated children seeking asylum relating to accommodation, medical and social needs as well as their application for refugee status are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) and the Child Care Act 1991. Where children are identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at the point of entry, as being separated children seeking asylum, they are placed into the care of the HSE.  </P>
    <P>In accordance with the Implementation Plan on the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse 2009, which contained a commitment that the HSE would end the use of separately run hostels for separated children seeking asylum and accommodate children in mainstream care, on a par with other children in the care system, the HSE phased out the hostel type of care arrangement with the provision of care for separated children seeking asylum being <Col N="877"/>provided on a national basis with each child cared for in foster care or a residential care placement or equivalent. These placements are subject to the implementation of national standards. Accordingly, since January 2010, hostels have not been used to accommodate unaccompanied minors.</P>
    <P>The HSE has developed a national policy on the standard of services to be provided to separated children seeking asylum. The policy seeks to achieve equity and equality of services to separated children seeking asylum <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> indigenous or resident children and to ensure that there is no differentiation of care provision, care practices, care priorities, standards or protocols.</P>
    <P>The HSE in cooperation with the Refugee Integration Agency, operated by Department of Justice and Law Reform, has agreed a policy for the transfer of separated children into adult services once they reach the age of 18.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Current rules require that a person applying for a first learner permit for car and motorbike category must submit an eyesight report. In addition, everyone over 70 years of age must submit a medical report which incorporates an eyesight test. Those licence applicants who suffer from serious eyesight diseases, including diplopia, defective binocular vision or serious loss of visual field must also submit a medical report with an application for a driving licence or learner permit. Applicants for truck and bus licence categories must supply a medical report incorporating an eyesight test with every application for a permit or a licence.</P>
    <P>Rules regarding eyesight requirements for various categories of driving licence were most recently amended by the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2010 (S.I. No. 544 of 2010). These changes were introduced in order to comply with EU standards. Regular examinations are required for licence renewals in cases where progressive eye diseases have been identified. In practice, where a doctor is satisfied they can certify that eyesight meets the standard. In cases where a doctor has concerns, he or she will refer the person to a consultant or ophthalmologist for further testing. Neither my Department nor any body under the aegis of my Department has any role in determining fees payable to the medical professional.</P>

    <Quest> if he will acknowledge that Galway Airport generates more revenue for the State via taxes and charges than it receives by way of subsidies, that it is in fact cost neutral; his plans for regional airports such as Galway Airport in view of their importance for business links, particularly multinationals; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
    <QRef>[12279/11]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I fully recognise the value of Galway Airport in terms of the numbers employed directly and indirectly at the Airport and the role that it has played in the economic development of the region. However, I do not accept that it generates more revenue for the State than it receives. Passengers using an alternative airport will spend much the same amount of money on air fares and other expenditure and the tax paid on this will still accrue to the exchequer albeit from another county. The future for Ireland does not lie in borrowing money from the IMF/EU to subsidise jobs that cannot sustain themselves. It lies in substantial, unsubsidised and viable businesses <Col N="880"/>and jobs they support. I do accept, however that spending cuts do take money out of the economy and that can impact negatively on employment. Nonetheless we cannot spend money we do not have.</P>
    <P>However, in the current financial crisis, I am faced with dealing with the lack of funding available for the regional airports programme for 2011 and future years following reductions in funding levels made by the previous Government. At the same time, some of the regional airports are becoming more dependant on Exchequer support of some sort.</P>
    <P>There is a total allocation of &euro;13.4 million available for the programme for 2011, &euro;11.4 million for current expenditure on the PSO air services, most of which is already committed, and operational losses of the airports and &euro;2 million for capital projects at the airports, which is all committed. This compares to expenditure of &euro;21.2 million on the programme in 2010. </P>
    <P>A value for money review published by the previous Government in January 2011 recommended that funding for PSO air services between Dublin and the regional airports be discontinued when current contracts end in July 2011, except for the Donegal-Dublin service. It also recommended that operational and capital expenditure funding be discontinued for Sligo and Galway airports. These recommendations took into account changes in EU legislation, airport performances, the substantial investment in surface transport, overlapping catchment areas, the requirement to make best use of scarce Exchequer resources and the implications for the tourism and business sectors in the regions.</P>
    <P>In addressing the lack of funding issue, I have to take into consideration developments in recent years as highlighted in the review and the need to focus on ensuring the sustainability of a strong network of regional airports serving the Irish public, both in terms of business and tourism. While no decisions on the funding of regionals airports for 2011 and future years have yet been made by the current Government, I will be bringing proposals to Cabinet in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate at this stage to comment on the possible outcome of the Government&rsquo;s deliberations. However, it is clear that in the current difficult climate, any decisions will have to take account of available Exchequer funds.</P>
