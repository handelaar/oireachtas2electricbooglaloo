        <Quest>  if he intends issuing offshore oil and gas exploration licences in the near future on foot of submissions received by him in 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

	<P>The 2011 Atlantic margin licensing round was formally launched in October 2010 and the closing date for applications was the end of May this year.  The 2011 licensing round was different from previous licensing rounds in that the authorisations on offer are for two-year licensing options and not for the traditional 15 or 16 year frontier exploration licences.  Fifteen applications were received under the round and my Department has now concluded its evaluation of the applications received.  I will make a decision on the granting of licensing options over the next week or so.</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P>There has been a good deal of debate of late on the possible potential of Ireland&rsquo;s indigenous oil and gas resources.  While there has been a modest increase in the number of exploration authorisations in recent years, the overall level of exploration activity has remained stubbornly low.  This is particularly true of exploration drilling with an average of only two exploration wells a year being drilled over the past decade.</P>
        <P>Companies that are offered licensing options under the 2011 licensing round will have to undertake work programmes agreed with my Department.  These work programmes, which will principally involve desktop studies, will then inform decisions to be made two years from now, as to whether these companies will actually apply for exploration licences with a view to then potentially moving towards exploration drilling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister is no doubt aware that the Oireachtas committee intends to investigate the whole regime under which licences are granted.  Is it his intention to await the conclusion of the report of the committee before issuing these licences in order that we get public agreement in regard to the terms of these licences?  There is great concern in regard to this matter, some of it stirred by the Minister&rsquo;s party when in opposition.  The Government when in opposition and when it came into office spoke about new politics and putting the Oireachtas first.  Is the Minister willing to wait until the Oireachtas, through its committee, reports on this issue before issuing these licences?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>As I told the Oireachtas committee concerned last evening, I am more than willing to engage with it for as long as is necessary to review this issue but I am not prepared to delay the current licensing round that has its origins in the changes made in the Finance Act 2008 which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v had the opportunity, when in Cabinet, to approve.  I do not wish to delay that as it would introduce a note of uncertainty in a situation which has been disappointing in recent years.  On average, fewer than two holes per annum have been drilled over the past decade.  At that level of exploration and drilling, it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.  The purpose and motivation of the Government is to increase exploration activity offshore and to explore whether some of the resources we hope are there exist.  The strike rate over the past 40 years has been disappointing.  In terms of energy security and so on, it is very important we have success and I hope we will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted the Minister is now convinced the terms we set in 2008 are the correct ones but he did not believe that when in opposition.  As he knows, the disquiet which his party tried to build up when in opposition is fairly pervasive among the public.  It seems the Minister is putting short-term expediency ahead of long-term certainty.  Will he confirm that if these licences are issued and if an Oireachtas committee subsequently recommends changes, if oil or gas was found, the licences would be under the 2008 terms and that it would not be possible to change those terms in the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not make any comment good, bad or indifferent approving or disapproving of the Finance Act 2008.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was bruiting this about throughout the summer and it is about time he produced some quote from me to that effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s party did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not do it.  That is the first point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s party did.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="3"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The second point is that there is nothing preventing &mdash; the former Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, understands this well &mdash; the Minister for Finance of the day addressing the fiscal regime in any area of the economy which he or she believes appropriate at any time.  That applies to this regime as well.  That is the competence of the Minister for Finance and it is untrammelled.</P>
        <P>It is important, now that the evaluation is concluding in my Department, that I get on with the authorisation of this licensing round.  It is for a relatively small area, 6%, of the Atlantic margin.  Let the Oireachtas committee take what evidence it wishes from whomsoever it wishes and for as long as it likes, and then let it come to conclusions.  However, that will take a considerable length of time in my opinion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister recommend that the Minister for Finance change the tax terms for the Corrib regime, since he said that they could be changed at any time?</P>
      </Speaker>

        <AskConj><b> </b>asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> his views on proposals to sell parts of the ESB; if he has made any decisions on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23961/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU-IMF programme of December 2010 involves a commitment that the Government will outline methods to raise funds through asset disposals.  The 2011 budget included a similar commitment.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government includes an intention to finance investment in the State from the proceeds of the sale of certain State assets.  The Government has also considered the report of the McCarthy review group on the sale of State assets and the recommendations of that group.</P>
        <P>I accept that the fiscal path, to which the Government is committed under the EU-IMF agreement, demands that the option of realising value from State assets be fully explored.  I also accept that there is significant value in energy commercial State companies, which could be realised at an appropriate time after necessary further analysis of all the complex factors relating to the disposal of commercial assets in the energy sector.</P>
        <P>The sale of a minority stake in the ESB as an integrated utility has, this morning, been agreed by Government.  This decision is an early demonstration of the commitment by the Government to the programme for Government&rsquo;s objectives and to its obligations under the EU-IMF memorandum of understanding.</P>
        <P>This sale will be advanced by means of a defined process involving a full evaluation of the best approach to be taken, including consideration of the size of the minority stake to be sold.  That process will be progressed by a group co-chaired by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, also including officials from the Department of Finance and availing of expertise from the National Treasury Management Agency and NewERA.</P>
        <P>Full consideration will be taken of the energy policy and regulatory framework in this evaluation, and appropriate consultation will be engaged in.  The group will report back to Government with a recommendation by the end of November.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P><Col N="4"/>
        <P>The decision by Government today recognises the strategic importance of the energy sector to the economic and social functioning of the State, and that the State must continue to have a strong and direct presence in electricity, particularly in the regulated transmission and distribution networks.  This presence must be maintained in a way that protects overall economic competitiveness and does not deter private investment.  The process to analyse options for the minority stake sale in ESB will fully reflect these principles.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>While I thank the Minister for his reply, I wish to reiterate that my party is totally opposed to the sale or disposal of any State share in the ESB, be it a minority one or otherwise.  The acquiescence of the programme for Government to the demands being made by the IMF and others is unacceptable and absolutely wrong.  For generations, the ESB and other semi-State companies have served this State well, both socially and infrastructurally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Could we have a question for the Minister, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will get there.  What has been agreed today is a retrograde step and will be a disaster in the long term.  What percentage minority share has the Government agreed to sell off?  What is the projected value of that share to the economy or, should I say, to the IMF?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I hear the Deputy&rsquo;s reiteration of his opposition to the disposal of any State assets.  I also hear his conviction that there is no necessity for the Government to respond to the demands of the IMF-EU memorandum of understanding.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>However, he has not explained how he would run the social services of the State in circumstances where we walk away from the agreement imposed on us by the previous Government.  Due to the injunction by the troika that we must dispose of some State assets, I find myself in a position I do not want to be in but I acknowledge that the survival and viability of this economy is at risk.  We have to ensure economic recovery and get people back to work.</P>
        <P>No decision has been made regarding the percentage that will constitute the minority stake.  That will be a matter for the process I have described in my initial reply.  A group comprising my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will, between now and 30 November, work out the many complex and intricate decisions that must be taken in the context of the disposal of any share in a State company.  I agree entirely with Deputy Ferris on the role the ESB has traditionally played in this society and economy.  I am happy to report that will continue to be the case because the Government&rsquo;s decision is to dispose of a minority stake.</P>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot understand why the Minister, after taking a decision in principle to dispose of a minority stake, does not know the percentage figure to which that minority will equate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcNamara"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McNamara</NameTxt>
	<P>It is less than 50%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has Deputy Ferris a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister does not know the value of the stake to the Exchequer.  He has taken a decision and he speaks about the financial situation in this country.  Will the financial situation be improved by privateers taking over part of our national assets?</P>

        <asker> Deputy Thomas Pringle</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>  if he has considered the development of a wood biomass industry to offset home heating oil imports, to create indigenous jobs and to reduce carbon emissions here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[24144/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2007 Energy White Paper set overarching targets for penetration of renewable energy in the electricity, heat and transport sector.  These targets are 40% renewable electricity, 12% renewable heat and 10% renewable energy in transport.  These three sectoral targets are in line with meeting our renewable energy directive target which sets a binding 16% penetration of all energy from renewable sources.</P>
        <P>Currently, Ireland imports some 90% of its fuel to meet demand at a cost of approximately &euro;6 billion per annum.  Developing renewable sources of energy, including energy from biomass, will help Ireland to reduce its dependence on these imports.  In addition, because sustainable biomass is considered carbon neutral, it will also assist Ireland in meeting its climate change commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and the 2020 European Union targets.</P>
        <P>In order to support renewable energy from biomass and waste, my Department is in the process of introducing new tariffs for biomass technologies under the renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT, scheme.  REFIT is designed to provide certainty to renewable electricity generators as to the price they receive.  It has been in operation for wind, landfill gas and hydro power since 2006, acting to ensure a guaranteed price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid by paying the difference between the wholesale price for electricity and the REFIT price.  The tariffs for biomass technologies will range from 8.5 cent per kilowatt hour to 15 cent an hour depending on the technology deployed and will include higher tariffs where the heat generated by a plant is being used more effectively.  These biomass REFIT rates are in the final stages of being cleared through the State aid process by DG Competition in Brussels.</P>
        <P>Other measures that will assist the development of biomass include the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&rsquo;s bio-energy scheme, which offers supports to farmers to grow miscanthus and willow for use as energy crops, and afforestation grants to encourage new forests.  Full details of all these scheme supports are available from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply, although only the last two sentences address my question.  There is great potential to create an indigenous wood for home heating industry which would offset the importation of home heating oil.  Given that, as the Minister stated, we are currently importing all the heating oil we use, such a development would greatly assist with our balance of payments.  The industry would be based in rural areas, where we already produce more wood than is needed to heat the entire country.  It would create jobs, something of which we have heard so much from the Government under the so-called NewERA.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the Minister did not address these aspects in the opening part of his answer.  Will the Government support the development of a wood for home heating industry and thus facilitate the creation of indigenous jobs and a reduction in imports of home heating oil?  That would be of significant benefit to the economy and would help to address fuel poverty.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I meant no disrespect to the Deputy.  It is conventional to provide this type of background information; not everybody is as knowledgeable about REFIT and the subsidy to the industry as is Deputy Pringle.  I did no more than elucidate that point.</P>
        <P>I do not disagree with what the Deputy said, but his expectation for an indigenous industry is somewhat exaggerated.  I agree with the general thrust of his contribution in terms of the capacity of this area to make a contribution to our electricity and heating needs and to contribute to rural development and the creation of jobs in rural areas.  However, in all fairness, one of the reasons I wanted to explain how REFIT works is that there may be an assumption by some people that all it requires is the press of a switch and we will have a biomass industry.  As stated in my reply all of this involves a subsidy and people should understand that.  I also stated that the tariff will range from 8.5 cent to 15 cent.  That is a consideration.  The net point as far as the Deputy is concerned is that this matter is being progressed.  It has been with the relevant DG of the EU for some time and I expect a decision on the matter in the next couple of months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest that the Minister&rsquo;s officials contact the Donegal Woodland Owners Association and Western Development Commission, which is currently running the RASLRES programme that is examining the potential of this industry.  I believe that a policy rather than a subsidy is what is required to encourage and develop this industry and I do not believe the EU-IMF-ECB or anyone else would have a problem with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We are agreed on the desirability of building a renewable sector that can make a contribution to the targets that we must meet in a European context.  I accept that biomass is an aspect of that.  I reiterate, however, that I would not be as optimistic as Deputy Pringle in terms of the quantum that will be contributed.  That does not mean that it is not important.  I accept that it is important in the context of rural development and indigenous employment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The renewable energy feed in tariff scheme known as REFIT was introduced in 2006 for certain categories of renewable energy, including onshore wind.  Since then, the tariffs have been increased, where applicable, by the annual consumer price index.  Adjustments to the rate are by way of indexation annually and by the annual increase, if any, in the consumer price index in Ireland.  </P>
        <P>REFIT is based around 15-year power purchase agreements between generators and suppliers which provide wind energy developers with the necessary certainty required to finance their projects.  The scheme is funded through a public service obligation, PSO, levy, paid for by all electricity consumers.  With the support of REFIT, the sector has continued to grow strongly and there is now approximately 1,800 MW of renewable generation capacity connected to the electricity grid.  In addition, there is a further 1,100 MW of renewable generation capacity with signed connection offers.  This capacity will build out over the next few years.</P>
        <P>The next batch of generation capacity is referred to as the Gate 3 process and consists of approximately 4,000 MW of renewable generation capacity.  The projects in this category are scheduled to be connected to the grid between 2012 and 2020.  EirGrid currently forecast that approximately 4,500 MW of renewable generation capacity is required to be connected by 2020 to achieve our national renewable electricity target of 40% of all generation from renewable technologies.</P><Col N="8"/>
        <P Just="Left">The original REFIT scheme was designed with a view to delivering our 2010 renewable electricity target of 13.2% of electricity consumption from renewable technologies.  It was successful in achieving that target and Ireland was one of only six member states to achieve its 2010 target level.  Officials from my Department are currently finalising State aid clearance with DG Competition in Brussels to continue to offer REFIT for the next batch of renewable energy projects that are in the Gate 3 process.  It is proposed to offer the same rates of tariff as in the original scheme.</P>

        <P Just="Left">There are two State aid clearance processes under way, one in respect of onshore wind, landfill gas and hydro technologies and a second in respect of various biomass categories.  The Commission is currently finalising its assessments on both applications and I am confident that we will have a positive outcome shortly in both cases.  As this is a Commission decision process, it is not possible to give an exact conclusion date.  Once these clearances have been received from Brussels the final proposed schemes will be brought, as soon as is practicable, to Government for sign-off before being opened for applications.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Any additional REFIT rates beyond these technologies will have to be considered carefully by the Government given the cost implications to the electricity consumer.  The public service obligation levy is imposed against all consumers&rsquo; electricity bills, domestic and commercial.  The objective is to balance the imperative of increasing the penetration of renewable energy with the retention of competitive affordable energy supply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister willing to hold back on the decision in regard to the new REFIT, which is fundamentally different from the old one, until an Oireachtas committee has had a chance to examine the issue?  There are people who believe that this is a great giveaway, which will give so-called suppliers, namely, big companies such as the ESB, Airtricity and Bord G&aacute;is, a licence to print money to the tune of &euro;1 billion on the backs of Irish taxpayers.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The reason is that the new REFIT works on the basis that the producer, that is, the person with the wind farm receives a fixed tariff, that the supplier receives a fixed margin, with virtually no risk, and if the price increases due to the cost of oil the supplier, rather than the producer, gets the benefit.  In view of all these serious public concerns about this scheme, which was devised by his Department, is the Minister willing to hold back on any decision on the new REFIT programme until the Oireachtas committee has had an opportunity to examine whether the concerns raised by people of good bona fides and knowledge are founded?  It would appear to me that they are well founded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The application has been with DG Competition of the European Commission for 18 months or longer and is in the final stages so I do not see how I can pull back.  Certainly, I am more than willing to go into committee with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and other members to tease through this issue because there are questions that need to be examined with regard to this system.  I am assured there is no basis for the claim that REFIT is a licence to print money.  As I said to Deputy Thomas Pringle what is involved here is essentially a subsidy, whether it comes from the consumer or the Exchequer, and for that reason it must be measured very carefully.  The whole idea is to bring more competition into the market to make us less reliant on fossil fuels and to use a natural resource, of which we have a bountiful supply, but I accept there has to be a balance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Minister leave the issue with the Commission while we examine it?  Will the Minister agree that no REFIT contracts will be entered into under the new scheme pending discussion by the committee?  The allegation made is that a margin is given to the supplier <Col N="9"/>&mdash; not the person with the wind farm who must operate through a supplier &mdash; for virtually no risk and if the price increases the supplier gets all the benefit.  If the price is low the State foots the bill and if the price is high the supplier, rather than the producer, gets all the benefit.  Therefore, there are two major gains for the supplier for virtually no risk.  These are not the people who build the wind farms but the major companies who would put the electricity on the market.  Will the Minister clarify the amount to be paid to the supplier multiplied by the total number of megawatts he intends to produce, multiplied by the 15 years these contracts would be place?  Will he hold back on issuing any REFIT contracts until the Oireachtas committee has had an opportunity to examine what, <i>prima facie</i>, appears to be a serious giveaway from the State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am assured that the contribution is no more than is necessary to encourage new entrants into the marketplace, which is what we are seeking to do.  If there are these big holes in it &mdash; the scheme was devised by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and his colleagues &mdash; I do not know when it dawned on him that there are such holes in it.  I am happy to go into committee and examine it.  I appreciate the Deputy holds strong on it, about which we have spoken briefly privately.  I am anxious to submit it to that type of scrutiny but the professional advice I have is that, contrary to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s conviction in the matter, the scheme is well balanced.  It simply would not function unless there was some element of REFIT.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>

        <QRef>[23880/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 13 together.</P>
        <P>I do not have a statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or unregulated market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is an independent statutory body.  Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by vigorous competition regulated by the CER.  Prices in the retail electricity market are now fully deregulated.  From 1 October, gas residential consumers will be the only segment of the electricity and gas markets where prices will be regulated.  Prices in the electricity market and unregulated part of the gas market are wholly a commercial and operational matter for the suppliers.</P>
        <P>The recent CER decision to approve a 21.7% increase in the Bord G&aacute;is tariff from 1 October is the first price increase for Bord G&aacute;is&rsquo;s residential gas customers since September 2008.  It follows three successive price cuts approved by the CER.  There have also been recent announcements by suppliers of electricity price increases.</P>
        <P>The driving factor in these increases, and the point of Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s question, is the trend in international gas prices during the past year, which looks like continuing into the future.  Wholesale gas prices for the coming winter will be more than 30% higher than they were last winter.  Ireland is a price-taker in the global fossil fuel market and the economy, therefore, is vulnerable to energy price fluctuations and price rises.</P>
        <P>Suppliers in neighbouring markets are also subject to similar pressures and price increases.  Last May, Phoenix Gas in Northern Ireland announced an increase of 39% in domestic and small business tariffs.  The big six gas suppliers in Britain have also increased domestic tariffs by 17% to 18%, following on from increases some months previously.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to competition as a way of exerting downward pressure on prices.  Competition is achieving competitive pressure on suppliers.  It stimulates them to offer better deals and discounts.  Business and domestic customers can, therefore, increasingly avail of the competitive offerings from electricity and gas supply companies active in the retail end of the market.  The first step that customers should take to reduce their energy costs is to work actively in securing better value offers in the market and in switching to suppliers delivering lower prices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Actions taken in the two years prior to the end of 2010 improved Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness in the gas and electricity sectors when compared with other European countries.  Analysis by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, of EUROSTAT data for the second half of 2010 shows that, for large business customers of electricity, Irish prices were between 91% and 93% of the eurozone average while prices for small to medium-sized business customers ranged from 4% below the average to 6% above, depending on the category.  Gas tariffs remain competitive with business tariffs at 83% to 90% of the eurozone average.  Increased competition has clearly had an impact.</P>
        <P>In addition, we must focus on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs where possible for business and domestic customers.  This is essential for competitiveness, employment and for economic recovery.  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy for business are as competitive as possible through those measures at our disposal.  I urge all businesses of whatever size to place a relentless focus on <Col N="11"/>energy efficiency.  The SEAI is available to provide advice and, subject to available resources, financial assistance in this respect.  In addition, there is extensive tax relief available to businesses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive reply.  Notwithstanding that, does he agree that energy price increases are never welcome, particularly in the winter and on foot of the current economic difficulties, which were, of course, not the responsibility of the current Government?  Is it possible to monitor the impact of increases on both the domestic and commercial sectors as we approach the time of peak energy use, namely, wintertime?  Arising from anything that might emerge, would it be possible at least to enter into dialogue with ComReg to ensure we do not allow circumstances whereby both industry and the domestic sector will be severely punished or disadvantaged arising from the proposals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that the last thing one wants to hear about heading into the winter is an increase in energy prices.  I acknowledge that and that some will be more severely affected  than others.  It is for this reason that I was happy to be able to negotiate with the energy companies an arrangement whereby no family in distress will be disconnected this winter provided it participates in a payment plan or agrees to have installed a pay-as-you-go meter.  I hope this gives some comfort to some people who will be in difficulty.</P>
        <P>With regard to monitoring the impact, it is a condition of the memorandum of understanding that there be a review of energy efficiency in the economy.  This will be conducted by the International Energy Agency and it is likely to commence before the end of September.  The agency is a reputable international body.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the price be reduced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us see.  At least conclusions will be drawn as to whether there is an efficient energy sector operating in this economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I attended a briefing by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul last week in Buswells Hotel.  The society has produced a major report, one of the findings of which points to the significant pressure on people at home all day, particularly the elderly, owing to the cost of energy.  We heard about people who are choosing to go to bed at 7 p.m. so as not to have to sit up and shiver.</P>
        <P>Those who are least likely to be able to shift from one company to another are those in arrears because the new rules appear to suggest one cannot move from one company to another and leave one&rsquo;s arrears behind.  People in this category do not have the scope of those who can pay their bills.</P>
        <P>Let me outline my motivation for my question and also the question I really want to ask.  Competition between the energy providers is internal.  Bearing in mind that this is a very small country, is there any question of a more collaborative approach between the energy providers in terms of purchasing, such as that adopted by the National Treasury Management Agency in negotiating a better currency arrangement?  There is no point in telling someone there has not been any increase since 2008 and that there have been decreases, because an increase of 22% is horrific for people under serious pressure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are very short on time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday evening I told the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture that I was in the process of bringing to the Government a memorandum on an affordable energy strategy.  For some months, very <Col N="12"/>active work has been done by the Department and the Departments of Social Protection and the Environment, Community and Local Government on the question of affordable energy and fuel poverty.  I expect to be in a position to make this public this month.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of advocacy by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on switching, Deputy Murphy is correct that the national figures show 43% of customers switch.  However, for the segment which benefits from the home benefits package the figure is approximately 16%.  This is one of the matters about which I am speaking to my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, with regard to the systems in her Department as they relate to the energy companies and the capacity to remove any barriers to allow this category of the population to switch with equal facility as those not in receipt of State aids.</P>
        <P>However, I must make a point on arrears.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and similar organisations such as MABS, make representations to us to state we ought to address this issue because a significant amount of debt-hopping takes place.  Somebody runs up a bill for six to nine months and, as bills are sent out every two months, before anybody catches up with them they switch to another supplier and repeat the performance before switching again.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul wants us to address this issue and I have been in discussions with the Commission for Energy Regulation about it.  Moves have been made whereby now a flag is put up and arrears must be declared to a new supplier.  However, a new supplier is not blocked from taking on the customer until the arrears are cleared.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been very tolerant.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, nothing in what Deputy Murphy stated &mdash; I understand from where she is coming &mdash; will alter world gas prices and this is the issue.  If we were to have the collaboration about which she spoke in purchasing gas on the world market it would be a cartel and anti-competitive and I do not see it being able to run.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>  his view on whether following the publication of the McCarthy Report on State Assets which recommends that ESB&rsquo;s assets be broken up, the Cahill/Frontier Economic report which recommends against unbundling, should be published prior to the comprehensive spending review being completed in order to ensure a full and informed public debate on the future of the States assets.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[20325/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry Deputy McDonald cannot be with us because she has been asking me to do this for a long time.  I have done it, but she is not here and I feel let down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>You will get over it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I suppose so.</P>
        <P>The report by Frontier Economics was undertaken under a process overseen by Mr. Fergus Cahill as independent chair.  The report contains an assessment of costs, benefits and regulatory impact of the options for unbundling the electricity transmission assets set in the context of the EU third package and the all-island single electricity market.</P><Col N="13"/>
        <P>The process allowed for input from the direct stakeholders and other stakeholders.  The direct stakeholders were the management and the unions of ESB and EirGrid and the ESB employee share ownership trust, ESOT.</P>
        <P>Both EirGrid and ESB have vital roles to play in delivering our national electricity infrastructure.  In July this year, the Government decided the ownership of the electricity transmission assets is to remain with the ESB while the operation and development of the transmission system will continue to be the responsibility of EirGrid.  Following that decision, the Cahill-Frontier report was published on 27 July 2011 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>More generally, the programme for Government commits to the sale of &euro;2 billion of State assets.  The report of the review group on the sale of State assets has also been published and will be an input into the Government&rsquo;s consideration of any such sales.  In this regard, I refer the Deputy to my earlier answer to the question concerning proposals for any sale of the ESB.</P>

	<P>The State&rsquo;s assets were put together at great cost to taxpayers, often when times were hard.  A percentage of these are now to be sold off to privateers as part of the diktat of the EU-IMF-ECB troika which was agreed by the previous Government and is now pursued enthusiastically by the current Government.  It is not democracy but dictatorship.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelColreavy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Colreavy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The troika may be clapping Ministers on the back but it is only because this Government is following the rules it set down and agreed with the previous Government.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister facilitate a full public debate on the sell-off of our national assets which will include discussion about the impact of such sell-offs on essential services, employment and what remains of our economic independence?  What happens next year or the year after when the troika demands more?  What happens when the so-called low hanging fruit is all gone?  What will be left to sell?  What then will happen to the Minister&rsquo;s claim that only minority shares of State assets will be sold?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The subject matter of the question is the break-up of the ESB.  The Cahill-Frontier report recommended against that.  The memorandum that I brought for decision to the Government was to implement those recommendations and avoid the break-up of the ESB.  I am happy my Government colleagues approved this.</P>
        <P>Deputy McDonald, in particular, was calling on me over a period before the summer recess to do precisely that.  I have done so.  That is why I am so upset that she is not in the Chamber to welcome that decision.  I presume she will be in touch later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Colreavy broadened the original question of the sale of a minority stake.  On the original question, I will be quite happy to facilitate a full debate on the issue, if the Deputy so wishes.</P><Col N="14"/>
        <P>The Deputy also wants to know what will happen if the EU-IMF-ECB troika comes back for more.  That is not a vista I want to contemplate.  What has been imposed on us as it stands is very painful to meet.  Deputy Colreavy does not think it is important we are seen to deliver on the severe targets set for us.  The manner in which this Government has managed it so far, however, has brought relief.  I cannot believe the Deputy is not reading the newspapers or watching reports on what is happening in Greece without realising the implications for any people or state that does not responsibly manage its economy.  Far from coming back for more, there will be an acknowledgment by the troika of the heroic efforts being made by this Government to comply with the strictures placed on us.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must stop the Minister there because I want to allow two brief questions from Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Boyd Barrett.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister confirm it is not legally possible for the EU-IMF-ECB troika to come back for more once the terms of the EU-IMF agreement are adhered to?  Will he clarify for the benefit of Sinn F&eacute;in that if the agreement were not in place, then there would be severe cuts on social welfare, education and health budgets?  Will he confirm the EU-IMF has made it abundantly clear that as long as the bottom line of the agreement is adhered to, they will be flexible as to how the programme is implemented?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree lessons must be learned from past sales of minority shares in State bodies?  The minute a minority share of a State company is sold off, the company&rsquo;s interest shifts from the national to the shareholders&rsquo; interest.  Pressure then mounts inexorably to sell more of the company until it is fully privatised.  For example, in the case of Irish Sugar, we were guaranteed only a minority share would be sold while a golden shareholding would be retained by the State.  We know, however, what happened to that company in the end.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The measure of people is not that they do not make mistakes but that they learn from their mistakes.  In hindsight, I have come to believe some of the privatisations of State companies in the past were wrong.  I am willing to learn from this, but it seems the Labour Party Minister opposite is not.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As a State company, the ESB played a key role in transforming Ireland from a Third World country to a modern state.  In any rational approach in dealing with the current economic crisis, is it not the case that a successful and profitable company such as the ESB should be kept in public ownership and investment be made in it to develop sustainable energy resources and so forth?

        <P>How does the EU and the IMF justify its insistence on the sale of State assets which could drive economic recovery?  Will the Minister agree such sell-offs are actually attempts to asset strip this country, using the guise of the current recession which was caused by the bankers and bondholders in the first place?  How can anyone construe an argument that a sale of even a bit of the ESB could possibly be good for this country?</P>

	<P>Assuming Ireland can get back into the sovereign markets which is the purpose of the programme in the first place, I still hope that it will be the case.  It depends, however, how we manage it in the remaining lifetime of the memorandum of understanding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is correct, even if our colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in will not admit it, that the alternative would have been serious cuts in social welfare payments, and the remuneration of garda&iacute;, teachers, nurses and so on because of the woeful mismanagement of our economy by previous Governments.  We are trying to correct that.  Regarding Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s point about a minority share, it depends on how that is implemented.  I say to Deputy Boyd Barrett we are not handing over ownership of the ESB.  The decision this morning was to sell a minority stake and there is no question of control passing out of the authority of the ESB.  I am no fan of the deal foisted on us.  In my view it was a bad deal and the people negotiating it did a bad job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <asker> Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>  the quantity of gas produced from the three fields of Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads, in County Cork; the current commercial value of the gas being produced from these fields; the amount the companies have paid in taxation and the royalties that the Exchequer has received since the commencement of production at these fields; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[23931/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The total volume of sales of gas from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields is approximately 1.75 trillion cubic feet since production started in 1978.  Royalties from the two fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of gas at the well head.  The amount received in royalties to date is just over &euro;190 million.  The total volume of sales gas produced from the Seven Heads gas field, since production started in 2003, is 0.025 trillion cubic feet.  Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads gas field as Ireland, following the lead of counties such as Norway and the UK, moved away from a royalty-based payments system to a tax-based system in 1987.  The Kinsale area gas fields are nearing <Col N="16"/>depletion and gas production is currently running at approximately 0.01 trillion cubic feet per annum.</P>
        <P>The amount paid in tax is a matter between the operators of the gas fields and the Revenue Commissioners.  However, for the information of the Deputy, the combination of tax, royalties and rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a more general and forward-looking note, the rate of tax that will apply to any future commercial discoveries made under an exploration licence granted since the Finance Act of 2008 will be between 25% and 40%, depending on the profitability of the field.  The fiscal terms in the Finance Act 2008 were introduced following a review of the licensing terms by my predecessor and that was informed by a report from expert economic consultants.  The fact that the Kinsale area gas fields are nearing depletion at a time when Ireland&rsquo;s only other commercial discovery, the Corrib gas field, is still in the development phase, is another clear indicator of why Ireland needs to encourage an increase in the level of exploration investment and exploration activity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Minister knows the point of my question, which is the extent to which the people of this country will benefit from gas and oil production under the terms that currently operate.  It is not very clear to me what &euro;190 million represents as a proportion because the Minister has not really answered that question.  If I am correct in understanding what the Minister said, &euro;190 million is the total tax take from the three fields I have asked about.  I ask the Minister to clarify this for me.  What I want to find out is how much tax revenue has been received from those fields as a proportion of the overall income generated so that we can know the actual percentage rather than the figures of between 25% and 40% being bandied around as to what we might receive.  It is like the corporation tax rate which we are told is 12.5% but actually the effective tax rate is 10%.  How much are we actually getting back?  I doubt very much we will get 40% back, given the other methods for the tax write-offs on capital costs and so on which means, I suspect, that in many cases we will get virtually nothing back from some of these fields, no royalties and no security of supply.  We cannot even control prices because we have effectively given away these gas and oil reserves under the conditions of the licences.  How can we justify a situation where at best we are talking about 40% while in Iran, for example, there are service-sharing agreements by which the state maintains the ownership of the gas and in Norway the state receives a 78% tax rate and it owns 67% of the gas and oil?  Why are we giving away the gas and oil and what will we be getting back in return?  Some of us suspect it will be nothing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure of &euro;190 million is royalties only.  The royalties system was terminated in 1987.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister knows the point of my question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes, I know the point of the Deputy&rsquo;s question and I understand the question and the importance of it.  However, the problem is I do not know how he can say what we are giving away.  The point is we are not giving anything away because until we find something, we have nothing to give away.  That is the issue.  If the Deputy is of the view that the fiscal regime is not tough enough, it was toughened by my predecessor, Eamon Ryan, in the Finance Act 2008.  Before he did so, it had been 25% for the previous 20 years.  Therefore, if it is a giveaway, why is there not a thicket of exploration rigs off the coast where the Deputy lives?  Why have there been fewer than 20 holes drilled in the past decade?  Nobody who has espoused the position &mdash; I sympathise with the Deputy&rsquo;s aspiration &mdash; has been able to explain to me why there is not a queue to drill for oil and gas off our shores, if it is a giveaway.  If the <Col N="17"/>Deputy decides that it is not practicable for this Government at this time to establish a State exploration company &mdash; at &euro;70 million to &euro;80 million a pop, we do not have the money to drill empty wells offshore &mdash; if he accepts the investment is not there to establish a State company, then we are reliant on the oil companies to do the exploration for us.  Therefore, it is a matter of balance and how one attracts them to do so but we have done a very bad job in this regard so far, with an average of two holes drilled per annum.  I am trying to balance a fiscal regime with the requirement to bring in the oil companies to do the exploration and the drilling and hopefully to make finds.  That is the balance and that is my position.  I was very conscious of what happened at Corrib having regard to the international reputation of Ireland in circumstances where we will be lucky to bring Corrib gas on shore after 17 years while Norway brings gas ashore within four years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A brief question from Deputy Boyd Barrett as we are out of time on this question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise but I am bursting with information on this question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Even at &euro;80 million a pop, would it not be better for us to borrow the money to invest in a State company to do some drilling rather than borrowing &euro;100 billion to bail out banks?  Could we not have borrowed a fraction of that sum to drill because there are estimates of the equivalent of tens of billions of barrels of gas and oil offshore?  Would this not have been a better investment than borrowing &euro;100 billion to bail out rotten banks, speculators and bondholders?</P>
        <P>The Minister did not answer my question.  What I am trying to elicit is what are we getting back from the fields that were exploited.  I understood the Minister to say that we were getting &euro;190 million in royalties but what was the total take we got as against what the companies made?  That would give a real sense of what we get back under those arrangements, even in a field that is in production.</P>
        <P>There are other methods to entice in companies to explore.  Why do we have this unique arrangement whereby as soon as the companies go into production we give it to them?  That is unique.  Why are we doing it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister made the point that we do not have money for exploration and that we cannot afford it but the reality is that all exploration carried out by multinational oil companies is written off.  Effectively, we are paying for it anyway.  It does not make sense.  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the amount of money we put into toxic banks to bail out bankers and developers.  If a small fraction of the money was used to develop our natural resources I am certain we would be in a far more lucrative state than is the case at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies and I are like ships in the night.  I do not think we are relating to each other.  I would love to be free of the shackles of the moneys that have gone into the banks but Deputies Boyd Barrett and Ferris do not accept that it was necessary in the first place.  We could have a long discussion about why it was necessary and how it might have been done differently.  That will be an interesting thesis for bright young people, such as Deputy Boyd Barrett, who will attend Trinity College in 20 years time but it is not much help in terms of trying to have a functioning banking system in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not functioning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody denies that the previous Government made a hames of the situation.  Everyone acknowledges that, but it does not help given where we are now.  Therefore, <Col N="18"/>I am reluctant to agree with the Deputy that it would be a better use of moneys that we do not have to spend &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million drilling holes that have largely been dry.  Of 156 holes that were drilled there were three strikes.  If one was to go to Paddy Power, I doubt if one would take those odds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is aware that does not reflect reality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very sceptical.  Under the present licensing round the companies will be given a permit for two years to do the necessary exploration activity.  After that, they have three years to drill and if they do not drill it is a case of use or lose it.  They have to drill.  We will see.  I hope Deputy Boyd Barrett and I will still be in the House at that time and I hope bountiful resources will be found.  Deputy Boyd Barrett must acknowledge that whether the tax rate is between 25% and 40%, as it is now, or 50% as he and Sinn F&eacute;in want, 50% of nothing is nothing.  I hope and believe we have prospects but we have not found anything.  What I am trying to do is strike a balance between bringing in companies to establish what are our reserves on the one hand while not frightening them away on the other.  That is the challenge that confronts us.</P>

Concerns exist around the quality of the community-based services that will take its place; (6) Deputy Joe Costello &mdash; to ask the Minister if he intends to review the licensing regime for gas and oil exploration during this Government&rsquo;s term of office; (7) Deputy James Bannon &mdash; the need for the Minister for Education and Skills to review the decision which has led to the suppression of the posts of resource teacher for Travellers, RTT, and the rural co-ordinator for disadvantage at St Mary&rsquo;s national school, Edgeworthstown, County Longford, the loss of which is detrimental to the continued successful provision of education to the children of Edgeworthstown and leaves the most vulnerable children in the <Col N="19"/>school without essential supports, and further, given the population explosion in Edgeworthstown &mdash; +68.4% in 2006 census &mdash; the urgent need for an increase in the built environment provision; (8) Deputy Michael McCarthy &mdash; ambulance service cover in the west Cork area, in particular the intention to reduce ambulance services in Skibbereen; (9) Deputy Dara Murphy &mdash; to ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government the following question which I believe is of national importance.  My question concerns the operation of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Minister will be aware that guidelines about the granting of planning permission for local authorities are strictly adhered to, with three months to access a planning application and a further month for consideration.  Currently An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not bound by any time delay with respect to the processing of appeals that come before it.  I suggest that the Minister consider enacting legislation that would require An Bord Plean&aacute;la to issue judgments within a similar or at the very least a restricted timeframe.  It is imperative in my opinion in the current economic climate that businesses or persons who are keen to proceed with developments are allowed to have the planning process they enter into completed in a reasonably expeditious manner.  I would further like to ask the Minister if there is any reason precluding him from introducing such a time restriction and if there is not, if he would consider it reasonable particularly given the fewer numbers of planning applications which are now being processed and consequently which are now being sent to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is also my opinion that given the competitive nature with respect to the choices when identifying a geographical location in which they may invest and consequently employ, that factors including how long a planning process may take will be taken into account in some cases.  This measure in my opinion will give a defined time period to include planning at local authority level and also at the appeals stage and therefore afford potential investors a finite date during which they know whether they will or will not secure planning permission.  On a related matter I would also like to ask the Minster if he is satisfied with the current membership of the board, how they are qualified and how the board is composed.  I would also like to know who is responsible for the composition of the board and how often the board is replaced.  The reason for this is that I think it would be advantageous to be aware what external forces may impact on the decision-making process of the board if any.  I am aware of recent objections by groups such as the National Roads Authority and An Taisce, however I wonder if the Minister would concede that for projects involving significant employment capacity that there may be some means of including a socially advantageous job creation objective within the framework of An Bord Plean&aacute;la. In other words, if the National Roads Authority is in a position to outline to An Bord Plean&aacute;la the potential traffic difficulties that any project may have on the road infrastructure it is my view that there should also be the opportunity for some method of equal advocacy from within the appeals process to identify the social benefits that would accrue by virtue of new and increased job creation.  I would be interested if the Minister had some further observations on that point.  For example can ministerial orders impact on the process and what are the current guidelines in approving projects, for example, for job creation?; (10) Deputy Joe Higgins &mdash; waiting lists for colonoscopies in 2011 compared to last year; (11) Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in &mdash; the need for the Minister for Health to address the delay in the employment of junior hospital doctors which persists in spite of the HSE recruitment abroad of such doctors and the passage of enabling legislation before the D&aacute;il recess; (12) Deputy Jerry Buttimer &mdash; the need to reassure the public of steps being taken by the Government to restrict the continuation of excessive pension entitlements of certain high-paid civil servants; (13) Deputy Thomas Pringle &mdash; the need for the Department to act immediately to ensure that the rural transport in the Gaeltacht areas of County Donegal is re-instated and the people of the area including the islands of Aranmore and Tory have a vital transport service restored that has been lost since the decision of Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta to wind up its operations last week; (14) Deputy David Stanton &mdash; to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to <Col N="20"/>debate the urgent need to provide primary and second level school accommodation in Carrigtwohill, County Cork; (15) Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v &mdash; an phr&aacute;inn a bhaineann le teacht ar shocr&uacute; maidir le sol&aacute;thar an cl&aacute;r LEADER, an cl&aacute;r LCDP agus seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; eile a bh&iacute;odh &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il ag Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta; and (16) Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett &mdash; the Government&rsquo;s new social housing policy, its affects on housing applicants and its costs to the Exchequer.</P>

	<P>We now move on to our new Topical Issue debate.  Before I call the Deputies in question I wish to make a brief point.  This is the first time that the new procedure has taken place.  The current Standing Orders effectively change the old Adjournment Debate into the Topical Issue Debate.  From contact made to my office today it appears that Members are under some misapprehension and there is a need for clarification as to exactly how the procedure for the Topical Issue Debate can be implemented, whether it is the former Adjournment procedure as reflected in the Standing Order changes or a new way of raising topical issues.</P>
        <P>It falls to my responsibility to select four issues.  Topics can range from an immediate, important national issue to some local issue.  I have to make a decision on them.  For that reason I am convening a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges next week in order to tease out the matter and to allow the necessary changes to be made, if any need to be made.  I am left in the position that I could be criticised or Members could feel very annoyed if their issue was not raised and they felt it was more important than some other issue.  That situation did not arise in the old Adjournment Debate.</P>
        <P>Today we had 18 Members seeking time.  It is impossible to give more than one slot to any topic because in this case 18 people sought time to raise issues.</P>
        <P>This is an important procedural change and it is of interest.  I would like to see it working properly.  I would like Members to be fully <i>au fait</i> with how they can raise an issue and what sort of issues should be raised or whether we simply transfer the procedure of the old Adjournment Debate into this slot.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaraConway"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciara Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to use my time in this House to best serve the people of Waterford who have been neglected for a decade in terms of industrial investment in the city and the region.  Along with my fellow Waterford Deputies, I have the dubious honour of being the first person to use this new Topical Issues Debate.  I use the word &ldquo;dubious&rdquo; because the news in Waterford over the past few weeks has been appalling.  Some 575 people have lost their jobs in TalkTalk in Waterford in the past week and that is the critical issue up for debate this afternoon.  Ironically, a company whose job it is to deal in telecommunications proved to do a spectacularly bad job at communicating this bad news to the Government and its workers.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year we had more bad news in Waterford.   GlaxoSmithKline, based in Dungarvan, is to lose 130 of its workers.  In September 2009, Teva, the largest pharmaceutical company in the south east, let go 315 workers.  Almost 500 jobs went in Waterford Crystal when the company went into receivership in 2009.  The glass, as it is known locally, made the Waterford name a proud one and an international byword for quality and elegance and it employed almost 3,000 workers at its peak.  Bausch &amp; Lomb, an eye care company, announced 195 lay-offs in March 2009; I could go on.</P>
        <P>Waterford has become an unemployment blackspot.  Currently, more than 15,000 people are on the live register in Waterford; 2,500 of these are in the city alone.  That is just not good enough and I intend to use my time in this House to fight for the people of Waterford and the south-east region.  This crisis must be tackled.  What will be done to tackle this jobs crisis Waterford currently faces?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Deputy Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for coming to Waterford at short notice to respond to the current crisis in the city.  Deputies and public representatives from all parties and from none had ample opportunity to question the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, his officials and IDA officials on Monday last.  Some of them chose not to stay at the meeting and asked only one question for 30 seconds or so.</P>
        <P>The sudden announcement last Wednesday by TalkTalk has had a devastating impact on the city and the entire region.  The treatment of the workers of TalkTalk demonstrated a lack of courtesy to the workers who have been loyal to it and to the State in which those workers live because the State has not had the opportunity or ample time to try to find alternative employment for that site.  Unfortunately, the story has moved on and those workers are now left with the unenviable task of trying to seek employment or perhaps new courses or upskilling.</P>
        <P>I point out to the Minister, the D&aacute;il and the Government the fact that over the past five years, the live register figure in Waterford has increased from approximately 6,800 to 15,500.  There is something fundamentally wrong with Government and IDA policy.  The crisis Waterford is currently experiencing did not happen overnight.  It is a result of continued neglect and lack of focus from the State agencies and past Governments.</P>
        <P>Waterford and the south-east region need co-ordinated and specific attention.  Waterford is a gateway city.  It is a region with almost 500,000 people which does not have university.  These <Col N="25"/>are tangible facts that need to be addressed.  What is needed is action by Government and a deep analysis as to why we have this unemployment crisis.  The people of Waterford have spoken.  They are worried and concerned.  This problem could visit other regions quite easily and we need to stop it now while we can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and I understand their sense of the huge blow this is for Waterford, in particular for the workers concerned.  I was first informed of this decision on Wednesday, the day it was to be announced.  I was dismayed, as was the IDA, at the way this was handled.  In discussions with the CEO, local management and the representatives of head office in Waterford on Monday, I continued to press for a longer period because it is important not only for workers adjusting to it but also to give the IDA every chance to market this effectively as a going concern.  A plant with workers and the skills they have built up is much more saleable while it is in operation than if it is closed.</P>
        <P>I had a series of meetings with public representatives and business.  I met the workers and the management and the city manager and business interests in Waterford on Monday.  The message was very clear in that Waterford has not benefited from the advances in the good times and it has been badly affected in the more difficult times of late.  On foot of that, I have instructed my agencies to put together an action plan for Waterford and the south east region to look at the areas they can intensify, at the way it is being supported and at the strengths and weaknesses of the area.  That was reflected in the discussions I had with local representatives.  There was a sense that there needed to be this sort of hard analysis as to why Waterford, with the strengths it has, not been more successful.  That is the task I have set the agencies to complete within one month.</P>
        <P>When that is done we will look afresh at what action can be taken and whether there are further, deeper issues which need to be assessed in some other way.  I am determined to give Waterford the priority it correctly deserves.  A casual view of the unemployment numbers and the history of industrial performance in recent times indicate that there are things which are wrong.  I am addressing those and I am committed to having an effective action plan to address them.</P>
        <P>There are issues of a long-term nature as well as things of a more short-term nature which we can address in the near term but we need to take a hard look at this to see how we can better support the enterprise sector in Waterford and set out the actions we can take in the near term and in the longer term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaraConway"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciara Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister but I emphasise at this critical time for Waterford that talk, talk is not enough and that we need action, action.  The Minister said the agencies will come together.  The programme for Government promised that 50% of IDA funding will focus on the areas outside Dublin.  Will the Minister ensure that the south east and Waterford is the focus of that 50% of IDA funding in the future because talk is no longer enough?  We must see action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Deputy Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware the Cabinet discussed this matter and gave it very serious attention late last week.  It is important the crisis in Waterford receives that type of attention.  Waterford has a proud industrial and manufacturing past.  It has a willing and an educated workforce and people who are resilient.  They have shown this summer, through the Tall Ships Festival and many other good things, the positive contribution Waterford city and the south-east region can make as a gateway to this country.</P>
        <P>It is important all Departments are instructed by Cabinet to respond to this crisis.  It is not only the job of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Waterford is located in the <Col N="26"/>heart of the south-east region which has huge potential from an agriculture and agrifood perspective.  As Ireland&rsquo;s oldest city, it has great tourism potential, so the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport has a part to play, as do all Ministers.</P>
        <P>This type of focus must remain even after the hype, some of which we saw today, and the media attention die down.  A concentrated, focused effort with real and tangible action is needed for the workers and the people of Waterford and the south-east region in the years ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the support of Cabinet colleagues.  The Minister for Social Protection responded immediately and staff from the Department have been in TalkTalk during the week and, indeed, were there last week.  The Minister for Education and Skills also responded immediately and the support of F&Aacute;S for the workers is in place.  In addition, the Minister for Education and Skills indicated that work on the proposal for a technological university, which is to be explored as part of the programme for Government, is being accelerated.  Clear criteria will be developed for that opportunity, which arose in discussions.  We need immediate action in the enterprise domain, but I also recognise that this assessment of strengths and weaknesses will throw up issues that are relevant for other Departments.  On foot of that, I will bring to the attention of other Departments areas of action that have the potential to assist.  </P>
        <P>I accept that IDA Ireland has been meeting its target for 50% of activity outside Dublin but, for whatever reason, Waterford has not been doing as well as other regions outside the capital.  I acknowledge there is an issue as to why Waterford, despite its offerings &mdash; and it has significant strengths &mdash; is not performing as well.  That is why it is important to examine this matter to see what items we can correct in the short term to enhance that performance.  It is our ambition to see Waterford doing better both from overseas investment and indigenous companies.  We need to create an engine of indigenous growth in this country.  Some 14 years after being in the Department, I am disappointed to see that the indigenous sector&rsquo;s contribution to our exports has not been enhanced in that time.  We must re-examine the weaknesses in that regard.</P>

    <Sect LHead="Suicide" RHead="Incidence"> 
      <sTitle>Suicide Incidence</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the recently published provisional figures on suicide rates for 2010, 486 people died by suicide that year.  For every individual who died, ten people were directly traumatised.  For the purpose of making accurate international comparisons, undetermined deaths are included in the suicide rates.  The figure for undetermined deaths last year was 123.  Chooselife, which is the Scottish programme for suicide prevention and is regarded as very progressive in this area, advises that the inclusion of undetermined deaths protects against under-recording and provides more accurate figures for international and geographical comparisons.  If we take this formula into account, 603 people died by suicide last year.</P>
        <P>The substantial increase in recent years is directly associated with our economic difficulties.  International research indicates that suicide rates increase by approximately 25% during times of recession.  In 2009, the incidence of suicide in Ireland increased by 25%.  Research in this area goes back to the 19th century.  Mental ill health resulting from recession, loss of employment, reductions in income or eviction can stress family relationships and people often take solace in drug or alcohol abuse.  The incidence of mental illness, especially depression, and suicide increase.</P>
        <P>I welcome the programme for Government&rsquo;s commitment to ring-fence an additional &euro;53 million per annum for implementing the recommendations set out in A Vision for Change.  In <Col N="30"/>2010, only 5.3% of the total health budget was allocated to mental health services, compared to 13% in 1986, and A Vision for Change recommends that the allocation should be 8.4%.  I suggest to the Minister for Health that &euro;53 million per annum is inadequate to achieve the level of spending recommended and the commitment should be revisited.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this important issue.  I am aware that the number of deaths by suicide has increased in recent years.  Discussing statistics in this context seems cold and unfeeling but we need to be aware of the increasing number of deaths by suicide.  In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion on the number of deaths that are not reported in the statistics as suicides, we must be consistent in making comparisons until we make a decision on moving in that direction.  There is no doubt that the suspicion arises in certain incidents, such as single vehicle fatal accidents, that suicide was involved.</P>
        <P>The suicide rate in Ireland had been undergoing a gradual decline, from 497 in 2003 to 458 in 2007.  These decreases gave cause for optimism that the action taken at local and national level to prevent suicide was having a positive impact.  However, the number of deaths by suicide increased to 506 in 2008, an increase of 10.5% over the 2007 figures, and the provisional figures from the Central Statistics Office are 527 for 2009 and 486 for 2010.  These are staggering statistics and they show that more people lose their lives from suicide than on the roads.  The increases in 2008 and 2009 were largely in the middle age groups, which we think were severely affected by the economic downturn.  Male suicides outnumber female suicides by a ratio of 4:1 and in some younger age groups the ratio is 7:1.  While welcome, the reduction between 2009 and 2010 still leaves us to deal with a high level of suicides.</P>
        <P>Reach Out, our policy strategy on suicide prevention, outlines the actions that need to be taken to prevent suicide and deliberate self-harm and increase awareness of the importance of good mental health.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention is responsible for the implementation of Reach Out.  A number of suicide prevention initiatives have been progressed in recent years, including the development and implementation of the ASIST and Safetalk national training programmes and the development of mental health awareness campaigns through TV, radio, cinema and outdoor advertising and the production of websites and written material.</P>
        <P>In 2011, mental health awareness campaigns will focus on young people and those in distress as a result of their economic vulnerability.  There is continued support for voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention; this year, with the additional &euro;l million provided for suicide prevention, a further 25 programmes were funded.  Specialist training has been agreed and implemented with the Garda, the Prison Service and the Defence Forces and work is under way with the fire and ambulance services.  In addition, a &ldquo;tough economic times&rdquo; information and training programme has been introduced for the staff of organisations such as citizens advice centres, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and so on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During 2011, the National Office for Suicide Prevention will continue to develop both the number and range of training and awareness programmes, including the ASIST<Insert> </Insert>programme, to reach the most vulnerable in our communities; improve and standardise the response to deliberate self-harm presentations; develop the capacity of primary care to respond to suicidal behaviour and consider new models of response; and ensure that helpline supports for those in emotional distress are co-ordinated and widely publicised.  Within each of these four areas an emphasis will be placed on the most vulnerable groups identified in Reach Out and more recent research.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="31"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  While he has pointed to several positive developments, the reality is that we are coming from a very low base given the historical neglect in the area of suicide prevention and mental health service provision.  I welcome the firm commitment given by the Taoiseach at the People of the Year Awards last weekend that the resources of the Government will be available to develop and improve mental health services in order to save lives and support the 70,000 people each year who attempt suicide or engage in self-harm.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister comment on reports that the level of staffing at the National Office for Suicide Prevention has been reduced?  While the budget for the office is currently in the region of &euro;4 million, the programme for Government includes a commitment to increase the level of funding.  I propose that it should be increased to &euro;10 million over the lifetime of the Government, which would require an additional &euro;2 million from the &euro;35 million allocated to mental health services.  I refer not to additional funding which must be found from somewhere else, but to the funding that is already committed to mental health services.  An allocation of &euro;2 million per annum should be given to the Office for Suicide Prevention from this funding line to deal specifically with suicide prevention.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to thank the director of the office, Mr. Geoff Day, who has announced his retirement, for his excellent work since its establishment.  Suicide prevention is an important arm of health service provision within the Health Service Executive and it is important that the Office for Suicide Prevention is given additional support.  The current allocation of &euro;4 million has been totally inadequate to deal with the issue nationally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Neville&rsquo;s commitment in this area is well known for many years.  I accept that the service base is low and that much requires to be done.  Nevertheless, I remind the Deputy that within our primary care strategy, it is our intention that each primary care centre will have a mental health facility so that people with mental health problems will be treated in the same way as any other patient, thus helping to remove the stigma associated with mental illness.  It often seems to be acceptable to talk about one&rsquo;s sore leg or chest pain but not to talk about mental health difficulties.  That stigma must be debunked.</P>
        <P>I too pay tribute to Mr. Geoff Day for all the work he has done.  Some stories in the press have suggested he is leaving because of a lack of resources.  This is not the case.  I met him last Friday at the Console conference where he made clear to me, as he had done earlier to conference attendees, that he is taking the opportunity to pursue a master&rsquo;s degree at Trinity College.  He had intended to retire next year but has done so a little earlier in order to commence his studies.  Mr. Day has generously and kindly offered his services to us in the coming years.  I am grateful to him for that and have no doubt he will continue to be a very valuable resource.</P>

    <Sect LHead="Hospital Waiting" RHead="Lists"> 
      <sTitle>Hospital Waiting Lists</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this vital issue for discussion.  Some days ago we heard the shocking revelation that the number of people waiting longer than three months for a colonoscopy has more than doubled in the past year.  Colonoscopies are used in the early detection of bowel cancer and are therefore a crucial life-saving measure.  It is shocking that the waiting list now stands at more than 2,400, according to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The Irish Cancer Society has stated that more people than ever before are now waiting longer than three months for this crucial test, with an additional 1,400 joining the list in the past year.  Beaumont Hospital in Dublin has the largest waiting list at 662.</P>
        <P>The waiting list at St. Luke&rsquo;s General Hospital in Kilkenny is also very large.  This should strike a particular chord because it was there that a young mother, Susie Long&rsquo;s, diagnosis of <Col N="32"/>bowel cancer was delayed by a catastrophic seven months in 2005 to 2006, which cost her life and deprived her family of a devoted partner and mother.  She died because she was on a public waiting list.  Had she been wealthy or covered by private health insurance, it is most likely this tragedy would have been averted.  The then Minister for Health admitted that the health service nationally had failed Susie Long and many others in her position.</P>
        <P>Five years later, it is shameful in the extreme that waiting lists are lengthening.  It is little wonder that Conor MacLiam, husband of Susie Long, has expressed his anger that after the tragedy he and his family endured, a situation could continue where other people might suffer the same fate.  That is a betrayal of the serious, solemn promise made following Susie Long&rsquo;s death that nobody would have to wait longer than a month for a colonoscopy.  No doubt the waiting times have been badly affected by the savage cuts in hospital funding being ruthlessly implemented by the HSE.  For example, Blanchardstown hospital, which has a long list, has endured a savage reduction of 19% in its funding in the last two years.  Colleagues and I have received correspondence from 23 doctors there describing the catastrophe this is causing.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>These life-threatening cuts are being made while the Government continues to spend tens of billions of taxpayers&rsquo; funds to salvage the European financial institutions and Irish speculators who gambled recklessly in Irish property.  The EU-IMF-ECB strictures on austerity are placing people&rsquo;s lives under threat.  The HSE claims that almost all patients who require colonoscopies and who are deemed urgent cases are tested within 28 days.  This is disingenuous and highly misleading.  The Irish Cancer Society points out that there is no clinical way of identifying all urgent cases since bowel cancer can be well advanced in some cases before severe symptoms are detected.  The delays in providing colonoscopies are condemning to death people who depend on our public health service and cannot afford private care.</P>
        <P>Why has the promise that nobody would wait longer than one month for a test for bowel cancer not been implemented?  What is the Minister&rsquo;s timeframe to effect that promise?  Will he give us the precise and immediate schedule showing what resources will be made available to honour the pledge made to the memory of Susie Long and in memory of all those who have tragically suffered, including many who have died, from bowel cancer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the issue of colonoscopy waiting times.  As has been widely reported, the most recent waiting list figures provided by the National Treatment Purchase Fund to the Irish Cancer Society show 2,418 people are waiting longer than three months for colonoscopy tests.  I have no hesitation in saying that both the numbers waiting and the longer waiting times are unacceptable.</P>
      
        <P>That is the reason the HSE has put in place a specific waiting list initiative to address this issue.</P>
        <P>It is important to point out that colonoscopy tests are carried out to monitor a range of other conditions besides cancer, including bowel disorders such as Crohn&rsquo;s disease and inflammatory bowel disease.  I would like to clarify that while more than 50,000 colonoscopies a year are carried out in our public hospital system, the vast majority of patients are diagnosed as not having cancer.  In 2009, the HSE provided hospitals with national guidelines on managing colonoscopies.  This included a definition to prioritise patients referred for colonoscopy services into two groups, urgent and non-urgent.</P>
        <P>The target timeframe within which urgent cases must be seen is four weeks.  I accept, as Deputy Higgins said, that there is no exact science in terms of identifying all urgent and non-urgent cases.  The symptoms which make a situation urgent are well known and these should receive priority.  That is the way it has to be.  However, I do not accept this number of people <Col N="33"/>should be on a waiting list for a colonoscopy, urgent or non-urgent.  I will deal in a moment with how we are going to address that.  The target timeframe within which urgent cases must be seen is four weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Data on waiting times for urgent colonoscopies has been collected.  The monthly performance reports from the HSE show that the vast majority of people requiring an urgent colonoscopy receive the procedure within the 28 day target.  In the month of June, 98.1% of patients waiting for an urgent colonoscopy had the procedure within the 28 day target.  Nationally, five patients were outside the 28 day target.  This is a slight improvement on the May figure, when the rate was 97.8%, with 20 people outside the 28 day target.  It is important to stress that the NTPF waiting list referred to by the Deputy does not include urgent cases which are assessed and deemed by a doctor as being at risk from cancer.</P>
        <P>With regard to HSE waiting lists initiatives for routine colonoscopies, the figures from the NTPF show that more than 1,600 people are waiting three to six months and a total of 2,418 are waiting up to 12 months and longer for the procedure.  As I mentioned earlier, the HSE has put in place a specific waiting list initiative which will see at least an additional 3,000 endoscopies, namely, colonoscopies and upper GI endoscopies, take place by the end of the year in hospitals where there are waiting lists.  The aim of this initiative is to increase access to routine colonoscopies for patients.  A second phase of this initiative will bring the total additional number of endoscopies to be undertaken to 7,000.</P>
        <P>The initiative involves providing funding to around 20 hospitals which will allow additional procedures to be undertaken within a strict timeframe during 2011 in order to address current problems.  It may involve referral of patients to a different HSE hospital in line with the NTPF approach.  This approach has a number of benefits, including increased access for patients, reductions in waiting lists for hospitals and assisting candidate screening colonoscopy units in their preparation for participating in the national colorectal screening programme which is scheduled to commence in 2012.</P>
        <P>HSE monthly performance data show that practically all of those referred for urgent colonoscopy are being seen with a 28-day time frame.  In addition, in regard to waiting times for non-urgent colonoscopy, I welcome the HSE&rsquo;s specific targeted initiative to address these and to ensure that those referred are seen in a timely manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister agreed with the Irish Cancer Society that it is not possible to clinically identify urgent cases.  The response prepared for him by the HSE relies on the fact that so-called urgent cases are seen within 28 days.  However, many cases of cancer, which could be advancing with detection, will not, therefore, fall within the urgent case cohort.  That issue has not been dealt with.  The only way this can be dealt with comprehensively is if the one month maximum waiting time is absolute in every hospital in every part of the country.</P>
        <P>The Minister has, with respect, contradicted himself in his reply.  I ask that he be more precise.  Within which timeframe will every person needing a colonoscopy be given the procedure?  Does the Minister accept that the pressure which hospitals are under in terms of resources militates against that type of service being available and that it is an urgent issue which must also be addressed by him?</P>
        <P>In reality, this is a cancer waiting list.  Poor people, those on modest incomes and affected by the recession and the tens of thousands forced out of private insurance are now potential victims in this scenario.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to address both of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions in the short time available to me.  I have not contradicted myself.  We know with certainty the cases that are urgent.  We do not know with certainty the cases that might be urgent.  That is the way cases <Col N="34"/>are categorised.  In other words, we know the symptoms which cause concern and should be seeking to identify.  Doctors know such cases are urgent.  That is not to suggest that people with innocuous symptoms will not also transpire to have cancer.  Let us face it, in some jurisdictions which carry out routine colonoscopies cancer is identified despite the patient having no other symptoms.</P>
        <P>Given the current climate, we are focussing on urgent cases.  It is our intention, through the additional resources we are putting in place, to tender to have the backlog of colonoscopies in hospitals cleared.  I cannot, however, tell the House today how much funding is being put aside as to do so would render the tender expensive.  In other words, if people know how much money we have that is the amount at which they will pitch their tender.  I will not share that information with the House as I want to get best value for the taxpayer and the best service for the patient.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct that hospitals are under pressure.  It is a legacy of the previous Government that hospitals were &euro;70 million in the red at the commencement of this year.  The previous Government allowed a huge overrun in activity in the first three months.  We must also meet our commitments under the EU-IMF arrangement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the message to go out that we have a strategy to address this backlog.  We are putting in place additional funds to make that happen and are addressing the issue in a manner which we hope will yield maximum result for patients who need this service.</P>

	<P>With no candidate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;with a commitment to honesty and transparency.  The Taoiseach may not have seen it from his office but outside this House today there is a group of pensioners pointing out the truth of the effect of this Government&rsquo;s raid during the last term on private pensions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Was Mr. Gay Byrne advising Deputy Martin?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach, when asked again and again in May and June about this issue, dodged the questions and hid the truth.  It took the Freedom of Information Act for us to uncover that the Government received and ignored repeated warnings about the damage <Col N="35"/>this levy could do.  The Taoiseach hid that information from the House.  I sought this information in May and June and the Taoiseach refused to provide it.</P>
        <P>Before the Taoiseach repeats his standard line minimising the impact of this levy, he should consider the following.  One member of the group with whom I met today is drawing a pension of &euro;10,000 per annum.  The effect of the pensions levy, and the Government&rsquo;s insistence, through legislation, that the pensioner pays, on this individual is not 0.6% as trumpeted by the Taoiseach but 10%.  This man&rsquo;s income falls from &euro;10,000 per annum to &euro;9,000 per annum for the next four years.  This is just the start of it.  At least 70,000 other private pension holders in this country will feel the full impact of the levy from 25 September onwards and that is just the first tranche.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of political gimmickry, the Taoiseach ignored the advice of qualified experts in the Departments of Finance and Social Protection.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform were warned that this levy was coming at the worst possible time as employers and employees do not have the resources to make additional contributions.  The result since its introduction has been no new jobs and more people on the live register.</P>
        <P>It is clear the Taoiseach withheld crucial information about the danger of the levy when he pushed it through the House.  It has become increasingly clear that the initiative was less about creating jobs and more about the image-building that characterised his early days in Government.  Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that the impact of this levy on the 70,000 people, at a minimum, who will be hit by it at the end of the month will be significantly more damaging than he admitted at the time of its introduction?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin is welcome back.  I would be the first to acknowledge that it would be wonderful to stand up here as Taoiseach and have very different stories to tell.

      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

I recognise the challenge that so many people in our country face today as do they and they want the Govern<Col N="36"/>ment to sort out this problem.  There is no point in living in fantasy land or behind the shadows here.  The levy was introduced by Government decision as a temporary measure for job creation facilities and there is an impact.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s party political game-playing is cold comfort to the people outside on &euro;10,000 per annum who, through the levy, will be reduced to &euro;9,000 per annum.

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;before he or the Minister for Finance would provide the information on the floor of the House to facilitate debate, on fundamental questions that go to the heart of this issue in terms of those concerned.  It is a disgrace and it is incredible that he would have the nerve to say that in this House.  How dare he say it.  It shows an absolute disrespect for this House and for the right of Deputies to the most basic information on budgetary decisions.  The pension levy was the Taoiseach&rsquo;s idea.</P>

It was a disgraceful performance in terms of a Government that has trumpeted transparency in respect of more information that is allegedly supposed to come before the House.</P>
        <P>I asked in May and June, during Leaders&rsquo; Questions, if the Taoiseach sought and received legal advices and, if so, if he would lay those advices before the House.  It was mid-summer before we got that information through the Freedom of Information Act.  The Taoiseach delib<Col N="37"/>erately misled the D&aacute;il and deliberately hid this information from the House because he did not want the truth to come out at the time.</P>

Of course I understand the impact of any levy on people.  People walk into my office just as they walk into Deputy Martin&rsquo;s office.

      </Speaker><Col N="38"/>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh ci&uacute;nas ann nuair a labhar&oacute;idh m&eacute; agus an Taoiseach.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte ar ais roimh an Taoiseach.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam gur bhain s&eacute; sult as a rothar i rith an tsamhraidh.  Nuair a bh&iacute; s&eacute; ag rotha&iacute;ocht, an bhfaca s&eacute; an bealach eile, an bealach chun an St&aacute;t a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il?  Every day since we left here, the Government has given &euro;315 million to the banks.  Some &euro;17 billion has been handed over to them.  In the 20 minutes it takes for questions to the Taoiseach, &euro;4.4 million will be given by the Government to them.  How can he justify this?  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Barnardos have said that one third of our children are without a warm coat or a hot meal and the 0.5 million people on the dole are being joined by people from TalkTalk and from the Gaeltacht regions.  I met pensioners from Tara mines who have had a 10% reduction in their pensions.  Surely, it is time to seize the moment, to change Government policy and put this money not into banks but into job creation to get our people back to work and to grow the economy, and to realise that we cannot cut our way out of the recession.</P>
        <P>What will be the social consequences of all this?  What will be left in terms of society, community, family and of social protections?  What about equality for Irish citizens?  I ask the Taoiseach to signal a step-change in Government policy, that is, money should not go into the banks but into job creation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government made a series of strategic decisions to restructure the bank system and to recapitalise banks.  We are all aware of the numbers of people who are in a distressed condition because of their mortgages.  We have set out the issues that currently apply there, where discussions should take place in the first instance between the lender and the borrower.  We are waiting for a series of recommendations from an expert group to report by the end of September.</P>
        <P>I spoke to an employer over the weekend who interviewed three times for employees in a nursing home, was unable to get any Irish employee to take a job at &euro;10, &euro;10.50 or &euro;11 per hour and must now bring in people from abroad who will work on those wages and send back contributions to their own countries.  I am well aware of the extent of the live register but I am also aware that the direction of the Government will be to reduce the burden on employers, business and opportunities for employment and initiatives.  To have a situation where we have 14.4% on the live register is completely unacceptable.  One cannot change the direction of such a magnitude overnight or in 20 weeks but the focus of the Government is to sort out our public finances&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>We missed that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but with a direct emphasis on the creation of jobs and initiatives.</P>
        <P>Deputy Adams is well aware that the extent of investment and investment opportunities from abroad is strong, as evidenced from the trade surplus based on our exports but our indigenous economy is flat and it is there that confidence measures must be placed.  This is why the Government reduced the PRSI for employers.  It is also why the Government reduced the VAT applied to the hospitality sector, which had such a direct beneficial impact on this summer alone.  It is in those areas that we will continue to focus Government direction.</P>
        <P>Of course I am well aware of the difficulties that many communities and people are experiencing these days.  There is a rocky period ahead &mdash; there is no doubt about that &mdash; but the Government will not back away from its responsibility for giving our country back to our people, restoring our economic independence and forging a better future for everybody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, it needs more than rhetoric to do that.  The Government is making political choices.  For example, the Government has signalled that it will take up to <Col N="39"/>&euro;4 billion in increased taxes and cuts in the December budget.  That will be the Government&rsquo;s choice.  The Taoiseach cannot blame Fianna F&aacute;il for it.</P>
        <P>I say this fraternally and, like the Taoiseach, with the best interests of the Irish people in my heart, but we want the Government to get people back to work.  The Taoiseach is in Government with a whopping majority.  Labour, the party of the working class, is in Government with him.  Bring forward a jobs package.  The Taoiseach greeted President Obama to this country and we were all glad to see him.  The President has just announced a jobs package in the United States of America.  He recognises that one cannot go forward unless one gets people back to work.  This is our request, appeal, challenge and plea to the Government &mdash; get people back to work.  Do not put the money into the pockets of top civil servants and top politicians, those who will walk off.  Do not put the money into the toxic banks.  The Government should put the money into getting our people back into good jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s belief in the principle of creating the maximum number of jobs that we can.  The arguments that we had before the summer recess about the interest rate reduction are not being raised now because it is being applied with great benefit to the country.</P>

	<P>The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has welcomed the adoption of the proposals by the European Commission today in respect of the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, EFSM, loan facility.

	<P>In respect of both the EFSM and the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, the reduction will be of genuine benefit to the country over the next number of years.</P>
        <P>The banks have been restructured and recapitalised.  As Deputy Adams is aware, &euro;1 billion of private equity has gone into one of those banks.  The Government has made the decision to have the portfolio of assets of Anglo Irish Bank in the USA offered for sale and strong bids are being submitted in that regard.  Confidence measures are being evidenced by this kind of momentum.</P>
        <P>We have got a very long way to go.  I will say something to the Deputy as the leader of his party.  If he is interested in job creation, in this Chamber in this session he will have the opportunity to point out credible opportunities that are realistic and can be considered for implementation by the Minister, Deputy Noonan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Ceann Comhairle and the Taoiseach back after the summer break.  I wish everyone well for this term.  I wish to raise the issue of education and its importance to the country&rsquo;s future, in particular as a major tool to get us out of this economic mess.  I just left the Leinster House gates where hundreds of parents, teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, are protesting the education service. Has the Government devised plans to raise the school-going age to five?</P>

	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>What are the Government&rsquo;s plans to address the shortage of qualified maths teachers in second level schools?  Does the Government plan to increase the pupil-teacher ratio in primary and second level schools to save &euro;75 million and at the expense of 1,200 jobs?  In this day and age, is it acceptable for children with a disability to be locked out of school on their first day back because there are no places, resource teachers or SNAs?  Some of them have been offered a lousy one hour per week service.  Does the Taoiseach accept this as part of modern Ireland?  Would members of the Government accept the same reduction in services for any of their children?  The parents&rsquo; tears on the first day of school were a scandal and a disgrace.  It is shameful that families are suffering and their children are being locked out of schools.  What will the Taoiseach do about these serious national issues?  Will he stand up for education and protect our schools and pupils?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked a number of questions.  The answer in respect of a Government decision about increasing the age of attendance is that no decision has been taken.  The answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question about a Government decision in respect of changing the pupil-teacher ratio is that no decision has been made.  I have outlined the situation in so far as SNAs are concerned.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="41"/>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>No decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Education and Skills held back more than 400 of these appointments so that they could be allocated in cases where they are absolutely necessary.  I had occasion to make contact with the Department of Education and Skills recently about two individual cases.  As the Deputy is aware, the professional assessor decides on the basis of professional qualifications the needs for any individual child, and the special needs officer of the Department discusses the use and the allocation of the SNAs to the school.  I made the point before the summer that if particular cases arise, they should be brought to the attention of the professional qualified assessors of need for the children in question.  The Deputy and I meet those affected.  The matter causes enormous stress for people in certain households.</P>
        <P>There has not been a cut in resource teachers.  As the Deputy knows, resource hours for pupils with special educational needs who require particular supports are allocated by the National Council for Special Education.  The number of resource teachers to be allocated in 2011 has increased over that for last year.  There are more resource teachers than there were before.  There were 9,600 whole-time equivalent posts for 2010.  For the new school year, this will rise to 9,950, representing an increase of 350 resource teacher posts this year.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s question on mathematics, all second level schools were sent a questionnaire on 5 September relating to the qualifications of mathematics teachers.  The results of the survey showed that of a total of 2,045 teachers teaching mathematics in 258 schools, 1,400 are fully qualified to do so, 596 have undergone some studies in mathematics and 49 have no third level qualifications or have conducted no studies in mathematics.  I find it somewhat unusual that the employers &mdash; in this case, the boards of management and principal teachers &mdash; would not have queried the actual qualifications for teaching mathematics in the first instance.  One is aware that the Minister for Education and Skills has announced a programme of up-skilling mathematics teachers, to start in January 2012.  Having met various business representatives, I note some are very happy with the standard of students coming through while others are not.  I was speaking to a businessperson some nights ago who was looking for 35 IT staff but who could not get anybody.  There is a worldwide shortage of designers, planners and programmers.  The Minister for Education and Skills is certainly considering this in the most serious fashion because it is fundamental to the well-being of our economy and the quality of our graduates over the coming years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  If he has made a commitment on the school entry age, I welcome it.  It is all very well for the Taoiseach to say what he said but the reality is that 227 SNAs have gone out of the system.  Why are hundreds of people at the gates today protesting about cuts to services for children with special needs?</P>
        <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach a couple of questions on his views on education.  I ask him to change the mindset of the Government on education.  Does he regard education as a cost or an investment?  He should ascertain whether the governments of countries such as Finland have targeted children with special needs or the weak or poor children during their similar economic problems.  We spend &euro;9 billion on educational services, yet we cannot find a couple of euro to protect the weakest and front line services.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is economic madness to slash the education budget while at the same time handing over &euro;100 million to private schools?  Where does the Government stand on the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s strong concern over the two-tier education system, on which he commented before the general election?  One private school in Dublin charges a fee of &euro;5,160, gets &euro;2.1 million from the taxpayer and employs an extra 12 teachers.  If the Taoiseach slashed 50% of <Col N="42"/>the funding for such wealthy schools, he could pay for all the SNAs and resource teachers required for children with special needs.</P>
        <P>I ask the Taoiseach to make a really tough decision to support our educational services, particularly for those with priority needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not regard education as a charge or cost but as an opportunity and as having potential.  It is of great importance to the country.  The National Council for Special Education has advised all the mainstream schools of their SNA allocations.  Four hundred and seventy-five have not yet received an allocation for particular cases where they are clearly needed.  Most of these allocations will apply outside the mainstream schools, in respect of which notification has already been issued.  As I stated before, the Department decided approximately 475 of the 10,575 posts should be retained in order to allocate them over the coming school year in cases of emergency, where appeals are justified, or where there are acquired injuries or new school entrants, for example.  That only makes common sense.  The Minister for Education and Skills is very much aware of this.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to Finland and what was done there.  Clearly, over 20 years Finnish governments invested heavily in the training of teachers to teach.  There is a need for leadership courses for principal teachers in schools so they can motivate their teaching staff who operate under great pressure.  I am quite sure the Minister is clearly aware of this.  I have no doubt the scheme being put forward by the Minister to improve teaching techniques and elements of mathematics teaching will bear huge dividends.  As Deputy Finian McGrath is aware, Project Maths, through promoting an understanding of the relevance of numbers and their practical applications, will have a bearing on the quality and range of students emerging in the years ahead.  As the Deputy is aware, issues such as vectors and complex numbers should all be understood in a general way by students.  I hope this will happen through the Project Maths scheme.</P>

	<P>Over the summer, we watched as the pledge by leaders coming out of the eurozone summit in July that they had agreed a radical plan which would safeguard the euro unravelled.  Will the Taoiseach provide time for a D&aacute;il debate on the summit?  In providing such time I am sure he will acknowledge that the threat posed by the increasing paralysis in European decision-making is very real, substantial and increasingly imminent.  Will the Taoiseach undertake to publish prior to such a debate his proposals, perhaps those which he has submitted to eurozone leaders, concerning the debt crisis?  Has he provided such advice?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is a debate promised on this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No debate has been promised but I am not opposed to having a debate on it.  It is just a matter of finding the time for it.  As Deputy Martin is aware, very clear decisions were made at the July meeting of the European Council and very clear commitments were given at it.  For our part, we have implemented and are implementing in full the conditions set out.  Obviously some benefits are accruing from the interest rate reduction.</P>
        <P>The troika is paying a further visit to Greece this week and it will make its views known on the implementation of the policies to which the Greek Government signed up arising from further facilities in July.  A meeting of the ECOFIN Ministers will take place on Friday.  As it is appropriate, I do not have any objection to having a debate on this matter as soon as it is feasible.  A number of pieces of legislation are strictly timelined, such as the referenda and the insurance Bill.  The legislation on the referenda must be cleared by 27 September for the referenda to be held on the election date.  A total of ten Bills are timelined because of the EU-IMF deal.  I have no objection to having a debate when it is appropriate on the European situation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to hear the Taoiseach state this because I was rising to ask the same question.  Time needs to be set aside for this issue.  Rather than having a debate, the D&aacute;il and the people need to know what contingencies the Government has put in place in the case of a Greek default.  We need to discuss any plan the Government has.  We need to know whether the Taoiseach has spoken directly to any of the other European leaders.  There is much speculation about plans being made for states to hand over significant fiscal powers to Europe.  We need to know whether the Taoiseach would support such a move.  Will he set aside time to make a statement on this issue?  Perhaps he will take the opportunity today to clarify this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance will set out a three-year fiscal plan for the country when the comprehensive spending analysis has been completed and we have examined it.  When we agree on a time for a debate on the European situation the Deputy will have an opportunity to give his views on it.</P>

I find it highly unsatisfactory that we know only on a Thursday evening when the Whips meet what will be the legislative programme for the following week.  We need much more notice so we can better prepare and research in advance.  In the next week, will the Taoiseach provide us with an <Col N="45"/>indicative and approximate timeframe for the legislation the Government will bring to the Chamber between now and the end of the year?

        <P>I thank colleagues for agreeing to consider this legislation at an early stage.  Deputies will recall that when I published the Bill at the beginning of August it was with a view to everyone having adequate opportunity to consider it ahead of our debates in this House.</P>
        <P>This Bill honours a commitment in the programme for Government.  I am happy we are in a position to proceed with this referendum at this early stage of the Government&rsquo;s term and at the same time as the presidential election.  The terms of the Referendum Act 1994 require that a referendum Bill pass both Houses of the Oireachtas no later than 30 days prior to polling.  I am grateful to all Deputies for their co-operation in taking it this afternoon.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s main objective in bringing forward this proposed amendment to the Constitution is to put before the people an option which would allow the pay of judges to be reduced on the basis of certain conditions and in very exceptional circumstances.  The proposal will protect the independence of the Judiciary while also maintaining the good public standing the Judiciary following a period during which, through no fault of their own, judges have found themselves in a very difficult position.</P>
        <P>Safeguarding judicial independence is of value to every citizen.  It means that people can be assured that judges&rsquo; decisions are taken solely on the basis of law, independent of any fear, favour or influence, whether personal, political or media driven.</P>
      
        <P>The power of judges to uphold the Constitution and strike down aspects of our law is a fundamental bulwark against the risk of tyranny and oppression.  Impartial judicial decision-making and public confidence in that impartiality when disputes occur between the State and-or State agencies and individual citizens is an essential cornerstone of our constitutional democ<Col N="50"/>racy.  Guaranteed this independence, the judicial system in a democracy serves as a safeguard of the rights and freedoms of all the people.  We have been well served by our independent Judiciary and I have not, been nor will I ever be found wanting in ensuring its independence is strengthened and secured.  As Deputies may be aware, in November 2009, when a member of the Opposition, I tabled a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to amend the Constitution which, had the then Government seen fit to accept it, would have ensured that judges were in a position to accept the same pay reductions which had then been imposed on the public service.  However, in the event it was not accepted and instead the previous Government, by specifically excluding the Judiciary from a levy applied to everyone else paid from public funds, put the members of the Judiciary in a difficult position, not of their own making.  As Deputies will be aware, this resulted from the previous Government&rsquo;s interpretation of the terms of Article 35.5 of the Constitution.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>This was not, I am convinced, the original intention of this provision which is operated in most common law countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States.  Indeed, the current terms of Article 35.5 are taken from the original 1922 Constitution which replicates almost directly the terms of Article 3 of the US Constitution.  Some countries, including the United States, have overcome the unfairness of the difficulty presented by the blanket protection of judicial salaries by allowing the salaries of judges to decrease in real terms over decades by failing to increase them in line with inflation or other public service increases.  This explains to some extent why Irish judges are among the best paid internationally.  However, in my view, this is not a valid approach, given the importance of the Judiciary as an institution of the State.</P>
        <P>The Judiciary holds a unique place in the structure of our democracy, required daily to adjudicate on disputes between citizens and the other branches of Government and for that reason it is vital that its independence is protected from all potential attack.  The respect for and confidence in judicial decisions is based on the confidence that every person who enters a court is secure in the knowledge that the judge is independent of the State and not subject to interference or threat, irrespective of the outcome of the litigation.  This safeguard is fundamental to our constitutional system.</P>
        <P>Some have argued that to adjust the Constitution in the proposed way undermines the framework of judicial independence outlined throughout Article 35.  The point has also been made that the amount of money potentially saved would be relatively small.  If implemented, the savings in respect of serving judges would amount to approximately &euro;5.5 million per full year.  Legislation setting a new lower pay rate in respect of newly appointed judges will be introduced this session by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, the savings are not the main objective.  The Government approaches this issue from the point of view of fundamental fairness.  Our strong view is that, far from attacking judicial independence, the proposed amendment is designed to strengthen and uphold the standing of the Judiciary and to ensure that, at a time of unprecedented fiscal and economic difficulty, members of the Judiciary are not perceived as an elite group immune to the current crisis who either will not or cannot contribute their fair share, in common with all others paid from the public purse.  I believe the proposed amendment strikes a balance between the traditional protection afforded to judges&rsquo; pay while allowing for the very difficult position in which Ireland now finds itself.</P>
        <P>The Bill itself is short and contains just three short subsections that will be the focus of today&rsquo;s debate.  The Bill as published proposes that Article 35.5 of the Constitution be amended by the substitution of the following:</P><Col N="51"/>
        <P LI="1">5.  1&deg; The remuneration of judges shall not be reduced during their continuance in office save in accordance with this section.</P>
        <P LI="2">2&deg; The remuneration of judges is subject to the imposition of taxes, levies or other charges that are imposed by law on persons generally or persons belonging to a particular class.</P>
        <P LI="2">3&deg; Where, before or after the enactment into law of this section, reductions have been or are made by law to the remuneration of persons belonging to classes of persons whose remuneration is paid out of public money and such law states that those reductions are in the public interest, provision may also be made by law to make reductions to the remuneration of judges.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As is evident from the proposed wording, the general protection afforded the Judiciary in most countries is retained.  The second subsection confirms the current position, upheld by the Supreme Court in the well known case, O&rsquo;Byrne <i>v</i> Minister for Finance in 1959, which held that the imposition of taxes on judges&rsquo; salaries is valid.  The final subsection provides that reductions made in the past or future in public service pay on the basis of the public interest can be applied, &ldquo;by law&rdquo;, that is, by primary legislation enacted by this House, to judges&rsquo; remuneration.  In other words, reductions will only be done in exceptional circumstances.</P>
        <P>It is essential to set out why this amendment is being put before the people by this Government.  In early 2009, the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government introduced legislation to apply a public service pension levy on all public servants.  The members of the Judiciary were specifically exempted from this levy or deduction because, it was then stated, of the constitutional ban on reducing their salaries as in Article 35.5.  Following on the pension levy introduced by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, a second Financial Emergency Measures Act was introduced later that same year which reduced the gross salaries of all those paid from the public purse.  Again, the Judiciary was exempted from this reduction.  Judges are not public servants; they are constitutional officeholders.  They are, however, paid from public moneys and operate within the public service environment.</P>
        <P>As the Chief Justice has observed, judges are daily witnesses to the difficulties which the current economic crisis brings &mdash; whether in family law, criminal proceedings or civil and bankruptcy cases.  I believe it is essential that they themselves are seen to be subject to the very different circumstances which now prevail.  The Judiciary recognised this necessity through the arrangement entered into by the then Chief Justice with the Revenue Commissioners which facilitated judges to make a voluntary contribution equivalent to the pension levy introduced in the first of the Acts to which I have already referred.  I understand a majority of judges have made this contribution in respect of the pension levy deductions.</P>
        <P>The current provisions of Article 35.5 have, in effect, led to an anomaly that puts judges&rsquo; pay out of line with pay in the public sector at a time when that pay has been the subject of financial emergency measures approved by this House.  It is worth noting that the 2009 report of the review body on remuneration in the public sector, which recommended pay cuts for higher-paid public servants, stated that the review body would have considered a cut in judges&rsquo; pay in line with those borne by senior public servants but was precluded from doing so by virtue of Article 35.5 of the Constitution.  This objective and independent report recognised the duty of judges to contribute proportionately, that is to say, on the same basis as others paid from the public purse, to tackling our financial emergency.  In view of the inequity of the situation and cognisant of the difficult position in which judges found themselves, this Government, as part of our agreed programme committed to hold a referendum at the earliest opportunity on this matter so as to allow the people determine whether these Houses should have <Col N="52"/>the power to cut judges&rsquo; pay on the same basis as it has cut the pay of others paid out of the public purse.  By enabling judges to pay their fair share, in this instance contributing an annual saving to the State of some &euro;5.5 million, I believe public confidence in the administration of justice will be maintained and enhanced in the eyes of many of our citizens.</P>
        <P>I will now turn to the specific draft amendment put forward by the Government in this Bill.  The proposed Article 35.5.1 restates the existing general constitutional protections afforded to judges&rsquo; remuneration while allowing for certain constitutionally based exceptions to this protection. It is important that this measure be retained.</P>
        <P>As I have noted, judicial independence exists not for the protection of the Judiciary but for the protection of citizens.  This proposed wording will continue to afford judges full constitutional protection from arbitrary or maliciously motivated reductions by any Government.</P>
        <P>It was argued in the O&rsquo;Byrne case in 1959 that the constitutional protection in Article 35.5 extended to exempting judges from the payment of income tax.  This argument was rejected by the Supreme Court with the Chief Justice Maguire noting that:</P>
        <P LI="1">To require a judge to pay taxes on his income on the same basis as other citizens and thus contribute to the expenses of government cannot be said to be an attack on his independence.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The proposed wording of subsection 5.2 simply acknowledges that judges are, like any other citizen, subject to the imposition of taxes and levies.</P>
        <P>The substantive change in this provision is contained in subsection 5.3 which is drafted to allow that when, and only when, reductions have been made or are in future made by law to public service pay on the basis of the public interest, these reductions can be applied &ldquo;by law&rdquo; to judges&rsquo; remuneration, that is to say, it can only be done by way of primary legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  The provision clearly limits the reduction in judges&rsquo; pay to cuts applying to others paid from the public purse.  It also guards against any danger of successive reductions being made to judges&rsquo; pay alone as it can only be done where reductions are being made to public service pay.  To ensure that no misunderstanding of any nature whatsoever as to the purpose of this provision can arise, and that its intent is clear, I will on Committee Stage be tabling an amendment to subsection 5.3 to insert the word &ldquo;proportionate&rdquo; in the last line of the subsection so that the final words read &ldquo;proportionate reductions to the remuneration of judges&rdquo;.  As a consequence, if this amendment is accepted by the House, Article 35.5.3&deg; &mdash; to be put by way of referendum &mdash; will read as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">35.5.3&deg; Where, before or after the enactment into law of this section, reductions have been or are made by law to the remuneration of persons belonging to classes of persons whose remuneration is paid out of public money and such law states that those reductions are in the public interest, provision may also be made by law to make proportionate reductions to the remuneration of judges.</P>

	<P>It is important to understand that the proposed amendments will allow for the application of the reductions already imposed on the public service on serving judges.  The draft wording adheres, in effect, to the test outlined in a leading Canadian judgment &mdash; Queen v. Beauregard 1986 &mdash; in which it was stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">If there were any hint that a federal law dealing with these matters was enacted for an improper or colourable purpose, or if there was discriminatory treatment of judges <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> <Col N="53"/>other citizens, then serious issues relating to judicial independence would arise and the law might well be held to be <i>ultra vires</i>.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is nothing punitive or excessive envisaged in the draft text.  Instead it is proposed that the pay of serving judges will be reduced by the same percentage as public servants on equivalent earnings.  To that extent their salaries will be treated proportionately in the same way as the lowest paid officials.  If the referendum is carried, the reductions will apply from the date the legislation is enacted &mdash; it cannot be applied retrospectively.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, Bills to amend the Constitution are published bilingually in both Irish and English.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude on this point.  I should mention that on Committee Stage, on the advice of the official translators office, I will be moving a number of amendments to the Irish language terminology in the Bill.  These are technical amendments relating to the words for &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; and &ldquo;public interest&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that there is other information in the speech that I furnished to Deputies that I have not had the time to cover.  I draw their attention in particular to what I hope is of assistance to them in setting out clearly the financial impact on judicial salaries should the referendum be successful and the envisaged legislation enacted.  I look forward to hearing what Deputies have to say during the course of the debate.  I hope this measure will have the support of all sides of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the chance to speak on the Bill.  We will support the Bill and the subsequent referendum.  I thank the Minister and his officials who made themselves available over the summer to brief us on it and the Library and Research Service which produced a good document concerning the Bill.</P>
        <P>While we support it, I genuinely have a number of concerns about the process on which we are embarking this evening.  We are talking about a referendum to amend Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, not the standing orders of Ballymagash town council.  The fact that the proposal is simple does not and should not hide the fact that this House will debate all Stages of a Bill concerning a referendum by 10 p.m. this evening with a break for an hour and a half for Private Members&rsquo; business.</P>
        <P>The fact that the referendum itself &mdash; this applies to the second referendum on the day &mdash; is only a door-opener, in that if it is successful further legislation will follow, is also of concern to me.  All we have in respect of the further legislation is a draft scheme, which in fairness goes into some detail.  However, there is nothing to stop any Government &mdash; I do not just refer to the make-up of the Government &mdash; with a majority such as this one has from producing completely different legislation after the confidence of the people has been won in a referendum.  Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann deserves much more.  If we as an Oireachtas do not show full respect for the Constitution, it is difficult for us to ask the citizenry to do so.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on a number of areas in the course of the debate.  I apologise in advance to the Minister as I have a long-standing commitment at 7 p.m. but I hope to be back in the Chamber around 8 p.m.  It is important to point out, as the Minister has done, that 126 out of 147 serving members of the Judiciary took voluntary reductions in 2010 in line with the reductions caused by pension-related deductions in the pay of the general public and Civil Service.  While the actual savings from the referendum would be small, it is important to acknowledge that the majority of the Judiciary made that sacrifice but I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s point on the need to see the Judiciary taking the cuts meted out to others.</P><Col N="54"/>
        <P>We should focus on the thinking behind Article 35 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann which underpins judicial independence in this country.  It is easy in 2011 to dismiss the notion of judicial independence as being something that is not important.  Since the foundation of the State the Judiciary has shown considerable independence and strength of thought.  However, when we take something for granted we diminish its status.  Judicial independence is a hallmark of a strong and functioning democracy and we should never take it for granted.  We can never predict the future make-up of a Government or an Oireachtas.  To date, there have been many situations where the Judiciary has challenged Government or Oireachtas decisions.  The accompanying referendum on 27 October is a direct result of a difference of opinion between the Judiciary and the Oireachtas.  It has been the case that the Oireachtas takes judicial decisions on board and makes whatever changes are necessary.  However, in future the Oireachtas may not respond in such a way.  It may choose to ignore the Judiciary or it may respond in a negative manner.  I wish the Minister, not just as Minister but also a practitioner of the law, to provide an absolute guarantee that a future interpretation of the change to Article 35.5 which underpins judicial independence could not be applied to the broader provisions.</P>
        <P>There is ambiguity concerning the wording proposed.  I note the wording proposed by the Minister differs from that which he proposed during Private Members&rsquo; business in 2010.  I wonder why there is a difference in the wording.  Could the Minister give an absolute guarantee, both as a Minister and a practitioner of the law, that he envisages nothing in the change to the Constitution that could potentially undermine the independence of the Judiciary?</P>
        <P>Did the Minister give any consideration to establishing an independent body on judicial pay that would in line with the way he is proceeding convene at a time when other reductions are being made to bring an independent input into the management of judicial pay?  The <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of such a body would be to remove any question of decisions on judicial pay ever being influenced by aggrieved politicians or aggrieved Members of a future Oireachtas.  If the Minister did consider such an approach, why did he decide not to proceed with it?</P>
        <P>Given that we have such an amalgam of elections on 27 October &mdash; a presidential election, a by-election and another referendum &mdash; it is probable that the level of public discussion on the referendum in question will be relatively low in comparison to the other votes on the day.  We should not mistake this probability for a lack of interest or respect on the part of the public in judicial independence.  It is important to proceed with the referendum to protect the integrity of the Judiciary&rsquo;s standing, as the Minister noted.  With regard to this I pay tribute to the late Mr. Justice Vivian Lavan and the late District Justice Con Murphy, both of whom were exemplary members of the Judiciary and who passed away during the past month.  Mr. Justice Lavan, in particular, leaves the amazing monument of the free legal aid system and all that goes with it.</P>
        <P>To maintain such integrity we must proceed with this referendum, endorse it and support it.  However, in supporting it I hope the Minister can give us cast-iron guarantees that this Oireachtas is not undermining, in any indirect or unforeseen fashion, the notion of judicial independence in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill, about which there has been much discussion, especially with regard to its effect on the independence of the Judiciary.  It would be prudent from the outset to state that it is the belief of me and my party &mdash; I am sure this is shared by  everybody in the House &mdash; that judicial independence is essential to any democracy.  It exists to protect members of the public, who are entitled to have their cases heard and adjudicated upon by judges who are impartial and free from any sort of influence, including political or financial pressure.</P><Col N="55"/>
        <P Just="Left">Article 35.5 of the Constitution deals with judges&rsquo; pay and prohibits any reduction in pay during a judge&rsquo;s term in office.  The rationale behind the protection was to ensure the separation of powers and prevent any potential attempt by this or other Governments to punish or discriminate against members of the Judiciary because of any adverse decisions or findings from the Government&rsquo;s perspective.  It is an understandable and necessary protection.</P>
        <P>When the issue was first raised by the Minister, a memo was collectively issued and posted on the website of the Courts Service.  It stated that this was not a case of whether judges&rsquo; pay should be reduced but rather how that reduction should be achieved.  The memo indicated that it was not to oppose the amendment of the Constitution, which would see judges shoulder their fair share in these tough economic times, but rather to reinforce the need to safeguard judicial independence.  It mooted the idea of the independent adjudication which Deputy Calleary has referenced.  I am also interested in the considerations and thoughts of the Minister on that option.  Why did he decide not to go down that road?</P>
        <P>The issue has divided opinion in both political and media circles.  Some have suggested that the Minister&rsquo;s treatment of the Judiciary was becoming increasingly arrogant and posed a real threat to judicial independence.  I do not share that view but it has been made.  Others have suggested that the Oireachtas should have just passed an Act in preference to a referendum on judges&rsquo; pay, which is precisely what happened in the reduction of pay for other public servants.  A challenge could then be taken if people felt it was required.</P>
        <P>Members of the public are considering the debate and are probably puzzled by its elements, asking what is the big deal and why a referendum must take place.  As the Minister noted in his opening remarks, the country is in a difficult financial position, with jobs being lost daily and families struggling to keep their heads above water.  These people see a certain section of society kicking up a fuss about having pay reduced or, as has been argued, the manner in which it is to be reduced.  Most people are not interested in the argument around the separation of power, regardless of its importance, and some do not understand the complexity of the issue.  They want the matter sorted out, which is why this Bill is welcome.  The speed with which the Government has addressed the issue must be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Members of the Judiciary are among the highest paid, if not the highest paid, in Europe, which is of concern.  The salaries range from &euro;295,000 to &euro;147,000, so nobody could argue that judges are not well paid.  Their salary is supplemented by a very generous system of allowances and expenses available to judges.  Just as nobody could argue that judges are not well paid, nobody could argue that this amendment is an attempt to make paupers of judges; we are merely putting in place a mechanism that will allow those with the means to pay to shoulder their fair share of burden in these tough economic times.</P>
        <P>We have received additional information concerning savings that the Minister did not touch upon.  They will not solve our problems but it does send a message that everybody is paying their way.  For this reason we will give the Bill our full support.  To be fair to judges and to give a balanced view, it is right to indicate that some members of the Judiciary engaged with a voluntary pension levy scheme, which should be recognised.  Asking members of the Judiciary to pay taxes and levies on income, similar to those paid by everybody else, will not impinge on its independence.  The Minister alluded to the ruling of the O&rsquo;Byrne case in this regard, and the only way the Judiciary&rsquo;s independence could be compromised would be through the application of the taxes and levies to discriminate against judges.  The amendment on Committee Stage deals with this matter.</P>
        <P>Since my election I have argued that public confidence in the justice system is not what it should be.  Some people are dismayed by the rulings which come from our courts and question the consistency of sentences.  There is a growing perception that some judges are not living in <Col N="56"/>the real world.  Steps must be taken to ensure people&rsquo;s confidence is restored in our justice system.  I have raised the matter at Question Time with the Minister and I hope this Bill can be the first of many steps to try to restore people&rsquo;s confidence in our justice system.  This is not an elite group so they should be treated the same as the rest of the public.</P>
        <P>In these tough economic times, this will send a clear message that even members of the Judiciary have a responsibility to pull their weight and ensure everybody plays a part in turning around this economy.  For too long the perception and reality has been that those who cannot afford to pay are being asked to contribute more while those who can afford it get off scot free.  For such reasons I welcome the Bill and my party will facilitate its passage through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose to share time with Deputies Shane Ross, Clare Daly, Joan Collins and Catherine Murphy.  The debate surrounding this Bill concerns matters of fairness and equality, and I wonder at the making of an exception for judges in matters of pay.  Why should they be seen as being in need of this special provision, with Article 35.5 of the Constitution stipulating that the remuneration of a judge shall not be reduced during the continuance in office of that judge?  I accept the need for an independent Judiciary, but surely that is not related to remuneration.  There have been enough cases in this country where it appeared that the higher the salary, the greater was the disaster wrought by the person receiving that salary.  We have many examples of extremely highly paid individuals who played significant roles in bringing about the disastrous situation in which we find ourselves.  I am not suggesting that our highly paid judges contributed to the economic recession, but there should not be any section in our society which feels it has a privileged position and whose remuneration is written in stone.</P>
        <P>Members of the Judiciary are citizens of this country who, like all of us, are subject to the law.  They should also be subject to the same taxes, levies and reductions.  I do not know why they are not considered to be public servants as they are paid from public money.  From a principled point of view, I would have expected that members of the Judiciary would wish to contribute to the public finances in the same way as other citizens.</P>
        <P>It is important that we have an independent Judiciary.  It is essential in a democracy.  There are glaring examples of other countries where the judiciary is not independent but is subject to the political whims and ambitions of the president or government.  It is also central to the democratic process that if somebody is before a court, he or she can be assured of a hearing and adjudication by an impartial judge.  However, why should an independent judiciary be commensurate with money and a particular salary scale?  Members of the Judiciary are among the highest paid in Europe.  In this country we appear to have a propensity for wanting to have the highest paid people, be it the Judiciary, the President, the Taoiseach, consultants, senior civil servants or bank managers.  This must stop, as must the expenses regime.  I constantly call for a 50% reduction, at least, in expenses across the board.  Members of the Judiciary also have an interesting expenses allowance.</P>
        <P>A pay cut for judges is not a threat to judicial independence.  Judges are citizens and are subject to the same taxes, levies and cuts as everybody else.  I do not believe we should even have a referendum on this issue and I cannot understand how the matter ended up in the Constitution in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the independence of the Judiciary being impacted somehow by this measure, that is a load of nonsense which does not stand up to any test.  The idea <Col N="57"/>that asking judges to take a pay cut like everybody else would jeopardise their independence is simply laughable.</P>
        <P>In ways, it is an insult that we are discussing this matter at all.  I believe this is an attempt by the Government to dress itself up as some type of magnificent reformer when it could easily have dealt with the matter through legislation.  The Minister can shake his head but there is nothing that could have stopped the Oireachtas passing legislation to provide for members of the Judiciary to take a pay cut like all the other public servants in this State.  That the Minister did not bring forward such legislation exposes the fact that this is simply a smokescreen.  In addition, the fact that some members of the Judiciary have been doing so much huffing and puffing about this matter is an indictment of those members.  It does not give one confidence in their judgment that they can be so removed from the lives of ordinary people at present.</P>
        <P>If the Minister was serious about this issue, he would have introduced a Bill and let the members of the Judiciary challenge it.  Would they have had the neck, against a backdrop of people on social welfare and elderly people having their household budgets cut, to challenge such a measure?  They would not, particularly when the wages of the lowest paid are being slashed under joint labour committees, JLCs.  Nobody will be crying over judges&rsquo; pay aside from the handful of judges involved, presumably.  This legislation is a side show; it is creating an illusion that the Government is attempting to tackle the wealthy and vested interests at the top of society when, in reality, it is doing the opposite.</P>
        <P>If the Government was serious about tackling the wealthy, we would not be discussing this measure.  It would have already been implemented and we would, perhaps, be discussing the introduction of a wealth tax for the top 300 individuals who saw their personal wealth increase by almost &euro;7 billion in the past year.  We could be discussing a 10% tax on that wealth, which would generate almost twice the amount that will be generated by the cutbacks and tax hikes the Government will impose on ordinary people under the forthcoming budget.  If the Government was serious about tackling the wealthy, it would unleash a team of inspectors to assist with the Anglo Irish Bank inquiry, not a team of inspectors to hound people on social welfare.  It would try to deal with a situation where the taxpayer is shouldering a &euro;36 billion private debt as a result of the recapitalisation of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, write-down for 180 individuals and the nauseating situation whereby one of those individuals could host a society wedding for his daughter last weekend, while other parents of sons and daughters with special needs have had to spend the afternoon protesting outside the D&aacute;il for justice for their children.</P>
        <P>The record of this Government is not one of tackling the wealthy but of hounding ordinary people.  This measure today will be seen for what it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this measure in principle.  It is fair that judges should pay the same price as everybody else and that their salaries should be reduced.  What is so extraordinary about this Bill is that it is necessary at all.  What happened, however, is that the judges eyeballed the Government and forced it to take measures to reduce their salaries.  Those who maintain that their salaries should not be reduced justify their stance on the basis that it somehow retains their independence and ensures they are not subject to the type of political pressures to which other public servants are subject.  This is cant, hypocrisy and nonsense.</P>
        <P>I support what is being done.  Of course, the salaries must be reduced.  A salary of almost &euro;300,000 per year for the Chief Justice is crazy in this economic climate.  The real problem here is not that judges might be subject to political pressure or that their independence might be jeopardised or compromised if their salaries were reduced like everybody else&rsquo;s salary, but that judges are on some type of pedestal and they are now believing their own propaganda.  They believe that for some reason they are not subject to the same constraints and restrictions as <Col N="58"/>ourselves and other workers in the public service.  That is completely wrong.  What should be attacked in this Bill is not just this, but the fact, which is not recognised or talked about, that judges have been treated like sacred cows in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Judges are politically appointed, and they are often appointed for blatantly political reasons.  District judges are directly appointed by the Government, as are Supreme Court, High Court and other judges.  There is no doubt that political complexion matters when these appointments are made.  That is the problem that should be tackled.  These people are appointed by the politicians in power.  There have been many cases, and I do not wish to name people who are outside this House, of people who are members of political parties or who have loyalties to political parties being appointed as judges.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has an input into the process.  It provides a list of people to the Minister.  The Minister brings the list to the Cabinet and it can appoint one person from the list of seven.  The list will inevitably contain the names of people who are acceptable to the Government, not least because the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is stuffed with political appointees as well.</P>
        <P>That is the real problem with the Judiciary.  We need an accountable Judiciary whose members can either appear before an Oireachtas committee, similar to what happens in America, or whose members can be removed.  Judges are virtually immovable.  The problem is the fact that they are political appointments and that they are so permanent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with the proposed amendment.  Many people will vote for it and I am confident it will be passed overwhelmingly.  I cannot think of anybody who would vote against it, aside from our esteemed, politically appointed ladies and gentlemen on the Bench who, of course, are not defending inflated salaries and privilege but their integrity and independence.</P>
        <P>However, is all this example-setting by people at the top not something of a con?  To what level will judges&rsquo; pay be cut?  Will it be to the level of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s pay?  At approximately &euro;200,000 per year their salaries are six times the average industrial wage.  The cuts in salaries for Ministers, Deputies and top civil servants are pure tokenism.</P>
        <P>Cutting &euro;20,000 per year off the salary of the Taoiseach or a judge does not place them in hardship but a cut of a few euro per week is a huge problem for someone on social welfare.  A real example would be to introduce a cap of &euro;100,000 on all salaries and pensions paid by the State, including those of judges.  This would still be three times the average industrial wage and almost ten times the income of a family on welfare.  A tax of 70% on individual incomes above &euro;100,000 in the private sector should accompany this measure.  These would be real measures and people would see that this Government is tackling the issue.  This could make a start in reducing some income inequality in our society where the top 20% of income earners receive four times the income of the bottom 20%.  This must be addressed.  People are overwhelmed by the poverty in which they have found themselves in recent times.  People have lost their homes, etc.</P>
        <P>The Government seems intent on increasing inequality with the dismantling of protection for 260,000 workers covered by the JLCs and the attempt to delay for six months the implementation of the EU directive on equal pay and conditions for the 35,000 agency workers in our economy.  SNA teachers are being cut in schools where they are badly needed.  People have been asked to put their hands in their pockets but the Government should examine its conscience and reverse the decision in regard to SNAs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not oppose this straightforward proposal.  I am not against reducing judges&rsquo; pay but I am deeply unhappy with the way today&rsquo;s and tomorrow&rsquo;s proposals <Col N="59"/>to amend our Constitution have been brought forward.  One of the major flaws with our first Constitution was that the Houses of the Oireachtas could amend it at will and we ended up with a Constitution which was like a wedge of Swiss cheese.  Before I and many in this House were born, the citizens adopted this Constitution.  The parts of the Constitution which have stood the test of time are those based on broad principles.</P>
        <P>It is very important that we properly scrutinise measures which look benign.  The Joint Committee on the Constitution&rsquo;s fourth report deals with electoral reform.  It is much more difficult to remove things than it is to put them in.  That is why full scrutiny is required when we decide to tinker with the Constitution.</P>
        <P>I agree with some of the points made in regard to who would have challenged a Bill if it had been brought forward.  When the Minister proposed this change in 2009, he said it should be tagged to the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights, which I wanted advanced quickly.  I am disappointed we are not at that stage.</P>
        <P>We are trying to visualise what could happen at a time of political instability when one needs that separation of powers.  That is a good principle.  The pay aspect is dubious but the separation of powers is incredibly important and a cornerstone of our democracy.</P>
        <P>When I read this Bill, which is quite short, I was concerned by the section which stated that the remuneration of judges is subject to the imposition of tax, levies and other charges that are imposed by law on persons generally or persons belong to a particular class.  I do not know how to interpret that and I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments.  Can it be interpreted as people other than judges?  That is the only aspect about which I have concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on a Bill which I have supported since the Minister initially proposed it two years ago in Private Members&rsquo; time.  I congratulate him on the presentation of this Bill, which he has spent a considerable amount of time preparing.  It is vital for this Government to give people an opportunity to make an amendment to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  It would be satisfying to follow through on another mandate from the people to bring judges&rsquo; remuneration in line with other public servants.</P>
        <P>Many people are angry and see one rule for the Judiciary and another for everybody else.  Judicial independence is of vital importance and must be retained and protected.  The separation of powers requires an independent Judiciary and this referendum will not diminish judicial independence.</P>
        <P>The issue of judicial pay needs to be addressed.  Currently, judicial salaries remain in bubbles which have well and truly been burst.  Irish judges are among the highest paid in Europe and we are all well aware that this is simply unsustainable.  However, it is important to note that this legislation does not seek to target judicial salaries in an unfair manner, but rather bring those salaries in line with other public servants and that they accept the reductions as other public servants have.</P>
        <P>I am sure most people will see that this level of objectivity will reinforce the independence of the Judiciary.  I welcome the fact that the vast majority of the Judiciary does not oppose this referendum and most have made voluntary contributions to the Exchequer in recent years.  However, this issue cannot be allowed to remain an optional choice for the Judiciary when it is a compulsory requirement for the rest of the public service.  If this amendment is approved by the people, a saving of &euro;5.5 million per year can be achieved.</P>
        <P>It is generally accepted that public sector spending and public sector salaries went out of control under previous Administrations.  After studying Irish figures in an international context, <Col N="60"/>it is no surprise that we are still battling to bring public service expenditure under control given the problems we have inherited.  At this point, it is hard to justify Ireland&rsquo;s high ranking among our OECD counterparts when it comes to the judicial earnings.  In this area there is a stark difference between us and many of our neighbours in the EU.</P>
        <P>If this amendment is successful, it will not interfere with the impartiality or freedom from influence of those on the Bench.  When a nation has a politically independent Judiciary, what matters primarily for the citizen is accessibility of the courts.  However, this has been a problem in my constituency of Wexford and my town of Enniscorthy.  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s sentiments that public respect for the Judiciary must be maintained and that this would be more difficult if they were immune from the economic reality in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have supported the Minister&rsquo;s proposal in this area since he first introduced his Private Members&rsquo; Bill to the House two years ago.  I am aware from my role as Government Chief Whip that this is a carefully drafted Bill.  Although the polls show that the majority are in favour of this referendum, I have urged all my constituents to study the literature they will receive over the coming weeks on this referendum before exercising their democratic right.  With the public fully aware of the proposal, I am fully confident the referendum will carry the amendment.</P>
        <P>The issue of judicial salaries is not a new topic for discussion in this House.  In the fourth D&aacute;il, Deputy William Magennis said that it is an elementary fact of psychology that nothing gives much independence to the character of a man as the knowledge that so long as he discharges his duties efficiently, he has an adequate salary.  I do not think any member of the Judiciary could dispute that he or she will not receive an adequate salary if this amendment is endorsed by the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickODonovan"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which deals with an important amendment to the Constitution.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Shatter, on bringing it before the House.  It is regrettable that his proposal was not accepted by the previous Government because if it had been, this referendum could have been held on the same day as the last general election.  However, the previous Government decided to protect the bigwigs a bit longer, so we are debating the issue now.  There is no doubt that the public have been convulsed about this matter for a long time.  Speaking as a teacher, and thus a public servant, I know that many of my colleagues were appalled by the Judiciary&rsquo;s rates of pay.  The spectacle of the Judiciary acting in some sort of lobbying movement to try to get themselves protected, or avoid the need for a referendum through the appointment of an independent commission, did not go down well with the public.  The Minister and the Government are doing the right thing and the public will no doubt say so when the matter is put before them in a referendum.</P>
        <P>There was a suggestion in some quarters that this proposal could somehow be interpreted as an infringement of the separation of powers between the Oireachtas and the Judiciary.  Nothing could be further from the truth, however, because Article 35.2 of the Constitution allows for judicial independence.  In addition, the Executive does not have the right to interfere in the judicial process once judges are appointed.  However, we have an obligation to the taxpayers who elected us to ensure that, at a time when the public finances are in the current position, people are seen to carry the burden fairly.  At the moment that is not the case because some judges opted into a voluntary reduction while others, unfortunately, did not, which is regrettable.  Maybe these people do not read the papers or listen to the news, but unless they are totally oblivious to what is going on in the country, they should all have signed up to this reduction.  The fact is, however, that they did not.</P><Col N="61"/>
        <P>The reduction in judges&rsquo; pay will save &euro;5.5 million, but some people may be of the opinion that the Minister could dig even deeper.  We have judges who are among the best paid in Europe, if not the world.  We have very well paid judges sitting on the Bench, while legal practitioners in court are also operating on highly inflated salaries and costs, many of which are met by the taxpayer.  I implore the Minister to examine that matter also.  I know that his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has been examining this issue.</P>
        <P>People are annoyed and fed up with the costs incurred in using the Irish courts service, whether it concerns judges, barristers or solicitors.  Enough is enough.  It is regrettable that judges did not voluntarily enter into this scheme.  Reference was made to the fact that the current Government is bringing forward this referendum in conjunction with another one on the establishment of Oireachtas committees of investigation, but that is in the programme for Government and was campaigned for during the election.  I cannot understand how some Deputies bemoan the fact that we are bringing forward referenda on the same day at the presidential election.  Perhaps they are the same Deputies who gave out earlier because we did not use the presidential election as an opportunity to do this.  A referendum on children&rsquo;s rights has also been promised.  Constitutional reform was put at the top of the agenda when the programme for Government was signed up to.  I am glad to see that today, at the start of the new Government&rsquo;s first proper term, the Minister for Justice and Equality is delivering this Bill.  I hope the amendment will be passed by an overwhelming majority.  Nurses, teachers, road sweepers, garda&iacute; and everybody else have taken their fair share in this country.  It is regrettable that judges have had to be dragged into this matter, which should also apply to new entrants to the Bench, in addition to their pensions and entitlements.</P>
        <P>Last week, the country was convulsed over a severance package paid to a retiring civil servant.  It is a scandal that the Croke Park agreement would be used by anybody leaving the public service as a way to justify those sort of payments.  That issue also needs to be put on the table.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Bill and support its objective.  The majority of judges took a voluntary cut in line with what was requested, but our party is supporting the legislation.  The Bill&rsquo;s contents have been examined and dealt with by many other speakers.  The Bill before us should be seen in the context of what the new Government promised to do during the election campaign some seven months ago.  This Bill was promised as part of six separate referenda that Fine Gael said it would introduce as part of a super Constitution day.  That is what they called it back in February, but it is a bit like the 100,000 jobs that were promised, as well as the five point plan.  I have not heard the Minister, Deputy Shatter, or any of his colleagues refer to the super Constitution day since 25 February.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>The promised referenda included one to abolish the Seanad and another to reduce the President&rsquo;s term of office from seven to five years, which would have been appropriate to hold alongside the presidential election.  Another proposed referendum was to give the D&aacute;il powers to cut judges&rsquo; pay, which we are now discussing.  Yet another referendum was to give Oireachtas committees stronger powers of investigation, which is scheduled to take place on the same day as the presidential election.  In addition, a referendum was promised to put the Office of the Ombudsman on a constitutional footing.  Those six referenda were promised as part of the super Constitution day, but some of them have been forgotten.</P><Col N="62"/>
        
<P>On 27 October, the date for the presidential election, these two referenda will also be held.  Although welcome, they were supposed to be part of something very separate.  I ask the Minister to outline where the promised super Constitution day now stands.  The Government appears to have taken a different tack since taking office by deciding to hold two referenda, rather than six.  For example, we were supposed to have a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  As his party&rsquo;s spokesman on children in the previous D&aacute;il, the Minister knows that such a referendum is of the utmost importance.  In Opposition, he regularly extolled the necessity for an immediate date to be set for that referendum.  When Fine Gael announced its super Constitution day, Deputy Charles Flanagan, who took over from the Minister as the party&rsquo;s spokesperson on children, said that the children&rsquo;s rights referendum would take place on the same day as the presidential election.  Just six months ago, Deputy Charles Flanagan, rightly, said:</P>
        <P LI="1">every day that goes by without a referendum acknowledging the voice of children in the Constitution is a poor day for children, leaving them in a position of great vulnerability and hardship.  So this will be a priority.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That was another promise that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, reneged upon in line with many of the other things he has done.</P>

        <P>One of the arguments used by the Minister to vote it down was that accompanying legislation would be needed.  The motion that I brought forward was the first referendum proposal made to this D&aacute;il but the Minister claimed there would be no space for it on the same day as the presidential election because three referendums were already being planned.  Now, however, we learn there will be only two referendums.  Therefore, while I welcome the proposed referendum, I ask him to outline to the House where he stands on the promises he made previously.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="63"/>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>My party welcomes this proposal and we intend to support it while recognising the importance to democracy of an independent Judiciary.  A judge&rsquo;s role is onerous and without parallel in society.  He or she must, to some extent, live at a remove from the rest of society.  I was disappointed by some of the political posturing in evidence on the Government benches.  The comments about big wigs and the other derogatory terms used are ill-becoming of Members of the Oireachtas, regardless of their parties.  This is a constitutional issue which needs to be resolved in a manner which is open and does not undermine the important role that judges play.</P>
        <P>Many judges have already made voluntary contributions in recognition of our current economic circumstances.  Reference has been made to savings of &euro;5.5 million and perhaps the Minister can indicate whether this figure is additional to the voluntary contributions that have already been made or if it includes them.</P>
        <P>Some elements of the Government&rsquo;s spin machine have sought to portray this referendum as a ground-breaking initiative to show the people that tough decisions are being taken.  However, while these claims are more about political posturing than anything else, it is right that judges be treated as equitably as other sectors of society.  I am somewhat disappointed but we must take the Constitution as it stands.  Given that judges&rsquo; pay increased in line with other public servants, it is ludicrous that it cannot be reduced accordingly without undermining the Judiciary.  I am not a lawyer but my layman&rsquo;s reading of the Constitution leads me to understand that it would become problematic if a Government sought to interfere with the pay of an individual judge or a group of judges.</P>
        <P>I was taken aback by Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s comments in regard to what he described as a convulsion over the severance package for a senior civil servant who retired last week.  I remind the Deputy that he is now a Member of the Oireachtas, which makes him party to the decision making process.  He is no longer in a position to make county councillor outbursts that have no effect.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>He referred to an individual who is familiar to us through the media.  It is open to the Government to address the matter collectively by introducing appropriate legislation that would, if necessary, deal with the issue retrospectively.  It is bringing forward a constitutional referendum in respect of the judges and if it is concerned that retrospective legislation would not stand up to the Constitution, it should bring forward an amendment.  I ask for less posturing and fewer outrageous attacks on individuals.  We should deal with the issue in an open and collective manner rather than make scapegoats of individuals who worked hard for this State.  This is not to suggest that I agree with the pay levels but we should not <Col N="64"/>make scapegoats for political purposes.  We owe it to the public servants who work on our behalf not to denigrate them and for this reason I was very disappointed about the aforementioned intervention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  As I drove up to Dublin this morning, I listened to the concerns expressed on the radio that the legislation was being rushed.  However, one of the finest compliments that can be paid to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, is to note the urgency with which he has approached his responsibilities thus far.  Even though we are only six months into this D&aacute;il, we are already contemplating two Bills which will allow referendums to take place on 26 October.  Judging from the earlier comments by Deputies O&rsquo;Brien and Calleary, I expected their respective parties would offer their full support for this Bill but subsequent Fianna F&aacute;il speakers lead me to doubt they can agree on whether they consider the referendum to be worthwhile or if they believe Fine Gael is posturing on it.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
        <P>Anybody who canvassed the people during the last general election campaign would concur that they want us to address the issue of the pay of judges and senior public servants.  I agree, however, that we have been well-served by our Judiciary.  Rather than focus on the small percentage of judges who did not volunteer reductions, we should acknowledge that some 90% of them did so.  The referendum respects the spirit of a judgment in the Supreme Court several years ago regarding discrimination against the Judiciary on tax matters.  As long as individual judges are not singled out in any way, it is fair for a Government to include them with the rest of the public service when deciding on pensions and payments.</P>
        <P>The amounts involved are not insignificant.  Deputy Dooley asked about the figure of &euro;5.5 million, which I understand does not include voluntary savings but the Minister may clarify the matter in his concluding statement.</P>
        <P>Today being international democracy day, it is appropriate to respond to the suggestion that the referendum, if passed, would undermine the separation of powers in this State.  I would argue the contrary because we are putting the decision before the people.  It is the ultimate demonstration of the separation of power and of the process of democracy that it is the people who will vote to make the decision on this matter, according to which the Government and the D&aacute;il will subsequently legislate on their behalf.</P>
        <P>In an environment where we all share a responsibility, in so far as possible, to reduce costs to the public purse, there is undoubtedly a significant cost involved in holding presidential and other elections and referenda.  As such, it makes economic and practical sense that, where appropriate, we put several issues to the electorate at once.  People give of their valuable time to vote and there is a cost to the Exchequer in setting up elections.  It makes sense that several proposals be dealt with together where it is possible and appropriate to do so.  Members opposite have pointed out that the programme for Government commits us to bringing forward referenda on issues other than those which will be put before the people next month.  I am satisfied, from where I am standing within the parliamentary party, that, unlike under the previous Government, we will see these issues, including the question of children&rsquo;s rights, being put before the people by way of referendum.  I look forward to that.  I call on everybody to support this important referendum when it comes before them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for bringing this Bill before the House.  I also welcome the commitment by the Deputies opposite to join the Government in supporting this referendum.  Their U-turn is to be commended and I congratulate them on their belated conversion to political correctness.  I hope they will campaign with vigour and <Col N="65"/>enthusiasm in bringing the message to their constituents that all citizens, as taxpayers, must be treated fairly and equally.  The Minister has held that viewpoint for two years, but it has taken Members opposite the same time to reach that level of thinking.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that this Bill must be brought before the House today.  Members of the Judiciary, as leaders in society, should have shown leadership on this issue without the requirement for constitutional change.  Some of them have done so.  I single out the new Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, in this regard in respect of her decision not to take the incremental pay rise for which she was eligible on her appointment.  In forgoing that payment she showed leadership.  The Minister too has shown leadership on this issue, as have members of the public service in taking voluntary pay reductions.  Everybody must be treated with respect and fairness.  In this time of economic crisis, nobody must be immune from the decisions of Government.</P>
        <P>The proposal before us is aimed at achieving equality between all taxpayers and ensuring no sector is sheltered from economic pain.  Those who hold high office and who are paid extremely well for so doing &mdash; I include Oireachtas Members in this &mdash; are expected to recognise their own privileged positions and to accept their civic duties.  This is particularly so in the case of the Judiciary.  It is important and proper that judicial independence is maintained and that Article 35.5 of the Constitution is protected.  However, it is also important that the people be given the opportunity to decide whether judicial pay should be amended in line with that of other public sector employees.  It is incumbent on those in high office and on us as Members of this House to show leadership and to bring the people with us.</P>
        <P>Nobody on this side of the House is seeking to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary; that is not what the referendum is about.  Rather, it is about fairness and equality and ensuring that everybody plays their part in our country&rsquo;s economic recovery.  Judges are expected to be above reproach and are required to interpret laws, pass judgment, impose punishment and exhibit compassion in so doing.  While we rightly demand high standards of them, we also require members of the Judiciary to be an integral part of our society, cognisant of the tribulations and difficulties endured by families on a daily basis.  We are fortunate to have an excellent Judiciary.  Its members do a tremendous job in administering justice in a fair and balanced manner.</P>
        <P>Now we are asking them to play their part in restoring the national economy.  Fortunately, 85% of judges have recognised the problems posed by the constitutional anomaly and have assisted in restoring the country&rsquo;s finances by voluntarily accepting the imposition of levies and changes.  Those 121 judges exemplify the civic awareness which society expects of its Judiciary.  If this referendum is passed, there will be a further sharing of the burden on society.</P>
        <P>In contrast to what Deputy Charlie McConalogue has claimed, the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, has shown tremendous stewardship of his Department.  He has been a proactive Minister and his record in his first six months in office is there to be examined.  I challenge the Deputy to examine that record and will debate it with him in any forum.  This referendum deserves to be passed.  It is not a referendum on judicial independence; it is about ensuring equality for all citizens and taxpayers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which paves the way for the future implementation of pay cuts for an exclusive elite.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill.  It is ironic, however, that if judges had taken the opportunity to embrace not only the letter of their own voluntary levy scheme, but also its spirit, we might never have reached this point.  That episode brought shame on them and their profession and in itself tells a story.</P>
        <P>While the average industrial wage in this State is some &euro;35,000, judges can expect to earn multiples of that, anywhere between &euro;147,000 and &euro;295,000.  At the same time, more than <Col N="66"/>440,000 people are signing on the dole and many more do not even qualify for that benefit.  Untold hardship is being visited upon ordinary people throughout the country as a result of cuts, cuts and more cuts, with no end in sight.  Through all of this recent hardship judges remained, and in many respects, regardless of the outworkings of this legislation and the referendum in October, will remain, sheltered and protected from such realities.  So too will their colleagues in the upper echelons of the civil and public service.  Through this saga and other events in recent weeks, we have had a very public display of the privileged and protected realms in which some people continue to live in this State.</P>
        <P>The reality for the vast majority of people in Ireland today is one of getting by.  The programme of austerity scripted by the EU and IMF and implemented diligently, initially by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party and subsequently by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, has resulted in devastating changes for ordinary people.  People are asking themselves whether they can afford their mortgage repayment from month to month, their children&rsquo;s ever-increasing back to school fees or, even worse, food, heat and electricity for themselves and their families.  Many workers wonder whether they will still have a job next week or next month.  This is a frighteningly common reality for many vulnerable people.  Meanwhile, members of the well-heeled, well-connected and well-protected sectors of Irish society remain immune and face no such difficulties.  They certainly do not have to worry about providing the basics for themselves and their families, including food, housing, health and education.  They might have to worry &mdash; if that is the correct word &mdash; about the cost of running three houses and two cars or paying private education fees.</P>
        <P>In this economic climate, such privileges arise, at least to some degree, at the expense of everyone else.  This sheltered elite remains as such because consecutive Governments, including the current one, have failed to confront it.  The obscene figures which have emerged over recent weeks are further evidence of the continuing practice of excessive pay and privileges, including severance and pension provisions, for senior members of the civil and public service.  This must be tackled head on.  The Government cannot continue to hide behind the excuse of contracts or precedent.</P>
        <P>The hundreds of thousands of people on the live register, as well as all of those who have suffered cuts to welfare, pensions and take-home pay, together with the hundreds of thousands who have been forced to emigrate must have thought they were hearing things last week when it was revealed that the recently retired Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach, Mr. Dermot McCarthy, received an incredible &euro;713,000 pension pay-off on top of his annual pension of &euro;142,000.  This is the same Secretary General who was a member of the Top Level Appointments Committee that appointed senior civil servants on behalf of the State and, according to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, agreed their remuneration packages, again on behalf of the Government.  Consecutive Governments obviously believed they were worth it.  They facilitated such behaviour by endorsing, signing off on, rubber-stamping and giving legal effect to it.  What one permits, one promotes.</P>
        <P>As part of his pension pay off, Mr. McCarthy received a special severance gratuity payment of &euro;142,670.  The Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963 states that the Minister, if in his discretion he so thinks proper, can grant such a payment to a civil servant.  This payment, which is clearly defined in section 7 of the Superannuation and Pension Act 1963 as being a special severance gratuity, could only have been made to Mr. McCarthy on the instruction of the Ministers for Finance or Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, might have considered how many special needs assistants might be employed for that money.</P>
        <P>There have been reports in the media that Mr. McCarthy is being considered as the next ambassador to the Vatican.  If this appointment comes to pass, it will be an even greater slap <Col N="67"/>in the face to struggling families and the unemployed.  The mere suggestion that any Government Minister would deem it appropriate to give such a high paid job to a retired civil servant in receipt of a &euro;713,000 lump sum pension pay-off is completely inappropriate and reeks of the worst kind of cronyism.  Recent media coverage gave even further insight into the culture of self-congratulation at the upper levels of the public and Civil Service with the disclosure that 21 senior civil servants who retired during the past four years received lump sums of between &euro;444,000 and &euro;570,000.</P>
        <P>A further 94 retired officials have received lump sums of &euro;225,000.  The retired officials also receive annual pensions of between &euro;75,000 and &euro;142,000, at a total cost to the taxpayer of almost &euro;10 million every year.  These are inordinate figures.</P>
        <P>In a similar vein, Irish hospital consultants earn a basic &euro;250,000 per annum for a nominal 33-hour-week.  While this may be Mickey Mouse money to some, it is not so to those of us living in the real world.  It has been reported that some consultants spend 40% of their working time on private practice, some of which is being reimbursed by the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This is another example of gross excess and a failure to challenge an already privileged group.  Given the extreme difficulties Government cutbacks are having on ordinary people, it is extraordinary that such practices continue unabated.</P>
        <P>The Government has promised legislation to deal with excessive senior public sector pensions and to end the practice of added years, but these changes look likely to apply only to new entrants.  This is unacceptable.  Methods must be found to tackle the excessively high pension arrangements for existing public and Civil Service top dogs.  Increasing the tax rate applied to the balance of lump sum pay-offs is just one option.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has called and continues to call for the capping of all public sector pay at &euro;100,000.  Similarly, pension pots should be reduced for senior public servants.  I welcome this Bill in its attempt to reduce the pay of judges in line with others in the public service.  I would like to see others in the public service challenged in a similar vein.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonnMaloney"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamonn Maloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McLellan for sharing time with me.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House.  I support the Bill and acknowledge its necessity.  Like other Deputies, including Members of the Opposition, I will be working to ensure a positive outcome for this legislation in the forthcoming referendum.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that this Parliament must, given the current climate, bring legislation before the House to deal with a small group of people who, since 1937, have held a privileged position, as provided for in the 1937 Constitution.  I am neither a great enthusiast nor supporter of that Constitution which appears not only to have given special positions to one church, but special protection to judges&rsquo; pay.  I expect that, following referendum day, this will end.  I have no axe to grind with judges; I am sure there are very good judges.  I do not know any judges; none live in my estate.  While I am sure they do good work, they are not beyond the responsibilities of civic society.  We are in a bad place, as outlined by other speakers, including Deputy McLellan.  People are experiencing hardship.  Judges are well paid and can afford to take the small wage cut being sought by Government.  Judges have been in an extremely privileged position as a result of the Constitution passed in 1937, which was only voted on by approximately 30% of the population.  Perhaps the majority of the people knew better.  Only a small number of people turned out for it.  I support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Members who supported the legislation, in particular my Fine Gael and Labour colleagues.  I welcome that there is agreement on all sides of the House that this change is necessary.</P><Col N="68"/>
        <P>I will try to explain some matters.  Deputies will forgive me if, given the time available, I do not respond to all questions raised.  It is important to be clear on where matters currently stand.  We know that a significant number of the Judiciary have volunteered to pay the pension levy.  I am not aware of any member of the Judiciary who has volunteered to opt into the salary reduction which has affected everyone else across the public service.  The major portion of the moneys that will be saved in the &euro;5.5 million will derive from the fact that if this referendum is successful, we will be applying to the Judiciary the same salary reductions as apply across the public service to others.</P>
        <P>The draft Bill to which Deputy Calleary referred sets out the percentage reductions, replicating exactly the provisions of the 2009 Acts, which will be applied to serving judges.  The draft Bill to which I am referring is the implementation Bill which we also published some weeks ago.  For the convenience of the House, I included in my script the table setting out the effects of the reductions on judges&rsquo; pay.  It is clear, if the referendum is successful, exactly where matters may stand with regard to judges&rsquo; pay.  That is the reason there is no need to appoint a committee to look at or consider the issue.  One or two speakers suggested that a committee should consider how much judges should be paid.  That then is doing what we should not be doing, namely, we should not be singling out judges for different treatment to others in the context of effecting salary reductions.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the need to continue to protect judicial independence and so I constantly reiterate that what this legislation is about is applying in a fair way to members of the Judiciary the same pension levy and salary reductions as have been already applied across the public service to others on similar pay scales.  That is the crucial issue in terms of what we are doing.  I agree with Deputy Buttimer that it was noteworthy that having been an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court for some time, Chief Justice Denham did not, when appointed to that position, accept the authorised level of pay of a Chief Justice, which is &euro;295,916, but continued to work for the salary she received as an ordinary member of the Supreme Court.  The changes to be effected, which are detailed in the script that was distributed, are proportionate changes that will apply to different members of the Judiciary.</P>
        <P>I shall deal quickly with some of the questions asked.  Why is the wording of this Bill different from that of the Bill I published on behalf of the Fine Gael Party in 2009?  There is a very simple answer to that.  One can achieve the same result in a variety of different ways.  There is no unique form of wording.  The form of wording before the House is the form of wording recommended by the Attorneys General and the Parliamentary Draftsman.  Any good lawyer could address this particular issue in a variety of different forms of wording.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to some Members, the Independent Members in particular, who seem to think that it was not necessary to have a referendum, that we should just enact the legislation.  That is poppycock.  There is an express provision in the Constitution in regard to not reducing the remuneration of sitting judges.  This House cannot simply enact legislation that is blatantly unconstitutional.  There is a constitutional obligation on this House to ensure, as best we can, the legislation we enact is constitutional.</P>
        <P>The only way to achieve the desired objective here is by way of holding a referendum.  We are not entitled in this House to remove from the people their entitlement to decide what should be contained in the Constitution.  That is not an option.  Also it would be to treat the people who vote in referendums as being irrelevant.  We must give due respect to those who make decisions about our Constitution.  We cannot simply drive a horse and cart through it.</P>

	<P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children recommended when that referendum takes place, that because it brings about a fundamental change in the adoption area, we should, as we have done in this case, publish an implementation Bill so people are clear how it will work.  Unfortunately, in the short time we have had in Government and in the context of the major issues we have had to address with great speed, it was not possible to finalise the wording for that referendum and publish an adoption Bill.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes that recent proposals being discussed on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform will have a detrimental impact on Ireland&rsquo;s agricultural sector and that the suggested introduction of a Single Farm Payment will cost thousands of jobs and decimate agricultural production by up to 30%; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />calls on the Government to immediately publish its proposals and position in relation to these matters.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion which is one of the most important issues facing the agricultural sector and the entire economy.  As has been noted right across the spectrum of the agricultural industry the targets are set out in the visionary document Food Harvest 2020.  During the quiet month of August documentation was leaked from the EU to ascertain the response.</P>
        <P>Before going into the detail of that documentation we must look at what the Common Agricultural Policy has achieved for agriculture and the primary producers in Ireland since 1973 and for Europe.  It has been the backbone of the EU and certainly the backbone of the Irish agricultural industry.  It is hugely important in any negotiations that take place in regard <Col N="70"/>to the Common Agricultural Policy that we put them high on the agenda.  We put them extremely high on the Government&rsquo;s agenda and on the agenda of this House because the whole essence of the Common Agricultural Policy is to ensure food security.</P>
        <P>During the past 25 years, following our accession to the Common Market and subsequent decisions, food mountains and so on, we have witnessed the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy to maintain a vibrant agricultural industry and food security.  It is clear that if we do not have a comprehensive Common Agricultural Policy we will not have food security or top quality produce on the supermarket shelves throughout the EU.  Last year food exports increased by 11% to more &euro;8 billion.  The Government&rsquo;s target is to grow that figure under Food Harvest 2020 by &euro;20 billion by 2020.</P>
        <P>The various discussions that have taken place at European and Irish levels have benefited the export industry.  However, post-2013, it appears the Minister will be chairing the talks on the conclusion of the Common Agricultural Policy and the decisions that will be taken.  There is a need to ensure that the less well-off regions as well as the better regions of Ireland are properly safeguarded.  We have had a system of historical payments, based on the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002, which by and large have served us well and brought a large amount of direct transfer payments from the EU into Ireland and the agricultural sector.  To an extent, this has allowed for certain planning at farm gate level in respect of decisions for the period.</P>
        <P>Post 2013 and 2014, we have witnessed a tightening of the agricultural budget although the figure is more or less the same.  We need to look at all aspects of what can be achieved in the food industry.  Through better regulation we now produce some of the best quality food in the world.  Farmers, the primary producers, have worked through a huge burden of bureaucracy.  Comments from the agricultural sector on the bailout make it clear that we have complied with strict EU and Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food rules in recent years.  It has paid off given that we have high quality produce that we can sell anywhere in the world.</P>
        <P>In recent addresses the Minister has made it clear that the Dairy Board and all in the industry are gearing up for the emerging markets outside the EU, markets considered to be buoyant and those that are moving forward.  While we must ensure we have a Common Agricultural Policy that rewards farmers, the primary producers, who are willing to produce a product that can be exported, agriculture is an export-led section of the economy which greatly enhances our national economy.</P>
        <P>It is clear there are fears at farm gate level arising from the EU leaked documents.  There is also a suggestion that the leaked documents will form part of the legislative proposals due later in the year.  What I seek through this motion, and I thank my colleagues for allowing me to table it so early in the term, is to show how serious we are about agriculture.  We would like to see the Department, the Minister and the Government&rsquo;s discussions built up and maintained.  Prior to decoupling, there was a great deal of activity at farm gate level to find a way to gain an advantage from what was being introduced.  Since August, people have been discussing leasing and so forth to try to ensure they can take advantage of the proposals when they come.  This will cause confusion and uncertainty.  Instead, we should ensure that the volume of direct transfer payments to Ireland in recent years be maintained, as doing so would be vital for our food and agriculture industries.</P>
        <P>I will revert to the importance of CAP, but it would be remiss of me not to mention one of the most serious issues facing agriculture at the farm gate level, one that ties into decisions made at EU level, namely, the milk quota.  A serious situation is affecting many dairy producers.  While I am trying to refrain from making outlandish claims, it is troubling that two Teagasc publications, one in the last week of August and another in the first week of September, advised <Col N="71"/>farmers how to stay within quota despite the fact there were still four, five or six months of milk production remaining.  Making sense of this is difficult.  In respect of many issues, we are tied by the EU-IMF agreement and required to become more competitive, seek export-led growth and so forth.  Given the developments of the past ten to 15 years, it is important that we apply common sense.  The majority of the milk produced is used in various products that are being exported outside the EU.  We should give this matter serious consideration, given how the situation affects dairy farmers in particular.</P>
        <P>Various documentation from official bodies and elsewhere has advised people to engage in cow leasing arrangements with farmers in the North who are working under the UK&rsquo;s regime and, as such, are 20% under quota.  This makes no sense, particularly given how we have grown closer politically since the Good Friday Agreement.  We share a land border with the UK, which is 20% under quota.  Farmers are drying off pedigree stock and making decisions at farm gate level that will have a detrimental effect in terms of, for example, putting back calving times and so forth.  According to best practice, what the training bodies are advising is a bad move.  Farmers are making decisions to try to live within their quotas until 2015.  In 2009 and early 2010, the national quota had not been reached in some time.  The assumption was that it would not be reached.</P>
        <P>This is a serious issue.  Next week, there will be meetings in Brussels.  Will the Minister prioritise this issue and seek a derogation?  Europe is under quota and Ireland, a small island off its coast, is significantly over quota.  Farmers are producing something that is exported outside the EU and is needed in the global market.  It would help to increase our balance of payments.  This makes economic sense in every way.  The House and every part of the agricultural sector need to consider and address this matter in a commonsensical manner.  The current situation is farcical.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, many dairy farmers who invested significant amounts have contacted me.  They had been informed by their milk processors, co-ops and so on that they would not receive milk cheques between now and May 2012.  These farmers have commitments to their banks, staff, contractors and suppliers and are drying off cows.  Glanbia, people in better farmland and so on are drying cows off in the middle of July.  This makes no sense.  Will the Minister take this serious issue on board?  No more than the Mulder quota, were it challenged under the Single European Act or other treaties, it would not stand.  Producing milk would help us in our economic plight.  We should explore the matter collectively.</P>

	<P>We are doing that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will set this matter to one side.  I feel strongly about it and I hope the Minister will reply to the points I have raised.  The quota is vital.</P>
        <P>During the summer, Deputies were contacted by people asking whether there was a way of putting excess milk quota into a product.  For example, since farmers were not going to get paid for it, could it be used in relief products?  This matter relates to the quota&rsquo;s essence, namely, interference in markets.  We were asked whether products could be exported to Somalia and so forth.  As the Minister knows only too well, though, the EU tied this idea down in knots.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The previous Government signed up to the milk health check, which we are operating under.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  However, there are serious issues with the check.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, we are working on them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="72"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to work on them.  If the constant reply is to be &ldquo;The previous Government signed up to it&rdquo;, why have an election?  The issues are on the Government&rsquo;s desk.  This is a desperate plight for dairy farmers.  Regarding CAP, the expert advice is to gear up for post-2015 milk quotas.  Our competitors abroad have the capacity to gear up because they are starting from low bases and their farmers will be in a better position to take the benefits post-2015, yet we are being held back.  As the Minister knows, the best dairy farmers in Ireland are being held back.  They are making decisions at farm gate level that are not acceptable and are not good practice, but they must make them to avoid a super levy.</P>
        <P>The essence of the motion is the importance of CAP to every part of the farming sector.  We must ensure that the direct payments agreed under the last health check will continue.  Among the farming community, there is a concern regarding the documents leaked in August, a slow time in Brussels, namely, that the EU might be trying to pull back on something.  Following the introduction of legislative proposals in the next month or six weeks, the period of discussion up to and including 2012 and the final decision being taken in early 2013, it will behove us all, in particular the Minister, to be able to say that the best deal for Irish agriculture was attained.  We must ensure that the primary producer gets the best out of the deal.  The statistics that are always used against CAP and farmers are to the effect that individuals are getting &euro;500,000 and that the greatest benefactors are wealthy aristocrats in Europe.  We must ensure that the money is given to the producer at the farm gate.</P>
        <P>The agriculture team on this side of the Houses &mdash; Deputies Browne and Kirk, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and I &mdash; visited Brussels in June and will have further discussions on the issues concerning CAP and the milk quota as we see them.  When the negotiations conclude, a cap should be placed to ensure some people do not benefit significantly.  The figure constantly trotted out is that 20% of farmers are receiving 80% of the payments.  This is no longer acceptable and we must examine it.  We have a year and a half before the negotiations will be signed off.  We must start now and ensure these are the issues that are brought to the fore.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House.  I ask the Minister to take our views on the CAP very seriously.  I ask him earnestly to ensure that, at the meetings next Tuesday, the issue of milk quotas and the plight of the best milk producers in the country will be addressed adequately and that common sense will apply.  We have seen regulations coming from the European Union from time to time in respect of which the common sense was not the best.  We have a product that is needed and saleable in the European Union and the world market.  We now need to address the issues I have raised in a very serious and compelling way.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion tabled by Deputy Michael Moynihan.  It affords me an opportunity to say a few words on the CAP and the various areas of agriculture.  Over the past year, farm incomes have increased reasonably.  Farmers had a few bad years but they generally recognise that, over the past year, incomes have increased and that they are now in a better position than they were.  Prices for various products have improved.  As the Minister will be aware, many young farmers now want to stay on the land, perhaps because of the changes in the economic climate and building industry.  This is a welcome boost for farming and the production of food generally.  Over recent years, particularly this one, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of young farmers who want a qualification in agriculture.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the support of the Minister for those in Wexford in ensuring a programme is up and running through Teagasc.  Perhaps it is not the type of programme we envisaged at the start &mdash; it was intended that it would be run in a vocational school &mdash; but at least a course is now available following the intervention of the Minister and discussions with Teagasc.  I thank the Minister for his intervention.  I hope such courses will expand and that vocational colleges, <Col N="73"/>other second level schools and third level schools, rather than just Teagasc colleges, will be able to run them.  It is important that the system be opened up.  I certainly welcome the course for Wexford.</P>
        <P>Irish farmers are renowned internationally as food producers.  They have constantly adapted to the changing demands of consumers.  As a green island, Ireland produces food in a very environmentally friendly way and this ensures the existence of tremendous opportunities for farmers to sell their internationally renowned food products in Europe and farther afield.  Having listened to the Minister a number of times on radio and television, I note he is very committed to implementing the measures under Harvest 2020.  I hope this will ensure the existence of other opportunities for farmers.</P>
        <P>Coming from Wexford and being familiar with Cork, from which the Minister comes and which has been regarded as the home of agriculture and one of the main food-producing counties, it is important to recognise the role farmers are playing not only in conventional farming but also in other types of farming.  In my neck of the woods, there is strawberry-growing and cheesemaking.  Many alternative products are being produced by farmers and this is the way to go for the future.  I hope the Minister will encourage such developments.  Strawberry-growing, for example, now extends from April until October or November.  There are fewer producers but a longer season.  I was at a function last week at which it was stated that Tesco is now, for the first time in many years, purchasing Wexford strawberries.  It had not been buying them for a number of years.  The change in this regard is welcome.</P>
        <P>On CAP reform, Deputy Moynihan and I visited Brussels before the summer and met some senior officials there.  They were rather secretive in many ways about what was to be included in the proposals for the CAP.  However, we received the leaked CAP proposals for the period after 2013.  They have caused some concern among farm organisations, the IFA in particular.  In recent weeks, the latter has been in touch with all politicians expressing its concerns over the content of the leaked document.  Perhaps the Minister will clear up today some of the concerns of farmers over the leaked document.  I wonder whether the Commissioner leaked the document on purpose to obtain a reaction from EU member states and the Ministers.  The Irish Minister will be in Brussels next week and I am sure he will be teasing out some of the issues about which farmers are concerned.</P>
        <P>From discussions with officials, I noted they certainly implied there would be some minimal changes and perhaps some dramatic ones also.  They referred to &ldquo;greening&rdquo;.  Farmers must engage in a certain amount of greening but if one accounted for the manner in which Irish farmers produce their produce, mainly through a grass-based system in an environmentally friendly way, one would not be so sure that a major budgetary allocation for greening would be of any advantage to them.  The farm organisations have raised the apparent major emphasis on greening with me and I am sure they have done so with other Members.</P>
        <P>The leaked document refers to the single farm payment, the rural development programme and the emergency market support measures.  The finalised proposals, which will require EU Commission approval, will be published in October 2011.  Key elements of the leaked documents include the change to the single farm payment.  The national envelope will be divided into a number of elements, which may include a basic payment, compulsory greening, with an associated figure of 30%, a voluntary payment, voluntary coupled payments for vulnerable sectors, a payment for young farmers, amounting to 2%, and a national reserve figure of 3%.  Perhaps the Minister will talk us through this in his reply and outline what other areas he has discussed with his EU counterparts in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>The timeline refers to the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.  The one benefit of this is that our Minister will be at the table throughout all the discussions.  He will probably be very much <Col N="74"/>to the forefront when we hold the Presidency.  I am sure he will ensure Irish farmers are well protected.  I appreciate there is and will be a difficulty with the finances.  There are not only financial difficulties in Ireland but also throughout the European Union.  Therefore, the Minister will not receive everything he is looking for but I am sure he will be fighting to ensure Irish farmers will be well protected on foot of any changes that occur on the implementation of CAP proposals.</P>
        <P>We have been listening to debates on changes to the CAP since the MacSharry proposals.  I suppose the next deal we will be talking about will be that of the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  Farmers will be able to look back on his proposals in years to come, as they do on the MacSharry proposals, and say he did a good job for Ireland.</P>
        <P>We have heard various farm organisations saying in recent weeks that the way to surmount some of Ireland&rsquo;s present difficulties is through the agriculture sector.  Coming from an agricultural county, I believe there is a tremendous opportunity for the sector to expand, develop and enter other areas of production.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Deputy Moynihan touched on milk production.  I know the Minister&rsquo;s hands are tied on this issue but because of the situation in 2009 and 2010 when there was not an overproduction of milk, farmers in Wexford and, I am sure, in other counties continued to produce milk this year.  Now, they find they are over quota and this is causing severe problems.  I have met small farmers who continue to produce milk for Wexford Creamery but who will not have cheque payments for the coming months.  It is ridiculous that Europe and the United Kingdom are under quota but Ireland is over quota.  I do not know how the Minister will work a miracle on this to have the quota considered a European one rather than an Irish one.</P>
        <P>These farmers need help and support.  They did not receive much help or support from Teagasc or the milk companies in recent months.  Now, they are being warned that they must pull back, cull or milk once a day.  They should have been receiving advice on this issue as far back as last Christmas but they were not well advised at that time.  I appeal to the Minister to do what he can at EU level to ensure such farmers are not penalised to the extent they will be.  Not alone will they be penalised by not being able to produce milk for the rest of the year but they will not have any income and they will find it very difficult to support their families.  This is a major issue.  It has landed on the Minister&rsquo;s desk and I have every faith that he will do his best.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This week, I read an article in the Teagasc magazine, <i>Today&rsquo;s Farm</i>, with the headline, &ldquo;Quota Alert&rdquo;.  What is suggested in the article would not be helpful to farmers.  Teagasc should have been more proactive in helping and supporting farmers and in making them aware of the difficulties that may be coming down the line.  In 2009 and 2010 this problem did not exist and farmers did not expect to have it in 2011.  Unfortunately, it is with us.  I support the motion tabled by Deputy Moynihan and I have every faith that the Minister will be at the coal face in the coming years ensuring Irish farmers and farm products will be well protected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I thank our spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Moynihan, for tabling the motion.  Those not involved in the agricultural sector might be confused, and because agriculture seems to be doing well at present and farmers have had a relatively good year they might suggest it is unusual for us to discuss it in the House.  In the past, many of the discussions in the House took place after the horse had bolted, and it is appropriate that we take a long-term view on this issue, recognising the significant and serious pitfalls that lie ahead for the sector, and address it in an open and frank way.  We should try to do so in as non-partisan a way as possible with agreement in the <Col N="75"/>House, when we do not have thousands of farmers protesting outside the gate with an imminent crisis on our doorstep.  Therefore, I welcome the approach taken.</P>
        <P>Agriculture is and always has been a major plank of our economy with regard to output, employment and exports.  It has faced many challenges over the years and the stakeholders have shown great resolve, innovation and capacity to change and to remain relevant, competitive and sustainable.  This includes farmers, processors and all those involved in the agricultural sector.  It is also important to recognise the tremendous work done by farm representative bodies.  They have been to the forefront in raising local, national and international issues.  They have shown a great capacity to understand the workings of the Commission and the important role Europe place in the sector.  They have identified some of the major challenges and sought to resolve them domestically and internationally.</P>
        <P>The president of the IFA, Mr. John Bryan, led an exceptionally important campaign to level the playing pitch for Irish beef against South American imports.  It was one of the highlights of the organisation&rsquo;s work.  I do not want to single out any one organisation; others have been very strong advocates on behalf of the farming community at times when it did not seem popular or relevant to some.  It is their work, together with the stakeholders, that has brought agriculture back to the fore.  For some years, agriculture has been put to one side and recognition was not given to its employment capacity and the major stake it has played in our economy.</P>
        <P>I will now turn to the issue at hand and the concerns raised about the proposed changes to the CAP, in particular the position taken by the Commission on the greening effect.  Farmers have modernised their business and are compliant in many ways.  It seems ludicrous that payments will be connected with a new requirement or necessity to get involved in a further greening process.  To some extent, we need to call a halt to this over-regulation.  The farming sector is over-regulated and is well-policed across the board.  Previously, we dealt with the matter of who would ultimately manage the nitrates directive and whether it would be the Department with responsibility for the environment or local authorities.  If we return to this type of process it will take away from the capacity of the farming sector to play an exceptionally important role in the regeneration of our economy.  If unnecessary boundaries or false ceilings are put in place merely for the sake of greater regulation, it will spancel the capacity of a productive sector in our economy to flourish and thrive and meet the needs of our society.</P>
        <P>We speak daily about the need to create jobs and the farming sector can do this.  The Food Harvest 2020 programme sets out an agenda for a thriving indigenous sector.  We spend much time speaking about foreign direct investment, which is a hugely important part of our economy.  If Intel or Microsoft suggested to us that we need to examine or be careful about regulation we would take it seriously.  The farming sector has a far greater impact on our economy than any of the multinationals and we must take very seriously its concerns with regard to our negotiating position on this subject.  I appeal to the Minister, and I have every confidence in him and his team, to find a workable solution which allows the sector to play an important role in the regeneration of our economy.</P>
        <P>Deputies Moynihan and Browne have already spoken about the significant and serious issue with regard to the quota regime.  While quotas will no longer exist from next year, it seems ludicrous that while other areas are 10% below quota we are over quota and will be penalised.  Farmers will be drying off cows, selling pedigree herds and reducing their capacity and output at a time when the country needs it for our balance of payments, as it will not be subsumed into our economy but will predominantly affect exports and value-added jobs in processing.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to use whatever leverage and muscle he has in Europe.  Some seek to suggest that because of other issues Europe may not look favourably on us.  It has looked favourably on us with regard to other matters, including today when the interest rate for the <Col N="76"/>facility provided by the Commission has, without any great effort on our behalf, been reduced.  This is significant and a recognition by some that we need appropriate assistance.  We should make our approach with regard to the quotas as a plank in our capacity to trade our way out of this.  We are not calling with the begging bowl; we are seeking fair play and a little bit of a push, particularly in this sector and we will work our way out of it.  I ask the Minister to bring the matter forward as quickly as possible in whatever way he can so that next year farmers will not be challenged by trying to re-establish their herds and output as quotas are lifted.  I look forward to working with him and his colleagues in this regard.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;<Miles com="mdash66" />recognises the importance of the agriculture and food sector as a driver for economic recovery and export led growth;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes the commitment of Government to the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and the progress in 2011 towards implementation of the targets as set out in the Food Harvest: Milestones for Success document published in July, 2011;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />endorses the clearly articulated policy of Government to date in relation to Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />reaffirms the following key priorities in relation to the upcoming negotiations on the CAP on which formal proposals from the Commission are expected to be published in early October:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />ensure that the vital role of the CAP in promoting sustainable and competitive food production is maintained and that a commensurate EU budget is provided to support that objective;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />provide appropriate support for competitiveness and sustainability in food production in the rural development pillar of the CAP (Pillar 2); and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />in this regard, notes and expresses its strong support for the efforts of Government to build alliances with other like-minded Member States in pursuit of these stated objectives.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I thank the Opposition for tabling this motion.  However, it is difficult for the Government to accept because it is not a fair reflection of the broader Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, debate.  I hope Opposition Members will examine my amendment to the motion.  They will <Col N="77"/>probably find it difficult to oppose when they do.  I have tried to ensure the amendment to the motion is as broad as possible.  It would be helpful if we had a strong statement of support from other parties in this House for my efforts with CAP reform, regardless of domestic politics and the build-up to the budget.</P>
        <P>Opposition Deputies know me well enough to know I do not normally read prepared scripts.  This evening, however, I will because I want to put several matters on the record which people will find helpful.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to the development of the agrifood industry.  It recognises the agricultural sector will be a key driver for national economic recovery and export-led growth.  We have taken on board the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and have worked actively and tirelessly towards implementation of its targets.  Many Members will have already seen the progress made towards implementation of these targets as set out in the document, Food Harvest: Milestones for Success, published in July 2011.</P>
        <P>In that connection, the CAP will be a key instrument underpinning our Food Harvest ambitions.  Accordingly, the negotiations on the future CAP are of enormous importance for this country because the policy decisions taken on foot of these negotiations will set the context and many of the conditions for the development of Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>So far the European Commission has not published any proposals on the future of the CAP.  These are not expected to be published until early next month.  The recent media reports refer to leaked drafts which have no status and which could be subject to significant changes before they are finalised and presented to member states.  Rather than speculate on the impact of what might be in the eventual proposals, I would like to give an outline of what we do know about the CAP reform debate to date and to present the Government&rsquo;s views on this.</P>
        <P>We know from the EU budget proposals that the intention is to freeze CAP spending at 2013 levels.  This represents a reduction in real terms but stability in nominal terms.  As there was pressure for a substantial nominal cut, this represents a reasonable starting point for the negotiations, one with which we can certainly work.  The eventual outcome will be determined by Heads of State in the financial framework negotiations.  I will be working closely with my Cabinet colleagues to ensure a satisfactory result for Ireland.</P>
        <P>As well as setting a benchmark for the funding available, the Commission&rsquo;s proposals for the future EU budget provided more guidance on Commission intentions for the CAP of the future.  It confirmed the intention to redistribute CAP funds between member states and proposed a pragmatic method be used for distributing pillar 1 direct payments that would close some of the gap between those member states with low levels of payments and those with high payment levels.  It went on to suggest the use of objective criteria to determine allocations between member states for pillar 2.</P>
        <P>A pragmatic approach that looks at both pillars together is needed.  The current distribution key as a starting point and eligible area as a comparator must be used.  On this basis, Ireland has below average payment levels per hectare for pillar 1 and 2 and would see no justification for any reduction in our allocation.  Clearly other member states will see it differently.  Accordingly, there is no certainty at this point about the outcome of the negotiations.</P>
        <P>Deputy Moynihan&rsquo;s motion centres on the issue of the distribution within member states.  There is strong pressure from the Commission, European Parliament and many member states for uniform national or regional flat rates for direct payments.  In that regard, there is very little support among other member states for the retention of the historic model, as used in Ireland.  My priority is to seek as much flexibility as possible for member states to determine the payment models best suited to their conditions and to the development of their farming systems.  A lengthy transitional period will be needed if there are to be any changes.  This is a <Col N="78"/>key issue for me.  Other member states are pressing for flexibility in regard to other areas of the CAP and it will be important in the upcoming negotiations to arrive at a solution that is satisfactory for all member states, including Ireland.  Yesterday in Poland, I conveyed my views on this point to the Commissioner and to my European ministerial colleagues.  I am actively seeking allies in favour of maximum flexibility and sensible transition arrangements.</P>
        <P>The Commission and the European Parliament are pressing for a 30% mandatory green component in direct payments for additional agri-environmental measures beyond current cross-compliance.  This was one of the policy elements mentioned in the Commission&rsquo;s budget proposal, aimed at strengthening the perceived legitimacy of direct payments.  The greening measures being mooted include retention of permanent pasture, crop rotation and ecological set-aside, all of which are already part of normal practice in Irish farming.</P>
        <P>The Government supports the idea of encouraging sustainable forms of agriculture which is at the heart of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  However, we need to keep matters simple and to avoid creating excessive additional bureaucracy.  While the greening measure that would be predominant in Ireland &mdash; retention of permanent pasture &mdash; should not create major compliance problems, the existence of separate greening conditions would complicate our single payment scheme.  There is considerable greening already in place through cross-compliance and we must question what value will derive from such proposals.</P>
        <P>A further complication for Ireland is that a 30% flat-rate greening component would exacerbate the movement towards uniform national or regional payment rates.  We should consider whether there are alternative simpler approaches to achieving the Commission&rsquo;s objectives.</P>
        <P>There is also strong pressure from the Commission and the European Parliament for introducing progressive capping of payments in respect of large farmers, although, there is, equally, strong opposition from certain member states, in particular Germany and the UK, to such a proposal.  This is not a major issue for Ireland as most of our farms are small family farms.  Only six farmers in Ireland would be affected by such proposals.  It should be used as a bargaining chip to get our ways in other areas.</P>
        <P>The Commission communication suggests the introduction of a scheme directed at small-scale farmers.  The details of such a scheme are still somewhat sketchy.  It appears to be mainly directed towards the large number of essentially subsistence holdings in some of the new member states.  I look forward to seeing more detail on this but my initial reaction is that it needs to be discretionary for member states to apply.</P>
        <P>Ireland, almost alone, has been lobbying the Commission on payments to young farmers.  It would be very desirable to have additional measures in the CAP to support young trained farmers.  These are the people who will drive Irish agriculture forward to achieve the targets set out in detail in the Food Harvest documents.  I was pleased that this point was referred to in the Presidency conclusions on the CAP under the Hungarian Presidency.</P>
        <P>The European Parliament has also been campaigning for special provisions to encourage young farmers and I would expect the Commission to come up with some specific proposals in this regard.  I would be interested to have the option of applying measures targeted at young farmers in both pillar 1 and pillar 2 and I understand our lobbying in this regard has been having some success.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The next issue is coupled payments.  In line with the trend towards full decoupling in all member states, I would expect the Commission to make provision for limited coupled payments &mdash; probably no more than 5% to 10% of national ceilings.  I have no objection to retention of coupled payments for vulnerable regions or sectors on a voluntary basis, provided this does not distort the market or prices.  Subject to that condition, it would be useful to have a reason<Col N="79"/>ably flexible and voluntary provision for funding coupled payments from reductions in the single payment.  I believe all member states should have the same flexibility and options.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The next area is what is termed payment for area of natural constraint and which we refer to as LFAs, less favoured areas.  The Commission has signalled that it would like to divert a proportion of direct payment funds in pillar 1 to areas of natural constraint, formerly less favoured areas.  This would be in addition to disadvantaged area payments under the rural development programme.  I would like this to be an optional proposal.</P>
        <P>Rural development is known as pillar 2.  The Commission&rsquo;s intention is that this will have a greater focus on competitiveness, innovation, climate change and the environment and that it would cover multi-annual programmes.  The Commission is also pressing for greater coherence between the different EU funds and to ensure that all objectives line up with EU 2020 strategy priorities.  All of this is acceptable, provided the various co-ordination mechanisms are streamlined and are simple to implement.</P>
        <P>I have considerable misgivings about the level of bureaucracy that might be involved in some of these proposals.  The priority for Ireland is to maintain support for on-farm investment in order to assist the restructuring that may be necessary to improve competitiveness.  It is also a priority to ensure that the review of less favoured areas is acceptable and that there is a sufficiently broad menu of rural development measures to meet our needs.</P>
        <P>Regarding market management mechanisms, aside from direct payments to farmers and targeted support under rural development programmes, it is very important to maintain the market stabilisation supports in place in the CAP of the future.  I understand that the Commission&rsquo;s aim is the retention of intervention capacity and other supports as a safety net should there need to be a price floor.  I agree with this policy.  The dairy crisis in 2009 showed the value of market supports and we need to retain the possibility of bringing them into play if and when they are needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In summary, in light of our ambitions for the sector as set out in Food Harvest: Milestones for Success, the Government has a number of key priorities in these CAP negotiations which are to ensure that the negotiations on the next EU budget framework deliver a well-resourced CAP to support sustainable food production in the EU; to retain Ireland&rsquo;s funding both for direct payments and for rural development in any redistribution of CAP funds between member states; to obtain flexibility for member states with regard to payment models and transition arrangements for distribution of single payment funds to farmers; to ensure that rural development policy includes appropriate targeted measures to support competitiveness and sustainability; and finally, to keep CAP processes as simple and as effective as possible and to minimise unnecessary bureaucracy for farmers and costs to the State.</P>
        <P>Since taking office, I have engaged actively with the Commission and the European Parliament to put Ireland&rsquo;s case.  In particular, I have worked to build up alliances with like-minded member states to ensure a successful outcome for Ireland in these negotiations which will underpin the future development and prosperity of this vitally important sector.  I am fully committed to continuing this work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Among much of the gloom and doom of 2011, agriculture has been a good news story and it has given a lead to other sectors of the economy in the manner in which it has bucked the trend and increased production to record levels in many of its sectors.  This has contributed to the significant increase in exports in the food and drink industry and the creation of both direct and indirect employment.  Thankfully, the bounce in the agriculture sector looks like continuing into the immediate future.  However, the period of time of the next two years must be used <Col N="80"/>wisely so that the potential of agriculture can be fully developed.  It seems that all sides of the House are in agreement on the desired destination even though there will be differences of opinion on how to get to that destination.  I welcome the comprehensive statement by the Minister which answers many of my questions regarding the future negotiations on the future of farming in Ireland.  It is very clear that there is no slippage nor any lack of support or of investment.  Agriculture has demonstrated its ability to deliver the goods whether the country is in bust or boom times and therefore, it needs to be allowed a fair crack of the whip.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister&rsquo;s request for flexibility for member states to determine direct payments, a system best suited to the conditions of the country.  This is a critical issue because it would allow our Minister to tailor the schemes to best suit the needs of our country, to keep things simple and to avoid bureaucracy, as he stated.</P>
        <P>My constituency is made up of small farmers, and farmers in SAC areas.  It is important that their needs and requirements are not forgotten in the bigger picture.  Farmers in the SAC areas have been constrained over the years.  They have destocked their lands and they have been asked to restock.  They have always co-operated with these schemes.  However, it is important they are compensated for these restrictions.  Small farmers must be remembered for their significant contribution over the years.  We all agree that small businesses need to be supported so that they can produce one or two jobs but land is a resource and farms provide jobs too.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the coming negotiations will be difficult but they will also provide great opportunities.  I was pleased to hear the Minister refer to the need to encourage young farmers.  The young farmers of this country have shown the way in their attendance at agricultural colleges and an open door is being pushed.  They must be supported.  There was a kick-back as a result of the withdrawal of the installation aid and the farm retirement schemes a number of years ago.  It is important to support young farmers by whatever mechanism can be found.  I support the Minister&rsquo;s amendment to the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinHeydon"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Heydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I too am delighted to get the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s positive comments on the progress to date in the negotiations albeit that they are at an early stage.  There is agreement in the House that agriculture and the agrifood sector are good news stories at a time when we have few such stories.  The sectors offer an opportunity to drive economic recovery and export-led growth.</P>
        <P>The negotiations on the new Common Agricultural Policy proposals will be some of the most important undertaken by the Government and officials this year.  They offer us the opportunity to ensure the vital role of the Common Agricultural Policy in promoting sustainable and competitive food production is maintained and that an acceptable European Union budget is available to continue to support that role.  The proposals to be published by the European Union in October will set the framework for the development of those industries for the next five years.  I am pleased that the Minister has taken not just an active role, but almost a lead role in the negotiations.  Too often in the past Governments have sat back and allowed EU directives and policy to be negotiated regardless of the consequences.  The way forward is to be on top of the issues, to formulate policy and fight our corner as best we can in advance so that we get the best outcome for the country.</P>
        <P>To put the Common Agricultural Policy in context, I wish to highlight its importance to the economy, not just the agricultural sector.  In the five years from 2007 to 2013, this country will have received a total of &euro;12 billion in payments under the Common Agricultural Policy.  That represents a staggering 85% of total funding from the European Union in that period and 1.4% of the total European Union budget.</P><Col N="81"/>
        <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is a critical part of current industry funding and needs to be protected to allow the agricultural sector to grow to its full potential and realise the spin-off benefits for other aspects of the economy that are possible.  Given that savings of more than &euro;150 million to &euro;200 million still need to be found in the Department this year, it is even more vital.  No farmer wants to survive on direct payments.  I made the point in the House previously.  Farmers wish to reach a point where their produce generates an optimum return.  Until we get to that stage, the Common Agricultural Policy regime is critical.  Average farm incomes in 2010 were &euro;17,770, just over 50% of the average industrial wage.  Direct payments from schemes such as the Common Agricultural Policy represent 98% of average farm incomes.</P>
        <P>If we can continue to develop our agricultural and food sectors, I firmly believe they can be a strong element of our home-grown recovery.  The combined agriculture and agrifood industries support jobs and local economies all over the country.  Almost 15% of total employment comes from these industries with 300,000 jobs either directly or indirectly related to agriculture and food.  Farmers spend almost &euro;8 billion annually on agricultural inputs and living expenses, the majority of which are purchased in their local areas.  One statistic that emphasises the pervasiveness of the agriculture industry is that every &euro;100 of agricultural output produces an additional &euro;73 of output, creating a total of &euro;9.25 billion in the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before getting involved in politics I was a young farmer.  I benefited greatly from the receipt of installation aid which helped me to push through my ideas and grow the enterprise when I took over the family holding.  I am encouraged by the proactive efforts of the Minister in highlighting the plight of young farmers.  Those who came after me did not receive installation aid as it was removed by the previous Government.  That was a kick in the teeth for many young farmers who are the future of the sector.  The Food Harvest 2020 targets are ambitious.  It is only by encouraging young farmers and putting them at the heart of policy making that we will reach the targets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomBarry"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Barry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  In order to look forward we must see where we have come from.  It is important to realise that area aid was a price support when we took reductions in commodity prices.  Those were the days of milk lakes and beef mountains.  We are far away from that.  Since those MacSharry reform days we have always had a good record of negotiating in Europe.  We started off with coupled production whereby one received payment for the product.  Decoupling then became the buzzword whereby in essence one got the payment regardless of production.  Farmers continued to produce and issues arise in that regard currently.  In order to get payments currently, the environmental impact is taken into consideration.  That is all well and good but when one links the environmental input with production, the two elements tug in slightly different directions.  While both are important, there is no point in having fabulous looking countryside but no production.  We must be careful about where that might lead.</P>
        <P>Price fluctuations are also a reality at the moment.  While 2011 has been a great year in most sectors bar the pig industry, we should bear in mind that in 2010 and 2009 most people were barely able to keep going.  The single farm payment comprised a major part of their income.</P>
        <P>I attended a meeting this evening which the Minister had attended previously concerning Beet Ireland.  The group has put together an impressive feasibility study showing that we possibly have a future in commercial sugar production.  I commend the Minister for giving his time to those involved.  Sugar production is part of the Common Agricultural Policy negotiations.  Last week, it was announced that the sugar quota could come to an end in 2016.  Sugar is also a vital part of the food economy in the future.</P><Col N="82"/>
        <P>We had cheap money and we have cheap food, but that may not always be the case.  While China has 8% of the world&rsquo;s land mass and 20% of the world&rsquo;s population, there will be a demand for food.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Deputy Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Common Agricultural Policy allows farmers to produce a sustainable supply of high quality food.  The agrifood sector is this country&rsquo;s most important indigenous manufacturing sector, which accounts for more than 7.5% of national employment.</P>
        <P>The Common Agricultural Policy also provides for services including environmental protection, landscape management, food safety and animal health and welfare standards.  Most importantly, the Common Agricultural Policy supports the continuation of the family farm of which there are 128,000 in the country.  A total of 1,100 food and drinks firms are dotted around the country.</P>
        <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is critical to ensuring sustainable and viable food production across the European Union, thus securing a supply of high quality food that is affordable.  In the absence of the Common Agricultural Policy, the Irish consumer would be exposed to volatile markets and prices with lower standards of food production and environmental protection.  Consumers and the people I represent expect security of food supply, guarantees on food traceability, food safety and environmental and animal welfare standards.</P>
        <P>European consumers spend 13% of their household budget on food.  The Common Agricultural Policy post-2013 allows farmers to respond to the food demands of the European consumer.  It also supports viable farm families and, importantly, ensures that farmers are not forced to produce below the cost of production.  It supports environmentally sustainable grass-based production.</P>
        <P>The good news story of 2010 in terms of farm incomes seems set to continue in 2011.  Dairy exports have increased by 40% between January and May and the sector has increased by 14% for the six months of 2011.</P>
        <P>Harvard Business School issued a series of recommendations and the one I liked the most was its use of the term &ldquo;Brand Ireland&rdquo;.  This is an amazing brand for us given our wonderful artisan food, which was demonstrated to us by the IFA before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on his forward planning and lobbying, especially on behalf of young people.  We must encourage the next generation to get involved in the agrifood sector.  I commend him on building relationships and alliances, and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that he will endeavour to retain Ireland&rsquo;s funding for both direct payments and rural development.  I also commend him on wanting to keep the process simple and straightforward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelColreavy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Colreavy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his report.  I confess that although I have sometimes been known to speak at length, perhaps too long, about matters, when I initially saw the Fianna F&aacute;il motion, I was not entirely clear about the intentions.  I reckoned I would speak for two minutes as a result and would not have much more to say after that.  I broadly understand what the motion is getting at and I am delighted it has been put forward; I thank the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for doing so as it has merited a good response from the Government.</P>
        <P>I read the Government amendment this evening and if I had more time, I could have put down an amendment to that amendment.  All sides could then have signed up to my amendment tomorrow morning and we would all have been happy.  History will never be proven on that but there we go.</P><Col N="83"/>
        <P>I will not rehash discussions concerning the importance of agribusiness and agriculture in Ireland.  I have described agriculture as one of the few major functioning areas of the real Irish economy, with agriculture and agribusiness showing characteristics that are not present in any multinational companies nor many of the national companies or employers.  Agriculture will not suddenly be whipped to Taiwan or China in order to gain increased profits for shareholders and most of the profits from the inputs to agriculture are sourced locally, which contributes to the Irish economy.  All of the wages are spent locally in developing communities, and profits from output are generally held within the Irish economy.  All sides would agree that it is an important industry in the country.</P>
        <P>Despite the economic downturn, the agrifood sector appears to have weathered the storm better than others.  I have no doubt that agriculture has the potential to lead this nation into economic recovery.  We must look after and protect the industry as it has always been our country&rsquo;s backbone, which we need now more than ever.  We must develop strategic plans, and I am aware that the Minister will deal with our Northern counterparts to ensure the sector, at an all-island level, can thrive and act as an economic driver while other sectors begin to recover.  We must increasingly consider this all-island approach to agriculture and the agrifood industry.</P>
        <P>Key to this is the EU Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which supports and promotes agriculture throughout the EU.  It is true that the imminent EU reforms of the CAP have the potential to make or break this valuable Irish agricultural industry.  We must ensure the Government can strenuously defend the rights of Irish farmers, food producers, fishermen and consumers in drawing up new policies and maintaining payments through 2013 and beyond.  I have said before and will repeat that my party will strongly support the Minister and Department responsible for agriculture for as long as they strive to achieve the ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020 and the report on our fishery harbours.</P>
        <P>Certain elements should be considered, although there is much in the Minister&rsquo;s statement that I welcome.  The Minister can see clearly the fundamental importance of the industry for the future of the country, with the critical importance of EU support continuing.  Freezing the CAP at 2013 budget levels will represent a reduction in real terms and perhaps there is scope for further debate in that regard.  All of us must bear in mind that many people, particularly in the west and north west, are small farmers who held small jobs as well.  In many cases those jobs are gone and overall income is well down as a result.  It would be wrong for the EU to assume that the average income <i>per capita</i>, particularly in disadvantaged areas, would be as strong now as when the Union last assessed it.  The chances are that incomes are well down and people will depend on the farm as a sole source of income aside from farm assist.  There is much work to be done in this regard.</P>
        <P>With regard to distribution among member states, there is a suggestion that objective criteria would be used to determine allocations between states for Pillar 2.  I know all of us are interested in this and would like further information on the type of criteria being spoken about.  We must talk to our communities in this regard.  Government must be prepared for what is coming and communities should also be prepared in order to gain pole position in availing of what comes from CAP reforms.  As soon as the reforms take shape, we must ensure the communities can benefit from them.  We must take a pragmatic approach that can consider both pillars.  Distribution within member states is key.  Every state will seek the best it can get for itself, which is one of several advantages to closer collaboration with colleagues in the Six Counties.</P>
        <P>The introduction of a green component to direct payments is potentially a dangerous issue for Irish agriculture.  I know the Irish Farmers Association has serious concerns in this regard.  Nevertheless, this could provide tremendous advantage as much of what farmers are already <Col N="84"/>doing works towards a green agenda, although they may not label it so.  They manage farmland to ensure it is ready for the next use, crop or season, working in harmony with nature to ensure the land remains as fertile as possible.  That is the kind of activity that has a green element, although the EU may not always support it financially.  Perhaps we should have a discussion with the EU about precisely what is meant by &ldquo;greening&rdquo;.  If it is the good management of land in order to maximise potential yield from that land, it is not something of which the IFA, the EU or farmers in general should be afraid.  We must ensure that when the Minister&rsquo;s counterparts in the EU speak about greening, it is not simply about inserting limitations which anecdotal evidence suggests will improve the land&rsquo;s prospects.  Good land management is in everybody&rsquo;s interest and that is what we should support.</P>
        <P>We need to keep things simple and avoid creating excessive additional bureaucracy.  I welcome that inclusion in the Minister&rsquo;s report.  With regard to capping, Sinn F&eacute;in has argued for some time that there should indeed be a cap on the grants being paid.  There should be scaled payments so that small and medium-sized farms get more support than large farms.  Furthermore, the money from these schemes should not be used to pay businesses which have no direct involvement in agriculture.  If those businesses require support, they should get it from some other fund.  The Common Agricultural Policy fund should be used to maintain those who produce the food in the first place.  We support capping in that regard and would support a mechanism that ensures there is fairness and equity in the distribution of the fund, whereby those who need most, get most.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister has some reservations regarding payments to small scale farmers.  There is a need to make the qualification criteria simpler and less demanding for smaller farmers or organic producers.  Perhaps this will be an opportunity to open that door to a number of people in the country.</P>

	<P>Yes, but perhaps in the discussions the Minister would suggest it as a possible opportunity under that heading.</P>
        <P>All of us welcome the Minister&rsquo;s insistence on the desirability of having additional payments to support young farmers.  In the north west I see many young people leaving farming.  They do not see a future for themselves in agriculture.  The worst thing that can happen is to have hope taken from these young people.  Anything the Common Agricultural Policy or the Government can do to make it easier for these young people and to give them hope that by staying on the farm they will have a half decent future would be welcome.  That is all they are seeking and it is what we should be fighting for on their behalf.  I believe the Minister will do that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelColreavy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Colreavy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a great deal in the Minister&rsquo;s report.  I do not know if this relates to the CAP negotiations but there should be discussions with farmers before their areas are designated special areas of conservation, SACs, as this can tear the bottom out of the local farming industry.</P><Col N="85"/>
        <P>The final point I wish to make is a criticism.  Regardless of what grant system is in place, if it is one in which people are owed money since last December and still have not received it, there is something very wrong with it.  A number of farmers have received bills for over-payments of area aid payments that were paid to them.  Apparently, there was a miscalculation by the Department and it sent out bills asking farmers to repay the money.  The farmers were told that if the money was not repaid within a month, penalty interest would apply.  Most of the cases I am aware of involved small amounts.  I deal with small farmers.  However, what if the same system applied to the Department, which is holding up some payments since last December?  The payments run to many thousands of euro for some of the same small farmers.  It is unfair of the Department to expect a small farmer to pay penal interest when the Department is not penalised even though grants due since God knows when are still unpaid.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for putting down this motion, which is very relevant.  I also thank the Minister for giving such a comprehensive response.  He is doing well so far and, hopefully, he will continue in that direction.</P>
        <P>There is a great deal of talk in Ireland at present about how great it would be if oil or gas were found here.  At times we forget we already have something far more valuable, that will never run out and that we can generate every year.  Perhaps that is our version of oil and gas.  I mention this because in my constituency the search for gas could potentially put an end to agriculture in view of the fracking issue, although I will not discuss that now.  However, people should be reminded that we have one hell of a resource.  We should be proud of it and make use of it.</P>
        <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has served some of us well in many ways, but under both the old and the current systems it appears, and I am open to being proven wrong, that certain people benefited a great deal more than others.  The idea of protecting small farms and the rural way of life does not appear to be the main priority but rather feathering the nest of people who have plenty of money already and, as Deputy Colreavy hinted, who are not really in the farming industry.  They are in something connected with it, but not in the industry.  I would like to see that change in whatever changes occur.  If the CAP is about protecting small farms and if there is only a certain amount of money to be distributed, it makes sense to give more of it to people who might survive on a 50 acre farm rather than to those on a 1,000 acre farm.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>The CAP has served us well with regard to exports and keeping us competitive.  However, I hope that in future it will help to develop the local economy as well, through its rural development component.  This takes in the greening issue.  Surely it is more environmentally friendly for somebody in Roscommon to eat potatoes that are grown in Roscommon.  I am not saying one should have to or that we should go down the insular route, but from the environmental point of view it makes far more sense than bringing the potatoes from other parts of the world.  In other countries such as France, Germany and Spain one will see local produce being sold locally.  That is almost absent in my area.</P>
        <P>As I said previously in the House, I conducted a study in my constituency before the general election.  I spoke to all the greengrocers and supermarket operators in the area.  Between &euro;9 million and &euro;10 million worth of fruit and vegetables are sold in my local area.  It is only an estimate but after talking to these shopkeepers I established that only approximately 5% of what is eaten locally is produced locally.  Under the CAP reforms more money should be directed towards this area.  Obviously, we will not be producing grapefruit or the like but if even 50% of the products were produced locally, it would mean another &euro;4.5 million going into our local economy.  The farmer who makes the money does not simply leave it in his pocket.  It is spent on other things and the money circulates throughout the local economy.</P><Col N="86"/>
        <P>I do not have much time but I will conclude by pointing out that we should be wary of the greening issue.  While I am an environmentalist and believe strongly in it, sometimes people can get a little fundamentalist on the issue.  Ireland should be very wary of rushing headlong into this and of thinking that because Europe is giving us this money we had better do what we are told.</P>
      
        <P>From what I can see, from 2013 onwards we will become a net contributor so we do not necessarily need to go in with our heads bowed quite so much in the future.  I hope we do not see a situation down the line where people will get payments and then discover, as in the case of one of the battles I am fighting, that if they cut turf next year, they will lose their single farm payment.  Will that be a component of greening or will greening be a case of good farm practice?  I would like an answer to this question because we cannot establish one.</P>
        <P>Under the current single farm payment system, there is a kind of insinuation or a threat that if people cut turf on one of the 55 SAC bogs next year, they will lose part of their payment.  We cannot get a definitive answer to that question but would like to get one.  It would be good to know it now and for the future.  Will this greening prevent us from doing something else?  What will be next which we never thought of when we signed up to previous agreements?</P>

        <P FLI="0">These are a series of technical amendments to the Schedule.  Amendments Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, and amendment No. 7 propose to replace the word &ldquo;tuarastal&rdquo; meaning salary, which appears throughout the Bill, including in the Title, with the phrase &ldquo;luach saothair&rdquo; meaning remuneration or reward.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in, the official translators office, which has advised that although &ldquo;tuarastal&rdquo; is used in the original constitutional provision, it would be more accurate to use the phrase &ldquo;luach saothair&rdquo; which has been the accepted Irish legal term for remuneration since 1950.  Obviously, a different term was being used in 1937.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 6 is similar but refers to what is the now accepted phrase for in the public interest which has also evolved since 1937.  The phrase now being adopted &ldquo;ar mhaithe le leas an phobail&rdquo; is used elsewhere in the Constitution &mdash; for example, Articles 40.6.1 and subhead 1 of that and throughout the Irish translation of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act.  These are essentially technical amendments based on advices we subsequently received in regard to the translation.</P>

        <P LI="1">In Part 2, page 6, line 25, after &ldquo;make&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;proportionate&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Amendment No. 6<i>a </i>represents the only substantive change I propose to make to the Schedule.  Section 5.3 is drafted to allow that when and only when reductions have been made or are in future made by law to public service pay on the basis of the public interest, these reductions can be applied by law to judges&rsquo; remuneration.  That is to say it can only be done by way of primary legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  The provision clearly limits the reduction in judges&rsquo; pay to cuts applying to others paid from the public purse.  It also guards against any danger of successive reductions being made to judges&rsquo; pay alone as reductions can only be effected where reductions are being made to public service pay.  Indeed, I referred to this in my speech on Second Stage.</P>
        <P>It has been suggested that the text of the proposed Article 35.5.3 be amended to address concerns that have been the subject of some comment.  The Attorney General has recommended that the wording of that provision be changed to state that any reductions made by law to the remuneration of judges should be proportionate to the reductions made by law to other classes of persons paid out of public money.  Such an amendment would remove any possible suggestion that the Judiciary could be discriminated against or targeted as a group for pay reduction in circumstances where no such reductions would apply to any other group paid out of public moneys.</P>
        <P>I made reference to this in my Second Stage speech, so Deputies will be aware of it.  Again, for the record of the House, the effect of this amendment would mean that Article 35.5.3 would read as follows: &ldquo;where before or after the enactment into law of this section, reductions have been or are made by law to the remuneration of persons belonging to classes of persons whose remuneration is paid out of public money and such law states that those reductions are in the public interest, <Col N="89"/>provision may also be made by law to make proportionate reductions to the remuneration of judges&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;proportionate&rdquo; is inserted.</P>
        <P>It is important to understand that the proposed amendment will allow for the application of the reductions already imposed on the public service and serving judges.  What the amendment does is more explicitly state what was already implicit in the original proposal and I suppose it is what I would describe as the &ldquo;to be sure, to be sure&rdquo; amendment so that no one can suggest, with any credibility, that this proposal does anything other than what we state it is intended to do which is simply to apply to the Judiciary any reductions that occur in other commensurate sections of the public sector as opposed to any possibility of the Judiciary ever being targeted.</P>
        <P>In the context of this issue, Deputy Calleary raised some concerns about the draft Bill we published, which I did not have the opportunity to address on Second Stage, and said that we might publish something different after the referendum or that some other Government might publish something different.  Of course, the protection there is a constitutional one.  No one can do anything different in the sense that one can only apply to the Judiciary the proportionate reductions that relate to persons paid out of the public purse in the public sector at the levels as detailed.  I deliberately provided the detail to the House in a form that I hope made it readily understandable in the context of the different levels from the Supreme Court down to the District Court and also the heads of the different courts and how it would impact on the Chief Justice all the way down to the President of the District Court.  I hope the House will support the amendment proposed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only one word but it significantly improves this and takes away any ambiguity about it.  We are very happy to support the &ldquo;to be sure, to be sure&rdquo; amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The &ldquo;to be sure, to be sure&rdquo; amendment reinforces the independence of the Judiciary and, as Deputy Calleary said, it is one word but as we sometimes know one word makes a difference.  We welcome the amendment also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Opposition Deputies for their support for this Bill.  I reiterate what I said at the start, that it is of crucial importance that we continue to maintain and protect the independence of the Judiciary.  On Second Stage, Deputies referred to the importance of the separation of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary.  When this proposal goes to the people in a referendum, it is important &mdash; particularly for Members of this House, including members of the Government &mdash; that we have a respectful public discussion.  We should show due respect for the independence of the Judiciary.  We need to deal with this issue in the way intended, which is to provide for fairness in the context of those who are paid from the public purse at a time of great fiscal difficulty for the State.  It is right that in this discussion we should recognise the integrity and independence of judges at all levels within our courts system.</P>
        <P>I would go further in citing the bravery that is exhibited with that independence on occasions in the context of some of the more difficult issues that judges have to address in the area of criminal law over the years.  On occasion in decades gone by, judges may, in hearing particular cases, have feared that they were placing themselves at risk.  As far as I am aware, however, no judges have ever shirked their responsibilities, obligations or constitutional oath to uphold the law.  It is my hope that, as we move forward with this particular issue, whatever small amount of heat that seemed to be generated around it back in July, will not reappear.  We should have an open discussion in so far as the public may wish to hear what we are doing and be informed.  On this particular issue, we will do it on a co-operative basis across both sides of the House.</P>
        <P>I thank Opposition Deputies not just for their support today on the principles of the Bill, but also for supporting the amendments we are making.</P>

	<P>The North West Mayo Forum was established in 2008 with the dual objectives of providing an opportunity for dialogue between parties with an interest in the Corrib gas project and offering an opportunity for furthering the socio-economic development of the North West Mayo Region.</P>
        <P>It was intended that membership of the Forum would include a broad representation from local community groups, however a number of groups opposed to the Corrib gas project declined to participate in the Forum.</P>
        <P>Over the course of its first year, the Forum met on five occasions. The last meeting was held over a year ago on 8th May 2010.  A decision has not been taken to convene a further meeting of the Forum at this time.</P>
        <P>The decision to approve the application from the Corrib partners to construct a pipeline connecting the offshore and onshore facilities made specific provision for the establishment of a Consent Conditions Monitoring Committee, to monitor implementation of the conditions of the Section 40 gas pipeline consent.</P>
        <P>This provides an opportunity for representatives of the local community to engage in a meaningful way in relation to the construction of the principal remaining element of the development.</P>
        <P>I will continue to keep in mind the potential for a further meeting of the Forum.</P>

	<P>Construction of the Corrib Gas Terminal at Bellanaboy is substantially completed, as are the subsea <Col N="94"/>facilities at the Corrib Gas Field.  The 83 km. offshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline has also been installed</P>
        <P>Following the granting of a number of statutory consents earlier this year for the construction of the onshore section of the pipeline along a revised route, work on this final element of the development has now commenced.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that construction of the onshore section of the pipeline, including the construction of a 5 km. tunnel, will take in the region of two years.</P>
        <P>The consent granted by the then Minister in February of this  year for the construction of the Corrib gas pipeline required the Corrib Gas Partners to prepare an environmental management plan. The purpose of this plan is to ensure that the mitigation and monitoring controls identified in the developer&rsquo;s Environmental Impact Statement as approved, are appropriately managed and implemented by the developer in agreement with my Department.</P>
        <P>In July of this year, following a detailed assessment, my Department approved the EMP submitted by Shell, which set out the proposed schedule of works for this year, together with the relevant environmental protection mitigations. These works relate to the construction of the Aghoose tunnelling compound and the conduct of offshore surveys.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Works at Aghoose are now ongoing and these works are the subject of independent monitoring being undertaken by international consultants ENVIRON on behalf of my Department. Shell's progress reports, together with ENVIRON&rsquo;s reports will be made available on my Department's website.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities, chaired by Mr Colm McCarthy, was presented to Government and published in April this year.  In respect of Bord na M&oacute;na the Review Group recommended that the Government should seek to dispose of Bord na M&oacute;na as a single entity, including peat extraction rights but not ownership of the peat lands.  Following publication of the Report, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sought the considered views of relevant Departments in respect of the Review Group&rsquo;s recommendations.  My Department consulted with Bord na M&oacute;na as part of the process of preparing its response.  The Company made a submission on the Report in response to this request.  My Department subsequently submitted its views to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the aspects in the Report which related to the work of the Department.  As the Deputy is now aware the Government has considered the general issue of the sale of State Assets and these submissions will feed into the process that has been established. </P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> his views that in view of modern technology, it is reasonable that &euro;18 million of the licence fee was attributed to RTE Radio 1 in 2010; and if he has asked RTE, in view of the high salaries paid to broadcasters at the station, that the public service funding requirement be reduced. </Quest>

	<P>RT&Eacute; is an independent national public service broadcaster whose remit and obligations are set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009. Section 114(1)(a) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 charges RT&Eacute; with providing and operating a national sound broadcasting service which shall have the character of <Col N="95"/>a public service, be a free-to-air service and be made available, in so far as it is reasonably practicable, to the whole community on the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Section 98 provides that the company shall be independent in the pursuance of this object, subject to the requirements of the Act, and as such I, as Minister, have no function in the management of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s day to day affairs, including matters relating to its budget for Radio One in 2010 and in relation to general staff remuneration and contracts. These are purely matters for RT&Eacute; management who no doubt seek to manage their full cost base in a way that ensures the financial sustainability of the company.</P>
        <P>That said, I would highlight to the Deputy that the &euro;18.4 million of licence fee revenue attributed to RT&Eacute; Radio One in 2010 represents a 21.7% reduction on the licence fee attributed to the station in 2009. It serves as an example of the widespread and significant cost reductions which RT&Eacute; has undertaken and continues to undertake. I would also point out to the Deputy that RT&Eacute; Radio One provides a very substantial quantum and quality of public service content, continues to attract the highest national share of listeners in the State, and, accordingly, fulfils an integral role as part of the public service broadcasting landscape in this country.</P>
        <P>With regard to the public funding of RT&Eacute;, it is the case that this has been reduced in recent times, both in the most recent Government Budget and with the onset of the Broadcasting Act 2009. The Act provided that the proportion of net television licence fee receipts to be paid to RT&Eacute; was reduced from 95% to 93% having the affect of reducing RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s annual budget by approximately &euro;4 million.  The Budget of last December resulted in the reduction of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s public funding by &euro;10 million as a result of the decision to transfer that sum to assist in the funding of TG4. The Budget also capped the payment of free television licences issued by the Department of Social Protection at 2010 levels which is expected to further reduce the corporation&rsquo;s funding by &euro;3 million in 2011.</P>
        <P>This series of reductions in RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s public funding is taking place in an economic climate where RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s commercial revenue has reduced drastically when compared to 2008 levels. RT&Eacute; is forecasting a significant end year deficit this year having already posted a &euro;4.7 million deficit in 2010. I have met recently with RT&Eacute; management and I have made my view clear that a continuing deficit position is not tenable.  I believe that the management fully concur with this and will take the remedial action necessary to address the situation.</P>
        <P>RT&Eacute; has invested significantly in respect of the upgrading of infrastructure to facilitate the successful transition to Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT). In this context, Deputies should be aware that Capital Expenditure of up to &euro;70 million will be incurred by RT&Eacute;. It is important that the costs of DTT roll-out do not place an undue burden on the company.</P>
        <P>Section 124(8) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 requires the BAI to carry out a review on the adequacy or otherwise of the funding of public service broadcasters not more than 3 years after the passing of the Broadcasting Act 2009. I look forward to receiving this review, which is due to be completed by the Authority by mid-2012 at the latest, as it will assist in informing any policy decisions I may take on the future public funding of public service broadcasters.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, I am confident that the Board and management of RT&Eacute; are taking the necessary action to ensure that the company is placed on a sustainable financial footing as soon as possible and that it continues to meet its legal obligations.</P>

        <P>The forum is chaired by Mr. Joe Brosnan, who in addition to chairing Forum meetings helped initiate direct meetings between the developer and local groups opposed to the project, engaged in ongoing contacts with a broad range of interested parties, including community representatives, the developer and public bodies.</P>

	<P>Companies wishing to submit applications for licensing options in the competition run by my Department last year were not required to indicate as part of their application the method they would propose for the extraction of gas in the event of a commercial discovery being made in the future. </P>
        <P>The licensing options on offer at the time specifically excluded exploration drilling of any kind. Accordingly, it would not be possible to make a commercial discovery under the licensing options that were on offer and as a consequence it would have been premature to focus on the technology that might be used to produce gas.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the licensing options is to allow the companies assess the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on desktop studies of existing data from previous petroleum exploration activity and shallow geological sampling. They also confer on the companies involved a first right of refusal for an exploration licence over the areas concerned.</P>
        <P>Exploration activity under these authorisations is at a very early stage and there is no certainty that it will lead to applications for follow-on exploration licences that would be required before exploration wells could be drilled.</P>
        <P>I have made clear that any future application proposing the use of hydraulic fracturing, will be the subject of an environmental impact assessment, including an appropriate public consultation phase before any decision is made.</P>

	<P>The Advisory Group on Media Mergers Report points out that there are some indications of a trend towards the concentration of media ownership and that this may accelerate depending on economic circumstances.   </P>
        <P>Global trends also reveal a tendency by large media corporations to acquire other media organisations on a continuing basis.</P>
        <P>The audiovisual media business in Ireland is subject to the same technological advances, growth of new media, globalisation and the convergence of what were formerly separate businesses.</P>
        <P>These rapid advances in communication technologies, including, in particular, Internet based media offerings, provide both for freedom of expression and a plurality of voices but may also concentrate media in large conglomerates not subject to Irish jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>I agree with the general view that, with increasing technological advances, growth of new media, and convergence of what were formerly separate businesses, new media is becoming inextricably interlinked.  These fundamental changes mean that the traditional print media business is migrating to audiovisual media and the Internet in a rapidly globalising print and audiovisual media landscape.</P>
        <P>On this basis, I see an increasing role for my Department and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in the media mergers area as desirable.</P>
        <P>The public interest test in relation to media mergers currently rests with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Minister Bruton has recently brought legislative proposals to Government in this area and I understand that the proposed legislation, the Consumer and Competition Bill, is now being drafted. The issue of the future locus of the public interest test in relation to media mergers is being addressed in that context and I will be remaining very close to the issue during the drafting of legislation.</P>

	<P>I am acutely aware of the difficulties that recent electricity and gas price rises by several utilities are having on householders and particularly those vulnerable customers who may already be struggling with arrears.  The recent report from the Society of the St. Vincent de Paul is a sobering reminder that energy poverty and reduced income are a cause of deep anxiety among many older people in our society, especially as we head into the winter months.  That is why the Government is determined to systematically tackle the causes and mitigate the effects of energy poverty across the country. </P>
        <P>Energy Affordability is a cross-cutting policy issue and tackling the root causes of energy affordability or fuel poverty requires action on a number of fronts.</P>
        <P>Energy poverty is caused by the interaction between energy prices, thermal inefficiency of the home and income.  Action to mitigate energy poverty has traditionally focused on providing assistance through the schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.</P>
        <P>The Affordable Energy Strategy will be the framework for building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty, which include <Col N="98"/>the thermal efficiency-based measures delivered through the Better Energy: Warmer Homes programme.  By providing significant energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, energy poverty, it brings benefits to recipients in terms of energy affordability, tangible health improvements and overall well being.  The programme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>Better Energy: Warmer Homes is primarily delivered by 28 community based organisations (CBOs).  The CBOs work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations including public health nurses, MABS and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to identify and address vulnerable homes.  Private contractors are also engaged to address areas or technologies not covered by CBOs.</P>
        <P>Enhancing the energy efficiency of low-income homes through structural improvements remains the most effective means of reducing energy poverty.  To date, energy efficiency improvements in over 71,000 homes have been made under Better Energy: Warmer Homes. My Department and SEAI have a target of an additional 20,000 homes this year of which 11,197 have been completed to the end of August.</P>
        <P>In addition to Better Energy: Warmer Homes, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government operate a retrofit programme for social housing.  Approximately 1,850 units were approved in 2010 with a similar number expected this year.</P>
        <P>The Inter-Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy, which is chaired by my Department and which represents all key Departments, Agencies and energy suppliers as well as the Energy Regulator and NGOs, finalised its own deliberations over the summer months.  Their analysis and recommendations formed the basis for a strategy to be agreed with my Ministerial colleagues.  I would remind the Deputy that I informed the Oireachtas Committee last evening that I was in the process of bringing a Memo to Cabinet on this issue and it is my intention to publish an Affordable Energy Strategy within a few weeks.</P>

	<P>The telecommunications market in Ireland has been fully liberalised since 1999 and, since then, has seen the steady growth and development of vibrant well-regulated competition in the provision of the full range of telecommunications products and services.</P>
        <P>The Government is not a player in this market and can only intervene in cases of market failure.</P>
        <P>Between the significant private and public sector investments over recent years all areas of the country now have access to at least a basic broadband service.</P>
        <P>The Rural Broadband Scheme, which recently closed for applications, aims to identify the remaining individual premises in rural Ireland, including county Tipperary, outside of the NBS areas that are unable to obtain a broadband service and to provide a basic broadband service to those premises, where requested.</P>
        <P>The <i>Verification Phase</i>   of the Scheme will now commence. Under this phase efforts will be made to obtain a service for those who have applied under the Scheme from commercial Internet Service Providers under existing market terms.</P>
        <P>If internet service providers confirm that a particular applicant cannot be served at present, the Rural Broadband Scheme will seek to offer a service through whichever company is successful in bidding for the RBS procurement contract. </P><Col N="99"/>
        <P>The <i>procurement process</i>   is expected to commence toward the end of October and will aim to identify the preferred supplier. Pending contract negotiations a service provider will be appointed in early 2012.</P>
        <P>Roll-out of the service under the Scheme is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.</P>
        <P>The Government accepts that the widespread availability of next generation broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.</P>
        <P>Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband customer access to every home and business in the State.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce has an important role, in this regard.</P>
        <P>In June of this year I convened the Taskforce which I chair and which also comprises the Minister of State with responsibility for NewERA, Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, T.D., the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies currently operating in the Irish market and the CEOs of some Internet Service Provider companies.  The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss the optimal policy environment required to facilitate the provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Taskforce, and four Working Groups reporting to it, are considering issues such as appropriate targets, private sector investment plans, and the role of Government in driving and facilitating investment.  The Taskforce met earlier this week and will meet again in December. I expect that it will help to identify the optimal policy to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband generally and thereby assist in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government.</P>

	<P>The telecommunications market in Ireland has been fully liberalised since 1999 and, since then, has seen the steady growth and development of vibrant well-regulated competition in the provision of the full range of telecommunications products and services.</P>
        <P>The Government is not a player in this market and can only intervene in cases of market failure.</P>
        <P>Commercial operators have been investing steadily in rolling out critical communications infrastructure in Ireland over the last number of years. That investment has been of the order of &euro;400 to &euro;500m per annum. The State too has invested where it has identified market failure.</P>
        <P>Between the significant private and public sector investments over recent years all areas of the country now have access to at least a basic broadband service. International comparisons of retail broadband services are conducted periodically. The ComReg statistical report for end 2010 noted the latest OECD broadband data up to June 2010 ranked Ireland 13th of 19 EU states surveyed for fixed line broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants and third of 18 EU states surveyed for wireless broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants.  A wider report on broadband services in 72 countries published in 2010 by the University of Oxford and the University of Oviedo, Spain, concluded that the broadband services currently available in Ireland are capable of meeting the requirements of today&rsquo;s broadband applications and overall, in terms of broadband quality and penetration, ranks Ireland 13th   of the 72 countries studied.</P><Col N="100"/>
        <P>Significant improvements have been made in the quality and delivery of broadband in recent years.  For example, broadband speeds of up to 100 megabits per second are already available to around 500,000 premises using coaxial cable. This will increase to over 700,000 premises by the end of next year.  Telephone lines now provide digital subscriber line broadband (DSL) offering speeds of up to 24 mbps, depending on distance from exchanges.  In addition to these improvements in fixed line services, developments in wireless technologies are also delivering higher speeds.  WiMax products, which are increasingly available, offer speeds of up to 10 mbps, while mobile broadband speeds are also being increased. Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a   commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband to every home and business in the State.</P>
        <P>The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, has an important role, in this regard.

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s energy policy, including the regulatory framework, seeks to deliver a secure, sustainable and competitive energy supply.  In achieving this objective, the regulatory framework must meet evolving energy policy challenges and also ensure compliance with the requirements of both EU and national legislation.</P>
        <P>The regulation of the electricity and gas market is the responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 provided for the establishment of the CER as an independent statutory regulator. Since its establishment, there may have been a number of changes to the regulatory framework, and CER&rsquo;s functions, in line with the continually evolving energy policy landscape and partly as a result of EU obligations.</P>
        <P>Initially, the Commission was responsible for the regulation and reform of the electricity market only. In 2002, under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act, the Commission was additionally given statutory responsibility for the regulation of the natural gas market. Since then its remit has been further extended to include additional responsibilities, for example for security of supply, upstream petroleum and downstream gas safety and customer protection matters.</P>
        <P>With a view to meeting policy objectives, the CER has played a pivotal role in the development of the Single Electricity Market (SEM) which has been operating in Ireland and Northern Ireland since November 2007. It represents one of the first markets of its kind in the world, a fact that was been recognised by the EU Energy Commissioner at the time of the launch of the SEM.</P>
        <P>Building on the success of the SEM, the two regulators are currently working together to develop Common Arrangements for Gas (CAG) on the island, whereby all players in the gas market can buy, sell, transport and contribute to the development and planning of the natural gas market North and South on an all-island basis.</P>
        <P>In the immediate future, the regulatory regime for the Irish electricity and gas market, including consumer protection issues, is being enhanced by the obligations on Ireland of the EU&rsquo;s Third Energy Package aimed at developing an integrated EU energy market and  improving competition to the benefit of consumers.</P>
        <P>The International Energy Agency will, in the coming weeks, be conducting its periodic in-depth review of Irish energy policy.  The Agency reviews the energy policy of every member country every four to five years.  On this occasion, the IEA review will include, as part of its overall review of Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy, an independent assessment of the efficiency of the Irish electricity and gas sectors, as required under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support <Col N="102"/>for Ireland.  In this assessment, the IEA will examine, inter alia, existing policy in relation to the regulatory framework and actions to ensure that the electricity and gas markets are competitive.  The IEA may make proposals for further strengthening of the regulatory and market reform framework, among the range of energy policy recommendations it will make in its final report.</P>
        <P>Based on the results of that assessment, I will consider what actions may require to be taken in relation in regard to strengthening the regulatory and market reform programme in consultation with European Commission Services, in line with the requirement in the updated EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is also my intention that a new energy policy framework will be published next year.  The new framework will take account of developments over the past few years since the publication of the 2007 White Paper.  The new energy policy framework will also be informed by the outcome of the IEA&rsquo;s review, including independent assessment of the efficiency of the Irish electricity and gas sectors referred to above.</P>

	<P>It is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency, which is an independent statutory body, to determine the activities that it is to licence.</P>
        <P>From my own Department&rsquo;s perspective I can inform the Deputy that each proposal for the drilling of an exploration well gives rises to a detailed application and assessment, before permission to drill can be given.  On the specific issue of possible future onshore exploration drilling using hydraulic fracturing, I have made clear that any such proposals would be subject to an environmental impact assessment before permission to drill could be granted by my Department.  That process would include a public consultation phase.</P>
        <P>Under the licensing options granted by my Department earlier this year, which run to 2013, exploration drilling is not allowed.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 27 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s total contribution to Official Development Assistance (ODA) will amount to &euro;659 million in 2011. &euro;524 million of this funding will be planned and managed by Irish Aid, in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Some &euro;135 million is accounted for by contributions of other Government Departments and by Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU development cooperation <Col N="103"/>budget. On current projections, this level of allocation ensures that Ireland will provide approximately 0.52 per cent of GNP for development assistance in 2011.</P>
        <P>The Government is strongly committed to Ireland&rsquo;s development programme, which is central to our foreign policy and to Ireland&rsquo;s role internationally in helping to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We are committed to the target of 0.7% of GNP and we are working to achieve it by 2015. This is in line with the long-standing UN target for ODA, and with the commitment of the European Union.</P>
        <P>It is clear that, in current circumstances, this will be a challenging target to meet. However, the Government was elected to face up to the challenges of rebuilding our society and economy, and of restoring economic growth and our international reputation. I strongly believe that we can do this without undermining our work to improve the lives of some of the world&rsquo;s poorest people. Over the next few years, decisions on the annual allocations for the aid programme will have to be taken within the overall budgetary framework and fiscal constraints facing the Government. Nonetheless, I can assure you, as Minister with responsibility for trade and development, that I will make the strongest possible case for funding for development cooperation.</P>

        <P FLI="0">My Department&rsquo;s current taxi policy provides that taxis may be used for official business only in cases when public transport is not available or feasible or when officers are required, because of work or official travel commitments to travel early in the morning or late at night either to or from HQ or to airports or train stations. At other times, the use of taxis is not allowed. I believe that this provides a reasonable balance between requirements to safeguard the exchequer to the greatest extent possible and a recognition that there are situations where the use of taxis will be necessary.</P>
        <P>In addition to the figure for taxi usage given above, HQ-based officers abroad travelling on official business may also find it necessary to use taxis and may be reimbursed for these costs. These costs are reimbursed with travelling expenses in the normal way.</P>
        <P>The costs related to taxi use are monitored on a monthly basis and the taxi policy is kept under review. The cost of contract taxi services has declined each year since 2007.</P>
        <P>The official taxi service is intended for staff of my Department only and is not made available to others.</P>

	<P>The 24-25 March European Council adopted the Decision amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in connection with the proposed new European Stability Mechanism.  This Decision shall enter into force on 1 January 2013 provided that all Member States have notified the completion of the procedures for the approval of the Decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.</P>
        <P>Having considered the matter carefully, including the legal advice of the Attorney General, the Government is satisfied that the amendment to the Treaty is compatible with the Constitution.  As no amendment of the Constitution arises, a referendum will not be required in order for Ireland to approve the amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. I propose to bring forward a Bill in the coming months to amend the European Communities Act 1972 to reflect the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to allow for the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that this Bill would also amend the European Communities Act 1972 to take account of the transitional provisions on the composition of the European Parliament until the end of the current parliamentary term (2009-2014).  These are contained in a Protocol agreed at an Intergovernmental Conference on 9 June 2010, in order to allow for the inclusion in the current European Parliament the additional seats which are provided under the Lisbon Treaty, since the last European Parliament elections took place before the Lisbon Treaty entered into force.</P>

	<P>My Department, which is responsible for Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs) and Vote 29 (International Cooperation), operates a restrictive policy for the use of corporate credit cards for official expenditure.    The use of official credit cards may be permitted for officials who, because of the nature of their work, need to make official payments by this method.  Credit cards are typically used to make occasional flight and hotel bookings, for making on-line purchases where it represents better value and for making payments at short notice, where cash may not be acceptable or where invoicing arrangements cannot be put in place. </P>
        <P>Their use is subject to the same authorisation and control procedures as other forms of payment and decisions to issue a card are made in response to identified business needs.  There are currently 4 official credit cards in use by my Department in Ireland, two assigned to Vote 28 and two to Vote 29. There are 16 official credit cards in use by Missions abroad.  Where credit limits apply, this is set at &euro;5,000.</P>
        <P>The details of total spending on departmental credit cards from 2007 to 2010 and to date in 2011, and the amount that related to representational expenditure, can be found in the table below.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Passports Act, 2008 requires that before issuing a passport to a person, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade shall be satisfied as to the identity of each applicant and that the person is an Irish citizen.  Documentary proof in respect of identity and entitlement to citizenship are required for all passport applications.  These requirements are outlined in the passport application form notes that accompany each application form.  Details are also available on the Department&rsquo;s website.   Birth certificates are among the standard documents that are required for all applications that involve children and persons, aged 18 and over the age, who are first-time applicants.  These certificates are critical to the passport process in the following ways:</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) Each certificate confirms and verifies the applicant&rsquo;s personal details such as his/her date and place of birth which appear on that person&rsquo;s passport.</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) They help to demonstrate the person&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship which is a prerequisite for passport issue; and</P>
        <P LI="3">(iii) Details of parents are stated on these certificates.  This is important to the Passport Service in ensuring that the full parental consent to the issue of a passport to a minor is provided.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Department is aware that some Irish citizens may have difficulty in locating a record of their birth and thus providing civil birth certificates.   The Department will consider this on a case by case basis where it arises in a passport application.  However, such consideration must be mindful of the Department&rsquo;s clear statutory obligation under the Passports Act, 2008 to satisfy itself as to the identity of each passport applicant.</P>
        <P>The case of the person in question is currently the subject of legal proceedings and as such it would not be appropriate to make any comment on the matter.</P>

        <P>None of the various investigations into allegations of extraordinary rendition, including those carried out by the Council of Europe, have revealed any evidence that rendition through Irish airports has occurred, nor is there any new information or allegation linking Irish airports to acts of extraordinary rendition.</P>
        <P>Specific and unique assurances have been sought, and have been received, from the US authorities that no such prisoners had been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be without our express permission. The Government has no reason to call into question the value of the assurances received at a high level from the US authorities in this matter.</P>

	<P>The matter raised by the Deputy appears to concern a tax refund issue related to a property transaction in Portugal.  The Deputy will be aware that the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade concerning private property transactions by Irish nationals abroad is limited and that redress in such cases, including on taxation issues, should be sought through the relevant legal system.  The Embassy of Ireland in Lisbon can provide a list of English-speaking lawyers to the individuals concerned.  However, I understand that they have already sought independent legal advice.  The Embassy is happy to discuss any further concerns that the individuals may have. </P>

	<P>External professional services are procured by the Department only where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of Irish Aid (Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance programme), where an independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required.  Given the overall scale of the Irish Aid Programme, this level of monitoring, review and evaluation is both prudent and proportionate.   My Department does not use the services of professionals who operate on the basis of agreed fee scales or fees which are set by statute or regulation. </P>
        <P>These services are procured on foot of competitive tendering which is designed to achieve the best value for money from the market.  Services procured in this manner do not allow for post-hoc unilateral reduction of fees by my Department, as this could expose the State to the risk of litigation for breach of contract.</P>
        <P>On the basis of 2010 expenditure, a further reduction in fees of 25%, if achieved through future tendering, would equate to savings of &euro;350,000.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU/IMF Programme provides for a 1% increase in the standard VAT rate to 22% with effect from January 2013, and a further 1% increase in the standard VAT rate to 23% with effect from January 2014.  The Programme for Government continues this VAT policy by limiting the top rate of VAT to 23%, but does not specify the timeframe for this increase.  The level and timeframe of any increases in the standard VAT rate will be determined in the context of the annual Budget cycle.  In recent years, the trend among EU Member States has been to increase VAT rates as a means of covering the budgetary shortfall generated by the economic downturn.  Sixteen of the 27 EU Member States have increased their VAT rates over the last 3 years, so that the EU average standard VAT rate now stands at 20.7%.  Nine Member States have a higher standard VAT rate than Ireland <Col N="113"/>with 20 of the 27 EU Member States having a standard VAT rate of 20% or higher.  VAT increases continue to be considered, as the recent announcement by the Italian parliament suggests.  In this context, any increase in Ireland&rsquo;s standard VAT rate is not out of place.  </P>
        <P>A number of studies into cross-border shopping have been undertaken in the last few years to determine the level of cross-border shopping and how much this affects Exchequer revenue.  The Report on the Implications of Cross Border Shopping, which was undertaken on behalf of the Minister for Finance by the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office, was published in March 2009.  This was followed on 4 December 2009 by the results of a survey of cross-border shopping as part of the CSO Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) Quarter 2, 2009.  Finally, on 12 November 2010, the QNHS cross-border shopping survey for Quarter 2, 2010 was released.</P>
        <P>The statistics in the QHNS Reports were broadly in line with the results of the March 2009 Report on the Implications of Cross Border Shopping, which noted that the main causes of price differentials between goods in Northern Ireland and the Republic were operating costs, profit margin (mark-up), taxes and a significant depreciation of Sterling against the Euro.  While variations in the VAT rates widened some price differentials, their impact remained small compared to the size of the change in the exchange rate.</P>
        <P>The differential between the standard VAT rates in both jurisdictions reduced from 6.5 percentage points in 2009 to just 1 percentage point since the start of this year.  Any increase in this differential due to VAT increases in Ireland is however likely to be offset by the relative strengthening of Sterling against the Euro since 2009, providing less incentive for people to shop outside the State.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 48 together. </P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the issue or renewal of public house licences. A licence may only be issued when the appropriate certificate has been issued by a District Court. The licensing year runs from the 1st October to the 30th September.</P>
        <P>The most recent period for which statistics are available is 2009/2010 when 914 licences were not renewed.  (By way of comparison, the equivalent figure for 2008/2009 was 893).  The most common reasons for non-renewal include difficulties in obtaining tax clearance, cessation of trading, court procedures pending and change of entity (sale of licence to new premises and/or entity).</P><Col N="114"/>
        <P>If a public house licence is not renewed, a range of targeted compliance interventions are initiated by Revenue, up to and including prosecution, to ensure that renewal of the licence takes place at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that they have the necessary resources to effectively carry out their role in relation to non-renewal of public house licences.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also have a key role in ensuring compliance by publicans with the licensing laws.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is satisfied that sufficient resources are available to the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce the legislation in question.  The Commissioner is responsible for operational policing matters, including the allocation of Garda resources.  The current strength of the Force is 14,162 and all attested members of the Force have enforcement powers in relation to the licensing laws.</P>
        <P>As regards to NAMA, the Revenue Commissioners do not distinguish between licensed premises that have been specifically brought under the control of NAMA and licensed premises that are under the control of any other persons for the purposes of deciding eligibility for the issue of a licence.  Accordingly, where any NAMA-controlled entity applies for a licence, the same conditions apply as regards a valid tax clearance certificate as would be the case in any other instance where a licence is sought.  The Revenue Commissioners do not hold specific information that would identify the number of NAMA-controlled entities, to whom they have issued licences.</P>

	<P>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the VAT Directive Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive.  I understand that the major sectors within the Irish craft industry are pottery, glass, jewellery, textiles and furniture.  Annex III does not provide for a reduced rate of VAT to be applied to these goods, which are consequentially subject to the standard VAT rate of 21%.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government sets out the Government&rsquo;s position with regard to the credit union sector.  The Government recognises the importance of credit unions as a volunteer cooperative movement and the distinction between them and other financial institutions.  The Government has established the Commission on Credit Unions to review the future of the movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for it.  This will take into account its not-for-profit mandate, its volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors&rsquo; savings and financial stability.  The Commission has met on eight occasions since the end of June and will be providing me, as Minister for Finance, with its interim report by the end of September.  </P>
        <P>While the work of the Commission on Credit Unions is ongoing, and its interim and final reports will inform Government policy, it should not prevent or delay regulatory action where it is needed in the meantime.  Under the Credit Union Act 1997, the Registrar of Credit Unions, as part of the Central Bank, has an independent role in the regulation of credit unions.  From time to time, the Registrar is required to act to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.  Such actions are within the Registrar&rsquo;s independent statutory mandate and are a necessary part of an effective regulatory regime.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Consumer issues relating to insurance matters are covered by the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  The Central Bank has informed me that there are life assurance products for which the benefits and premiums can vary over the life of the product.  These are called &lsquo;Unit Linked Whole of Life Policies&rsquo;.  Each life protection policy is intended to pay out a sum of money to the beneficiary in the event of death of the insured person.  Premiums are not guaranteed to remain constant throughout the life cover protection period. Premiums that are paid are used to purchase units in a unit-linked fund, which in turn pays for the life cover protection.    </P>
        <P Just="Left">The performance of the fund is linked to fluctuations in the stock markets and, therefore, if the fund increases, the value of units held by the consumer increases.  Conversely, if the fund underperforms, then the consumer&rsquo;s share of units in the fund decreases. As the consumer gets older the cost of the life cover protection will become more expensive and therefore more units will have to be used if the same level of life cover is to be maintained.  To avoid the possibility of policy funds not having sufficient value to pay for the life cover, life companies are supposed to carry out periodic reviews of a policyholder&rsquo;s fund to ensure that sufficient units are maintained in the fund to pay for continued life cover protection.  This is governed by the terms of the policy rather than by any statutory obligation.  Generally, a periodic review will take place 10 years after the policy&rsquo;s inception and usually at intervals of 5 years thereafter.</P>
        <P>At the periodic reviews, life companies usually offer the policyholder a choice of:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />paying a greater premium in order to maintain the same level of life cover, or</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />reducing the life cover protection in order to maintain the static level of premium.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Central Bank expects that entities, regulated by it, ensure that the key issues, specific to &lsquo;Unit Linked Whole of Life Policies&rsquo; such as the periodic review feature and the non-guaranteed nature of the premiums are highlighted by their sales staff at the point of sale.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Central Bank has advised me that they wrote to all mortgage lenders to ascertain whether they were offering, or intended to offer, a mortgage product that would allow home owners to sell their existing home and transfer the negative equity portion of the original loan to the new loan.  The Central Bank was concerned as to whether such a product was in the long term interest of consumers as it could lead to indebtedness at a time when there was no certainty over the direction of future property values.  In addition, consumers would be moving to a new product and, consequently, those on tracker mortgages would move to fixed or standard variable rates which were generally higher than existing tracker rates. The higher rates would impact on the continued affordability of such mortgages and there would also be an increase in the loan to value ratios of many mortgages.   </P>
        <P>In response to the Central Bank&rsquo;s letter, only a small number of mortgage lenders said that they would consider offering such a facility, but it would be on an exceptional basis, would only be considered following an approach from an existing customer and would be subject to strict criteria in relation to debt service ratio, net disposable income, loan to value ratios, income multiples, credit history, transparency and suitability.</P>
        <P>A trial period commenced in mid-2011 and is due to be assessed by the Central Bank and the institutions involved before the end of the year.  Any institution offering such a facility may only do so in accordance with criteria agreed in advance with the Central Bank and subject to a trial period.  Consequently any arrangement that might be agreed with a customer would have to be in the context of the parameters set out above and not as a result of the introduction of a negative equity type product.</P>

As with all new income tax measures, the first year yield is expected to be significantly below the full-year yield for a number of reasons including the fact that a portion of the tax collected in the year in which a measure is introduced relates to earnings in the previous year.</P>
        <P>On the basis of the forecasts set out in the Budget the cost to the Exchequer of abolishing the universal social charge would be of the order of 4 billion in terms of the 2012 projection.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together. </P>
        <P>Pensions policy falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.  I have no role in relation to the regulation of pensions in Ireland, a role which is fulfilled by the Irish Pensions Board.  Any proposals for a compensation fund for pensions would be a matter for that Minister and the Pensions Board.  However, in the context of the questions tabled by the Deputy, I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to a number of issues.</P>
        <P>This investment firm was originally granted its authorisation to operate by the Financial Regulator in 1998.  As part of its supervisory function, the Central Bank has, since 2009, intensified its monitoring of the firm.  Recently the Bank became increasingly concerned about the firm.  The Bank successfully applied to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors to the firm and Custom House Capital consented to the appointment of the inspectors.  The application arose from the Bank&rsquo;s continuing concerns about the firm&rsquo;s management of its client holdings as well as the financial position of the firm.  A final report is expected to come before the High Court on 21st October 2011.</P>
        <P>The specific inspection activity currently underway is mandated by Regulation 166 of the European Communities (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2007.</P><Col N="121"/>
        <P>The steps taken by the Central Bank to closely monitor activities of the firm demonstrate the active and urgent efforts being made to ensure the orderly oversight of the firm and the protection of investors.</P>
        <P>I understand the process of inspection necessitates temporary and urgent restrictions on the firm&rsquo;s activities while the Central Bank attempts to investigate the issues with the firm. Regrettably, this has resulted in the temporary freezing of funds.  However, the restrictions are deemed necessary by the Central Bank, acting independently to ensure the protection of all clients&rsquo; holdings in this firm.</P>

	<P>The gradual reduction from marginal to standard rate tax relief on pension contributions commencing in 2012 forms part of the fiscal consolidation measures in the agreement with the EU, IMF and the ECB over the period 2011 to 2014.  When introducing the temporary pension scheme levy to pay for the Jobs Initiative on 10 May last, I gave a commitment to examine the issue of reducing the tax relief on pension contributions to the standard rate.</P>
        <P>The Government is carrying out a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in order to provide it with a set of decision options to meet the overall fiscal consolidation objectives and re-align spending with the Programme for Government priorities.</P>
        <P>The Review is due to be completed by the end of this month.  The Government will then examine the findings and, in consultation with the EU, IMF and ECB, will introduce fiscally neutral changes to the detail of the EU /IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland while maintaining the overall commitment to fiscal consolidation.  I will examine the scope for any change to the proposed standard rating of tax relief on pension contributions in that context. </P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware the Quinn Group and Quinn family are substantially indebted to Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited (&lsquo;the bank&rsquo;) and by direct extension to the Irish taxpayer.  The bank is obliged to take whatever steps are necessary to protect the bank&rsquo;s Quinn-related assets/investments from a diminution of value and the bank&rsquo;s involvement in a joint venture to acquire the Quinn Insurance Company or in the appointment of a share receiver to the wider Quinn Group must be considered in this context.   The position is that the Quinn Insurance company was placed in administration on 29 March 2010 after concerns were raised by the Central Bank of Ireland about the firm&rsquo;s ability to meet its liabilities to its policyholders. Further, and quite separately, the bank has been instrumental in the appointment of a share receiver to the wider Quinn Group but has no direct involvement in the day to day running of the various companies in the Group.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Quinn Insurance company, the bank is involved in a joint venture with Liberty Mutual to acquire the company.  This involvement does not require the Bank to provide <Col N="122"/>cash towards the purchase price, instead it involves the bank procuring the release of legal guarantees held by the relevant banks and bondholders in return for a carried interest in the company.  This partial ownership approach is considered to be the best way to maximise the repayment of debt owed to the taxpayer.  The appointment of a share receiver to the wider Quinn Group does not involve the acquisition of those companies by the bank or indeed any additional funding of these operations.  The process of appointing a share receiver pursuant to relevant security documents entered into by Quinn related entities and persons with the bank is simply to protect the bank&rsquo;s interests.</P>
        <P>The bank is actively involved in a myriad of litigation with the Quinn family in five jurisdictions in order to stop attempts to dissipate valuable property assets pending resolution of the primary proceedings in Dublin early next year.</P>

The proposals submitted, will be examined in tandem with the normal process of reviewing and considering taxation measures and reliefs, in the context of the budgetary process.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 73 together.</P>
<P>The Deputy will recall that the previous Government in January 2010 set out a framework to the Oireachtas for investigation into the banking sector.  This investigation consisted of two distinct stages.  The preliminary reports published in June 2010 by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, on <i>The Irish Banking Crisis &mdash; Regulatory and Financial Stability Policy 2003-2008 </i>and the report by Messrs. Regling and Watson, <i>Preliminary report on the sources of Ireland&rsquo;s banking crisis</i>,  formed the first stage of this investigation.  </P>
        <P>The second stage consisted of a statutory Commission of Investigation.  The establishment of a Commission of Investigation into the Banking Sector in Ireland was approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 8 July 2010 and an Order formally establishing the Commission was made by the previous Government on 21 September 2010.  Mr Peter Nyberg was appointed as sole member of the Commission of Investigation on 22 September 2010.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference which were for the period 2003 to 5 January 2009 were in summary to examine:</P>
        <P LI="2">a) the main causes of the serious failure, within each of the covered institutions;</P>
        <P LI="2">b) the main reasons why Anglo Irish Bank Corporation and Irish Nationwide Building Society adopted and implemented business models, strategies and lending practices, which resulted in those institutions experiencing severe financial distress;</P>
        <P LI="2">c) whether external auditors of the covered institutions commented in their audit reports or other communications to the institutions concerned on the failures I referred to;</P>
        <P LI="2">d) the main causes for the failures, in the performance of the statutory roles and responsibilities of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and the relevance in that regard of any advices or directions given by the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Commission submitted its report <i>Misjudging Risk: Causes of the Systemic Banking Crisis in Ireland, Report of the Commission of Investigation into the Banking Sector in Ireland</i>   to me on 22 March 2011, in keeping with its remit to complete its Report within 6 months.</P>
        <P>As I said in my statement to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 20 April 2011, following the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s report, the report has identified the main causes of the banking crisis.  Together with the two preliminary reports they set out all the interlinked elements that, each in their own way, contributed to the financial crisis that we found ourselves in since 2007.   I also set out a number of steps the government is taking to implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 93 together.   </P><Col N="124"/>
        <P>The Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children.  Childcare is one of the biggest issues facing working parents today.  For this reason a number of support measures have been introduced. These include, (i) the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, (ii) the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides free childcare places to qualifying FAS and VEC trainees and (iii) the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school. In addition, generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave are provided, as well as child benefit payments.</P>
        <P>In order to assist with an increase in the supply of childcare places, an exemption from income tax for individuals who mind children in their own home is available. To avail of this scheme, the childminder concerned may not mind more than 3 children, excluding their own. The exemption is subject to a limit of &euro;15,000 per annum.</P>
        <P>I have no plans at present for any additional tax incentives in this area given the current fiscal position.</P>

	<P>I am not privy to the full details of the agreement to which the Deputy has referred and accordingly it would be inappropriate for me to comment on it.   Initial reports would suggest that any such agreement may provide for a one-off deduction from funds on deposit to settle past liabilities and a withholding tax from 2013 in place of the actual liability due in respect of investment income and capital gains. We have no plans at present to pursue a similar approach with the Swiss Authorities; however, we will keep the matter under review when the full details of the final ratified agreement are published.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Office of the Revenue Commissioners obtained High Court orders in December 2009 requiring clearing banks in the State to provide information to Revenue on details of transfers to and from the State involving a number of offshore jurisdictions including Switzerland.  The orders cover the 12 years to 31 December 2008 and include <Col N="125"/>electronic transfers as well as cheques and drafts either drawn in the State and sent offshore or drawn offshore and sent to the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Deferred Interest Scheme that was recommended by the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt which published its report late last year. Under this scheme, subject to certain criteria being satisfied, borrowers are allowed to pay at least 66% of their mortgage interest but less than 100%.  Payment of the balance may be deferred for up to five years. The Central Bank has advised me that a number of lenders have notified the Bank of their decision/intention to implement a Deferred Interest Scheme but with varying dates for its availability.    Since the publication of the Group&rsquo;s Report, the Central Bank has revised the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) to reflect many of the Group&rsquo;s recommendations, including recommendations relating to the introduction by all mortgage lenders, regulated by the Central Bank, of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).   </P>
        <P>Chapter 3 (33) of the CCMA provides that:</P>
        <P><i>&rsquo;A lender must explore all options for alternative repayment arrangements, when considering a MARP case, in order to determine which options are viable for each particular case. Such alternative repayment arrangements must include :</i></P>
        <P><i>a) an interest-only arrangement for a specified period;</i></P>
        <P><i>b) an arrangement to pay interest and part of the normal capital element for a specified period;</i></P>
        <P><i>c) deferring payment of all or part of the instalment repayment for a period;</i></P>
        <P><i>d) extending the term of the mortgage;</i></P>
        <P><i>e) changing the type of the mortgage, except in the case of tracker mortgages;</i></P>
        <P><i>f) capitalising the arrears and interest; and</i></P>
        <P><i>g) any voluntary scheme to which the lender has signed up e.g. Deferred Interest Scheme.&rsquo;</i></P>
        <P>In addition, Chapter 3 (47) of the CCMA provides that:</P>
        <P><i>&rsquo;Where a borrower co-operates with the lender, the lender must wait at least twelve months from the date the borrower is classified as a MARP case (i.e. day 31), before applying to the courts to commence legal action for repossession of a borrower&rsquo;s primary  residence.  The twelve month period commences on day 31 but does not include:</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>any time period during which the borrower is complying with the terms of any alternative repayment arrangement agreed with the lender;</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>any time period during which an appeal by the borrower is being processed by the lender&rsquo;s Appeals Board;</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>any time period during which the borrower can consider whether or not they wish to make an appeal on the decision of the  Mortgage  Lender&rsquo;s  Appeals Support Unit;</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>any time period during which a complaint against the lender regarding any aspect of this Code, is being processed by the Financial Services Ombudsman&rsquo;s office; and</i></P><Col N="126"/>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>for pre-arrears cases, the time period between the first contact by the borrower in relation to a pre-arrears situation and an alternative repayment arrangement being put in place.</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">A copy of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website:  <i>www.centralbank.ie</i></P>
        <P>The Government would urge all lenders to make available a Deferred Interest Scheme (DIS).  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the lenders which have implemented a scheme are Bank of Ireland, ICS Building Society, EBS, Haven Mortgages, Permanent TSB and Springboard Mortgages. The following have indicated their willingness to implement a scheme later this year &mdash; AIB, AIB Mortgage Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society and Start Mortgages.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Section 216C of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for an exemption from income tax for individuals who mind children in their own home. The individual may not mind more than 3 children, excluding their own. The exemption is subject to a limit of &euro;15,000 per annum.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are currently engaged in updating figures of the cost of tax reliefs for the tax year 2009 for inclusion in their next statistical report. This work is ongoing and not yet complete, but a tentative estimate of the cost in 2009 of the tax exemption for income arising from the provision of child-care services   is of the order of &euro;0.8 million in respect of approximately 470 claimants.</P>

	<P>There are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax depending on the variables that are used and it is difficult to determine a general or single reliable comparative measure of an effective tax rate.  In responding to questions in the House during the Summer, I mentioned that our effective rate of corporation tax was 11.9%.  This figure comes from a recent <i>Paying Taxes</i> study produced by the World Bank and PriceWaterhouseCoopers as part of an annual <i>Doing Business</i> report and includes a measurement of effective tax rates across 183 countries.  The effective tax rate is based on the tax obligations of a standardised company operating in each country of the study and using standard assumptions regarding exemptions, deductions and allowances.</P><Col N="127"/>
        <P Just="Left">Another recent study by the European Commission also indicates that Ireland has an effective corporate tax rate which is close to, or indeed higher than, the statutory 12.5% rate (because of the higher 25% tax rate that applies, generally, to non-trading profits).</P>
        <P Just="Left">These general findings are to be expected as Ireland&rsquo;s 12.5% corporation tax regime is transparent, does not discriminate based on company size or ownership and applies across a broad base.</P>
        <P>The effective rate of corporation tax paid will vary from company to company, of course, depending on the circumstances in each individual case.</P>

        <Quest> the savings made to the Exchequer if incorporated bodies were no longer allowed to claim losses against profits made in previous years. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The availability of relief for losses incurred in a business is a well-established feature of corporation tax, which is in recognition of the fact that a business cycle runs over several years and that it would be unbalanced to tax profits in one year and not allow losses in another. Under Irish tax legislation, a company incurring a trading loss in an accounting year can carry that loss back for offset against profits in the immediately preceding year. The carry back of a trading loss is limited to one accounting year back and there must be profits in that year for the provision to be of use to a company. A trading loss in an accounting year may also be carried forward for offset against trading profits of the same trade in subsequent years.   I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the potential saving to the Exchequer if future claims by incorporated bodies for losses to be offset against previous year&rsquo;s profits were to be disallowed would depend on the amounts of losses incurred by companies and the extent to which there are profits in the preceding accounting year against which such losses would otherwise be available for set-off.  It is not possible to anticipate what these would be.</P>
        <P>By way of illustrating this latter point, data from corporation tax returns for 2008 and 2009 (the latest years available) show that for 2008 the amount of trading losses carried back for offset against profits earned in a previous year was &euro;1,573m while the comparable figure for 2009 was a much lower figure of  &euro;868m. The actual saving to the Exchequer in respect of those years under the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal would depend on the tax rate applicable to the profits of the companies concerned but assuming that this was the standard 12.5% rate, the savings under the proposal would have amounted to about &euro;200m in 2008 and about &euro;100m in 2009. The Deputy should note, however, that the estimated savings for 2008 and 2009 are not necessarily indicative of what the savings might be for future years. Also, since under the proposal companies could continue to carry forward losses for offset against future profits, the estimated Exchequer savings outlined would be temporary in nature.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from increasing the Capital Acquisitions Tax rate by 10%, based on the expected outturn in 2011, could be in the region of &euro;110 million, assuming no change in the existing thresholds.  The additional full year yield from existing taxpayers from reducing the existing thresholds by 10% and applying the proposed rate of 35% to the additional amounts thus brought into charge is estimated at &euro;20 million.   Revenue do not receive information on gifts and inheritances which currently do not have to be declared <Col N="128"/>so it is not possible to estimate the potential yield if such benefits were brought into the tax net.   These estimates are based on transactions recorded in 2010, the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that these estimates are based upon an assumption that there would be no behavioural impact from these changes, which could lead to a less than expected impact on Exchequer yield.  In addition, the realization of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets, which are currently occurring in the economy.</P>

	<P>The total amount of professional fees paid by my Department in 2010 was &euro;5,393,503.  If a reduction of 25% was applied across the board then potential savings of &euro;1,348,376 could have been achieved.  In relation to expenditure on professional fees by agencies under the aegis of my Department the following outlines the position of each:&mdash;</P>
        <P><i>Revenue</i></P>
        <P>The total amount of professional fees paid in 2010 was &euro;11,195,000.  Accordingly, a 25% reduction would save &euro;2,798,750 (this figure is net of VAT.)</P>
        <P><i>Appeals Commissioners</i></P>
        <P>In 2010 the Appeals Commissioners did not incur any professional fees.</P>
        <P><i>National Treasury Management Agency</i></P>
        <P>Based on the 2010 legal and consultancy expenditure for the NTMA the potential savings of a 25% reduction would be &euro;570,000.</P>
        <P><i>Office of the Comptroller &amp; Auditor General</i></P>
        <P>The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General spent &euro;461,000 on professional fees in 2010, including legal fees, contract audit services, internal audit and external audit.  A 25% reduction in expenditure on professional fees would have led to savings of &euro;115,250 in the year.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should be aware that the figures include fees some of which are determined by legislation, regulation, contract etc and a reduction of these fees may require agreement of the <Col N="129"/>parties concerned.  The Deputy should also note that included in the figures supplied by my Department, are payments for professional fees which from 2011 have transferred to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>

	<P>It is assumed that the threshold for the proposed new tax band mentioned by the Deputy would not alter the existing standard rate band structure applying to single and widowed persons, to lone parents and married couples.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2012 incomes, of the introduction of a new 49% rate would be of the order of &euro;436 million.</P>
        <P>However, given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how in practice such a new rate could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.</P>
        <P>This figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2009, adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2012.  It is therefore provisional.</P>
        <P>The current basis of cost also reflects a revision of the cost basis that was used to underpin my reply of 19 July last to a question about a 48% rate which was tabled by the Deputy under Parliamentary Question reference 21030/11.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers for 2009, the latest year available, the amount of tax foregone by allowing a deduction for interest on borrowings to be offset against all rental income assessable under Case V, Schedule D for both residential and commercial property is estimated at &euro;745 million.  This is an update of an estimate of &euro;730 million provided on 21 July last in my reply to Parliamentary Question number 22016/11. </P>
        <P>On this basis, the full year yield to the Exchequer from abolishing this relief would be of the same order.  The estimated 2009 cost is based on assuming that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and the figure provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers.  This figure is subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return form 12 is not captured in the Revenue computer system.  However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete an income tax return form 11. This return is the source of the figure provided in this reply.</P>

	<P>In recognition of the fact that groups of companies generally comprise a single economic entity, the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the allowance of trading losses of a group company in an accounting period against profits of another group company in the corresponding accounting period.  Essentially, two companies are members of a group of companies if one company is a 75% subsidiary of the other or both are 75% subsidiaries of a third company&mdash; and in many instances there will be more than 75% common ownership throughout the group.  It is important to note that only current year trading losses may be surrendered between companies under the group relief provisions.  As regards holding companies, the position generally is that such companies hold shares in subsidiaries, do not carry on a trade and do not, therefore, incur trading losses.  In many instances, for commercial reasons, group borrowings may be controlled by the holding company.  Where this is the case, similar to the treatment of losses, under the group relief provisions the interest paid by the holding company may be surrendered to subsidiaries for deduction against their profits.</P>
        <P>Group relief is a standard feature of corporation tax codes and similar relief is available in most other countries.  The availability of such relief is an important facility for Irish and multinational enterprises which conduct their business operations within a group of companies.  The absence of a group relief provision would put Ireland at a significant competitive disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other jurisdictions.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information furnished on corporation tax returns does not generally require the yield from a particular sector or sub-sector of economic activity to be identified. In these circumstances the amount of tax revenues collected in respect of the activities specified in the question cannot be readily identified from the overall corporation tax yield. There is, therefore, no statistical basis on which the Exchequer impact of the changes mentioned in the question could be estimated.  I am further informed by Revenue that even if the basic information was available the obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to observe confidentiality for taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers might preclude them from disclosing it.</P>
        <P>Section 45 Finance Act 2008 introduced new tax provisions in relation to profits derived from petroleum exploration and production activities.   A new tax called a &ldquo;profit resource rent tax&rdquo; will apply at rates of 5%, 10% or 15% in addition to the corporation tax rate of 25% that currently applies to profits from petroleum activities.  It will apply when profits exceed certain defined levels.  This will be worked out by a formula that relates the profits from a petroleum field to the capital investment in the field. The new tax provisions give effect to the Government Decision of 30 July 2007 that a new regime would apply in relation to petroleum profits from discoveries made from 2007 onwards.</P>

        <Quest> if he will clarify the new arrangements in place to qualify for the vehicle registration tax exemption for disabled passengers in view of the fact there has been some confusion resulting in genuine cases being unable to avail of this exemption; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there have been no changes in the qualifying criteria for the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) exemption for disabled passengers. The scheme is governed by the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers [Tax Concessions] Regulations 1994 (S.I. No. 353 of 1994).  The Scheme is open to persons who meet the specified medical criteria and have obtained a Primary Medical Certificate to that effect.</P>
        <P>A disabled person can apply for relief either as a driver or a passenger.  The vehicle must be suitably adapted for the transportation of the disabled person and must be used for that purpose. In the case of passengers, VRT relief is restricted to a vehicle which has an engine size up to 4,000 cc and the net cost of the adaptations must be not less than 10% of the tax exclusive cost of the vehicle.  The vehicle must be purchased outright by the applicant (this includes vehicles purchased on hire-purchase, but excludes vehicles which have been purchased by way of a leasing arrangement). The vehicle must not be destined/used for any commercial purpose following the granting of relief, e.g. taxi/hackney, courier service.</P>
        <P>A family member of a person with a disability who purchases a vehicle for the transport of that person as a passenger qualifies, provided the person<b> </b>  resides with and is responsible for the transport of the disabled passenger. In exceptional circumstances, the condition concerning residency may be waived.  In this regard, evidence is sought that the qualifying vehicle is used on a regular basis for the transport of the disabled person. Each case is evaluated on an individual basis and, where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that a qualifying disabled person is transported on a regular basis, the relief is granted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would consider the Deputy&rsquo;s question to be principally a matter for the Minister for Social Protection but tax legislation and rules are also relevant to the issue.  Generally speaking, once an occupational pension scheme member has at least two years qualifying service for pension purposes, that member is entitled under the Pensions Acts to preserved pension benefits on leaving employment and does not get a refund of contributions made to the scheme.   The rationale for giving various tax reliefs to pension savings schemes in the first place is to encourage and promote savings over the long term in order that individuals will have an adequate replacement income in old age. Emerging demographic indicators point to increasing numbers of people living longer and healthier lives with more of their lives spent in retirement than previously. I am conscious of the case being made for pre-retirement access to pension funds but there is also a strong case for maintaining the ring-fencing of pension savings to ensure that individuals have an adequate post-retirement income. This is not a simple matter and while I am open to examining it further, in conjunction with the Minister for Social Protection, it would require very careful consideration before any changes could be made to the current arrangements.    </P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that the measure to which the Deputy refers is the Domicile Levy which was announced in Budget 2010 and introduced in Finance Act 2010.  The Domicile Levy of &euro;200,000 is charged on an individual who is Irish-domiciled and an Irish citizen whose world-wide income exceeds &euro;1m, whose Irish-located property is greater than &euro;5m, and whose liability to Irish income tax was less than &euro;200,000.</P>
        <P>The Levy will be charged for 2010 and subsequent years, but the payment for each year can be made at any time up to 31 October in the year following the valuation date, which is 31 December of each year.  The first valuation date for the Domicile Levy will be 31 December 2010 and the tax return and payment of the Levy for 2010 will not be due until 31 October 2011.  The figure will, therefore, not be available until after that date.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Revenue Commissioners are charging a 14% interest rate on small companies in arrears; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Revenue Commissioners are charged with responsibility for the timely collection and recovery of taxes and duties due to the Exchequer.  Revenue has a clear focus on making sure that every person and business complies with his or her responsibilities by paying the right amount and on time. That is an appropriate and correct focus for Revenue, which I fully endorse. In that context, where businesses or individuals fail to meet their tax payment obligations on time, then they are liable to interest, as provided for by the Oireachtas in the Taxes Acts. Interest on late payment of tax operates not only as a compensation for the Exchequer for the late payment of monies due to it but also as an essential support for timely voluntary compliance by ensuring a level playing field between those who meet their obligations on time and those who pay late or who may attempt not to pay at all.   The Finance Act 2009 provided for a reduction from 1 July 2009 of the rate of interest applied to late payment of tax. In the case of Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Capital Acquisition Tax, and Stamp Duty, the daily rate of interest was reduced from 0.0273% to 0.0219%, in effect an annual equivalent drop from 10 % to 8%. In the case of other taxes and duties i.e. Value Added Tax, PAYE/PRSI the daily rate was reduced from 0.0322 to 0.0274%, in effect an annual equivalent drop from 12% to 10%.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that through 2009 and 2010, there were few inflationary pressures. Indeed, price levels fell, with the CPI declining by 4.5% in 2009 and 1% in 2010, and the HICP falling by 1.7% and 1.6% respectively.  In the latter months of 2010 and to date in 2011, the main drivers of inflation have been insurance premium hikes and increases in the price of commodities. The CPI has also been affected by increases in mortgage rates.</P>
        <P>In August 2011, the annual rate of increase in the CPI was 2.2% and 1.0% in the HICP. This rate of inflation is the lowest in Europe meaning prices in general here are growing at a slower rate than in any other European country.</P>
        <P>Specifically, I would like to address Mr. Gibson&rsquo;s (Mr. Gibson of Dublin 13 was in touch with Deputy Flanagan on this matter) concerns regarding Government policy to improve the cost of living and escalating food and petrol prices.</P>
        <P>The Government is keenly aware that people are under financial pressure in the current economic environment. To counter that, the Government is encouraging increased competition in the domestic areas of the economy. For example, the reduced VAT rate was introduced to lower prices for a range of services connected to the hospitality and tourism sectors.</P>
        <P>In relation to food prices, the latest CSO information for the grouping &lsquo;Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages&rsquo; shows that prices are equivalent here to mid-2007 levels and are over 7% lower than the peak seen in 2008.</P>
        <P>Petrol prices have increased substantially in recent months mainly related to increased oil prices on international markets so Government policy is limited in what it can do to alleviate price pressures in this regard.</P>
        <P>The overall picture remains one where muted domestic demand and considerable spare capacity in the economy are expected to keep underlying Irish inflation in check for some time to come.  Therefore, modest price rises will assist in restoring our relative competitive position globally.</P>

	<P>Following the collapse of Home Payments Ltd (HPL) last month, the Central Bank commenced an investigation into the matter. This investigation is on-going and I await the final report from the Bank. However, I can confirm that the Central Bank has informed me that, as HPL was not authorised or licensed by the Bank, clients are not eligible for a compensation scheme/deposit protection scheme and, in addition, clients of HPL do not have recourse to the Financial Services Ombudsman. Since the collapse, the Central Bank has worked with the National Consumer Agency and with  regulatory and industry bodies to provide assistance to customers of HPL who are at a financial loss.  The Bank has also informed me that it is undertaking a review of all firms in the State which appear to offer customers debt advice and/or debt management type services. </P>
        <P>The Government is committed to having in place an effective regulatory/supervisory system for those firms providing a household budgeting and bill payment service, a debt management service and/or a debt advice service. The findings of the investigations by the Central Bank into HPL and into the other firms will inform what regulatory/supervisory system should be put in place for firms providing these services &mdash; whether provided separately or bundled together &mdash; or, alternatively, what amendments to the current regulatory/supervisory framework may be required.</P>

	<P>The Stamp Duty rate on residential property transfers was reduced in Budget 2011 while some reliefs and exemptions were abolished.  This broadened the tax base while lowering the rate of Stamp Duty for most purchasers.  All purchases of residential property valued under &euro;1 million in value are now only liable for stamp duty at 1%, with any balance over &euro;1 million liable at 2%.  Even where a transfer was previously relieved or exempted from Stamp Duty the overall transaction cost is now lower than in recent years.   Stamp Duty on property transfers is calculable by reference to the value of the property on the date of transfer, regardless of any mortgage or loan outstanding.  No account is taken of whether the property was previously transferred at a higher or lower value &mdash; to do so could lead to complications.  I have no plans at this time to make further changes to the residential Stamp Duty regime.</P>

	<P>The decision on whether or not to grant individual mortgages must remain a commercial decision for individual lending institutions. It is important that each lending institution is allowed to assess properly and independently the individual risks that it is considering accepting. Mortgage lending must be undertaken on a sustainable and prudential basis by financial institutions and conform fully with regulatory requirements both in relation to the financial institution itself and also the safeguarding of the consumer&rsquo;s interests.  However, if a consumer feels that he or she has been improperly treated, or that he or she has grounds for complaint for some other reason, then a complaint may be made directly to the financial institution concerned. If the consumer is not satisfied with the response received from the institution, there may be grounds to forward the complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO), who has statutory powers to investigate complaints against financial service providers. The FSO will only consider a case once the internal complaints procedure within the financial institution concerned has been followed.  </P>

	<P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to a type of Financial Transaction Tax (FTT).  The EU Commission stated in a Communication in October 2010 that it supported the idea of an FTT to help fund international challenges such as development at climate change.  However, the Commission has recently proposed the introduction of an FTT in Europe for the purpose of an &ldquo;own resource&rdquo; tax imposed centrally to fund the EU.  Ireland has traditionally opposed the concept of an EU-wide tax and believes that the financing of the EU Budget should continue to be mainly based on GNI. While we will examine any proposal, we would have serious concerns about its economic, budgetary and political impact.  </P>
        <P>There is no consensus as yet among European member states on this issue, and most Member States are awaiting the EU Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment of the various measures before deciding what stance to take.  There is a strong emerging view that the EU and other international groupings such as the IMF and G20 should move in tandem in a global manner to avoid the danger of financial sector business gravitating to areas where taxes are not levied on financial transactions.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Finance, I have no statutory role in the setting of interest rates charged or paid by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank  has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. Each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors, such as cost of funds and commercial considerations, competition in the market, risk pricing and the impact on deposit rates.</P>
        <P>In the case of a customer experiencing financial difficulties in meeting his/her mortgage commitments or one who is concerned that he/she is in danger of getting into financial difficulties, mortgage lenders must comply with the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) which came into effect on 1 January 2011. The CCMA applies to the mortgage loan of a borrower which is secured by his or her primary residence. Primary Residence means a property which is:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />the residential property which the borrower occupies as his/her primary residence in this State, or</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />a residential property in this State which is the only residential property owned by the borrower.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Under the CCMA a lender must have a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process in place incorporating communication with borrowers, financial information, assessment, resolution and appeals. In exploring all options for alternative repayment arrangements lenders must consider, inter alia, deferred payment, term extension, interest and partial capital payments and interest only arrangements.</P>

	<P>Section 473 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides tax relief at the standard rate to individuals who pay for private rented accommodation that is used as their sole or main residence. The level of rent qualifying for rent relief depends on an individual&rsquo;s marital status and age.  In Budget 2011, it was announced that rent relief was being withdrawn on a phased basis. No new claimants were allowed from 7 December 2010 but existing claimants will continue to receive the relief, on a reducing basis, with a complete cessation of the relief from 2018.  </P>
        <P>Any person who was paying rent under a tenancy on 7 December 2010 qualifies for rent relief. A subsequent change from one property to another or from one lease to another does not affect their entitlement to rent credit on a reducing basis.</P>

	<P>The legal basis for the Deposit Guarantee Scheme in Ireland is set out in the European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Regulations 1995 (S.I. No. 168 of 1995) as amended.  These Regulations implement the European Union Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (Directive 94/19/EC) as amended.  Under the Regulations, a depositor with a deposit of up to &euro;100,000 will be covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme where a compensation event occurs in a credit institution.  A compensation event occurs if-</P><Col N="141"/>
        <P>(a)      the Central Bank of Ireland has determined that, for the time being, the credit institution appears to be unable, for reasons directly related to its financial circumstances, to repay a deposit or deposits and to have no current prospect of being able to do so,</P>
        <P>(b)      a court has appointed a liquidator or examiner of the credit institution, or</P>
        <P>(c)       a judicial authority has made, for reasons directly related to the credit institution&rsquo;s financial circumstances, any other ruling that has the effect of suspending depositors&rsquo; ability to make claims against it.</P>
        <P>The Scheme covers 100% of deposits held in any credit institution authorised in Ireland (including credit unions) up to a maximum of &euro;100,000 per qualifying depositor per institution and is administered by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Generally, the Scheme covers deposits held in current accounts, demand deposit accounts and term deposit accounts with credit institutions.</P>
        <P>The basic intention behind such a scheme is to reassure depositors that there is a safety net that will enable them to recover all, or at least most, of their savings in the event of a failure of a credit institution.  This reassurance, in turn, helps to contribute to the stability of the financial system.  For more information on the various guarantees available to depositors for amounts above &euro;100,000, please see:   <i>http://www.itsyourmoney.ie/index.jsp?n=757&amp;p=125</i></P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland, as with other countries, has experienced an increase in the cost of petrol and auto-diesel. The increase in fuel prices is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions. However, the price of oil has decreased somewhat relative to highs earlier in the year.   The excise rates (including the carbon charge) in Ireland on motor fuels are 57.6 cent on a litre of petrol and 46.6 cent on a litre of auto-diesel. Ireland&rsquo;s excise rates are the ninth and third highest in the EU27 for petrol and auto-diesel respectively. However, our rates remain lower than many of our main trading partners and significantly lower than our nearest neighbour the UK.</P>
        <P>The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel. For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system. VAT on petrol can not be deducted/reclaimed.</P>
        <P>There are no plans for temporary taxation adjustments, as to do so, could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer. The issue of rising fuel prices was recently briefly discussed by EU Finance Ministers at an ECOFIN meeting and they reconfirmed the approach taken in 2005 and again in 2008, when oil prices were very high, which endorsed a coordinated approach towards not making distortionary fiscal adjustments.</P>

	<P>The most recent figures for the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) published by the NPRF Commission are for the second quarter of 2011. These showed that the Fund was valued at &euro;20.8 billion at end-June 2011, made up of &euro;15.5 billion in the Directed Portfolio (the part of the Fund which is managed by the Commission on foot of directions from the Minister for Finance) and &euro;5.3 billion in the Discretionary Portfolio, the investment of which remains the Commission&rsquo;s responsibility.</P>
        <P>The &euro;15.5 billion in the Directed Portfolio comprised &euro;5.5 billion in bank investments &mdash; the value of investments in Bank of Ireland and AIB made at the direction of the Minister in 2009 and 2010 &mdash; and a further &euro;10 billion set aside at the direction  of the Minister as part of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland.  The &euro;10 billion was subsequently used in July 2011 to recapitalise Bank of Ireland and AIB.</P>
        <P>The value of the Discretionary Portfolio at end-June 2011 was &euro;5.3 billion, which can be broken down as set out in the table below (figures may not add due to rounding). The Discretionary Portfolio has not been affected since that date by bank recapitalisation investments.</P>

The service of vehicle testing, that entails an inspection of a vehicle rather than its repair or maintenance, is liable to VAT at the standard rate of 21% in accordance with section 46(1)(a) of the VAT Consolidation Act. There is no provision under the EU VAT Directive that would allow for a reduced VAT rate to apply to testing services.</P>

	<P>Following the collapse of Home Payments Ltd (HPL) last month, the Central Bank commenced an investigation into the matter. This investigation is on-going and I await the final report from the Bank. However, I can confirm that the Central Bank has informed me that, as HPL was not authorised or licensed by the Bank, clients are not eligible for a compensation scheme/deposit protection scheme and, in addition, clients of HPL do not have recourse to the Financial Services Ombudsman. Since the collapse, the Central Bank has worked with the National Consumer Agency and with  regulatory and industry bodies to provide assistance to customers of HPL who are at a financial loss.  The Bank has also informed me that it is undertaking a review of all firms in the State which appear to offer customers debt advice and/or debt management type services. </P>
        <P>The Government is committed to having in place an effective regulatory/supervisory system for those firms providing a household budgeting and bill payment service, a debt management service and/or a debt advice service. The findings of the investigations by the Central Bank into HPL and into the other firms will inform what regulatory/supervisory system should be put in place for firms providing these services &mdash; whether provided separately or bundled together &mdash; or, alternatively, what amendments to the current regulatory/supervisory framework may be required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is proposing that the amount of the pension levy passed on to individuals over the period of the levy should be available to them as a credit against their future tax liabilities.   The moneys raised from the pension fund levy will be used to pay for the reductions in VAT, PRSI and the air travel tax as well as for the additional expenditure measures announced in the Jobs Initiative in May last. These and the other various measures in the Initiative represent the first steps by this Government towards improving the competitiveness of important sectors of the economy and facilitating the return to work of people currently unemployed.</P>
        <P>Given our commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support and the current difficulties in the public finances, the Jobs Initiative must be funded on a cost neutral basis. Since the proceeds of the levy are already committed in the manner I&rsquo;ve described, a commitment to allow the levy to also be used as a tax credit against future tax liabilities would mean that the Jobs Initiative would not be cost neutral. I cannot therefore agree to the proposal.</P>

	<P>The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code requires entities regulated by the Central Bank to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers. Regulated entities must not recklessly, negligently or deliberately mislead a customer as to the real or perceived advantages or disadvantages of any product or service. In accordance with common rule 12 of the Consumer Protection Code, regulated entities have to ensure that all relevant information, and in particular key information, is provided to a consumer in a clear manner. The operation of any agreement between a regulated entity and a consumer must be in accordance with the terms and conditions applying to that agreement. The Central Bank does not investigate individual complaints but if a consumer is not satisfied with the service he or she has received, he or she is entitled to make a complaint by writing directly to the firm concerned. If he or she is not happy with the response received from the regulated entity he or she is entitled to refer the complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman who has statutory powers to investigate complaints against financial service providers.</P>
<P>In the case of a customer experiencing financial difficulties in meeting mortgage commitments or one who is concerned that he/she is in danger of getting into financial difficulties, mortgage lenders must comply with the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) which came into effect on 1 January 2011. The CCMA applies to the mortgage loan of a borrower which is secured by his or her primary residence, which is defined as a property which is the residential property which the borrower occupies as his or her primary residence in this State, or a residential property in this State which is the only residential property owned by the borrower. Under the CCMA, a lender must have a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process in place incorporating communication with borrowers, financial information, assessment, resolution and appeals. In exploring all options for alternative repayment arrangements lenders must consider, <i>inter alia</i>, deferred payment, term extension, interest and partial capital payments and interest only arrangements. The CCMA states that lenders   &ldquo;must not require the borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type, as part of any alternative arrangement offered to the borrower&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The Central Bank&rsquo;s Quarterly Financial Accounts data show that households had outstanding loans amounting to &euro;184.9 billion in the first quarter of the year, representing 147 per cent of forecast GNP for 2011. The stock of household loans has declined by &euro;18 billion or 9 per cent since peaking in the final quarter of 2008.   The same data source reveals that non financial corporations had outstanding loans of &euro;264 billion in the first quarter of the year, or 210 per cent of forecast GNP. The stock of such loans has contracted by &euro;62.5 billion or 19 per cent since peaking in the final months of 2009.</P>
        <P>Of course the data also show that households and non financial corporations have significant assets as well as liabilities. In the case of households, for example, net financial wealth &mdash; the difference between assets and liabilities &mdash; was a positive &euro;105 billion (this figure does not include housing assets). This figure has increased by 80 per cent since the first quarter of 2009.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, under the previous Government, some &euro;43.6 billion was injected into the Irish banks by the end of 2010.  The Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR), which was carried out by the Central Bank and reported in March 2011, identified an additional capital requirement of &euro;24 billion.  This means that the expected total capital needs in March 2011 amounted to &euro;70.3 billion.   While the Government is committed to ensuring that the banks would be fully capitalised up that level, the Government has instigated processes which have reduced and will further reduce the cost to the State.  Direct contributions were sought from subordinated debt holders through burden sharing/liability management exercises (LME) and where possible, by seeking private sector investors.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Prior to the PCAR, burden sharing with subordinated bondholders raised c. &euro;9.7 billion of core tier 1 capital.  Since the PCAR announcement, burden sharing with bondholders has realised an additional c. &euro;5 billion.  AIB/EBS completed their LME in July resulting in a total capital gain of &euro;2.15 billion.  Bank of Ireland announced on 8 July that it generated circa. &euro;2 billion from LME.  Further burden sharing with outstanding subordinated bondholders is expected to raise additional equity capital.  Irish Life and Permanent completed their LME on 24 August with a &euro;1bn gain from &euro;1.2bn of subordinated debt.  Burden sharing with outstanding subordinated bondholders is expected to raise additional equity capital.  Irish Life and Permanent completed their LME on 24 August with a &euro;1bn gain from &euro;1.2bn of subordinated debt.</P>
        <P>Under the PCAR, Bank of Ireland required an additional &euro;5.2bn of capital. In July 2011, private investors agreed to an investment of up to &euro;1.123 billion in Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Tier 1 capital.  This transaction, in addition to other equity participation from existing shareholders/bondholders of some &euro;600m, ensured that the State&rsquo;s commitment was significantly reduced while retaining a significant equity shareholding in the banks.</P><Col N="147"/>
        <P>The commitment from the Irish State is lower than initially expected as a result of the LME exercises with subordinated bondholders conducted since 31st March 2011 and private sector investment in Bank of Ireland.    Out of the total identified capital of &euro;70.3 billion, at the end of July actual capital investment was circa &euro;63 billion.  There will be further stress tests in 2012 by the Central Bank of Ireland through a PCAR and also by the European Banking Authority.  I believe that the Irish banks will have sufficient capital to meet those stress tests.</P>
        <P>Through the processes I have referred to above, the Government has ensured that the recapitalisation burden has not fallen exclusively on the Irish taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I have forwarded for the Deputy&rsquo;s attention a copy of my presentation to the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 1st September 2011 on progress made in restructuring of the banking sector.</P>

	<P>With the approval of the Government and subject to confirmation by the Oireachtas, I signed the Amendment to the EFSF Framework Agreement on behalf of Ireland on 8th September 2011.  The Amendment agreement provides for the implementation of the measures announced by the Heads of State or Government on 21 July last.  These include increasing the flexibility of the EFSF in the euro area, to allow it to act on a precautionary basis, to finance the recapitalization of banks through loans to Governments and to intervene in primary and secondary markets on the basis of ECB analysis.  The Amendment agreement will facilitate the reduction in the interest rate charged on loans to Ireland but the actual reduction will be given effect in the EFSF Loan Agreement with Ireland.   It should also be noted that the Amendment I signed on 8 September 2011 incorporates an earlier Amendment agreement of 30 June 2011 which had not yet been ratified by most euro area Member States, including Ireland.  The primary purpose of the earlier amendment was to increase the effective lending capacity of the EFSF to &euro;440 billion.  This is being accomplished by an increase in the level of over-guarantee to 165% for each of the guarantor Member States.  Although Ireland&rsquo;s guarantee ceiling increases, it is notional in our case because we have stepped out and this is noted in the Amendment agreement.</P>
        <P>Legislation to ratify the Amendment to the EFSF Framework Agreement is being prepared for the consideration of the Oireachtas.  The Bill will also provide for the amendment of the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010 to provide for the amendment of the (Greek) Loan Facility Agreement dated 14 June 2011.  It is proposed that the Bill be published later this week and brought before the D&aacute;il for debate next week.</P>

A comprehensive programme of bank recapitalisation and restructuring is currently underway following my statement on the future banking landscape in Ireland at the end of March last.  The essential detailed assessment and planning work to meet this objective will be accelerated once the Government&rsquo;s key objectives for the renewal of the banking system, which are ahead of schedule, have been completed. This assessment will include the strategic investment bank&rsquo;s relationship with the two pillar banks and the timeline for its establishment. </P>

	<P>I am informed by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) that no projections are made for mobile telephone usage, whether calls or texts.  The only basis for estimating the yield from a tax on text messages <Col N="149"/>is the figures for mobile telephone usage per quarter supplied by the companies to ComReg.  In the 12 months to end March 2011, the last 12 month period for which figures are available, over 12 billion SMS messages and over 43 million MMS messages were sent in Ireland, a total of over 12.192 billion messages.  At those usage rates, a levy of 2 cent on such messages could raise c. &euro;242 million per annum, which is in line with the figure indicated in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  However, this potential yield does not take account of any behavioural impact if a levy was directly imposed on customers or imposed on the mobile phone companies and passed on to customers.    Text messages are already subject to VAT at 21%.  While any additional revenue would be welcome in the current circumstances, the wider social and economic factors which militate against the introduction of a further levy on text messages must also be taken into account.  I am not aware of a similar tax anywhere else in the world.   Although there are no plans to introduce such a tax at this time, and I have had no contact with the mobile telephone companies on the matter, all potential taxation measures are kept under review.</P>

	<P>It was announced in last years Budget that the necessary arrangements are being made to ensure that bets placed on the internet by domestic punters are subject to the same level of betting duty as applies to high street betting shops. This will serve to broaden the tax base and increase betting duty receipts.   The Finance Act 2011 provides for the taxation of bets that remote bookmakers enter into with persons in the State. This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences. </P>
        <P>The proposed Betting (Amendment) Bill, which is being drafted at present, will establish the regulatory framework for these licences. The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted. This Bill is well advanced and it is hoped that it will be published in the autumn.</P>
        <P>I am hopeful that by including the high-growth area of the betting sector the tax base from betting will be boosted significantly.</P>
        <P>In addition, this measure conveys a positive signal to international betting operations that have expressed an interest in or have already invested in Ireland. A location with an appropriate licensing regime coupled with relatively low taxes provides real investment and employment opportunities in this sector, which ultimately can potentially be beneficial to all concerned.</P>
        <P>There are currently no plans to introduce a tax on winning bets which would represent a fundamental change to the taxation of betting to date.</P>

	<P>NAMA participated in the Working Group set up by the Government to examine the issue and extent of unfinished estates in Ireland. The Group&rsquo;s report was published by the Minister for Housing in June 2011.That report identified 2,800 unfinished estates that were categorised by reference to the extent to which they required remediation work.  The report identified about 225 Category 4 estates which were considered to require immediate remedial attention. NAMA debtors have loans with an exposure to 31 of those Category 4 estates.    I am informed by NAMA that is has committed, through its debtors, the cost of essential urgent works on these sites. It instructed a surveyor to carry out an initial assessment of the required works to meet the public safety initiative, and then each debtor/site owner was requested to liaise with the Local Authority to assess what works needed to be carried out urgently and the estimated cost of such works. Based on this assessment, it was estimated that funding of &euro;3m was required for urgent remedial work. Site resolution plans are currently being prepared and consultation is taking place with various local authorities in relation to sites within their areas. NAMA is considering proposals and 15 site resolution plans are under review.</P>

School transport is a very significant national operation involving about 42 million journeys and over 82 million kilometres on 6,000 routes every school year. This service is delivered using a mix of Bus &Eacute;ireann, both school transport and road passenger vehicles, private contractor vehicles including private operator scheduled services, and Dublin Bus, Irish Rail, DART and LUAS where practical. The 2011 allocation to my Department for the provision of School Transport is almost &euro;180m.  I can assure the Deputy that expenditure from this allocation is used solely for the provision of school transport in accordance with the terms of the school transport schemes. </P>

However, the Union referred the matter to the Labour Court, and the Labour Court recommended that the arrangement be re-instated to allow for due process.

	<P>In July 2011, the Government decided that a new further education and training authority, to be called SOLAS, should be established. SOLAS will operate under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills, and will co-ordinate and fund the wide range of further education and training programmes around the country. The establishment of SOLAS, the disbanding of FAS and making VECs responsible for the delivery of Further Education and Training programmes to learners is the most significant change in Further Education and Training in decades.  It does not merely involve rebranding.  The branding of SOLAS is a small but necessary part of the significant change management process that is involved.  This will be one of the issues for consideration by the SOLAS  Implementation Group which has been set up to oversee the process.  Particular care will be exercised to ensure that the costs associated with the rebranding will not be excessive. </P>

This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number. It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.</P>
        <P>The NCSE issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme is to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.</P><Col N="158"/>
        <P>The NCSE has now advised all mainstream schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy in County Cork, of their SNA allocation for the current school year, taking into account the care needs of qualifying pupils attending the school.</P>
        <P>I wish to clarify for the Deputy that SNA allocations are not permanent, as the level of SNA support allocated to a school may be increased or decreased as pupils who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school. They are also decreased where a child&rsquo;s care needs may have diminished over time.</P>
        <P>I also wish to clarify that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</P>
        <P>The NCSE will advise schools early in the new school year of any review process to review allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that they comply with my Department&rsquo;s policy. The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism.</P>
        <P>It will be expected that schools, before requesting a review, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.</P>

	<P>It is important to note that Special Needs Assistant (SNA) allocations are not permanent, as the level of SNA support allocated to a school may be increased or decreased as pupils who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school. They are also decreased where a child&rsquo;s care needs may have diminished over time.  </P>
        <P>The recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. The Board is the SNA&rsquo;s employer and the terms of employment are subject to the conditions of the contract of employment.  There are therefore presently no plans to introduce a panel system for SNAs.</P>
        <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that my Department has recently published a Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Analysis review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme. This review is available on my Departments website: <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Value for Money review recommended that the Department of Education and Skills should consider conducting a cost benefit analysis, to establish if the introduction of a regional redeployment scheme for SNAs would lead to greater economic efficiency. It also recommended that alternative employment models for SNAs that could achieve greater administrative efficiencies and provide greater employment certainty for SNAs should be considered by the DES.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently establishing a working group which will consider and implement the recommendations of the SNA Value for Money report.</P>
        <P>In the interim, a Special Needs Assistant whose post is surplus to the approved allocation to the school may be entitled to a redundancy payment under the terms of circular 58/2006 &mdash; <Col N="159"/>titled Redundancy Arrangements for Special Need Assistants. Support to SNAs who may have been made redundant is provided for within the terms of this scheme.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. </P>
        <P>Circular 37/2011 provides information to schools regarding the arrangements which are being put in place for the 2011/12 school year for the allocation of Resource Teaching hours for children with assessed special educational needs.</P>
        <P>In relation to the allocation of individual Resource Teaching hours, the position is that for the coming 2011/12 school year, an allocation of 90% of valid identified resource teaching allocations has been made by the NCSE to schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy in Ballyboden, in the first instance, to provide schools with the majority of their allocation, while also preserving enough capacity to deal with late applications and ensure that the Department of Education and Skills can remain within Employment Control Framework obligations.</P>
        <P>Schools have now been asked to forward as soon as possible any outstanding applications, or additional outstanding materials to support incomplete applications, to the NCSE for consideration, but in any event by no later than 16th September 2011. Following the receipt of all such applications, consideration will be given as to whether there is potential to revise the 90% allocation previously given to schools, and also the extent to which new Resource Teaching allocations can be made, taking into account the number of valid new applications received and in the context of my Departments Employment Control Framework obligations.</P>

	<P>The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all <Col N="160"/>pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</P>

My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </P>
        <P>Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</P>

	<P>Arts education (visual arts, music and drama) is one of the seven curriculum areas that comprise the primary curriculum, which was revised in 1999.  Therefore all primary school children have access to an arts programme. </P>
        <P>At second level there are approved syllabuses for Junior Certificate in Music and Art, Craft and Design.  In the senior cycle there are syllabuses in Music and Art.  Modules in the Arts are also available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied.  In the Transition Year programme, schools offer a variety of modules which stimulate pupils&rsquo; interest in the Arts in general and which, in many cases, give them the opportunity to interact with practising artists in their own classrooms and in other contexts.</P>
        <P>In addition to supporting curricular provision for the arts at primary and second level, my Department aids the arts through the provision of some 68,000 teaching hours to a number of schools of music operated by VECs and through co-operation (teaching) hours to VECs which support work with other institutions.  In addition, two Music Education Partnerships are funded in Donegal and Dublin City VECs.</P>
        <P>A further initiative in Music for young people of school age has been launched by Music Generation, a subsidiary company of Music Network, supported by donations from U2 and the Ireland Funds.  The programme is aimed at providing access to vocal and instrumental music education for children and young people.</P>
        <P>The Artists in School Guidelines, developed jointly by the Arts Council and my Department, and issued to all schools in 2006, are an important resource in informing schools of how best to plan, implement and evaluate partnerships with local artists and organisations which will provide stimulating and interesting learning experiences for children.  This type of initiative could be further strengthened through work experience programmes in schools for arts graduates.</P>

This categorisation is a legacy from the original 1970&rsquo;s agreement and originally it was a charge of 13% on certain defined costs.  This figure covers some indirect costs, indirect support costs, indirect regional costs, property and a contribution.  A more detailed breakdown of the administration heading is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and as set out below.

        <asker> Deputy Regina Doherty</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> his policy on educating children with autism; if this Deputy will be furnished with a copy of same; the research underpinning same; and the date it was originally published. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22919/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that policy can be expressed and manifested through a variety of forms.  Explicitly, it is communicated via legislation, regulations, rulings, orders, plans, strategies, policy statements, and other forms &mdash; or through a combination of these.  Therefore the Deputy will appreciate that specific policies and objectives are not always articulated in just one document.</P>
        <P>In response to a previous request from the Deputy regarding my Department&rsquo;s policy on autism I outlined how my Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs.  In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism.  As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.</P>
        <P>Children with autism present with a wide range of needs.  Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports.  Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance.  Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive inter<Col N="166"/>ventions are required.  Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.</P>
        <P>The preferred policy of my Department is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children.  Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children.  Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased.  Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.  This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the intent of the EPSEN Act.</P>
        <P>While some children may be able to attend a mainstream class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or unit in the school or in a special school.  My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 430 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of some 5,000 children with autism, all of which operate within the policy parameters.  This policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.</P>
        <P>My Department is satisfied that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism.  It is for this reason that my Department&rsquo;s preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child&rsquo;s needs.  In arriving at the preferred policy which is currently in place, my Department has considered published  research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism (2001) and the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (2006), both of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website has also informed the policy.  My Department was also mindful of contributions of many others experts at international conferences/visits have also informed the development views.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Changes in the School Transport Scheme were announced by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the scheme.  One of the changes announced included the increase from seven to ten in the minimum number of eligible pupils, residing in a distinct locality, required to establish or retain a school transport service. </P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport schemes on behalf of my Department, has advised that in this case, the number of applications from eligible pupils has fallen below the minimum number requirement and consequently the service will not operate for the 2011/12 school year.  As is currently the position, families of eligible pupils, for whom there is no school transport service available, may apply for a remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.</P>
        <P>It is essential to stress that the wider context within which these changes are taking place, is a situation of the most serious financial difficulties.  Under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of &euro;17 million on the school transport budget and these measures are an integral part of this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.  This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</P>
        <P>10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts are being provided for SNA support for the coming school year.  This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number.  It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.</P>
        <P>The NCSE issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year.  A key feature of the amended scheme is to provide for an annual allocation of <Col N="169"/>Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE has now advised all mainstream schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy in Baldoyle, of their SNA allocation for the current school year, taking into account the care needs of qualifying pupils attending the school.</P>
        <P>I wish to clarify that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that SNA allocations are provided, in accordance with the terms of my Departments Circular 07/02, to provide for the care needs of qualifying pupils with special educational needs.  The SNA role does not provide for teaching of a child, which is the role of the class teacher, or which may be supported by an additional resource teaching allocation.</P>
        <P>The NCSE will advise schools early in the new school year of any review process to review allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that they comply with my Department&rsquo;s policy.  The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism.  It will be expected that schools, before requesting a review, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.</P>

        <P>Class size data for all primary schools is compiled by my Department on an annual basis and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The most recently published data relates to the 2010/11 school year.  The staffing schedule is the mechanism used for allocating mainstream teaching posts to all schools.  It currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils.  Schools have autonomy on how these posts are deployed to individual classes.</P>
        <P>School authorities are advised in the staffing schedule to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.).  In particular, they should ensure, as far as possible, that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and the differential between the largest and the smallest classes is kept to a minimum.  With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will always be differences in individual class sizes.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the fact that parents with dyslexic children must present a report of a three-hour assessment carried out by an educational psychologist at a cost of almost &euro;500 to get support for junior certificate examinations (details supplied). </Quest>
        <QRef>[23110/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The State Examinations Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) scheme of Reasonable Accommodations is designed to assist candidates with special needs at the certificate examinations.  The term special needs applies to candidates who have physical/medical and or specific learning difficulties.  Applications for reasonable accommodations are considered within a published framework of principles.  Reasonable Accommodations are designed to remove as far as possible the impact of a disability on a candidate&rsquo;s performance, so as he or she can demonstrate in the examination his or her level of achievement &mdash; they are not designed to compensate for a possible lack of achievement arising from a disability.</P>
        <P>Accommodations are granted under the scheme to students who fall within specific criteria.  The existence of a specific learning difficulty (e.g. dyslexia) does not automatically entitle an examination candidate to such special arrangements.  Even though candidates may have a specific difficulty with reading, writing or spelling, they may not require the provision of any special facilities provided that they can read the question papers of the required level and write legibly.  Decisions are made on foot of the evidence supporting a candidate&rsquo;s application, including educational psychological assessments, as to whether his or her special needs fall within the parameters set for the granting of an accommodation.</P>
        <P>Some information on how the scheme operates may be of help in understanding the process.  There is no obligation on schools or parents to provide a private psychological assessment in support of their application for reasonable accommodations.  However, many parents choose to provide such report in support of their application.  There is a fundamental difference in how the scheme operates between Junior and Leaving Certificate level.  At Junior Certificate level the application process was changed in 2001 to expedite decisions and allow schools a larger degree of autonomy.</P>
        <P>The key features of the SEC&rsquo;s approach on the Junior Certificate are: A series of tailored application forms that match the more common special needs that give rise to applications</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Elimination of the requirement for supporting medical evidence in most cases</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Elimination of the requirement for submission to the SEC of psychological assessments or samples of course work in the case of students with specific learning difficulties</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Provision for the application to be signed by a school representative other than the principal</P>
        <P FLI="0">Essentially the SEC accepts a school&rsquo;s confirmation on the application form as sufficient evidence to enable the arrangement.  Put simply, if the candidate&rsquo;s special need has been established by the school, there is no need to provide documentary evidence to the SEC.</P>
        <P>To guide the school in its determination, the SEC provides a set of guidelines to schools to help them determine the eligibility of a candidate for accommodations.  This procedure is designed to reduce the administrative burden on schools and essentially empowers the school itself to put reasonable accommodations in place.  This approach reduces the amount of preparatory work and documentation collation for schools in preparing applications.  However, a key feature of the Junior Certificate model is that, where an accommodation is approved for Junior Certificate, it does not automatically follow that approval will be granted for Leaving Certificate.  A fresh application is required in respect of the Leaving Certificate and each will <Col N="171"/>be considered on its own merits.  This position is clearly outlined in the documentation that issues to schools annually in relation to the operation of the Scheme.</P>
        <P>At Leaving Certificate decisions in relation to applications for reasonable accommodations are taken having regard to the circumstances of each individual case.  Applications on the grounds of a specific learning difficulty are referred the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) for consideration in the first instance.</P>
        <P>In cases where a school/parent or student is dissatisfied with any aspect of SEC&rsquo;s decision, at either Junior or Leaving Certificate level, they have access to an Independent Appeals Committee.  All members of the Appeals Committee are drawn from outside the SEC.  The remit of the Appeals Committee covers appeals against all elements of a decision taken by the SEC.  All appeals are considered within a published framework of principles.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176, 217 and 228 together.</P>
        <P>The economic circumstances of the country are such that the previous Fianna Fail-Green Party Government introduced a new Student Contribution Charge of &euro;2,000 from this September.  The Programme for Government commits the Government to implementing the decisions of the 2011 Budget, which was passed by the last D&aacute;il.  The new student contribution will replace the previous Student Services Charge and will apply to students who qualify for &lsquo;free fees&rsquo;.  The contribution will be paid by the Exchequer on behalf of student grant-holders who last year amounted to some 46% of students in receipt of free fees.</P>
        <P>Conscious of financial pressures on families tax relief provisions have been put in place so that second and subsequent siblings will not have to bear the full cost increase.  Based on current rates of relief, the effective cost of the student contribution, net of tax relief, for second and subsequent siblings will be &euro;1,600 each.  An additional category of &ldquo;50% Student Contribution&rdquo; has been also been included in the student grants scheme. Institutions have also been asked to allow students to pay the contribution in two moieties.</P>

	<P>The Colleges of Education operate a number of reduced points and direct entry schemes including streams for mature students, students from disadvantaged areas and students eligible under the Gaeltacht scheme.  Provision is made for up to ten per cent of the teacher training places in the Colleges of Education to be reserved for applicants who reside in the officially designated Gaeltacht, and the normal language of whose home is Irish.  The special entry competition is in accordance with Government policy for the support and promotion of the Gaeltachta&iacute; and of the use of the Irish language as a community language.  In order to achieve these objectives, it is essential to ensure an adequate supply of teachers for the schools in the Gaeltacht.  It is also considered highly desirable that children from Gaeltacht areas would be taught by teachers who are native speakers of the dialect spoken by the children in order to maintain and develop children&rsquo;s fluency in the local dialect.  </P>
        <P>The scheme requires the reservation of up to 10% of places on teacher training courses for Gaeltacht applicants with any places not being taken up distributed to mainstream candidates.  The scheme does not provide for a difference in entry points depending on candidate; rather this is dictated by market forces of supply and demand and is within the remit of the Central Applications Office.  Given the fewer numbers of Gaeltacht applicants, points required for admission as a Gaeltacht applicant may be lower than otherwise required.  However it is important to note that Gaeltacht applicants who secure places do not necessarily have lower points than other mainstream applicants.</P>
        <P>The Teaching Council now has a remit to advise the Minister for Education and Skills in relation to the minimum standards of educational qualifications required for entry into programmes of teacher education and has been asked, when formulating its advice on entry standards, to provide specific advice on the Gaeltacht entry scheme.</P>

	<P>The results of the OECD&rsquo;s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), undertaken in 65 countries in 2009, were published on 7 December 2010.  Finland scored above the OECD average in reading literacy, mathematics and science, and is often cited as an example of excellence in educational practice. <Col N="173"/> Whilst there are no plans to specifically adopt the Finnish education system, educational policies are informed by many factors including international research and experiences of educational practices.  The two principles of the Finnish education system referred to in this question: an egalitarian system and regular systemic student assessment are, I believe, vitally important.</P>
        <P>An objective of Finnish education policy is to achieve as high a level of education and competence as possible for the whole population.  I am also committed to ensuring that all students reach their potential and providing additional supports for those students who require them.  There are a range of existing provisions in place to achieve this.  DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion was introduced in 2005, and provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  As a result of the identification and review processes, 876 schools were included in the School Support Programme (SSP) under DEIS.  These comprise 676 primary schools (urban and rural) and 200 second-level schools.  DEIS provides various supports for both primary and post primary schools including a  reduced pupil teacher ratio in primary schools in urban areas with most disadvantage.</P>
        <P>An evaluation of DEIS has been undertaken by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of my Department and a report of this evaluation is expected shortly.  The outcomes of the ERC evaluation will inform any future changes to the current programme.  In July of this year I launched the National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy among Children and Young People, &ldquo;Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life&rdquo;, which aims to ensure that no child leaves school without having mastered literacy and numeracy skills.  The Strategy contains 6 key areas which include helping students with additional learning needs to achieve their potential and improving assessment and evaluation to support better learning.</P>
        <P>In relation to a policy of regular student assessment, I agree that when used properly this can provide useful information about the progress of individual students and also inform schools in their self-evaluation processes.  The Literacy and Numeracy Strategy emphasises the importance of assessment for learning which gives an indication of the progress that students have made in achieving the learning outcomes that are set out in the curriculum.  Standardised test are identified by the Strategy as one important tool which can be used to monitor student progress.  The Strategy provides for standardised tests for students in second, fourth and sixth classes in primary school and for students in second-year at post-primary school.</P>

	<P>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld. </P>
        <P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school.  My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection <Col N="174"/>process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently launched a discussion paper on school enrolment.  The document,&ldquo;Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment&rdquo; contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent and I am inviting education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department by the 28th of October.</P>

	<P>In line with international best practice, the Primary School Curriculum (1999) advocates the use of resources to develop mathematics concepts.  This includes the use of calculators from Fourth Class onwards.  In Irish primary schools, calculators are primarily used to check answers and perform routine calculations and best practice includes their use to enhance mathematics reasoning and problem-solving skills.</P>
        <P>Whilst some people believe that calculators can harm rather than enhance a pupil&rsquo;s mathematical skills, this is not supported by research evidence.  A recent study in Ireland (Close et al, 2008) reports that, correctly used, calculators can improve performance on more complex mathematical concepts and skills, and on problem-solving.  This is also reflected in international research.</P>
        <P>The reforms that I have announced as part of the national literacy and numeracy strategy include increased provision for teacher education at the pre-service stage, during the induction phase in the early stages of a teacher&rsquo;s career and as part of every teacher&rsquo;s continuing professional development.  As a result of enhanced professional development, I am confident that teachers will have a better understanding of the effective use of calculators to support better teaching and learning in Mathematics.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 to 187, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>At a Government meeting held on the 15th March, 2011, it was decided to reduce the number of staff permitted in Minister&rsquo;s Private Offices from 10 to 8 and Minister of State&rsquo;s Private Offices from 7 to 5.  The number of staff permitted in Minister&rsquo;s Constituency Offices has been reduced from 6 to 4 and Ministers of State&rsquo;s Constituency Offices from 5 to 3.  The staffing of these offices at my Department is in accordance with these reduced parameters.</P>
        <P>Since I have taken office I have appointed 2 Special Advisers.  It should be noted that there were 3 Special Advisers, as allowed under Department of Finance guidelines, appointed by the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills from March 2010 to March 2011 to allow for additional duties in respect of her role as T&aacute;naiste.  Salary costs in respect of these Advisers are set out in the following table.  There are currently 4 officers in my Constituency Office and 8 officers in my Private Office.  Salary details in respect of each office are set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>There are currently 3(2.8 fte*) officers in the Constituency Office and 5 officers in the Private Office of Minister of State Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, T.D. Salary details in respect of each office are set out in the following table.  There is also 1 Private Secretary appointed to Mr Se&aacute;n Sherlock, T.D., and Minister of State for Research &amp; Innovation in my Department.  Their salary to date in 2011 is set out in the following table.  The salaries paid to the civil servants are in accordance with the Department of Finance salary scales for the relevant grades.  The salaries paid to the non-civil servant staff are in accordance with the Department of Finance Instructions relating to the Appointment of Ministerial Private Office Staff.</P>

	<P>Under the current terms of my Department&rsquo;s Post Primary School Transport Scheme, pupils are eligible for transport if they reside 4.8 kilometres or more from their local post primary education centre, that is the centre serving the catchment area in which they reside.</P>
        <P>The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside.  However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area &mdash; otherwise known as catchment boundary transport.  These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their &lsquo;own&rsquo; post-primary centre have been catered for.  Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.</P>
        <P>Changes in the School Transport Scheme were announced by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the scheme.  One of these changes includes the cessation of the use of the above catchment boundary system.  Eligibility for school transport for all new pupils entering post-primary from the 2012/13 school year will be determined by the distance they reside from their nearest post-primary centre or school.  Existing eligible post primary pupils will retain their eligibility for the duration of their post primary education cycle provided they continue to meet the terms of the current scheme.</P>

	<P>This Government is committed to supporting the overall thrust of 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030, and to the delivery of the goals and targets proposed.  As part of this, a thorough reform of the Irish curriculum and the way Irish is taught at primary and second level will be undertaken.  The priority is to take steps to improve the quality and effectiveness of the teaching of Irish.  Only when these steps have been implemented, the question of whether Irish should be optional at Leaving Certificate will be considered. </P>
        <P>A revised Leaving Certificate curriculum in Irish began in all schools in September 2010 for first examination in 2012.  The revised programme provides for an increase in the proportion of marks available for oral assessment to 40%, and is aimed at promoting a significant shift in emphasis towards Irish as a spoken language, where students can communicate and interact in a spontaneous way, and where Irish is spoken every day in schools.  The National Council for <Col N="184"/>Curriculum and Assessment has been asked to review this syllabus in the light of the experiences of students in the first examination.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 to 195, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Teaching Council that there are almost 4,100 qualified Maths teachers currently on the register of teachers.  Of these, just over 500 teachers are aged between 55 and 59 (nearing retirement), while less than 230 are aged 60 and over.</P>
        <P>In relation to the qualifications of those currently teaching mathematics in post-primary schools, the Teaching Council has carried out a survey on this subject.  The results of the survey shows that out of a total of 2,045 teachers teaching maths in 258 schools, 1,400 teachers are fully qualified to do so, 596 teachers have undergone some studies in maths and only 49 have no third level qualifications/studies in maths.  The survey helps us to get a clearer picture of what is actually happening on the ground in these schools and the data allows us to plan to meet the training needs of teachers over the coming years.   The Council has not advised on the breakdown of maths teachers in different categories of schools, by gender, or location, nor is this information currently available to the Department.</P>
        <P>Recruitment of teachers is a matter for individual schools and therefore it is not possible for me to say how many teachers with maths degrees will be recruited for this academic year.  However, schools have been directed by my Department, as far as practicable, to appoint only appropriately qualified and registered teachers.  The appointment and deployment of teachers within schools is also a matter for schools themselves.</P>

	<P>The expenditure incurred by my Department&rsquo;s IT Unit in 2010 was &euro;1.334m on capital and &euro;1.783m on current.  There is provision of &euro;2m for capital and &euro;2.395m for current expenditure in 2011. </P>
        <P>The purchase of IT equipment by my Department is on the basis of a competitive tendering process, conducted in compliance with national and EU rules.  There are framework arrangements in place, managed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and used by my Department, for the purchase of personal computers (including notebooks) and printers.  These frameworks maximise volume discounts and allow government departments and agencies to operate much simpler procurement processes for such equipment.  The method used to procure IT equipment not covered by the framework arrangements, is determined by the estimated value of the contract.  It is recommended that three quotes be obtained for purchases less than &euro;5,000.  A minimum of three written quotes must be obtained in respect of purchases between &euro;5,000 and &euro;10,000.  Contracts in excess of &euro;10,000 are advertised on the eTenders website.  In addition, contracts in excess of &euro;125,000 must also be advertised on the Official Journal of the European Union website.</P>
        <P>Bodies under the aegis of my Department have budgets for the purchase of IT equipment and are obliged to comply with national and EU procurement rules.  In accordance with the 2009 Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, the Chairperson of each state body must furnish to the relevant Minister in conjunction with the annual report and accounts of the body a comprehensive report  to include an affirmation that &lsquo;all appropriate procedures for financial reporting, internal audit, travel, procurement and asset disposal are being carried out&rsquo;.</P>

	<P>A fundamental element of the building cost limits for all school building projects is the Basic Building Cost (BBC). The Basic Building Cost is expressed as a cost per square metre of the new build floor area. My Department keeps the Basic Building Cost under review in line with cost developments in the construction industry generally and the cost of school building projects in particular.</P>
        <P>The current Basic Building Cost, effective from January 2011, is &euro;930 per square metre, which equates to approximately &euro;86 per square foot. This compares with the Basic Building Cost which applied in 2008 which was &euro;1,230 per square metre (approximately &euro;114 per square foot).</P>
        <P>The Basic Building Cost extant at any particular time applies to both urban and rural areas and applies equally to new build areas in extensions and new schools alike.</P>
        <P>Other elements which can affect the overall cost of a school building project include External Works, Abnormal Costs and site acquisition costs. These elements can vary from site to site and from project to project.</P>

	<P>NCTE courses are unique in that they are designed and delivered by qualified teachers based on nationally and locally identified need and government priorities, such as literacy and numeracy. They are available throughout the year and are fully funded by NCTE, so that teachers do not have to pay course fees.  Most courses are delivered face to face to ensure that teachers gain adequate hands-on practical skills combined with the knowledge of how to use ICT as an integral part of the curriculum. The &ldquo;whole-school&rdquo; orientation of many courses is also unique to NCTE/NCTE funded <Col N="189"/>courses, allowing teachers to learn based on their specific needs and using the equipment in their own school.  </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 and 212 together.  </P>
        <P>The five state funded Colleges of Education offer the Bachelor of Education for primary teaching and four of the Colleges offer an 18 month post graduate primary education course.  Hibernia College, a private provider, also offers a postgraduate course. There are 15 providers of Post Primary initial teacher education courses.  Students follow one of two models of initial teacher education: a concurrent (three or four year degree course) or a consecutive model (a Bachelor degree and a one-year Higher Diploma in Education).  Students following the concurrent route enter through the CAO and students following the consecutive model enter under the Post Graduate Applications Centre or apply directly to the provider.</P>
        <P>My Department does not hold the detailed data for post primary entrants which the Deputy has requested.  The following table sets out the data on entrants and graduates for the primary initial teacher education providers and graduates registered with the Teaching Council for post primary from 2007-2010 as well as estimated graduates for 2011.</P><Col N="191"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 and 231 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support, which now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</P><Col N="193"/>
        <P>As set out in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 0042/2011, in order for the NCSE to complete the processing of applications for mainstream schools in the first instance, the existing 2010/11 level of SNA supports have been maintained in special schools for the coming school year, other than for schools with declining enrolments, with a review to take place in Autumn of the 11/12 school year. This review will also take into account the Policy Analysis and Value for Money Review of the SNA scheme and policy advice received from the NCSE on the Future of Special Schools and Classes.</P>
        <P>Therefore, the existing level of SNAs in special schools, other than those whose enrolments have declined significantly, has been maintained in order to assist and protect the most vulnerable children in the education system.</P>
        <P>The special school in Kildare, referred to by the Deputy, has therefore not experienced a reduction in SNA support over the level of SNA support provided at the end of the 2011 school year, but has maintained its existing high levels of SNA support.</P>
        <P>The overall level of SNA support in this school is presently being reviewed by the NCSE. Notwithstanding the outcome of this review, it is the position of both my Department and the NCSE that given the exceptionally high levels of teaching and support staff which have been allocated to the school, that the school has sufficient support within its overall allocation to provide for the teaching and care requirements of all of the children enrolled to the school, pending the outcome of this review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 216 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating teaching staff and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to special schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Departments criteria in allocating such support, which now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</P>
        <P>As set out in my Departments Circular 0042/2011, in order for the NCSE to complete the processing of applications for mainstream schools in the first instance, the existing 2010/11 level of SNA supports have been  maintained in special schools for the coming school year, other than for schools with declining enrolments, with a review to take place in Autumn of the 11/12 school year. This review will also take into account the Policy Analysis and Value for Money Review of the SNA scheme and policy advice received from the NCSE on the Future of Special Schools and Classes.</P>
        <P>In relation to teaching posts, Circular 0042/11 states that there are a small number of special schools which have significant excess teacher posts and that the NCSE may therefore contact such schools to review the individual circumstances in these schools. The Circular indicates that the NCSE may suppress a post in schools which have excess teaching posts in order to <Col N="194"/>create a post in a school which does not have excess posts and which has growing pupil numbers.</P>
        <P>The overall levels of teaching and SNA support in the school referred to by the Deputy in County Cork, is currently being reviewed by the NCSE.</P>
        <P>The school caters for pupils with severe/profound disability and ASD. The correct teacher allocation ratio for schools catering for children with severe and profound disability is 6:1.  In 2010/11 the school had 7 approved class teaching posts and 3 supernumerary posts and 28 SNAs. The enrolment is 38 pupils, including the 9 new children enrolled for September 2011. One of the surplus teachers retired at the end of the last school year and the school is not eligible for a replacement. A further supernumerary post has been withdrawn leaving the school with 1 supernumerary post above its staffing allocation.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the outcome of this review, it is the position of both my Department and the NCSE that given the exceptionally high levels of teaching and support staff which have been allocated to the school, that the school has sufficient support within its overall allocation to enable it provide for the teaching and care support requirements of all of the children enrolled to the school, pending the outcome of this review.</P>

        <P>Unemployed people who wish to undertake a course of education, including the Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) programme referred to by the person, may be eligible to receive the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA).

Under the terms of the scheme, grant assistance is awarded to learners who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  The local VEC can advise the person on his eligibility or otherwise for the scheme. Budget 2011 provided for the introduction of a &euro;200 annual PLC programme participant contribution for all PLC participants.  The following categories of participants are exempt from paying the contribution:</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to a proposal for an academy for children with autism which was submitted to my Department for consideration by Achieve ABA.  The Deputy will be aware that my Department had no direct funding arrangements with the group in question.</P>
        <P>Consideration of this proposal took account of my Department&rsquo;s policy in this regard, which is focused on ensuring that all children, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports.  In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios.  Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs.  In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services.  The SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs.  Another specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.  SENOs are a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children.  The NCSE have been fully engaged in securing placements for the children in question.  The NCSE has advised my Department that, irrespective of the assessed levels of ability of the children, there are placements available for these children.  I also understand from my officials that the parents of the children have been advised of their placement options by the NCSE at the start of this week.</P>
        <P>I also wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has approved additional home tuition for the children which will facilitate transitional arrangements when the school based placements have been accepted by the parents.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 229 together.</P>
        <P>The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, otherwise known as the Hunt report, lays out a clear possible development pathway for amalgamated institutes of technology, which meet specified performance criteria, to seek re-designation as technological universities.  A small number of new technological universities, with their own legislative framework and a distinct mission that is faithful to the ethos of the technological sector, working with existing universities, institutes of technology and other education providers, can enrich the diversity and quality of the Irish higher education landscape.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Higher Education Authority for its formal advice on performance criteria to be used in an independent assessment process for any future applications for designation as technological universities.  A consultation process on draft criteria is being undertaken by the Higher Education Authority and will be completed early next month. It is understood that the Higher Education Authority hopes to sign off its formal advice to my Department at its November meeting of the Authority.  I will expedite consideration of the advice with a view to publishing the criteria before the end of December.</P>
        <P>All applications will be considered under an independent assessment process. Once a process is in place it will be open to institutes of technology to come together to make applications for consideration for re-designation, including those in the south east.</P>

        <P>Circular 37/2011 provides information to schools regarding the arrangements which are being put in place for the 2011/12 school year for the allocation of Resource Teaching hours for children with assessed special educational needs.</P>
        <P>In relation to the allocation of individual Resource Teaching hours, the position is that for the coming 2011/12 school year, an allocation of 90% of valid identified resource teaching allocations has been made by the NCSE to schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy in Midleton, in the first instance, to provide schools with the majority of their allocation, while also preserving enough capacity to deal with late applications and ensure that the Department of Education and Skills can remain within Employment Control Framework obligations.</P>

	<P>I recently met with educational book publishers, representatives of parents&rsquo; organisations and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul regarding the cost of school textbooks. Subsequently, the publishers devised a voluntary Code of Practice and, while I welcome the Code as a significant step in the right direction, I believe that more should be done to reduce the price of textbooks.</P>
        <P>Accordingly. I have proposed to the representatives of the textbook publishers: that the cover price of the most popular textbooks should be reduced; that a significant discount should be given to schools which purchase textbooks in bulk, in line with the discounts given to retailers of textbooks; that the practice of combining a conventional textbook and workbook in a single volume should be ended to allow students to re-use a textbook; and that support materials should be provided to teachers online, to minimise ancillary printing costs. While respecting the position that educational book publishers are independent private companies not under the direct control of my Department, I intend to meet with their representatives again to progress these issues.</P><Col N="200"/>
        <P>I am also keen to examine if there are ways to encourage schools, via the book grant scheme, to establish or maintain book rental schemes as I believe this to be one of the most effective ways of lowering the burden of the cost of school books.  I have invited the National Parents Councils at primary and post-primary levels to provide me with examples of good practice of book rental schemes. Drawing on these and other examples, I intend to publish advice to schools on how best to establish and maintain textbook rental schemes in schools well in advance of the beginning of the next school year.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce new legislation to protect small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies.  In addition, the Deputies may be aware that the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 was introduced by Senator Feargal Quinn and passed Committee and Remaining Stages in the Seanad on 8 March 2011.  It is now before the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>In this regard, my colleague Minister of State, Mr Brian Hayes is working with Senator Quinn to continue a collaborative approach in regard to advancing the Bill.  The Senator&rsquo;s Bill is a   welcome initiative and I understand that Minister Hayes and Senator Quinn held a meeting with relevant stakeholders and opposition spokespersons on 28th June 2011.  This consultation highlighted a number of matters relating to the Bill that required further consideration and that have been taken into account in the Regulatory Impact Assessment which is being finalised in my Department at present.</P>
        <P>These steps will make it possible to bring proposals to Government about how to progress this legislation.  It is intended to have the legislation progress in the D&aacute;il in the current session.</P>
        <P>It is important that a solution to the problem of non-payment in the construction sector must not place an unnecessary regulatory or cost burden on the parties to the dispute, other parties involved in the project, or the State.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A scheme of restoration of Glasnevin Cemetery commenced in 2007. Funding for the works is being provided through the Office of Public Works.  The Glasnevin Cemeteries Group is managing the works, with the Office of Public Works acting in an advisory capacity.  The project is working towards completion in time for the centenary of the 1916 rising in 2016.  To date &euro;10.033 million has been contributed by the State by way of grant assistance to the project.</P>
        <P>Works completed to date include: the relocation of the Sigerson Memorial; landscaping in the vicinity of the Round Tower and lighting of the base of this tower; cleaning of monuments close to the O&rsquo;Connell Tower; cleaning of the Monaghan Chapel; replacement of railings around a number of monuments; provision of new foundations for headstones and reinstatement of damaged headstones.  In addition, part of the ongoing work has been to remove many of the lower branches from the trees in order to provide better visibility for visitors to the cemetery.  Removal of ivy from tree trunks and monuments has also been undertaken.  The area at the eastern end of the cemetery has been grassed and the re-surfacing of the eight kilometres of paths has begun. Improvements have been made to drainage by sinking new manholes into the century-old drains.</P>
        <P>Among the works planned to be carried out in 2011 are: preservation works to Prospect Lodge (listed building); further works to the road and pathway infrastructure; upgrading of works yard adjacent to the Crematorium; further bollard installation, wiring and electrical works; and further horticultural upgrading works.</P>
        <P>The historic cemetery will be linked to the neighbouring National Botanic Gardens, providing an opportunity to mutually enhance both national institutions.  The necessary preparatory design work for this link has been completed and it is expected to commence following planning consultation.</P>
        <P>In addition to the works already mentioned, the programme of work included the provision of a state of the art heritage centre and museum at the entrance to the cemetery.  The Glasnevin Trust Museum and Visitor Centre was formally opened on 8th April 2010.  This project was managed and funded separately by the Glasnevin Trust.  The museum has already won many prestigious awards.</P>

	<P>Records for expenditure on taxis for my Department are from April 2011 only.  Since that time a total of &euro;2,991 euros has been spent on taxi fares.  Taxis should be used for official business purposes only.  While it is not Departmental policy to pay taxi fares for outsiders, occasionally a journey, which begins from this Department, will include outsiders along with a Departmental official.  This would be done as a means of reducing overall expenditure for the public service.</P>

As such, release of these documents could not be considered in advance of Government decisions on the forthcoming Budget.  I would envisage that the reports submitted as part of <Col N="206"/>the CRE process can be made available publicly following the completion of the budgetary and Estimates process.</P>

	<P>I understand that it is likely that one Secretary-General will retire before the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The provision in the Book of Estimates for Vote 7 (Superannuation and Retired Allowances) was based on a projected 1,400 retirements and 600 deaths of pensioners or their surviving dependants.</P>
        <P>The 2011 gross provision for Vote 7 is &euro;450.025 million and it is estimated that the average pension cost is &euro;27,000 per annum.</P>
        <P>It difficult to predict with any certainty the number of retirements from the Civil Service in any year, as staff may retire at any time between 60 and 65 years of age, or indeed earlier than this with an actuarial reduction being applied to their pension.</P>
        <P>The rate of retirements thus far this year is somewhat slower than originally estimated, but it is too early to make definite estimates of the end-year position on the Vote. The ending of the &lsquo;grace period&rsquo; at end February 2012 is a factor.</P>

	<P>In the recently published 2011 Revised Estimates for my Department approximately &euro;127,000 has been set aside for expenditure on consultancy and other services in my Department.  If a 25% reduction applied to this allocation this would give potential savings of &euro;31,750.</P>
        <P>In relation to expenditure in 2010 on professional fees by agencies under the aegis of my Department the following outlines the position of each:&mdash;</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>Valuation Office</i></P>
        <P>Based on the 2010 expenditure the potential savings of a 25% reduction in professional fees to the Valuation Office would be &euro;57,860.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>Office of the Ombudsman</i></P>
        <P>In 2010 expenditure on professional fees (consultancy and legal) for the Office of the Ombudsman amounted to &euro;505,000.  A 25% reduction in fees paid would have resulted in savings of &euro;126,250.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>State Laboratory</i></P>
        <P>In 2010 expenditure on professional services the State Laboratory was &euro;13,243.  A 25% reduction in fees paid would have resulted in savings of &euro;3,311.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>Public Appointments Service</i></P>
        <P>Based on the 2010 expenditure if professional fees were reduced by 25%, the savings would be &euro;2,530 (based on expenditure incurred for internal audit reports).</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>Commission for Public Service Appointments</i></P>
        <P>Based on the 2010 expenditure there would be a saving of &euro;16,000 if a 25% was taken by reducing professional fees in the Commission for Public Service Appointments.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>Office of Public Works</i></P>
        <P>The total paid by the Office of Public Works in respect of professional fees in 2010 was &euro;20,906,305 (VAT inclusive).  A 25% reduction in fees paid would have resulted in savings of &euro;5,226,576.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should be aware that the figures include fees some of which are determined by legislation, regulation, contract etc and a reduction of these fees may require agreement of the parties concerned.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should also note, that expenditure in relation to professional fees in 2010 for my Department are covered by material provided by the Department of Finance in respect of that year given that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was not officially established until last July.</P>

	<P>The role of my Department is to drive Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and productivity by creating the conditions where enterprise, entrepreneurship and innovation can flourish and quality employment opportunities are grown and maintained. Funding is provided to a number of State Agencies under its aegis including that of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), through whom <Col N="209"/>assistance is delivered directly to businesses. The CEB&rsquo;s role positions them as a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business. </P>
        <P>The forms of financial assistance, which are available, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, include Priming Grants, Business Expansion/Development Grants, and Feasibility/Innovation Study Grants. The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise. In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.</P>
        <P>I would advise the promoter to contact their appropriate CEB; Kerry County Enterprise Board in the first instance to discuss what options may be available to them and their proposed business venture.

	<P>The European Progress Microfinance Facility is a European Investment Fund (EIF) initiative to support entrepreneurship and employment through microfinance activities. The EIF does not provide direct financing to micro-entrepreneurs, micro-businesses or individuals. </P>
        <P>Financing is made available through intermediaries participating in the Facility. Eligible intermediaries are any public and private institutions that provide microfinance loans and/or guarantees to individuals, or micro-enterprises established in the EU Member States. Applications for participation do not require State involvement.</P>
        <P>EIF provides to selected intermediaries, capped guarantees partially covering their portfolios of micro-loans, or guarantees on micro-loans granted to micro-enterprises, including self-employed people, female entrepreneurs, young entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs belonging to a minority group, entrepreneurs with a disability and sole traders.  To apply to become an intermediary, interested institutions must submit a formal application for Progress Microfinance micro-credit guarantee<b> </b>  directly to the EIF.  Applications can be made until 31 December 2013.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, work is under way within my Department on the establishment of a Microfinance Fund as set out in the Programme for Government which is intended to provide loans to micro-enterprises.  The Fund, including scheme design and appropriate delivery mechanisms, will be developed with a view to formalising proposals in the context of Budget 2012.</P>
        <P>In the context of developing a Microfinance Fund, there has been contact with the EIF to explore the possibilities of accessing the Progress Microfinance Facility to support any national Fund being established.  This matter will be pursued further with the EIF when arrangements for a national Microfinance Fund are being finalised.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The data in the table does not include expenditure where taxis other than National Radio Cabs are used by officials of the Department/Offices while on official business in Ireland or abroad.  In these instances taxi costs are included with other forms of transport costs on my Department&rsquo;s financial management system and it is not feasible to identify such taxi costsseparately.</P>
        <P>My Department recognises that the use of public transport is normally the most economical means of transport available and should be availed of by staff wherever possible.  As a general rule, the use of taxis &mdash; either in Ireland or abroad &mdash; should arise only where no suitable public transport is available, or where the use of public transport is not feasible.</P>
        <P>The following is the instruction to staff concerning the use of taxis:&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">Every effort should be made to minimise the use of taxis, whether on the Department&rsquo;s Corporate account, or through personal hire for which a refund is subsequently claimed.  Staff are reminded that the bus service, which passes close to most of the Department&rsquo;s Dublin offices, should be used for journeys to and from the airport where possible.  This service is frequent, reliable and considerably cheaper than taxis.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Whether a taxi is being charged to the account or being reimbursed on foot of a receipt, staff are regularly asked to explain the reason a taxi was required or are asked for an explanation in regard to the cost.  My Department is housed in six separate offices in Dublin city and taxis are used by staff to move IT equipment, lodge cash in the bank or to move boxes, crates and in some cases small items of furniture.</P>
        <P>Staff may also use taxis where there is a perceived risk to personal safety (e.g. when arriving/departing at unsociable hours), or where there is a likelihood of missing a flight or where it is not practical to use public transport due, for example, to the location of the hotel or meeting room.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s Administrative Budget, which will contain the provision for taxi services for 2012, will be announced on Budget Day.</P>

	<P>The management of IDA&rsquo;s property portfolio including the development of Business &amp; Technology Parks is a day to day operational matter for the Agency and not one in which I have a function. </P>
        <P>I am informed by IDA that, in 2008, it acquired approximately 11 hectares of industrial zoned land on the Sligo Road, Ballina, Co. Mayo for the development of a Business &amp; Technology Park.  Perimeter landscaping works on the site have been completed.  Capital works for a new park entrance, access road and associated services were also planned, but due to current budgetary constraints these works have not yet taken place. IDA&rsquo;s Strategy &ldquo;<i>Horizon 2020</i>&rdquo;, which was published in March 2010, sets a key goal of attracting 50% of investments to Gateway locations excluding Dublin and Cork by 2014.</P><Col N="213"/>
        <P Just="Left">However, the challenge in achieving an even spread of investment across the country is intensified as the sophistication of investments increase.  These investments require a concentration of highly qualified and educated workers, supporting infrastructure and high level business services.  Frequently, competition for FDI comes from city regions with populations in excess of one million people.  Dublin is the only recognised city region of scale in Ireland.</P>
        
        <P>In selecting locations to show companies, IDA Ireland seeks to include locations which have been affected by closures/job losses.  Typically, a company is shown three or four selected towns, which can meet its requirements for skills, labour, site and/or buildings, infrastructure, etc.  The lands in Ballina are available to any potential client company and while IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of location, the final decision on which location a company will visit and locate in is made by the promoting company.</P>
        <P>There are 18 IDA client companies in Mayo employing 3,500 people of which 5 are located in Ballina; Hollister, Ballina Beverages (Coca Cola), Charles River Laboratories, Heyco and Lionbridge.</P>

	<P>The company in question went into examinership in November 2008 and into liquidation a few weeks later in December 2008.  Following receipt of a letter from the liquidators of the company in question, stating that no funds were available, Enterprise Ireland issued a claim to the guarantor of the grants and equity.  The agency continued to pursue the recovery of funds due from the guarantor and the State has since received repayment in full in respect of all amounts owing to Enterprise Ireland.  There are no other repayments due.  </P>

	<P>The recent announcement by Vodafone Ireland to offshore 139 jobs from its Irish call centres is part of a review of the company&rsquo;s European operations, which will also impact on its operations in other EU Member States. Vodafone state that in the current market environment cost efficiencies are a prerequisite so as to ensure their continued ability to compete in the Irish market where they employ over 1,000 people.  <b></b></P>
        <P>The announcement will impact 45 Vodafone roles and 139 in Rigney Dolphin, Vodafone&rsquo;s Irish call centre contract partner.  The 139 staff are employed by Rigney Dolphin but are in-sourced to Vodafone and are based at its sites in Dublin and Dundalk.  Rigney Dolphin have given assurances to the Minister that they will work through the implications of the redundancies with their employees.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All impacted Vodafone employees will be offered the opportunity to transfer to alternative roles within Vodafone Ireland, and voluntary redundancy packages will be offered. A consultation process is now under way with all Vodafone employees affected by the decision to <Col N="214"/>finalise the alternatives available. The changes to Vodafone Call Centre operations will take place in late 2011 and early 2012.</P>
        <P>I recently met with representatives from the company. Vodafone sees Ireland as an important strategic country and says it is committed to Ireland for the long-term. Vodafone&rsquo;s restructuring of its Irish operations was necessary for the company to continue operating in the Irish market, and to ensure future investment by the company in its Irish operations. This investment is vital for maintaining up-to-date infrastructure to meet the service demands.</P>
        <P>Job creation is central to economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.  The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate both job creation and job retention.  Enhancing our competitiveness and getting our cost base back into line with key competitors will be vital. Enhancing productivity through innovation and research is also critical. The programmes supported by my Department and its agencies are focused on achieving economic growth through promoting the export potential of enterprise in Ireland and driving sustainable job creation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 267 together.</P>
        <P>I have examined the proposal in question, which envisages the placement of 200,000 unemployed people back in the workforce while retaining their unemployment payments and receiving a fixed salary of &euro;270 per week from their employer.</P>
        <P>The question of workers retaining unemployment payments is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection, Ms. Joan Burton, T.D., and her view, on the proposal should be sought.  However, I can foresee a number of difficulties with the proposal, including implications for the principles underpinning unemployment payments and difficulties with EU State Aid rules as the measure could be construed as a subsidy to enterprises.</P>
        <P>There are already a number of schemes in existence which create very generous incentives for businesses to employ people who are on the Live Register.</P>
        <P>For example, Revenue Job Assist allows employers a double wages deduction in their accounts if they employ a person who has been unemployed for 12 months or more.  The double wages deduction may last for 3 years and applies to wages paid to a qualifying employee and to Employers&rsquo; PRSI contributions paid in respect of those wages.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection also operates an Employer&rsquo;s PRSI Incentive Scheme.  This scheme exempts employers from paying PRSI for 12 months in respect of certain qualifying employees.</P>
        <P>The Government also recently launched the National Internship Programme &mdash; Job Bridge &mdash; which will provide work experience placements of 6 to 9 months for those who have been on the Live Register for at least 3 months.  The aim of the National Internship Programme is to assist in breaking the cycle of jobseekers being unable to obtain a position in the absence of <Col N="215"/>experience. The scheme will provide for up to 5,000 work experience placements in the private, public and voluntary sectors.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s website includes information and links to a range of financial and non-financial supports available from Government Departments, Offices and agencies to assist companies to grow, improve competitiveness, create employment and improve productivity.  Details are available at: <i>http://www.djei.ie/enterprise/businesssupport.htm</i>.</P>

	<P>The role of Government is to create the conditions where enterprise, entrepreneurship and innovation can flourish and quality employment opportunities can be grown and maintained.  Two Industrial Development agencies under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, together with the Kerry County Enterprise Board (CEB) support enterprise development in Co. Kerry.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland promotes Co. Kerry for new inward investment across the ICT, International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sectors.  As well as attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA works closely with its existing clients in Kerry to encourage them to expand their operations in the County.  IDA continues to market all available land and buildings in the county, including its Business &amp; Technology Park in Killarney.  As regards the site in question, I understand that IDA Ireland has requested details of the specification of the building from Killarney Town Council, which owns the building.  However, as most potential is in the services sector, whose requirements differ from those of manufacturing, the opportunity to source a prospective FDI tenant for this building may be limited due to its current layout.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s activity as regards job creation is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs to set up new high potential start-up companies, and on the retention and creation of jobs in existing companies through the support of company development plans.  In Killarney and Co. Kerry as a whole, Enterprise Ireland actively engages with its client companies and has a number of supports and initiatives in place to assist companies.  A number of local seminars and workshops on a variety of subjects take place throughout the year.</P>
        <P>In addition to its existing supports for Irish companies, Enterprise Ireland has launched a new <i>Jobs Expansion Fund</i>, which can provide grant support up to a maximum of &euro;150,000 towards the recruitment of new employees.  In 2011, in addition to its existing offer for innovative high potential start-up businesses, Enterprise Ireland also launched a series of <i>Competitive Start Funds</i>  geared towards start-up businesses in target sectors, with the most recent focusing on the lifesciences, cleantech and industrial sectors.  These initiatives are expressly directed at business projects which can generate new jobs in the short to medium term.</P>
        <P>Kerry County Enterprise Board provides support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The Board has concentrated efforts on the on-going development of the Killarney Technology Innovation Centre (KTI), which has received funding from Enterprise Ireland, in Deerpark close to the Pretty Polly building.  In addition, I have been informed that a meeting is expected to take place between the Chief Executive Officer of Kerry County Enterprise Board and representatives of the Killarney Town <Col N="216"/>Council to discuss the Pretty Polly issue further in relation to what advice and/or assistance the Board would be in a position to offer.</P>

	<P>My Department processes applications in respect of the different types of employment permits (Green Cards Permits, Work Permits, Spousal/Dependant Permits and Intra-company Transfer Permits).  All applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006.</P>
        <P>It is current Government policy to issue new employment permits only in respect of:</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />highly skilled, highly paid positions or;</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or;</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />where there is an officially recognized scarcity of workers of a particular type or qualification.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that in 2010 a total of 7,501 employment permits issued, of which 3,555 were new and 3,946 were renewals.  To-date in 2011 a total of 3,968 permits issued, of which 2,383 were new and 1,585 were renewals.</P>
        <P>Detailed statistics on the numbers of permits issued over the last few years, broken down by sector, nationality and county, can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>http://www.djei.ie/labour/workpermits/statistics.htm.</i></P>

        <Quest> the details of spending, using departmental credit cards held by Department staff over the past four years; the numbers of persons in his Department who hold credit cards; the credit limits of said cards; and the amount that was specifically spent by his Department on entertainment provided using said credit card. </Quest>

	<P>I interpret the Deputy&rsquo;s question as relating to credit cards held by my Department where any costs incurred on the cards are paid directly by the Department.  My Department does not operate credit cards of this nature.  </P>
        <P>However, my Department recognises that certain staff may incur substantial up-front costs in the course of their official business.  In this context, my Department can facilitate the issuing of a corporate charge card by a commercial provider.  In order to be provided with this facility staff must satisfy certain criteria. There must be a business need for the card and a supervisor at Principal Officer level or higher must approve the application.  In addition, the Finance Officer must be satisfied that the applicant is required to travel on a regular basis and/or requires the charge card facility, having regard to the officer&rsquo;s duties.</P><Col N="217"/>
        <P>Staff who are issued with corporate charge cards under this arrangement hold individual accounts with the issuing credit card company.  Each cardholder is responsible for paying any balances due on his/her account directly to the credit card company as and when they arise.</P>
        <P>Staff are entitled to reclaim from my Department travel, subsistence and other official   expenses incurred in connection with their official duties, in accordance with Department of Finance regulations and applicable rates.  Reimbursements of this nature are paid directly to the officers concerned who may use the refunds to settle their charge card accounts.</P>
        <P>At present, 6 staff of my Department hold corporate charge cards under the arrangement outlined.  Provided the individual cardholder has settled his/her account with the credit card company in full and on time each month, no pre-set limit is placed on the card by the provider.  However, the card company monitors the spend on the cards, and any out-of-pattern spend or ramp-up in spend on a card is blocked at the point of sale.  In addition to these controls, my Department monitors and regularly reviews activity and monthly balances on accounts.</P>
        <P>Some other staff of my Department choose to use personal credit cards for business-related transactions and claim reimbursement of these expenses in accordance with Department of Finance regulations.</P>
        <P>My Department pays Government Stamp Duty on all corporate and personal charge/credit cards used for official transactions.  The total cost of Stamp Duty paid on these cards from 2008 to the present is set out on the following table:</P>

        <Quest> if it is envisaged that the community sector will be given the right to recognition for the purpose of collective bargaining. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>While Article 40 of the Irish Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to form associations and unions, it has been established in a number of legal cases that the constitutional guarantee of the freedom of association does not guarantee workers the right to have their union recognised for the purpose of collective bargaining.  No differentiation is made in this regard between workers employed in the community sector and those employed in the private and public sectors.</P>
        <P>I would recommend that voluntary and community organisations engage with their employees and the trade unions representing their employees on all aspects of good employment practice, including recruiting the right person, managing a diverse workplace, preparing model employment contracts or devising essential human resource management policies.  The services of the Labour Relations Commission are available to management and to trade unions representing employees in the community and voluntary sector, just as they are available to those engaged in the public and private sectors, to help solve human resource related problems and improve performance, and to develop effective industrial relations practices, procedures and structures so as to best meet the needs of their respective organisations.</P>

	<P>Total IT expenditure in my Department and its Statutory Offices in 2010 was &euro;6,334,328 and the budget for this expenditure for 2011 is &euro;6,450,921.  The amounts include purchase of IT hardware, software and services but do not include cost of telecommunication services.</P>
        <P>All IT purchasing within my Department and in all Offices and Agencies under my remit is subject to general public procurement rules, including requirements for competitive tendering.  My Department and the Offices and Agencies under my remit are subject to a number of <Col N="222"/>additional policy provisions to ensure best practice and value for money in IT procurement.  These include a requirement to prepare an ICT Start of Year Statement and corresponding End of Year Statement, detailing all IT expenditure, which is subject to approval by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  My Department has appropriate governance and project management processes in place; and this is achieved by having an ICT Steering Committee and through the use of project management methodology.  Also, under Department of Finance Circular 02/09 on Arrangements for ICT Expenditure in the Civil and Public Service, public bodies must implement measures to reduce reliance on external service providers, and my Department has taken steps to achieve this, including bringing forward proposals to deliver IT helpdesk services in-house.</P>

	<P>The role of my Department is to drive Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and productivity by creating the conditions where enterprise, entrepreneurship and innovation can flourish and quality employment opportunities are grown and maintained. Funding is provided to a number of State Agencies under its aegis including that of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland, through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.</P>
        <P>The role of the CEBs is to develop indigenous potential and stimulate economic activity at a local level primarily through the provision of financial and technical support for the development of small and micro-enterprises. The Boards form a nationwide support network for small business and are considered to be a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business.</P>
        <P>Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing micro-enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of priming, expansion/development and feasibility/innovation grants. The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise.  In addition, the CEBs deliver non-financial supports such as one-to-one mentoring and a range of business advice and training programmes to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises <Col N="223"/>designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow, which may be available as appropriate to the needs of the promoter&rsquo;s business. The promoter may therefore wish to contact their most appropriate CEB; the Dublin City Enterprise Board, in the first instance, to discuss what options may be available to them and their proposed business venture. The Board is located on the 5th floor, O&rsquo;Connell Bridge House, D&rsquo;Olier Street, Dublin 2; Phone No: 01 6351144, Fax No: 01 6351811; Email: info@dceb.ie; Website: <i>www.dceb.ie.</i></P>
        <P>In addition to the CEBs, the role of Enterprise Ireland is to support the development of manufacturing and internationally traded services companies. They provide funding and supports for companies ranging from entrepreneurs with plans for a high potential start-up through to large companies who are seeking to expand their activities, improve efficiency and grow their export sales. Enterprise Ireland are located at The Plaza, East Point Business Park, Dublin 3 and may be contacted by telephone at 01 727 2000 or through their website <i>www.enterprise-ireland.com</i>.</P>

This will include an assessment of the causes of the particular unemployment problems in the South-East Region. In that context, I will consider agency presence and other actions for the region. I would point out that there are six IDA staff in its Waterford office.  I understand that two of these are engaged in regional development and marketing of the South-East Region with other staff assigned to attracting and developing companies in specific sectors.</P>

        <P>On 10 August  2011 a draft standard was issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) for public comment. Interested parties have until 23 September 2011 to make submissions. All submissions will then be reviewed by the NSAI&rsquo;s Technical Committee on the Safety of Internal Window Blinds. I am informed that it is still expected that the standard will be published late in 2011.</P>

        <Quest> her plans for the introduction of mandatory pension for middle and lower income workers in the private sector; if she will give details of the proposed amount that employers would pay towards this scheme, on behalf of their employees; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The most recent coverage figures available from the Central Statistics Office indicate that just over half of workers aged between 20 and 69 had a pension at the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>The fact that supplementary pension coverage continues to be relatively low is of major concern to the Government.  That is why the Programme for Government includes a commitment to achieve universal coverage, with a particular focus on low to middle income groups.</P>
        <P>A soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme is a very proactive way in which we can increase pension coverage.  This proposal is set out in the National Pensions Framework and describes a scheme with contributions from employees, <Col N="226"/>employers and the State.  Contributions will only be in respect of earnings above a certain minimum level and below a certain maximum.</P>
        <P>An Implementation Group, chaired by my Department, has been working on the development of the details of the scheme including consideration of the contribution rate.</P>
        <P>The National Pensions Framework indicated that this scheme would be implemented in 2014 but only if this would be prudent given the economic conditions prevailing at that time.</P>

	<P>The query referred to by the Deputy asks whether the Government has any plans to raise the level of income support for families with children in the context of a named person&rsquo;s concerns that it is necessary for the Government to make efforts to support middle income families with children and to make efforts to support families with the cost of child-care.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection makes a number of payments to families with children including child benefit, qualified child increases to primary social welfare payments (QCIs), family income supplement (FIS), and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. These family and child income support payments both assist parents in contributing to the costs associated with raising children and play a very important role in the objective of reducing child poverty. The Government is conscious that these payments are an important source of income for all families, particularly during a time of recession and unemployment. Decisions on the rates for these family and child income support payments are a matter to be decided in a budgetary context.</P>
        <P>The issue of family and child income supports is currently being examined by the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which was established in June. The Group has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes.</P>
        <P>Child-care issues are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 286 and 287 together.</P><Col N="227"/>
        <P>The position in relation to the digitisation of historic civil registration records is that all the records are in digitised format and all index records are in electronic format. All birth records from the commencement of the registration of births in 1864 are available on the live computer system. Marriages from 1920 and deaths from 1924 are also available on the live system. The remaining records &mdash; marriages from the commencement of registration in 1845 to 1919, and deaths from the commencement of registration in 1864 to 1923 &mdash; are currently stored on a separate database at the headquarters of the General Register Office (GRO) in Roscommon. These records require a substantial amount of data cleaning and the linking of marriage index records with the digitised image of the register entry pages before they can be migrated to the live system. Preparations for the completion of this project are currently underway, including upgrading of the ICT infrastructure which hosts the data and the applications required to work with the data. The completion of the historic data project is an extremely labour-intensive task requiring a high level of skill, great attention to detail and extensive quality control. As the Deputy will appreciate, resources are very limited and preliminary estimates suggest that the completion of this project using the available resources will take approximately four years. All of this work will be done at GRO headquarters in Roscommon. The cost of the project to date is of the order of &euro;10 million. Initial indications are that the costs of completing the project are of the order of &euro;1.5 million.</P>
        <P>The question as to whether the civil registration indexes will be made available through a website will require careful consideration, both from an ICT viewpoint and a legal viewpoint. Currently, access to indexes is governed by section 61 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 and there are conditions surrounding such access. Any relaxation of these conditions will involve consideration of data protection, privacy and identity fraud issues.</P>
        <P>Access to civil registration records by the Church of the Latter Day Saints began in 1960 on foot of an agreement between the church and the GRO and is entirely unrelated to the GRO modernisation programme. The church required access for religious reasons and the &lsquo;quid pro quo&rsquo; was that the church would give the GRO a microfilm copy of the records for its own use. This arrangement was discontinued in the 1980s when microfilm technology became more widely available.</P>

        <Quest> the number of people who are estimated to begin drawing down additional social welfare payments as a gap solution <Col N="228"/>between reaching retirement at age 65 years and receiving the State pension at age 66 years; the cost of same to the Exchequer. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23721/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>State pension (transition) (SPT) is currently paid to people aged 65 who have a minimum yearly average of 24 social insurance contributions and who have retired from work.  Currently it ceases at age 66 when the claimant transfers to State pension (contributory) (SPC).</P>
        <P>In 2010, there was an average of 8,955 recipients of State pension (transition) with expenditure of &euro;108 million. This compares to 273,005 SPC recipients at a cost of &euro;3.45 billion.  Less than 25 per cent of the SPT customers were in employment at the time of claim while 44 per cent were on a social welfare payment prior to receiving SPT.  A further 25 per cent were retired from work at the time of claim.</P>
        <P>This means, based on recipients in 2010, that approximately 2,200 customers may be impacted (for one year) by the abolition of SPT.  They may be in a position to remain in employment or qualify for another social welfare payment. They may (the following year) be able to qualify for SPC at age 66.</P>
        <P>As announced in the National Pensions Framework, State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of State pension age at 66.  State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028. It is worth noting that, until the early 1970s, the qualifying age for State pension (contributory) was 70 years of age.  By gradually increasing the qualifying age for State pension, people will be further encouraged to remain in employment beyond 65 years of age.</P>
        <P>The Quarterly National Household Survey Q4 2010 showed that the numbers currently at work drop dramatically at 65 years of age. While 77.2 per cent of people aged 45-54 years are in employment, this drops to 64.3 per cent for 55-64 year-olds and to just 8.7 per cent  for people aged 65 years or older.  It is clear, therefore, that the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  Increases in life expectancy mean that more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  While this is to be welcomed, this has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  The fundamental principle that people need to participate in the workforce for longer needs to be emphasised and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 291, 320 and 412 together.</P><Col N="229"/>
        <P>These questions address the issue of access to unemployment payments, such as Jobseekers  Benefit, for self-employed individuals or those who were previously self-employed.  Self-employed workers are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory).   Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social welfare benefits, including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).</P>
        <P>Any proposal to extend short term benefits such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to the self-employed would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.</P>
        <P>PRSI coverage is related to the risks associated with employment or self-employment, the annualised system of contributions for self-employed people and the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payment for self-employed people.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year.  In the current climate account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.</P>

	<P>The extent to which social insurance contributions made in other countries are taken account of when eligibility for Irish benefits is being considered depends on where the contributions were made and if there are bilateral social security agreements in place.</P>
        <P>In relation to EU countries the social security rights of people living and working in these countries are governed by EU Regulations 883/04 and 987/09. The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work. These arrangements also extend to EEA countries and Switzerland.</P>
        <P>The Regulations set out the rules as to which State&rsquo;s social security system a person will pay contributions to when they move from one Member State to another to take up work, or where they live in one State and work in another. In addition, the legislation also sets out the rules as to which State will pay benefit in the event of the usual contingencies arising, e.g. unemployment, sickness, old-age etc. The general rule is that a person is insured in the State in which they are employed.</P>
        <P>With few exceptions, the State of last employment is responsible for paying benefits when, for example, a person becomes unemployed. The Regulations also provide that when entitlement to benefit is being examined insurance contributions made in any Member State where <Col N="230"/>the person has worked or lived must be aggregated. Accordingly, a person who has worked in any other EU Member State will have any contributions they have made in those countries aggregated with their Irish contributions when claiming benefits here.</P>
        <P>Ireland has social security agreements with a number of other countries including Australia, Austria, Canada, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, the United Kingdom covering the Isle of Man and Channel Islands, and the USA. There is also an agreement with Quebec. These agreements came into effect between 1989 and 2010 and protect the social welfare pension entitlements of Irish people who go to work in these countries and protect workers from those countries who come to work in Ireland. They allow workers to combine periods of Irish social insurance and, where provided for, periods of residence or contributions in the second country when applying for a pension.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Subject to conditions, it is also possible for a person who is posted abroad by their employer to remain attached, for a limited period, to the Irish social welfare system. In such circumstances, PRSI contributions continue to be paid here and the person can qualify for Irish benefits.</P>

      <sTitle>Social Welfare Fraud</sTitle>

        <asker> Deputy Robert Troy</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest> the steps she will take regarding social welfare fraud in view of the recent announcement that Ireland has issued in excess of 6 million PPS numbers for a population of 4.3 million. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22684/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The PPS No. is the individual&rsquo;s unique reference number for all dealings with Government Departments and public bodies.  This covers its use for DSP purposes as well as use by other agencies (in accordance with legislation &mdash; Section 262 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 provides the basis for the allocation, use and sharing of the PPS No.).</P>
        <P>These numbers are issued by my Department following checks on an individual&rsquo;s identity. The checks vary depending on the type of individual concerned &mdash; we accept notification via the General Register Office of births but for the last number of years (since 2000) insist on a face to face interview before issuing a PPS number to a resident of working age.</P>
        <P>There are some 7.4m records on my Department&rsquo;s central database, each identified by a PPS number. These records are for all PPS numbers ever issued so, the PPS numbers issued, and the population figure should differ. As well as all individuals currently resident in the State who have been issued with a PPS number, the figure also includes any individual who:</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />since 1979, required a PPS Number and has died,</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />has been resident in the State but has subsequently left the jurisdiction (including those born in the State since 1971) or</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />has not been resident in the State but has, for instance, benefited from an Irish Estate (the Revenue Commissioners have a requirement that all beneficiaries of Irish Estates should have a PPS Number).</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">It is not possible for me to describe all uses that other agencies have for the PPS Number, but it is worth remarking that my Department uses the number to identify an individual&rsquo;s PRSI contributions while they are working in the State. This means that, even after they have left the State, the number allocated to them remains valid. The PRSI contribution information will be relevant to calculating pension entitlements in other jurisdictions as well as this one.</P>
        <P>I will also make the point that possession of a number, in itself, does not convey any entitlement. While it can make identifying a person easier for both the individual and the agency, checks on identity and meeting the qualifying conditions for any scheme must be carried out.</P>
        <P>My Department takes its stewardship of the individual&rsquo;s data very seriously and, although any database containing the volume and historical content of its client records will contain incomplete and incorrect data, we have processes in place to monitor, correct and enhance the data that we hold. Most importantly, we also continue to enhance the processes associated with collecting the data in the first place.</P>
        <P>I am committed to a zero tolerance approach to social welfare fraud, regardless of the scheme involved or the position of the person claiming it. It is a crime and persons defrauding the social welfare system will be pursued relentlessly by my Department.</P>
        <P>The reorganisation of Departmental responsibilities along with  the addition of almost 2,000 Community Welfare Staff (CWS) and F&Aacute;S staff  to my Department will enhance our ability to interact directly with all our customers in more effective ways.  The transfer of functions brings together employment supports and associated income support services in one organisation, the National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES). Arising from this, a more integrated <Col N="234"/>approach to fraud control can now be realised.  A single customer view for control purposes will be created.</P>
        <P>I have launched a strategic fraud and control plan earlier this week to ensure a targeted response to high risk sectors and to ensure an integrated approach to the prevention, deterrence and detection of social welfare abuse across the Department&rsquo;s schemes and services.</P>
        <P>Ensuring that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department of Social Protection. My Department processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and it makes payments to over one million people every week.  The majority of payments issue to people who are fully entitled to their payment.</P>
        <P>For 2011, the Department of Social Protection has a target of reviewing 780,000 individual welfare claims and to achieve &euro;540m in control savings.  This figure is the value of the control activity in the Department and if this work did not take place there would, over time, be a similar increase in total social welfare expenditure. To the end of July, my Department has carried out reviews on over 350,000 individual claims and have achieved control savings totalling almost &euro;345m.</P>
        <P>The control emphasis under the new control plan will be on increasing home visits by investigators and comprehensive face to face interviews of persons suspected of fraudulent activity. There will be a re-emphasis towards onsite inspections to increase a visible Departmental presence across those sectors of the economy where social welfare fraud is prevalent.</P>
        <P>The Department has introduced a number of new measures to target control activity at high risk categories of claimants.  In excess of 450,000 reviews will be undertaken in the working age cohort. The Department supplements reviews of entitlement by the frequent use of direct mail shot letters, particularly in relation to eligibility for child benefit.</P>
        <P>In the case of persons receiving illness and disability payments, recipients are reviewed on a systematic basis through medical assessments and examinations, the frequency of which relates to the nature of the illness of disability. Residency checks on social welfare claims of specific cohorts of customers are undertaken nationwide in order to determine whether their residency status in the State is fulfilled.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit will undertake a series of targeted national projects aimed at the prevention and detection of social welfare fraud in high risk sectors, schemes and client cohorts. The unit will also work closely and collaboratively with other compliance and fraud investigation agencies to ensure that Social Welfare abuse is comprehensively deterred and detected (i.e. Revenue, NERA, and Garda Sioch&aacute;na).</P>
        <P>A key aspect of control policy is to ensure that appropriate deterrents and sanctions are applied in instances where social welfare fraud has been detected.  Where people  have been overpaid the Department will take appropriate steps to recover this debt, including deductions being made from ongoing social welfare payments, lump-sum recoveries, or the instigation of civil proceedings where appropriate. It is the Department&rsquo;s policy to consider for prosecution all cases of fraud against the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>Public Service cards are to come into use later this year. The PSC will include a photograph and signature. One of the anticipated advantages of the new card is that it will help to reduce fraud and error which result from the incorrect identification of benefit claimants.</P>
        <P>My Department is very conscious of its obligation to protect public money and is determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.</P>

        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that the person concerned was refused rent supplement on the grounds that his partner is in full time employment and because both the person concerned and his partner had owned dwelling houses which were voluntarily transferred/willed to family members.</P>
        <P>The HSE Appeals Office has advised that it has received an appeal from the person concerned against this decision on 18th July and that the appeal is currently awaiting decision.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware the Government has provided various types of support to people affected by the November 2009 flooding. Humanitarian Aid payments were made, both in the immediate aftermath of the flooding and subsequently to enable eligible households to resume living at their home. Flood relief works were also undertaken in some of the affected areas and other works are at an advanced state of preparation. Discussions also took place with representatives of the insurance industry regarding giving households access to appropriate house insurance at a reasonable cost.</P>
        <P>Subject to certain conditions the Government also decided to provide support to a small number of families who are continuing to experience significant housing problems as a result of the November 2009 flooding and are considering the possibility of relocating rather than resuming living at their original home.</P>
        <P>The household of the person concerned and all of the other households have been visited by officials from the Department and reports of their individual circumstances have been completed. The Department has received a report from the Office of Public Works in relation to the house of the person concerned and expects to be in a position to make a decision on the case in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>Qualification for domiciliary care allowance is dependent on the child having a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention substantially in excess of the care and attention normally required by a child of the same age and likely to require this level of care for at least 12 months.</P>
        <P>In advance of the transfer of the scheme from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection in 2009, medical guidelines were established to identify conditions which are more likely to result in a child meeting the qualifying condition and those less likely to result in the child qualifying.</P>
        <P>These lists are for the guidance of medical assessor&rsquo;s, however no condition automatically rules a child in or out of qualification for the allowance.  Applications for children with Asperger syndrome are processed in exactly the same manner as an application for a child with any other condition, with each application being assessed on its own merits.</P>

	<P>The query referred to by the Deputy asks whether the Government has any plans to cut Child Benefit in the next Budget and whether tax relief will be available on  Child Benefit. Child benefit is a universal payment that assists parents in both contributing to the costs associated with raising children and, together with more targeted child-related payments, in reducing child poverty.  The Government is conscious that this payment is an important source of income for all families, particularly during a time of recession and unemployment.</P>
        <P>Any plans to change the child benefit rates are a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day. Taxation matters are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>

        <Quest> the reason the bereavement grant is not made available to families in need in circumstances when the deceased is a disabled adult and the disability was an impediment to working and making PRSI contributions and likewise the disability was an impediment to the person with a disability marrying; and the further reason the current regulations governing the availability of the grant specify that where the deceased is an adult his or her spouse must have made 26 PRSI contributions. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bereavement Grant is a payment designed to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses. It is a scheme that relates specifically to those who have made PRSI contributions and is payable on the death of an insured person, his/her spouse and dependent children under age 18 or under age 22 if in full-time education.</P><Col N="239"/>
        <P>In 2007 the bereavement grant was extended to the next of kin of deceased recipients of disability allowance aged between 16 and 22 years.</P>
        <P>There are a wide range of benefits available to people who have paid social insurance.   Entitlement to these benefits is dependent on the number of contributions and the class of contribution.  Long term payments, such as the State pension (contributory), require a significant number of contributions given the value of the pension.  The bereavement grant is available on the basis of only 26 contributions by the deceased or his or her spouse.  This is significantly fewer contributions than are required by most other PRSI based payments.</P>
        <P>I recognise of course that there are people who are unable to satisfy the minimum PRSI requirements. For that reason, where there are no or insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for bereavement grant a person may receive assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Under this arrangement, the Community Welfare Officer may make a single payment to help meet exceptional expenditure, for example, for funeral expenses, which a family could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their income.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment.  Each application is determined based on the particular circumstances of the case.</P>
        <P>There are no rights to payments to cover communion/confirmation costs or the cost of other religious ceremonies. The payment of an ENP and the amount of any payment is at the discretion of the Community Welfare Officer (CWO) based on his/her experience and judgement having considered all the relevant facts of the case including the average cost of the item required.</P><Col N="240"/>
        <P>ENP&rsquo;s are a key support for low income households and payments are only made after careful consideration of all the circumstances of an individual case.  In 2010 approximately 12,650 payments were made in respect of communion, confirmation and other religious ceremonies at a cost of some &euro;3.2m.</P>

	<P>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) scheme operates from the beginning of June until the end of September each year.</P>
        <P>The administrative arrangements for the 2011 BSCFA scheme differ from those that applied in previous years. For this year, the majority of BSCFA entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers, 127,000 households in respect of over 250,000 children received their payment automatically in June.</P>
        <P>Those customers who did not receive an automated payment are required to complete and return an application form to the Department. The timescale for determining applications for Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance claims is dependent on a number of factors including: the number of applications received, when the application is lodged, the availability of the required information such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements and other relevant information regarding an individual&rsquo;s application.</P>
        <P>In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</P>
        <P>Staff are working as quickly as possible on clearing the large volume of manual application claims received. Based on the current volume of applications it could take up to 8 weeks from date of receipt to process claims. Departmental records show that an application form was received from the person concerned on 3rd August 2011 and it is expected he will be notified of the outcome of his claim shortly.</P>

	<P>The savings in the fuel allowance scheme and household benefits package were provided for last December in Budget 2011 but were not specified or announced by the Government at that time.</P>
        <P>From September 2011 the fuel allowance is to be standardised at &euro;20 per week, the rate currently received by the majority of customers, with no additional allowance for living in a smokeless area.</P>
        <P>The rationale for paying the smokeless allowance to customers in smokeless areas cannot be maintained.  The price differential between the types of coal is as low as 2% while the allowance represents an addition of 20% to the fuel allowance.  Use of coal has dropped considerably, to about 3%.  It is inequitable to continue paying this top-up allowance to some customers and not others when the purpose for which it was intended no longer applies.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection will spend over &euro;530 million in 2011 on the Fuel Scheme and the telephone, gas and electricity elements of the Household Benefits package which will benefit over 630,000 people.

	<P>I do not tolerate social welfare fraud, regardless of the scheme involved or the position of the person claiming it. It is a crime and persons defrauding the social welfare system will be pursued by my Department. </P>
        <P>The reorganisation of Departmental responsibilities along with the addition of almost 2,000 Community Welfare Staff (CWS) and F&Aacute;S staff to my Department will enhance our ability to interact directly with all our customers in more effective ways.  The transfer of functions brings together employment supports and associated income support services in one organisation, the National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES). Arising from this, a more integrated approach to fraud control can now be realised.  A single customer view for control purposes will be created.</P>
        <P>I have launched a strategic fraud and control plan earlier this week to ensure a targeted response to high risk sectors and to ensure an integrated approach to the prevention, deterrence and detection of social welfare abuse across the Department&rsquo;s schemes and services.</P>
        <P>Ensuring that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department of Social Protection. My Department processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and it makes payments to some 1.4 million people every week.  The majority of payments issue to people who are fully entitled to their payment.</P>
        <P>For 2011, the Department of Social Protection has a target of reviewing 780,000 individual welfare claims and to achieve &euro;540m in control savings.  This figure is the value of the control activity in the Department and if this work did not take place there would, over time, be a similar increase in total social welfare expenditure.  To the end of July, my Department has carried out reviews on over 350,000 individual claims and have achieved control savings totalling almost &euro;345m.</P>
        <P>The control emphasis under the new control plan will be on increasing home visits by investigators and comprehensive face to face interviews of persons suspected of fraudulent activity.  There will be a re-emphasis towards on-site inspections to increase a visible Departmental presence across those sectors of the economy where social welfare fraud is prevalent.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit will undertake a series of targeted national projects aimed at the prevention and detection of social welfare fraud in high risk sectors, schemes and client cohorts. The unit will also work closely and collaboratively with other <Col N="243"/>compliance and fraud investigation agencies to ensure that Social Welfare abuse is comprehensively deterred and detected (i.e. Revenue, NERA, and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na).</P>
        <P>A key aspect of control policy is to ensure that appropriate deterrents and sanctions are applied in instances where social welfare fraud has been detected.  Where people have been overpaid the Department will take appropriate steps to recover this debt, including deductions being made from ongoing social welfare payments, lump-sum recoveries, or the instigation of civil proceedings where appropriate. It is the Department&rsquo;s policy to consider for prosecution all cases of fraud against the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>Public Service cards are to come into use later this year.  The card will include a photograph and signature.  One of the advantages of the new card is that it will help to reduce fraud and error which result from the incorrect identification of benefit claimants.</P>
        <P>My Department is very conscious of its obligation to protect public money and is determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.</P>

        <P>The administrative arrangements for the 2011 BSCFA scheme differ from those that applied in previous years. For this year, the majority of BSCFA entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers. Not every household had to apply for a payment under the BSCFA scheme this year, 127,000 households in respect of some 250,000 children received their payment automatically in June.</P>
        <P>Those customers who did not receive an automated payment are required to complete and return an application form to the Department. The timescale for determining applications for Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance claims is dependent on a number of factors <Col N="244"/>including: the number of applications received, when the application is lodged, the availability of the required information such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements and other relevant information regarding an individual&rsquo;s application.</P>
        <P>In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</P>
        <P>While the majority of cases have been processed in advance of the new school year it is regretted that for some families this was not possible. Following the conclusion of the 2011 scheme, the Department intends to review all aspects of the scheme.  The question of the timeframe for submission of claims for the scheme will be considered in the context of the review</P>

	<P>The One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) is a means-tested payment for men and women who are bringing up a child or children up to the age of 14 years without the support of a partner.  Lone parents are not a homogenous group.  A claimant must be widowed, a surviving civil partner, separated, divorced, have a dissolved civil partnership, or be a prisoner&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner.  The OFP is, along with other social welfare payments, made up of a personal rate and of additional amounts for dependent children.  The current payment rate is &euro;188.00 per week &mdash; with a further &euro;29.80 for each additional qualified child.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to cease the payment of additional amounts for all qualified dependent children so long as the conditions for the payment of OFP are met.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.

        <P>ENPs are a key support for low income households and payments are only made after careful consideration of all the circumstances of an individual case.  Exceptional needs payments are not normally requested for food items and thus there are no statistics available on the average or waiting times for the processing of such applications.

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 46 of 20 July 2011, if the poverty impact assessment referred to specifically examine the impact of the changes to the household benefits package scheme that are scheduled to take effect from September 2011; if not, the reason she did not arrange for a poverty impact assessment of the changes to be undertaken prior to her decision. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23165/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The poverty impact assessment referred to in the previous Parliamentary Question was carried out in the context of developing a range of options for the future administration of the household benefits package in a de-regulated domestic energy market.  While this focused on the potential impact of changing the electricity allowance from a unit base to a cash base to avail of cheaper rates available it also examined the issue of the vulnerability of older people who are the main recipients of the household benefits package.</P>
        <P>Data for the 2009 EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) show that households comprising predominantly older people had lower consistent poverty rates than other age categories. Single adults aged over 65 with no children had a consistent poverty rate of 0.6% while people in households with 2 adults at least one of whom was aged 65 or over with no children had a consistent poverty rate of 1.0%. In 2009, in the general population, 5.5% of people were in consistent poverty.  Given the low consistent poverty rate, it was considered that the information gathered in the existing poverty impact assessment was sufficient.</P>
        <P>While of course we want to protect the basic social welfare payments which have very positive economic and social effects, regrettably there is an ongoing necessity to achieve savings due to our commitments with the IMF/EU/ECB Troika.  There will be an ongoing necessity to curtail overall expenditure in 2012 and in later years.  My Department will spend over 530 million in 2011 on the fuel scheme and the telephone, gas and electricity elements of the household benefits package which will benefit over 630,000 people.</P><Col N="246"/>
        <P>Energy poverty is a factor of income, energy prices and the thermal efficiency of the home. The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty is to reduce their consumption of energy through improving the thermal efficiency of the home.  Sustainable Energy Ireland has administered an energy efficiency programme for privately owned low income households (Warmer Homes) since 2001. Over 65,000 such households have benefited to date, with a further 15,000 expected to receive energy efficiency upgrades this year. A similar upgrade programme is also in place for local authority houses.</P>

	<P>The legislative basis which provides for the introduction of the Partial Capacity Benefit scheme is contained in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2010, which was enacted by the Oireachtas in December 2010.</P>
        <P>The partial capacity benefit scheme will be open to people who are in receipt of invalidity pension or who have been in receipt of illness benefit for a minimum of six months.  Participation in the scheme will be voluntary and the scheme is designed in particular to respond to the needs of people who currently seek to avail of &lsquo;exemptions&rsquo; in order to take up employment opportunities.</P>
        <P>The regulations which are currently in the course of preparation will elaborate on the detail of the operation of the scheme and will formally set out, for instance, the rates of payment which will apply to those who avail of the scheme and the medical criteria which may be taken into account by the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors in determining partial employment capacity.  The normal process for introducing regulations will be followed for the partial capacity benefit regulations.</P>
        <P>The development of the scheme has been the subject of regular consultation with stakeholders through the Department&rsquo;s disability consultative fora.  The priority at this stage is to complete all the necessary steps, including the development of an appropriate IT platform, in order to ensure that the scheme will be introduced before the end of this year.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) advised that the persons concerned were awarded mortgage interest supplement for a 12 month period which ended in July 2011. This payment was made as an exceptional measure as the amount of mortgage interest payable by the claimant was in excess of the amount the HSE consider reasonable to meet his or her residential needs.</P>
        <P>The HSE advised that the persons concerned appealed this decision to the HSE Appeals office and this decision has been upheld.

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is presumed that the Deputy is referring to JobBridge &mdash; the National Internship Scheme.  In recent times JobBridge has received media attention concerning the measures in place to minimise displacement. In order for an application from a host organisation to be approved it must meet a number of criteria so as to ensure that the potential internship is one of quality.  These include the following:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />that the internship does not allow the intern to work unsupervised;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />that the internship is not displacing an employee; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />that the intern accrues significant experience throughout the entire internship.</P>

        <P>To ensure compliance with the scheme, the Department of Social Protection and the Employment Services Division of F&Aacute;S are monitoring internships to ensure that they are of sufficient quality and that both host organisations and interns are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme.</P>
        <P>This involves the monitoring of monthly compliance reports that are required to be submitted by the host organisation verifying that the internship is proceeding as set out in the Standard Internship Agreement. In addition, contact with the host organisations and interns, including random site visits, will begin shortly as part of this process.</P>
        <P>A &ldquo;whistle blowing&rdquo; feature has been introduced, where any individual who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme&rsquo;s criteria, including in cases of suspected displacement, may contact the National Call Centre.

	<P>The purpose of the Back to School Clothing &amp; Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) scheme is to assist families on social welfare and Health Service Executive payments towards the cost of uniforms and footwear for children who are attending school. </P>
        <P>The administrative arrangements for the 2011 BSCFA scheme differ from those that applied in previous years.  This year the scheme is being administered directly by the Department of Social Protection and the majority of BSCFA entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers.  Customers who did not receive an automated payment are required to complete application forms which are being processed from a centralised unit in the Department&rsquo;s office in Letterkenny.</P>
        <P>Following the conclusion of the 2011 scheme, the Department intends to review all aspects of the scheme.  The question of the making of payments directly to schools will be considered in the context of the review.</P>

	<P>The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU Regulations which co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of EU Regulations, Irish Child Benefit is classified as a Family Benefit and there are specific rules governing the payment of these benefits.  EU Nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families reside in another EU Member State may have an entitlement to family benefits in Ireland under EU Regulations.</P>
        <P>Child Benefit is currently being paid in respect of 7,635 non-resident children of 4,836 families spread throughout all twenty six Member States.  A breakdown of these customers by country is not readily available.  In 2010, the total cost was &euro;15.4million. This represents less than 1% of total Child Benefit expenditure.</P>

	<P>The person concerned submitted an application for Back To Education Allowance.  A condition for receipt of Back To Education Allowance is that a person must be in receipt of a social welfare payment for 234 days prior to commencement of the course.  Another criteria for receipt of Back To Education Allowance is that a person must be commencing the first year of an approved course of study.  As this person does not fulfil either of the above conditions, Back To Education Allowance was disallowed.</P>

	<P>The staff of the Community Welfare Service (CWS) was seconded to my Department from the HSE at the beginning of this year and the intention is to have staff fully integrated within the Department by the beginning of next month.</P>
        <P>The main function of the Community Welfare Officers (CWOs), who make up the CWS, is to administer the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Scheme on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>While CWOs work closely with social workers and other support services provided by the HSE, their role is quite distinct and different from that of a social worker.  Their primary function is to review client applications for Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) payments. In doing this they gather information in order to assess the client&rsquo;s means and their <Col N="261"/>needs.  In cases where the client&rsquo;s needs are not met by income support payments the CWO may refer the client to other services (including social workers).  Although this can give rise to overlaps with regard to the collection and sharing of information we do all we can to minimise duplication within the parameters of Data Protection Law.</P>

	<P>Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the HSE based on the particular circumstances of the case.  Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that the application for assistance from the person concerned was granted in August 2011.  Additionally the person concerned is in receipt of a weekly supplement from the HSE under the SWA scheme.</P>
        <P>Should the person concerned require further assistance they should contact the community welfare officer (CWO) in their local Health Centre in order that an assessment of their entitlements can be further examined.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to providing a high quality service to our customers and to ensuring that all payments are made available on their due date.  We offer a range of payment options to customers including payment at a local post office or to a bank or building society account or certain credit unions that have been authorised by the banking and credit union regulators.  While the Department accounts for a large volume of retail customers in individual post offices, An Post also provide agency services for other companies including front line banking services and payment of utility bills etc.  The Department has been advised by An Post that due to a heavy volume of business, Lucan Post Office experienced a greater than expected demand for cash in week ending 3rd September 2011 and as a result, was unable to deal with all of its customers.  The nature and cause of this is not completely clear as yet.  An Post made extra cash available at Lucan on Saturday and again on Monday to deal with the higher than usual level of financial transactions.  An Post has advised that some 20 social welfare customers who could not be dealt with on the Friday or Saturday were dealt with on the following Monday.</P>
        <P>An Post has advised that this occurrence was confined to Lucan Post Office.</P><Col N="262"/>

While apologising to customers who were inconvenienced by what happened, An Post has offered this Department assurances that measures are being put in place to ensure that this will not happen again.</P>

	<P>The overall objective of labour market policy is to provide a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register so that as employment opportunities become available they can be taken up by those on the Register.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For this reason, in order to be eligible to participate in JobBridge &mdash;  the National Internship Scheme, an individual must:</P>
        <P Just="Left" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66"/> Currently be  in receipt of a live claim (Jobseekers Allowance/Jobseekers Benefit/Signing for Social Insurance Contribution Credits) on the Live Register, and</P>
        <P Just="Left" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66"/> Have been in receipt of Jobseekers Benefit, Jobseekers Allowance or signing for Social Insurance Contribution Credits for a total of 3 months or more in the last 6 months.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, it is imperative to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.  This will ensure that those availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will gain work experience and so be in a better position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, eligibility for the scheme is confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 months.  In so designing the scheme, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it and ensure a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.</P>
        <P>Individuals who are in receipt of a disability allowance can access the F&Aacute;S Work Placement Programme, which provides participants with a work experience placement of between two and nine months.  During this time participants may be able to retain their social welfare entitlements.</P>
        <P>In addition, people in receipt of a disability allowance can access a range of other specific programmes, such as the Supported Employment Programme and the Wage Subsidy Scheme.  Both of these programmes aim to assist people with a disability to secure and maintain a job in the labour market.</P>

        <P>The persons concerned were refused BSCFA as their income exceeded the limit allowable for their family composition.  Your request for a review of their entitlements has been forwarded to the BSCFA review section in Letterkenny who will arrange to have the review completed as soon as possible.  However, due to the large volume of applications received, information regarding the progress of individual reviews will not be available until such time as the applications have been examined and a decision taken.</P>

	<P>The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes provide income support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative employment.  It is a fundamental qualifying condition for these benefits that a person must be available for full-time work.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, with a consequent increase in the number of atypical workers.  In response, the Department conducted a &lsquo;Review of the Application of the Unemployment Benefit and Assistance Schemes Conditions to workers who are not employed on a full-time basis&rsquo; which examined the application of the jobseekers benefit and allowance scheme conditions to workers who are employed part-time, casual or systematic short-time basis.</P>
        <P>The review made a number of recommendations which are under active consideration within the Department.  These considerations are taking place in the context of the &lsquo;Report on the desirability and feasibility of introducing a single social assistance payment for people of working age&rsquo;, the current economic situation, and the considerable administrative and IT change that implementation of the recommendations would require.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case.</P>
        <P>There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.  In the context of dealing with the considerable number of appeals now on hand, the Department has made 9 additional appointments to the office earlier this year.</P>
        <P>While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person&rsquo;s oral hearing will be heard, but she will be informed when arrangements have been made.</P>

	<P>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) scheme operates from the beginning of June until the end of September each year.</P>
        <P>The administrative arrangements for the 2011 BSCFA scheme differ from those that applied in previous years.  For this year, the majority of BSCFA entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers, 127,000 households in respect of over 250,000 children received their payment automatically in June.</P>
        <P>Those customers who did not receive an automated payment are required to complete and return an application form to the Department.  The timescale for determining applications for Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance claims is dependent on a number of factors including: the number of applications received, when the application is lodged, the availability of the required information such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements and other relevant information regarding an individual&rsquo;s application.</P>
        <P>In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</P>
        <P>Staff are working as quickly as possible on clearing the large volume of manual application claims received.  Based on the current volume of applications it could take up to 8 weeks from date of receipt to process claims.  Departmental records show that an application form was received from the person concerned on 20th July 2011 and it is expected she will be notified of the outcome of her claim shortly.</P>

However, people participating in approved courses under the Back To Education Allowance scheme receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the maximum rate of their previous social welfare payment and may retain any rent supplement which was in payment prior to the commencement of their education course.  Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is payable to people participating in approved second or third level courses.</P>

        <P>Following this medical examination and having considered all the evidence, the appeals officer disallowed the appeal for the person concerned.

	<P>An application for domiciliary care allowance was received on the 18th August 2011 from the person in question.  This application was referred to one of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors who found that her child was not medically eligible for the allowance.  In order to qualify a child must have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.</P>
        <P>A letter issued to the person in question on the 8th September 2011 advising her of the decision.  In the case of an application which is refused on medical grounds, the applicant may submit additional information and/or ask for the case to be reviewed or they may appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office within 21 days.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer having fully considered all the available evidence disallowed the appeal of the person concerned by way of a summary decision.  Notification of the Appeals Officers decision issued 30 April 2011.</P>
        <P>Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of the Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed by the Appeals Officer in the light of new evidence or new facts.  The legislation also provides that an Appeals Officer may decide a case before him/her on the basis of the documentary evidence.  This course of action was taken in the case of the person concerned as it was considered that an oral hearing was not warranted.</P>
        <P>Following the submission of additional evidence the Appeals Officer has agreed to review the case.  The person concerned will be contacted when the review of her appeal has been finalised.</P>

	<P>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) scheme operates from the beginning of June until the end of September each year.</P>
        <P>The administrative arrangements for the 2011 BSCFA scheme differ from those that applied in previous years.  For this year, the majority of BSCFA entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers, 127,000 households in respect of over 250,000 children received their payment automatically in June.</P>
        <P>Those customers who did not receive an automated payment are required to complete and return an application form to the Department.  The timescale for determining applications for Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance claims is dependent on a number of factors including: the number of applications received, when the application is lodged, the availability of the required information such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements and other relevant information regarding an individual&rsquo;s application.</P>
        <P>In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</P>
        <P>Staff are working as quickly as possible on clearing the large volume of manual application claims received.  Based on the current volume of applications it could take up to 8 weeks from date of receipt to process claims.  Departmental records show that an application form was received from the person concerned on 29th July 2011 and it is expected she will be notified of the outcome of her claim shortly.</P>

	<P>A death benefit pension under the Occupational Injuries scheme is payable to the widow, widower or surviving civil partner of a person who dies as a result of an occupational injury or prescribed occupational disease or who was in receipt of a disablement pension assessed with a loss of faculty of 50% or higher, at the time of death.  The weekly rate for a person over age 66 is &euro;234.70.   The person concerned applied for a death benefit pension in respect of her late husband, a former miner, who died in 1998 and who had never applied for disablement benefit or occupational injury benefit.</P>
        <P>As the person concerned was unable to supply medical evidence in support of her application that her late husband died as a result of a prescribed occupational disease, her application was refused.</P>
        <P>She has appealed that decision and the case has been referred to the Social Welfare Appeals Office for a final decision.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office are independent of my Department but as soon as a decision is made, she will be notified of the outcome.</P>
        <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of a widow&rsquo;s contributory pension from my Department of &euro;230.30 weekly.  Should the Social Welfare Appeals Office rule in her favour, she would be required to transfer from the widow&rsquo;s contributory pension to the death benefit pension.</P>

	<P>The remit of the Citizens Information Board (CIB), under the aegis of my Department, is to provide advocacy on public and social services for all citizens.  It fulfils this remit through the network of Citizens Information Services (CIS) where trained staff and volunteers will assist people, many of whom are over 65 years of age, in accessing entitlements and negotiating with providers on their behalf.  </P>
        <P>In addition, the Citizens Information Act (2007) conferred responsibility on the CIB for the provision of advocacy services for people with disabilities.  In this regard, the National Advocacy Service (NAS) was established, which is an independent, representative advocacy service for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>A National Advocacy Programme Alliance, established by the HSE, provides independent advocacy services for older people in residential care settings.  A working group was set up to progress this plan, which includes representation from the CIB.  Currently there are 250 volunteers trained under the programme, delivering volunteer advocacy services to over 2,500 people in 89 nursing homes and community units around the country. The service is now moving to Third Age to ensure independence from service providers, with funding provided by the HSE.</P>
        <P>The NAS will work closely with the Third Age volunteer programme for older people and take referrals where particularly vulnerable older people are at risk.</P><Col N="279"/>
        <P>As well as providing information, advice, and advocacy to older people, the CIB will work closely with older people&rsquo;s organisations, such as Third Age, Age Action and the Alzheimer Society in providing different types of advocacy for older people with disabilities.</P>

	<P>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year. The administrative arrangements for the 2011 Scheme are different from those that applied in previous years. For this year, the majority of Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance entitlements will be fully automated with no application form required from customers.</P>
        <P>Customers who did not receive an automated payment are required to complete application forms which are being processed from one centralised unit within the Department of Social Protection.</P>
        <P>This change to the administrative arrangements saw some 127,000 households receive their payment automatically in June of this year.</P>
        <P>Manual applications have been accepted since the start of July and up to last Friday (9th September) 81,000 applications have been received. Claims continue to arrive at over 700 per day however this is down from a high of 3,000 per day received in the first two weeks of July, and 2,000 per day in the second two weeks of July, and 1,500 at the end of July/ beginning of August.</P>
        <P>Of the 81,000 claims received almost 45,000 have been processed. 33,000 have been paid, 5,000 refused, 5,500 returned because there was insufficient information and there were 1,300 duplicate claims</P><Col N="282"/>
        <P>The Department is working to clear the claims as quickly as possible.  38 staff were originally provided to process these claims, an additional 14 staff were assigned in mid-August bringing the staff complement to 52.  This number has now been increased to 60 staff with overtime also being worked.</P>
        <P>The timescale for determining applications for BSCFA claims is dependant, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements, etc. In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</P>

	<P>In order to qualify for family income supplement (FIS), a person must (inter alia) be an employee who is engaged in remunerative employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight.</P>
        <P>When a person is absent from work due to illness and claims illness benefit (IB), both FIS and illness benefit are only payable for a period of 6 weeks. Section 247(7) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 provides for the withdrawal of FIS after 6 weeks where a person is in receipt of illness benefit.</P>
        <P>The person concerned received both FIS and illness benefit concurrently until 27 July 2011 when payment of FIS was withdrawn as the 6 week period allowed for concurrent payment of these benefits had expired.</P>
        <P>Subsequently the person concerned made an application for carer&rsquo;s benefit indicating that she had ceased work to provide full time care to her husband. Arrangements are currently being made to award carer&rsquo;s benefit with effect from 15 September 2011 and the person concerned will be notified directly.</P>
        <P>A disability allowance application was received on 6 July 2011 for the husband of the person concerned.  His claim is currently being assessed by a medical assessor from this Department.  His claim is also awaiting a decision on his weekly means.  Claims are dealt with as quickly as possible and in date order of receipt in the Department.  A decision on his entitlement to disability allowance will be issued as soon as possible and he will be notified directly of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the meantime the person concerned continues to receive a weekly supplementary welfare allowance payment for the family pending the award of her carer&rsquo;s benefit.</P>

	<P>The person concerned has not submitted a claim for Disability Allowance.   I believe the Deputy is referring to a claim for invalidity pension.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was awarded an invalidity pension from 24th January 2008.</P>
        <P>On 16th October 2009 she was called for and attended a medical examination and was assessed in-person by a medical assessor. It was decided that she no longer satisfied the medical criteria for invalidity pension.  Accordingly, her invalidity pension payment was terminated from the 5th November 2009.</P>
        <P>She appealed this decision and was referred for a second in-person medical examination. She attended this medical examination on 17th February 2010. This medical examination was carried out by a different medical assessor.  The opinion of the second medical assessor also was that the person concerned did not satisfy the medical criteria.</P>
        <P>Following this medical examination and having considered all the evidence, the appeals officer disallowed the appeal for the person concerned. She was notified of this decision, and the reason for it, in writing on the 26th October 2010.   The decision of an appeals officer is final and conclusive in the absence of fresh facts or evidence.</P>
        <P>The person concerned subsequently submitted further written medical evidence which was referred to a medical assessor for their consideration. The opinion of this medical assessor was that the further medical evidence provided did not contain any fresh facts or evidence in the case.  Consequently, the person in question remains ineligible for invalidity pension.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to review the operation of the rent supplement scheme with a view to introducing a code of conduct for rent supplement eligibility similar to that which operates for local authority tenants. The purpose of this review is to ensure that tenants who are receiving long term support from the State under the rent supplement scheme are subject to the same type of anti-social behaviour regime as local authority tenants. The most appropriate way for this to happen is for local authorities to take over responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of these individuals. My Department is currently working with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to achieving this goal.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 435 and 449 together.</P><Col N="290"/>
        <P>Connemara National Park was established in 1980, combining land from a number of sources, including Kylemore Abbey, Coillte Teoranta and a number of private landowners. The Park is managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department.</P>
        <P>The main remit of NPWS is the conservation of our natural heritage and the National Park provides a valuable amenity for both locals and visitors to the area and encourages the development of sustainable tourism in the locality. The main purpose of the Park&rsquo;s exhibition area is to interpret the landscape and natural heritage of the National Park and the surrounding area through information exhibits and special events, such as children&rsquo;s activities, guided walks and evening talks which are organised throughout the year.</P>
        <P>While the graveyard and some outbuildings from the former Letterfrack Industrial School lie within the boundaries of the National Park the main building which housed the School does not. With regard to the graveyard itself, its enhancement was facilitated and funded by the NPWS and the area is treated with dignity and respect and is cared for by NPWS staff who maintain it to the highest standards. In addition, there is appropriate signage in place where the access path to the graveyard leaves the main route in the Park.</P>
        <P>The appropriate means of highlighting the history of the Letterfrack Industrial School and other such institutions and any commemoration of those who spent time there are matters that falls outside the primary remit of the NPWS and may be more appropriate to the Department of Education and Skills. I understand from enquiries made to that Department&rsquo;s Residential Institution Redress Unit that, as part of the implementation of the recommendations of the Ryan Report, an independent committee was appointed by the Minister for Education and Skills to oversee the design and commissioning of a memorial for those affected by institutional abuse. Following the consultative process, a competition is being organised and administered on behalf of the committee by the Commissioners of Public Works. The competition is open to all, including those who might wish to make proposals for an appropriate memorial to those affected by institutional abuse in Letterfrack Industrial School. I am advised that the closing date for receipt of expressions of interest is Thursday 13of October 2011 and details of the competition, including selection criteria, indicative dates and competition jury membership, is available on at <i>www.education.ie</i> and <i>www.publicart.ie.</i></P>

	<P>The species referred to by the Deputy was first introduced to Ireland over 100 years ago. It forms dense thickets along roadsides, waste-grounds and waterways, reproduces by vegetative means and is difficult to kill off once it becomes established.</P>
        <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department is currently working with the Northern Ireland Environment Agency to fund and manage the Invasive Species Ireland project. This initiative provides advice and guidance on the management of a range of invasive species, including the species referred to, which can negatively impact on the environment and on property on the island of Ireland.  Best Practice Management Guidelines for the species in question have been published and can be accessed on the project website at <i>www.invasivespeciesireland.com</i>.  I understand that this guidance is currently undergoing review following changes in legislation and refinement of good practice in the management of the species. The updated guidance will be made publicly available during the month of October.</P><Col N="291"/>

	<P>My Department, in association with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, is currently undertaking a review of all commonage framework plans. The review will provide the basis for the sustainable grazing of commonages, to avoid both over-grazing and under-grazing. It is envisaged that a minimum and maximum stocking level will be set for each commonage townland and owners of shares in the commonage will be notified of these levels. Farmers will be able to farm freely once these stocking levels are observed and the land is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition.</P>
        <P>Farmers in certain areas, which are still assessed as being in bad condition, will continue to have their stock levels restricted over the next two years. The issue of financial assistance will be examined in the light of the review and of Departmental budgets.</P>

	<P>The curlew is red-listed as a globally threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature since 2007. A recent survey published by BirdWatch Ireland indicated that, based on the results of a survey to find breeding curlews in counties Donegal and Mayo, the current number of breeding pairs in the State is less than 200.  However, there is a large influx of curlews into Ireland every winter and the winter numbers have not shown a parallel decline.</P>
        <P>The cause of the decline in breeding pairs is not clear. It is possible that the loss of habitat in upland areas, where afforestation, commercial peat-cutting and windfarm developments have taken place, is a factor in the decline of the species. It is also likely that the spread of forestry has boosted the number of foxes and grey crows, both very efficient predators of nests.</P>
        <P>Under the Open Seasons Order the hunting of curlew is allowed in the month of November only. My Department is reviewing its inclusion on the shooting list in view of the steep decline in breeding curlews. My Department is also engaging in a process of investigations and consultations with relevant parties with a view to ascertaining the causes of the decline and putting in place appropriate supportive measures.</P>

	<P>Culture Ireland operates a quarterly grant scheme to support the international presentation of work by Irish artists.  To be eligible for funding, the primary purpose of the proposed international visit must be to present the work of Irish artists to a wide audience through performance or exhibition.  All applicants must demonstrate how the event will meet the following criteria: quality of work and track record of artist/company; level of geographic priority for Culture Ireland; profile of international venue/festival; financial viability of the event (including level of support from presenter/other partners); proven capacity of applicant to present work internationally; and wider promotional and media impact.</P>
        <P>Decisions on funding applications are based on the extent to which they meet these criteria.  In assessing the financial viability of the event, Culture Ireland considers the detailed budget for the event which must accompany the application and funding for selected projects is only offered where there is a budgetary shortfall.  In supporting an event, Culture Ireland will typically offer funding towards the costs of travel/transport and sometimes also accommodation/subsistence, i.e. costs which relate directly to the international presentation of the event.  Culture Ireland does not fund fees or production costs.  The list of projects grant-funded by Culture Ireland is available on the website <i>www.cultureireland.ie</i>.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The majority of the funds in question were capital grants made under the ACCESS II grant scheme and apply to major capital projects.  Applications were made in 2006 following advertisements in the national media.  The decision-making process was lead by an independent assessment committee under the chairmanship of Mr John Fitzgerald, former Dublin City Council Manager.  Grants were allocated in 2007 and again in 2008 based on the recommendations made by this committee.  Because of their technical nature, capital projects usually involve multiple year drawdowns.</P>
        <P>Allocations made under my Department&rsquo;s Cultural Technology Scheme in 2010 were also decided by an independent assessment committee under the chairmanship of Ms Karlin Lillington.  Again, this scheme was advertised in the national media and the assessment criteria were published.</P>
        <P>When availability of funds allow, smaller capital grants may also made available.  Details of the application process for this type of funding, along with the requirements and criteriafor drawdown of these grants, is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at<i>www.ahg.gov.ie/en/Publications/ArtsPublications/FAQFebruary2011.pdf</i>.

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht was established on 2nd June 2011.  My Department has received sanction from the Department of Finance for the appointment of two Special Advisors.  My officials are currently in contact with both individuals with a view to finalising specific contracts arrangements in line with the guidelines on staffing of Ministers&rsquo; Offices issued earlier this year. No salary costs have been incurred by my Department to date, pending the finalising of these arrangements.  I have not appointed any programme managers, nor is any such appointment envisaged.</P>

	<P>The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht was established on 2 June 2011 and the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to provide meaningful comparative information for 2010 as sought by him.</P>
        <P>The administrative budget available to my Department for postal, telecommunications, office equipment and IT services in 2011 is &euro;2,045,000, comprising &euro;1,641,000 for current expenditure and &euro;404,000 for capital expenditure.  The purchase of IT equipment is specifically provided for from this capital expenditure budget.</P>
        <P>In accordance with public procurement regulations, all relevant IT procurements are subject to a tendering process, with purchases of particular IT equipment and services, such as desktop or laptop PCs, printers and mobile or fixed voice or data services, being procured under the national ICT procurement frameworks, which are under the auspices of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, my Department has been active in establishing cross-departmental collaborations with, for example, the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Environment, Community and Local Government on IT projects where significant cost savings can be achieved through the sharing of IT services and resources.</P>
        <P>Whilst my Department provides funding to the agencies within its remit, the board of each agency is responsible for all operational matters relating to the agency, including IT services, and I do not have a statutory function in respect of such day-to-day operational matters.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, in the current economic circumstances, the Government is faced with a number of difficult decisions in lead up to the forthcoming Budget.  To assist in this regard, the Government has embarked on a detailed Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE).  The objectives of the CRE are to provide the Government with a comprehensive set of decision options: to meet the overall fiscal consolidation objectives, both as regards spending and numbers reduction targets; to re-align spending with the Programme for Government priorities; and; in this context, to consider new ways of achieving Government objectives in the context of public sector reform.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Departmental CRE submissions form a central part of the overall pre-budget deliberations of the Government and, as such, their release cannot be considered in advance of Government decisions on the forthcoming Budget.</P>

	<P>I am currently engaged in a programme of classification of Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the Birds Directive. This exercise includes the re-classification of many existing SPA sites, including Lough Ree which was first designated some sixteen years ago. A judgment delivered by the European Court of Justice against Ireland in December 2007 found that Ireland&rsquo;s classification of its SPAs had been inadequate in some respects and this has necessitated the re-classification of many of the older sites.</P><Col N="302"/>
        <P>The proposal to update the designation of Lough Ree was advertised during the week commencing the 25th July, 2011. Detailed information on the proposal was included with my Department&rsquo;s letter of 22nd July, 2011 which issued to landowners and others identified as having an interest in the site. This material, including maps of the proposed site, was also made available through public access points in the area, including Garda Stations, Teagasc offices, local libraries and the offices of local authorities in the area.</P>
        <P>Appeals by affected landowners or land users against the proposal may be made up to 25th October, 2011. The re-designation process will be concluded, following consideration of any appeals submitted, with the making of a new Statutory Instrument for the site.</P>
        <P>To protect ecologically important sites, certain potentially harmful works are restricted within SPAs.  These activities (known as Activities Requiring Consent) are works liable to interfere with the integrity of the site. For the Lough Ree site, activities such as drainage works, reclamation and water abstraction are specified. These provisions apply to works undertaken by public bodies and agencies as well as private individuals. However, there is no general prohibition on the activities listed, merely a requirement to notify and secure my consent, as Minister, where relevant.  In practice, this consent is obtained through contact with the locally based staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Details of these activities and this process have been sent to landowners. There is no requirement to obtain consent if an activity is licensed by or subject to the permission of another Minister, public body, State or local authority, or specified as permitted in an approved farm plan for the land in question.</P>

	<P>I met with representatives from the Irish Family History Foundation in July where they outlined their views on the digitisation of records.  Additionally, I held a full day seminar on 7 September with representatives from a wide range of organisations with an interest in genealogy matters. A representative from the Family History Centres in each county was invited, the majority of which attended on the day. Each organisation that attended was given an opportunity to make a presentation that outlined their views on the issue of digitising genealogical records. This involved some 30 presentations being made over the course of the day. I am now considering the views of the various organisations on this important issue.</P>

	<P>Under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, each planning authority is required to include in its development plan a Record of Protected Structures. The making of an addition to, or deletion from, a Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the planning authorities.</P>
        <P>Inclusion in the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</P>
        <P>Section 59 of the 2000 Act provides for a planning authority to serve notice to require works to be carried out in relation to endangerment of protected structures.  On the basis of information submitted by the planning authorities to my Department, there were 19 such notices served in 2008, 27 in 2009 and 10 in 2010. None of these notices were served by the Wicklow planning authorities.</P>
        <P>Archaeological sites, generally, are protected quite successfully under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2004. Whilst it not currently possible to quantify nationally how many sites are endangered, there are twelve cases of reported threat or damage to archaeological sites in County Wicklow currently under investigation by my Department.</P>
        <P>Sites designated by my Department for their natural heritage interest include Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), Special Protection Areas (SPAs), Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs), Refuges for Fauna, Nature Reserves and National Parks. Detailed information on these sites, including information on the nature conservation associated with each, is available on a county basis on the National Parks and Wildlife Service website at <i>www.npws.ie</i> .</P>
        <P>I have given approval for my Department to undertake a review of the operation of Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Planning and Development Act 2000. An Expert Advisory Committee is being established as part of the review process. The review will focus on the effective operation of the existing code, rather than on a fundamental review of Part IV. This Committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting later this month.</P>

	<P>Energy poverty is a cross-cutting policy issue and tackling the root causes requires action on a number of fronts. Energy poverty is caused by the interaction between energy prices, thermal inefficiency of the home and income.  Action to mitigate energy poverty has focused on providing assistance through the schemes operated by the Departments of Social Protection, Environment and the Sustainable Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</P>
        <P>The Affordable Energy Strategy will be the framework for building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty, which include the thermal efficiency-based measures delivered through the Better Energy: Warmer Homes programme.  By providing significant energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, energy poverty, this programme provides benefits to recipients in terms of energy affordability, tangible health improvements and overall well being.  The programme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>The Inter-Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy, which is chaired by my Department and which represents all key Departments, Agencies and energy suppliers as well as the Energy Regulator and NGOs, finalised its own deliberations over the summer months.  Their analysis and recommendations formed the basis for a strategy to be agreed with my Ministerial colleagues.</P>
        <P>I would remind the Deputy that I informed the Oireachtas Committee last evening that I was in the process of bringing a Memo to Cabinet on this issue and it is my intention to publish an Affordable Energy Strategy within a few weeks.</P>

	<P>Earlier this year, my Department granted onshore Licensing Options to two companies over parts of the Lough Allen Basin.  The Licensing Options are preliminary authorisations and are different to exploration licences.  The Options are for a two year period from March 2011 to the end of February 2013.</P>
        <P>During this period, the companies will evaluate the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on studies of existing data.  The companies will also undertake a preliminary environmental baseline/impact assessment and engage with the local authorities and other statutory agencies as required.</P>
        <P>This work is largely office/desktop based and will not involve exploration drilling or hydraulic fracturing.  In fact exploration drilling is specifically excluded under these authorisations.  By the end of the Option period in February 2013, the companies will have to decide whether to apply for a follow-on exploration licences or relinquish their acreage.</P>
        <P>In the event that either company decides to apply for an exploration licence that includes proposals for exploration drilling using hydraulic fracturing, the company would have to demonstrate that this work could be undertaken without causing harm to the environment.  The application would have to be set out in detail and be supported by an environmental impact statement.</P>
        <P>My Department would then undertake a full assessment of the application, including an environmental impact assessment and public consultation.  As part of that public consultation, my Department would consult with other relevant statutory authorities such as the EPA, NPWS, Local Authorities etc. in making any decision.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The potential of the Irish offshore as a petroleum producing region is largely unproven. This is likely to remain the case unless there is a relatively significant increase in the level of exploration activity, in particular exploration drilling. Over the past decade on average only two exploration wells have been drilled per year.</P>
        <P>The principal aim of the 2011 Atlantic Margin Licensing Round is to seek to inject new momentum into the level of exploration in the Irish offshore and to attract new exploration companies to Ireland. For that reason I do not intend to delay my decision on the award of the two-year licensing options.</P>
        <P>Companies that are granted two-year licensing options under the round will have to undertake work programmes agreed with my Department. These work programmes will then inform decisions to be made two years from now as to whether or not these companies will want to apply for exploration licences, with a view to moving towards exploration drilling.</P>
        <P>As any exploration drilling that might result from the 2011 licensing round is unlikely to take place until six years from now at the earliest, it would not be in the public interest to delay <Col N="306"/>decisions on the award of licensing options. To do so would only delay the much needed increase in exploration activity levels and damage investor confidence.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">While there is no specific allocation for taxi use in my department, it is included in the overall travel budget, expenditure in this area is closely monitored to ensure it stays within expectations.  The following stipulations apply to the use of taxis: Officials travelling within normal walking distance of their office base should not use a taxi service except in exceptional circumstances.  The possible exceptions to this are officials with a &ldquo;declared&rdquo; disability or those carrying weighty files; Other cheaper forms of public transport should be used when available, e.g., buses; Taxis should be shared when officials are attending the same meeting; Meetings should be held in our buildings and/or video conference facilities used where possible; Staff who book taxis should be present in reception and ready to go ahead of the taxi arrival to avoid waiting charges.</P>
        <P>Use of taxis is only permitted for official purposes and is restricted to staff use except in very exceptional circumstances. The extraction of information on the use of taxis by external personnel would be very time consuming and would necessitate going through all invoices from the taxi firm going over the past four years.  My department has also implemented an initiative that makes available a number of bicycles for use by officials in its two Dublin offices during office hours. Following a successful pilot phase in Adelaide Road, this voluntary initiative was extended to Beggars Bush. The reaction of staff to the initiative has proved very positive and all eight bicycles are in regular use. This has helped to reduce the cost of taxis to the department since its inception in 2008.</P>

	<P>A finding from a research study sponsored by my Department estimated that there could be a total reserve potential in the order of ten billion barrels of oil equivalent in the frontier basins west of Ireland.  This figure is simply an estimate of unproven potential, derived from an assessment of the scale of acreage, the state of knowledge of offshore geology and experience elsewhere.  It is not a detailed estimate based on comprehensive survey and exploration drilling of Ireland&rsquo;s Atlantic offshore. Actual reserve figures are likely to vary widely from these estimates and will not be known without a dramatic increase in the level of exploration activity.  In fact, Ireland&rsquo;s proven commercial reserves to date are estimated at 0.5 billion barrels and more than half of this has already been exploited.</P>
        <P>The only commercial discoveries of hydrocarbons made in the Irish offshore to date are the three producing gas fields in the Kinsale area, along with the Corrib gas field which is currently being developed off the coast of Mayo.  There have been no commercial discoveries of oil.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to the onshore, earlier this year my Department granted Licensing Options to two companies over parts of the North West Carboniferous or Lough Allen Basin.  The Licensing Options are designed to allow the companies assess the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on desktop studies of existing seismic and well data.  This potential had been identified in earlier exploration, but was not considered to be commercially viable.  It is too early to conclude whether or not these authorisations will proceed to the exploration licence stage let alone to anticipate a commercial discovery that would potentially lead to a petroleum production project.</P>
        <P>In relation to royalties, Ireland followed the lead of other countries such as the UK and Norway and moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987. <Col N="308"/> Under a tax based system the return to the State is linked directly to the profitability of the oil or gas field compared to a royalty based system where payments are linked to the volume of production and take no account of differences in development cost or actual profitability.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive review of Ireland fiscal terms for oil and gas exploration and development was carried out in 2007.  The review, which was underpinned by independent economic analysis, considered the appropriateness of Ireland&rsquo;s licensing terms in comparison to other European countries that Ireland competes with for exploration investment.  The outcome of that review was the introduction of a profit resource rent tax, of between 5% and 15% that will apply in the case of more profitable fields.  The profit resource rent tax would be payable in addition to the standard petroleum corporate tax of 25%.</P>
        <P>Ireland competes with other countries, both in Europe and much further afield, to attract mobile international exploration investment.  To that end, it is important that Ireland maintains a licensing regime that appropriately reflects both the risks and rewards of investing in petroleum exploration in the Irish offshore, relative to investing in exploration in other jurisdictions.  Ireland&rsquo;s petroleum taxation rate is deliberately pitched at a level that is consistent with countries such as France, Portugal and Spain, who like Ireland have limited petroleum production, rather than with major petroleum producers such as Norway or the UK.</P>

	<P>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland launched the Greener Homes Scheme in March 2006 to support homeowners who wished to install renewable heating technology in their homes. The technologies supported included Biomass, Heat Pumps and Solar Thermal systems.  The scheme closed for applications in May 2011 when solar thermal technology transitioned across to Better Energy: Homes.  At that time, just over 29,500 applications for solar technology had been approved.</P>
        <P>To date, a total of 22,500 systems have been installed by homeowners with a small number outstanding yet to be completed (approx 550).  A total of 1,851 solar grant applications have been approved since the launch of Better Energy in May this year.  Applications can be made online and, for eligible homes, approval is immediate with the homeowner having six months to complete the required work and submit payment documentation.  Grants are not paid in cases where the homeowner does not meet the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>

	<P>EirGrid, the State owned independent electricity transmission system company, is building the East West Interconnector between Ireland and Britain.  The construction of this vital strategic infrastructure by EirGrid is on schedule for completion next year.  I have no role in the planning <Col N="309"/>and construction of transmission infrastructure, which are operational matters for EirGrid.  The planning process for strategic energy infrastructure is a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Strategic Infrastructure Act, in which I have no role.  </P>
        <P>The Interconnector obtained full planning permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la in September 2009.  This approval followed a comprehensive assessment process including a public oral hearing which addressed, inter alia, public health and safety considerations.  It is being developed and constructed in line with all relevant national, EU and International guidelines for health, safety and the environment.</P>
        <P>In order to allay further concerns expressed by Rush Community Council and to assist local community understanding and confidence, an independent Expert Opinion on health issues relating to High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Cable was commissioned by the Department which was positive in terms of safety of HVDC cable technology.  A further report on the operational safety of the interconnector project was commissioned on a jointly agreed basis by Rush Community Council and EirGrid and also reported positively in terms of the operational safety of the project.</P>
        <P>There is no reason to doubt EirGrid&rsquo;s commitment to complete this strategically vital project successfully to the highest safety standards in the national interest and without risk to the health and safety of local communities, nor is there any evidence to suggest that EirGrid would deliberately mislead Fingal County Council, An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the local communities in any way.</P>

        <Quest>  if he will confirm that the current pace of development here is sufficient to meet our renewable energy targets (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

	<P>Under Directive 2009/28/EC, Ireland has been set a legally binding target for renewable energy as a percentage of all energy consumed by 2020.  Our target is 16% and this is to be achieved across the transport, heating and electricity sectors. Our intention, as set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan, available on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dcenr.gov.ie</i>   is that the overall 16% target will be achieved with around 40% consumption in the electricity sector being from renewable sources, 10% in the transport sector and 12% in the heat sector.</P>
        <P>Table 10 of the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) sets out the trajectory for how the target would be achieved in the electricity sector. By 2020, the NREAP modelled scenario shows 5111MW of renewable generation comprising 75MW of wave and tidal generation; 153MW of biomass generation; 234MW of hydro generation and 4649MW of wind (4094MW of onshore wind and 555MW of offshore wind.) Appendix 1 of the NREAP details the basis on which the modelling was carried out.</P>
        <P>Since the NREAP was drafted there have been further falls in projected demand for electricity.  EirGrid&rsquo;s All Island Generation Capacity Statement 2011-2020 concludes that Ireland will need 4350MW of wind generation by 2020 (i.e. 299MW less than forecast in the NREAP).  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s (SEAI&rsquo;s) Energy Forecasts for Ireland to 2020 (2010 Report), which was compiled after the NREAP, indicates that only 3843MW of wind generation will be required by 2020 (see Table 16).</P>
        <P>The figures for each year supplied in the NREAP were based on a modelled trajectory towards the achievement of our target on the basis of the information known at the time.  These <Col N="310"/>figures will have changed since the NREAP was published, which relied largely on 2009 data.  A first report on the NREAP is to be submitted to the European Commission at end 2011 and will include new figures, which on the basis of the information already available from EirGrid and the SEAI energy forecasts are likely to show a lower trajectory.</P>
        <P>As of June 2011, there was 1459MW of wind generation connected to the grid, 234MW of hydro and 30MW of other renewable generation. A further 1150MW of renewable generation from Gate 1 and Gate 2 has contracted with EirGrid or ESB Networks and is awaiting connection over the next few years.</P>
        <P>While the amount of new windfarms connected in 2010 was lower than expected, an improvement is expected in 2011. The Commission for Energy Regulation, EirGrid and ESB Networks have been continuing to roll out the Gate 3 grid connection offers comprising 3900MW of new renewable generation. EirGrid is also actively pursuing implementation of the Grid 25 programme.</P>
        <P>Between the 1723MW of renewable generation currently connected, the 1150MW relating to Gate 1 and Gate 2 that has contracted for a new connection with the TSO or DSO and with the 3900MW of Gate 3 connection offers our renewable energy targets are still on track to be achieved by 2020.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 486 and 505 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s national digital switchover strategy provides for the closure of the RT&Eacute;NL analogue TV network at the end of 2012 and, through the resulting &lsquo;digital dividend&rsquo;, paves the way for the delivery of new and better mobile and broadband services which should assist new national economic growth.  I am keenly aware of the challenges this initiative brings, in particular for Irish households which are reliant on the existing &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; analogue TV network.</P>
        <P>In May of this year, I published a Report on TV Viewing Methods in Ireland, which was commissioned by my Department to assist with planning for Analogue Switch-Off (ASO).  This report, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, focuses on TV viewers who rely on the analogue terrestrial TV network and also provides useful information on the economic profile of TV households, their media preferences and preferences for receiving information about analogue switch off.  The report is being used by my Department to inform the digital switchover programme.</P>
        <P>This report is also useful in helping to estimate the number of TV households reliant on the aerial TV network backed up by other research such as the TAM establishment survey.  From the research, we can estimate that there are approximately a quarter of a million households in Ireland reliant on the aerial network solely for television reception, and an estimated 100,000 of these households are classified as DE homes from a socio-economic perspective.</P>
        <P>All households that rely solely on the existing &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; analogue TV network will need to upgrade to digital TV by the end of 2012 or they will lose access to television services.  TV households can choose to upgrade to digital TV by moving to a pay-TV service or by upgrading <Col N="314"/>to Saorview, Ireland&rsquo;s national digital TV aerial network, which was launched by RT&Eacute; on 26th   May 2011.</P>
        <P>To upgrade to Saorview, TV households will need to purchase either a set top box to connect to their existing TV or a new Saorview digital TV.  In some cases, depending on the type of aerial and the orientation and age of the aerial, TV households may also need a new aerial.  The number of TV households who may need a new aerial or aerial adjustment is estimated to be around 20,000 TV households.</P>
        <P>Experience from other European countries indicates that the cost of set top boxes and other digital receivers reduces as the date for digital switchover approaches, and there is increased competition in the market.  There is clear evidence that this is now happening in Ireland with affordable set top boxes that meet the Saorview standard now coming on the market, as well as a range of suitable digital televisions.</P>
        <P>To overcome the challenges that digital switchover brings, I recognise that we must also assist people with information and practical assistance to ensure that no one is left behind as Ireland goes digital.   I have undertaken to deliver a substantial information campaign providing households with information on the digital switchover and on their options for going digital.  This information campaign will be starting this autumn and I will be announcing details in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with this, my Department is currently working to address the particular information and assistance needs of vulnerable households as they prepare to go digital.  In this context, the expertise and local knowledge of the many voluntary and charity organisations around the country could be of critical importance in ensuring the success of the switchover process.  I have asked my Department to ensure that, to the greatest possible extent, these organisations play a major part in our information and assistance campaign.</P>

        <P FLI="0">My Department ensures that all public procurement procedures as outlined by the Department of Finance are adhered to during the procurement process. As part of these processes every effort is being undertaken to ensure value for money and achieve cost reductions.</P>
        <P>Notably, my Department, earlier this year, as part of the Croke Park Agreement has implemented an agreement with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to receive <Col N="315"/>a service from that Department for the maintenance of IT helpdesk services and network infrastructure. This arrangement, which is the first shared service to apply to a full government department, will provide long-term savings on licensing and maintenance costs and is likely to be a model for future IT services for smaller Government Departments.</P>
        <P>The purchase of IT equipment for Agencies under the aegis of my Department is an operational matter for each Agency. In addition each Exchequer funded Agency makes annual returns to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on all ICT expenditure.</P>

	<P>The recently enacted Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act, 2011, designates An Post as the universal postal service provider in the newly liberalised postal services market.</P>
        <P>This designation, which is for a period of twelve years, will be reviewed by ComReg to decide whether the designation of An Post after the expiry of the first seven years should continue for the remainder of the twelve years, whether other postal operators should be designated or that no designation is required in order to fulfil the universal service obligation.  Designation requires An Post to provide a minimum level of postal service throughout the State, the essential element of which is the collection and delivery of mail to every address on every working <Col N="316"/>day.  The Government&rsquo;s core policy goal for the postal sector is to ensure that Irish customers, both business and residential, enjoy competitively priced, high quality postal services.</P>
        <P>An Post is an important postal service provider and has served the State well to date.  However, the postal sector globally is facing challenges &mdash; not least from liberalisation and competition, but also the ongoing effect of the recession and the impact of electronic substitution and this has implications for how postal service providers, including An Post, must position themselves.  Flexibility is required and a focus on innovation to meet the evolving needs of users, particularly business users, to maximise the &ldquo;value added&rdquo; by post to their customers.</P>
        <P>I know that An Post has many genuine strengths such as its dedicated workforce, its trusted brand and its strong visible presence in every community in Ireland on every working day of the year &mdash; a presence that very few, if any, competitors will be in a position to replicate.  An Post and its staff must play to these strengths and ensure that its resources are aligned with the needs of its users.  To do so will involve significant change and I understand that this is already underway.</P>

	<P>Better Energy: Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors.   Due to the mixed delivery model and variations across CBOs, the number of measures available to particular homes can vary from region to region.</P>
        <P>At all times the scheme works to maximise the number of vulnerable homes to receive support, particularly when working from a limited budget envelope.  The focus of our efforts therefore is to prioritise homes that have not received any measures, thereby maximising the number of vulnerable homes that will receive some form of assistance.  Within this context SEAI believes that best impact for homeowners and value for public funds can be achieved by limiting interventions to single visits per home.  As the applicant referred to by the Deputy had already received a package in 2009, which included all the measures that the CBO was in a position to deliver at that time, it was not deemed appropriate to undertake a second package.</P>

	<P>The issues raised in this case at the end of 2010 were responded to directly by way of letter to the company concerned.  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme was enacted and introduced in July 2010 <Col N="318"/>in order to help deliver on the mandatory EU target of 10% renewable energy in transport by 2020.  Since the scheme was introduced, 16 companies have applied for certificates under the scheme. In 2010, over the first six months of operation, certificates were awarded for 92,516,069 litres of biofuel placed on the market.  This represents a very significant increase in the amount of biofuels being used in the Irish market.</P>
        <P>The Scheme requires large suppliers of road transport fuels to include a certain percentage of biofuel, across their general fuel mix, and works on the basis of tradable certificates.  Currently the obligation is for 4% of overall transport fuels to be biofuel, but this obligation will increase over time and by 2020, suppliers will be required to include 10.5% biofuel in their fuel mix.  Suppliers can meet their obligation either by placing the biofuel on the market themselves, or by purchasing certificates from companies that sell higher blend biofuels to market.  The scheme is not exchequer funded.</P>
        <P>Before the Biofuel Obligation Scheme, the use of biofuels in Ireland was incentivised under the Mineral Oil Tax Relief (MOTR) schemes.  Excise relief under MOTR was granted only to a limited number of companies under terms set out in the Finance Act 2006.  These terms specifically included volume limits, and a clearly stated end date for the relief of 31 December 2010.  The Government&rsquo;s Bioenergy Action Plan, published in 2007 explicitly stated that a national Biofuels Obligation would replace MOTR as those schemes came to a close.   The issue of a compensation scheme does not therefore arise.</P>

        <P>I am happy to report that between the significant private sector investments that has taken place and the targeted Government intervention aimed at addressing market failure, such as the National Broadband Scheme and the Rural Broadband Scheme, Ireland will be in a position to meet this first milestone in advance of 2013, including the areas in County Kildare mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.</P>
        <P>Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband customer access to every home and business in the State.  The recently-established Next Generation Broadband Taskforce has an important role, in this regard.  The Taskforce met earlier this week and is scheduled to complete its work in December next. I expect that it <Col N="319"/>will help to identify the optimal policy to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband generally and thereby assist in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government.</P>

	<P>The electronic communications market is, and has been since its liberalisation, a commercial competitive market.  Thus, the provision of electronic communications services, including broadband, is a matter for those private sector service providers, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). The Government only intervenes in cases of market failure.</P>
        <P>I understand that various private sector service providers have infrastructure in the Portlaoise and Athy areas.  Additionally, a Government owned Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) was built in Portlaoise under Phase I of the Metropolitan Area Networks programme and is fully operational.  The MANs are fibre optic networks mainly built in a ring formation around towns with populations above 1,500 persons.</P>
        <P>The MANs are a &ldquo;middle mile&rdquo; solution meaning that they fit between the local access delivered in towns by services providers and national backhaul networks (owned mainly by ESB Telecoms, BT, eircom and others) which carry the traffic from the MANs to the central points of international connectivity in the country.  The MANs are operated on a wholesale carrier neutral and open access basis meaning that any service provider can use the network without having to privately invest and replicate network footprints throughout the country. The MANs are managed, operated and maintained by e|net on behalf of the State.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government provides a commitment to roll out a Pay-As-You-Save (PAYS) retrofit scheme after 2013. This is anticipated to replace the existing grant supports in this area, for which the 2011 capital allocation is &euro;91.4m. To date under Better Energy: Homes, efficiency upgrades have been completed in 33,559 homes this year and over 96,000 homes since the programme commenced in 2009. In total, the estimated energy savings achieved are 529 GWh or &euro;33.14 million.</P>
        <P>PAYS is an innovative financing mechanism that will allow consumers to finance upgrades directly through the energy savings generated. My Department has convened a project team to undertake preliminary analysis of what a PAYS model could look like with a view to submitting an initial report to me in October. I expect to be in a position to bring proposals to Government soon after.</P>

	<P>There are a number of significant programmes in place to improve Energy Efficiency for businesses and thereby help reduce energy costs.  The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) sets out 90 actions which are already underway, or will be taken in the period to 2020, to achieve the national energy efficiency target.  The Government has set a target of 20% across all areas of the economy, including the business sector.  The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately &euro;1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.</P>
        <P>The SEAI Energy in Business Programme supports efforts by business to improve energy efficiency and competitiveness through structured energy management now involves the 150 largest business energy users and 2,000 small businesses.  In 2010, large companies involved in the Energy in Business Programme  identified savings of 600 GWh worth approximately &euro;17 million while SMEs saved 130 GWh, worth &euro;7 million.</P>
        <P>The Large Industry Energy Network (LIEN) is a networking and information programme for 150 of the largest energy users. Energy spend across the LIEN is approximately &euro;900 million and accounts for approximately 70% of industrial energy usage and for more than 10% of national primary energy usage. LIEN members share information on energy-saving technologies and techniques to maximise savings and maintain competitiveness. The Energy Agreements Programme supports large industry to implement an energy-management system through the EN 16001 standard.</P>
        <P>Under Better Energy: Workplaces, &euro;11.5 million was made available for implementing a wide range of qualifying sustainable energy upgrading projects in the public, commercial, industrial and community sectors, which serve as exemplar projects for the public sector and for business.</P>
        <P>Such projects may comprise individual or packaged measures aimed at achieving lasting savings in energy usage for thermal, electrical or transport purposes. The main focus of the support will be on achieving delivery in 2011 of sustainable energy (mainly energy efficiency) investment projects of differing sizes and complexities.  Similar projects in 2009 and 2010 had a spend of &euro;5.9 million and &euro;7.8 million respectively, with annual savings of 63GWh</P>

	<P>Earlier this year, my Department granted an onshore Licensing Option to Tamboran Resources PTY Ltd over parts of Cavan Leitrim and Sligo.  The Licensing Option is for a two year period from March 2011 to end February 2013.</P>
        <P>This Licensing Option is designed to allow the company to assess the natural gas potential of the acreage, largely based on desktop studies of existing seismic and well data.  The company will also undertake a preliminary environmental baseline/impact assessment and engage with the local authorities and other statutory agencies as required. This work is largely office/desktop based and does not involve exploration drilling or hydraulic fracturing.</P>
        <P>By the end of the Option period in February 2013, the company will have to decide whether to apply for a follow-on exploration licence or relinquish their acreage.  In the event that the company decides to apply for an exploration licence that proposes hydraulic fracturing, the application would have to be set out in detail and be supported by an environmental impact statement.</P>
        <P>My Department would then undertake a full assessment of the application, including an environmental impact assessment and public consultation.  My Department would also consult with other relevant statutory authorities such as the EPA, NPWS, Local Authorities etc, in reaching any decision.</P>
        <P>However, at this stage in the Licensing Option, it is much too early to conclude whether or not this authorisation will proceed to the exploration licence stage let alone to anticipate a commercial discovery that would potentially lead to a petroleum production project.</P>

	<P>Frontier Exploration Licence 1/06 was awarded to Serica Energy (UK) Ltd in December 2006 for <Col N="322"/>a period of 15 years.  The licence is situated in the Slyne Basin off the west coast and is divided into four phases of three, two, five and five years.  Each phase of the licence is subject to a work programme to be agreed with my Department. A commitment to drill an exploration well is required to progress to the second phase of a frontier exploration licence. </P>
        <P>In 2009, during the first phase of the licence the company drilled an exploration well to test the Brandon gas prospect.  Although no gas was found, the company encountered an oil accumulation.  Further detailed evaluation is required in order to assess the extent of the discovery and to determine whether the accumulation can be progressed to commercial development. This work is continuing.</P>
        <P>Regarding relinquishment, the company must surrender 50% of the acreage held at the end of the second phase in November 2011 unless the third phase work programme includes a commitment to drill a second exploration well.  The company will be required to surrender the licence at the end of the third phase unless a second exploration well has been commenced by that date.</P>

	<P>Petroleum was identified in the Hook Head prospect in 1971 by Marathon. While this resulted in the granting of a petroleum lease, it did not lead to a development and the lease was relinquished in 1992.  The acreage has been subject to further exploration authorisations on a number of occasions since then, none of which has resulted in a commercial discovery being made. </P>
        <P>The current authorisation over the area, a standard exploration licence, was granted in 2007 to a consortium with Providence Resources Plc as operator.  This exploration licence is for a six year period from February 2007 to January 2013, divided into two phases of three years each.  Under such a licence the holders are required to drill one exploration licence in the first phase of the licence.</P>
        <P>Since being granted the licence in 2007 the holders have drilled two wells and are at present planning a further appraisal well in the Hook Head prospect in order to complete their assessment of its potential.  The licence holders relinquished 70% of the acreage initially held under the licence on entering phase two on 1 February 2010.</P>
        <P>The holders have until January 2013 to relinquish the licence or apply for a petroleum lease to produce petroleum, or a lease undertaking in order to be granted a petroleum lease.</P>

	<P>I have no statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) which is an independent statutory body.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by vigorous competition regulated by the CER.  Prices in the retail electricity market are now fully deregulated.  From 1 October next, gas residential consumers are the only segment of the electricity and gas markets where prices are regulated. Prices in the electricity market and unregulated part of the gas market are wholly a commercial and operational matter for the suppliers. The recent CER decision to approve a 21.7% increase in the Bord G&aacute;is tariff from 1st   October is the first price increase for BGE&rsquo;s residential gas customers since September 2008.  It follows three successive price cuts approved by CER. There have also been recent announcements by suppliers of electricity price increases.</P>
        <P>The driving factor in these increases are gas price trends over the past year which look like continuing into the future. Looking forward, wholesale gas prices for the coming winter are more than 30% higher than for last winter. Ireland is a price taker in the global fossil fuel market and the economy is therefore vulnerable to energy price fluctuations and price rises.</P>
        <P>Suppliers in neighbouring markets are also subject to similar pressures and price increases. Last May, Phoenix Gas in Northern Ireland announced an increase of 39% in domestic and small business tariffs. The &lsquo;Big Six&rsquo; gas suppliers in Britain have all increased domestic tariffs by 17% to 18% and this follows increases some months earlier.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to competition as a way of exerting downward pressure on prices. Competition is achieving competitive pressure on suppliers. It stimulates them to offer better deals and discounts.</P>
        <P>Business and domestic customers can therefore increasingly avail of the competitive offerings from electricity and gas supply companies active in the retail end of the market.  The first step that customers should take to reduce their energy costs is to work actively in securing better value offers in the market and in switching to suppliers delivering lower prices.</P>
        <P>Actions taken over the last two years have improved Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness in the gas and electricity sectors in the two years to end 2010 when compared with other European countries.</P><Col N="325"/>
        <P>Analysis by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) of Eurostat data for the second half of 2010 shows that for large business customers of electricity Irish prices were between 91-93% of the Eurozone average for the last six months of 2010 while prices for small to medium business customers ranged from 4% below to 6% above Eurozone averages depending on the category. Gas tariffs remain competitive with business tariffs at 83-90% of the Eurozone average. Increased competition has clearly had an impact.</P>
        <P>In addition, we must focus on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs where possible for business and domestic customers.  This is essential for competitiveness, employment and for economic recovery.  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy for business are as competitive as possible through those measures at our disposal.</P>
        <P>I would also urge all businesses of whatever size to place a relentless focus on energy efficiency.  The SEAI is available to provide advice and, subject to available resources, financial assistance in this respect.  In addition, there is now extensive tax relief available to businesses for energy efficiency measures.</P>

There have, however, been some encouraging results detailed in recent media releases by a number of companies engaged in exploration but it is too early to determine whether these results will lead to identification of commercially viable deposits.   </P>

	<P>International comparisons of retail broadband services are conducted periodically. The ComReg statistical report for end 2010,  for example,  noted the latest OECD broadband data up to June 2010 ranked Ireland 13th of 19 EU states surveyed for fixed line broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants and 3rd of 18 EU states surveyed for wireless broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants.  A wider report on broadband services in 72 countries published in 2010 by the University of Oxford and the University of Oviedo, Spain, concluded that the broadband services currently available in Ireland are capable of meeting the requirements of today&rsquo;s broadband applications and overall, in terms of broadband quality and penetration, ranks Ireland 13th   of the 72 countries studied.</P><Col N="326"/>
        <P>I should point out that international comparisons must be viewed in context and can present challenges.  Issues such as advertised versus actual speeds, geographic spread of services, topography, population density, and the number of people per household must all be taken into account when making comparisons between different jurisdictions.  Ireland will however meet the EU target of having a basic broadband service available to all citizens by 2013.  The challenge now is to accelerate the roll out of high speed broadband.</P>
        <P>Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband customer access to every home and business in the State.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce has an important role, in this regard.  In June of this year I convened the Taskforce which I chair and which also comprises the Minister of State with responsibility for NewERA, Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, T.D., the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies currently operating in the Irish market, and CEOs of some Internet Service Provider companies. The purpose of the Taskforce, which will conclude its deliberations by the end of this year, is to discuss the optimal policy environment required to facilitate the provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.</P>

	<P>The electronic communications market in Ireland has been fully liberalised since 1999 and, since then, has seen the steady growth and development of well-regulated competition in the provision of the full range of electronic communications products and services.  Regulation of the provision of electronic communications services within the liberalised market is governed by the EU Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications which was transposed into law in Ireland by the Communications Regulation Act 2002, as amended.  The applicable EU rules limit the regulation of electronic communications services, in the main, to the provision of electronic communications services by fixed line telephone, fax and dial-up internet access under a universal service obligation (USO) to ensure these basic electronic communications services are available to all EU residents.  The EU Commission is currently engaged in a consultation process with a view to increasing the quality of electronic communications services covered by the USO.  </P>
        <P>It is also important to note that a key element of the consumer strategy of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) is to monitor developments in the marketplace and understand consumers&rsquo; requirements through a number of channels including (i) their dedicated Consumer telephone line; (ii) their award winning websites; (iii) the conduct of consumer and business surveys and their Consumer Advisory Panel.  These processes enable ComReg to identify and respond to trends that impact on those using electronic communication services, including broadband and mobile telephony.</P>
        <P>Additionally, in accordance with the Programme for Government, ComReg has been liaising with industry with a view to introducing an appropriate regime to ensure that advertised broadband speeds are actually delivered to end users.</P>

	<P>Cloud computing has the potential to revolutionise the IT investment model in Ireland and elsewhere.  It allows companies to use the internet to efficiently access vast amounts of computing resources that would otherwise be beyond their reach.

        <P>The Programme for Government commits to a range of initiatives aimed at making Ireland a leader in the emerging I.T. market of cloud computing. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, <Col N="328"/>Enterprise and Innovation, Richard Bruton, T.D., has established a group to implement this commitment on Cloud Computing. The group, on which my Department is represented, has been tasked with addressing all aspects of cloud computing, including expenditure, IT, procurement, security, infrastructure, and industrial strategy. I understand that the group will complete its work before the end of the year.</P>

	<P>The Report of the High level Group on Green Enterprise was launched in December 2009. The Report made 55 recommendations to develop the Green Economy in Ireland. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Mr. Richard Bruton TD, has responsibility for monitoring progress on the recommendations. However, I understand from his Department that 38 of the 55 recommendations (69%) of the High Level Group&rsquo;s Report have been addressed to a greater or lesser extent. Key recommendations which are being implemented include investment in the electricity grid, the rolling out of brown bins to households and businesses, funding to reduce water leakages, introduction of electric cars, and a range of demonstration projects being actively supported by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The progress made with respect to the recommendations, including the three recommendations in relation to the grid was set out in a Progress Report published in March and which is available at:</P>
        <P><i>http://www.djei.ie/publications/trade/2011/Progressreportongreenenterprise.pdf and http://www.forfas.ie/media/forfas-110318-green_enterprise.pdf</i>.</P>
        <P>Since the report the progress made with respect to the recommendations relating to my Department have included:</P>
        <P>The Electric Vehicle grant scheme which was opened in April 2011 to assist in the purchase of electric vehicles.  Those purchasing a full battery electric vehicle (BEV) or plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) will be grant aided by up to &euro;5,000, depending on the price of the vehicle.  These grants are in addition to the VRT reliefs of up to &euro;5,000 which apply to BEVs and the VRT reliefs of up to &euro;2,500 for PHEVs. In addition,  57 public charge points including 6 fast charge points are currently operational throughout the State.  The ESB plans to have 66 more charge points operational over the next two months</P>
        <P>The development of smart metering is progressing to schedule and phase 1 of the programme will conclude this year. The CER proposes to consult in the coming months on the high-level regulatory design and implementation approach for a national smart metering rollout.</P>
        <P>Regarding the recommendation to support the farming community to produce and sell green energy, officials from my Department and the Department of Agriculture Food and Forestry and the SEAI are engaging in progressing the recommended pilot forum on renewable energy for the farming community.</P>

        <Quest> his plans to amend the motor taxation rates in order that the rate is based on the actual emissions from a car rather than the original manufacturer&rsquo;s figures to take account of cases when persons have converted petrol or diesel engines in vehicles to run on liquid petroleum gas; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>For cars registered from 2008 onwards motor tax is based on the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions level of the car. The CO<sub>2</sub> rating, which is based on the car&rsquo;s Certificate of Conformity, under EU type approval law, is captured initially by the Revenue Commissioners at vehicle registration tax stage and then passed on to the national vehicle file for use in connection with the administration of the motor tax system.  The motor tax and vehicle registration tax systems have a uniform approach to the CO<sub>2</sub> emission level and the level established at vehicle registration stage remains for the lifetime of the vehicle. There are no measures in place to revisit the CO<sub>2</sub> level of a vehicle and I have no plans to amend the system in this context.</P>

	<P>It is open to any person or household to apply to a housing authority for an assessment of their housing need.  Each application will be considered by the relevant housing authority to determine whether an applicant for social housing support is eligible for and in need of that support having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.  When considering an application for social housing, an authority may have regard to whether the household&rsquo;s current accommodation is unsuitable by reason of a mental health disability or for other medical or compassionate reasons.</P>
        <P>Once a household has been accepted as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, particular priority may be available within authorities&rsquo; allocation schemes to persons or households with special needs, including mental health issues.  Apart from mainstream housing available from housing authorities, the Irish Council for Social Housing, which represents <Col N="332"/>bodies involved with voluntary housing may be able to advise on the names of voluntary bodies which specifically provide housing for people with mental health issues in various parts of the country.</P>
        <P>The National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability is the new Government strategy to address the housing needs of people with a disability over the period 2011-2016 and it sets out a framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities through mainstream housing policy.  The strategy has a specific focus on meeting the housing needs of people with a mental health disability.  This encompasses commitments in relation to moving people with low and medium support needs, from HSE mental health facilities to more appropriate community based housing, in line with the objectives of the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy, A Vision for Change.  The strategy has been approved by Government and is expected to be published by the end of September.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Question refers to the household charge.  The EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland commits the Government to the introduction of a property tax for 2012.  The Programme reflects the need, in the context of the State&rsquo;s overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.  </P>
        <P>In light of the complex issues involved, a property tax, requiring a comprehensive property valuation system, would take time to introduce and accordingly, to meet the requirements in the EU/IMF Programme, the Government has decided to introduce a household charge in 2012.  The household charge is an interim measure and proposals for a full property tax will be considered by the Government in due course.</P>
        <P>The charge will be set at &euro;100 and will apply to the majority of the households in the country, subject to a limited number of exemptions and waivers.  It is expected to raise some &euro;160 million and it is the intention that the revenues from the charge will support the provision of local services. Internationally, local services are administered by local authorities and financed by local service charges. In Ireland, local authorities are responsible for, among other services, fire and emergency services, maintenance and cleaning of streets, street lighting, public parks, waste services, libraries, open spaces and leisure facilities, etc.  Legislation to underpin the household charge will be brought before the Oireachtas shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 527 and 574 together.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function of a local authority.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis.  The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in making the rating system fairer and equitable for ratepayers.  Following completion of the revaluation programme, there will be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and <Col N="334"/>their commercial rates liability and this relationship will thereafter be maintained by means of recurring revaluations provided for in the Valuation Act.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner of Valuation is actively reviewing options which might hold potential for accelerating the delivery of the revaluation programme to all rating authorities within a shorter timeframe.  I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration in my Department.</P>

The detailed administration of the schemes, and the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding schemes, are the responsibility of the relevant local authority.

Due to the current level of commitments and having regard to available funding, projects proposed under CAS will only be considered in the event of a new call for proposals. It will be a matter for Mayo County Council to prioritise projects locally having regard to the relative merit of any proposals received and the extent to which they meet housing need.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 531 and 542 together. </P>
        <P>In Case C-66/06, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) found that Ireland&rsquo;s system of screening projects to assess the requirement to carry out environmental impact assessment (EIA) for certain categories of agriculture development was over-reliant on size thresholds and did not take sufficient account of other relevant criteria such as the cumulative effects of development and the location of those developments.  In June 2011, the Commission referred this case back to the Court to seek the imposition of both lump sum fines and daily fines for failure to act on the findings of the judgment and extensive consultations and action have been taken to minimise the risk of exposure to fines and to expedite resolution of the case.</P>
        <P>In response to the Court&rsquo;s finding, my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have been working together, in consultation with the European Commission, fully to address the Court findings and ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s legislative system and procedures are fully compliant with the Directive.  It has been agreed that it is more efficient and appropriate to transfer responsibility for most of the activities covered by the judgment, such as the re-structuring of fields and removal of hedgerows and boundaries, the use of uncultivated land or semi-natural areas for intensive agriculture and normal field drainage works to the Department of Agriculture, as part of its wider management responsibilities for overseeing agricultural activities and integrating environmental considerations into relevant schemes.  The only element of the judgment being retained within the planning system is on-farm development activity that impacts on the drainage or reclamation of wetlands, which are regarded as highly environmentally sensitive areas.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, following approval by the Oireachtas of the draft Regulations, I signed  the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2011 on 8 September 2011, which introduce a number of amendments to address the ECJ findings in this case.  The Regulations provide, <i>inter alia</i>  , for the:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />removal of certain categories of farm activities from the planning code as these are now regulated under the new Department of Agriculture system,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />lowering of thresholds for both planning permission and for projects requiring mandatory EIA for farm developments that impact on the drainage and/or reclamation of wetlands,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />introduction of enhanced screening processes for relevant sub-threshold development, particularly those that may impact on certain sites such as designated Natura 2000 areas, recorded monuments, natural heritage areas and other nature reserves, given their environmental and heritage sensitivities, and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />abolition of any planning exemptions for relevant projects where an EIA is required.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has also signed, on 8 September, new European Communities (Agricultural Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2011 which provide for a new system of screening for environmental impact above certain thresholds for different types of agricultural activity, and the requirement for the Minister&rsquo;s consent to be sought and mandatory EIA to be carried out on such projects at a higher threshold level.</P><Col N="337"/>
        <P>Both Minister Coveney and I are satisfied that we have introduced appropriate and balanced reforms that meet our compliance requirement with the EU Directive and that facilitate reasonable activities by farmers in these areas, while also protecting our valuable environmental heritage.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 532 and 581 together. </P>
        <P>On 29 October 2009, the European Court of Justice ruled against Ireland in relation to the treatment of wastewaters from septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems. The Court found that by failing to adopt the necessary legislation to comply with Articles 4 and 8 of the 1975 EU Waste Directive as regards domestic waste waters disposed of in the countryside through septic tanks and other individual waste water treatment systems, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive. My Department, together with the Office of the Attorney General, is finalising the preparation of a Bill to establish a system of inspection of septic tanks and other on-site systems. I expect to bring the Bill to Government in the coming weeks seeking approval for its publication. Full details on how the inspection system will operate will be announced at that time.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 534 and 539 together.</P>
        <P>Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste (the Packaging Directive) classifies items such as bottles, drink cans and containers as packaging.  Deposit and refund schemes on such items can reduce litter and contribute to the recovery rates for packaging waste.</P>
        <P>The Packaging Directive is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market.  Under the Directive, the recovery rate of packaging waste required by Ireland in 2011 is 60%.  Ireland had already achieved a rate of 70% in 2009.  The material specific recycling targets for glass of 60% and for metals of 50% had also been achieved by Ireland in 2009 &mdash; the recycling rate for these materials being 76% and 50% respectively.  Rather than being content with this level of performance, the Programme for Government   contains a commitment to drive a waste reduction programme as part of a sustainable waste strategy. One of the possible elements of this waste reduction programme is a levy on packaging.</P>
        <P>I recently consulted with industry, other stakeholders and the public on a possible levy on packaging. This consultation closed on Friday 5 August 2011 and the submissions and comments received are currently being examined.   Any decision regarding deposit and refund schemes will be taken as part of the overall response to dealing with the issue of packaging.</P>
        <P>More generally, I am determined to deal with the problem of litter and recently announced the following initiatives that will be taking place over the coming months:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Firstly, I am preparing a new national anti-litter campaign which will raise awareness of the costs and the consequences of littering.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Secondly, I will be bringing forward new legislation to ensure that the punishment fits the crime in all cases.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Thirdly, I will be making available &euro;750,000 to local authorities for enforcement activities, such as CCTV monitoring, to ensure that those who commit the crime suffer the consequences.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will be considering a range of options, including those suggested in the questions, as part of the development of a new waste policy and responses to combat litter pollution.</P>

	<P>While works that could materially impact on rivers and river beds, such as the deepening or widening of the river bed, would require planning permission, other <Col N="339"/>minor type works, such as the removal of accumulation of silt and debris (such as might accumulate after winter floods, for example) from a river and the restoration of the watercourse to its original condition would be classed as maintenance and would therefore not require permission.</P>
        <P>In an area protected under the Habitats Regulations 1997 or the Wildlife Acts, such works could be a notified activity and might therefore require the consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I also understand that Inland Fisheries Ireland have powers and duties under the Fisheries Acts in relation to the protection of fish spawn, which could be affected by the removal of gravel: this is a matter that comes under the remit of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>

        <P>I refer to the reply to Question No 58 of 24 March 2011 which comprehensively addressed the issues regarding the registration of the title of Architect.  I have recently approved the schedule of fees applicable in respect of the registration of Architects in accordance with the Building Control Act 2007.  The fee in relation to candidates who apply for registration under the Technical Assessment route has now been set at &euro;4,500.  This is a significant reduction on the figure originally proposed.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to amend the arrangements for the registration of Architects, as set down under Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007, along any of the lines suggested.  The Act sought to provide for the registration of the title of Architect in order to protect consumers. There is no question of persons who fail to register through one of the routes to registration provided for in Part 3 of the Act being allowed to use the title of Architect.</P>

        <P>The Government fully recognises the value of the work carried out by community and voluntary organisations (including the Community and Voluntary Fora), which complements State endeavours in the community area.  The Community and Voluntary Fora provide an important input to the work of local authorities, particularly in the context of their membership of local <Col N="341"/>authority structures such as the Strategic Policy Committees, Joint Policing Committees and County/City Development Boards.</P>
        <P>I recently approved allocations totalling &euro;587,000 to the Fora to support their work.  Such funding is in addition to any other supports provided by individual local authorities including meeting the expenses of community representatives on the aforementioned local authority structures.  In addition, on 2 June 2011 I approved a further &euro;55,000 per annum to the Irish National Community and Voluntary Forum for the next two and half years, subject to annual budgetary review.  This is on top of the &euro;19,000 already allotted to this body as part of the overall Fora allocation.  The National Community and Voluntary Forum is the representative body of the Fora.</P>

	<P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented residential sector. My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 with a specific emphasis on whether the Act best supports the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions and on whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector. The outcomes of the review were announced by my predecessor as Minister of State and, in July 2011, the Government approved the Heads of a Bill to deliver on the review&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>The incorrect retention of deposits by landlords was identified in the review process as one of a range of issues that merited specific attention.  While the Heads of the Bill contain provisions that will, inter alia, deter the incorrect retention of deposits by landlords, I am continuing to evaluate the review recommendations and associated legislative proposals.  In that regard, I have already met with the PRTB which has engaged in some research as to the viability of a separate deposit retention scheme pursuant to its function, under section 151(1) of the Act, to provide advice to the Minister concerning policy in relation to the private rented sector. On foot of that meeting, I have asked the PRTB to carry out further research on how best to <Col N="342"/>address the issue of deposit retention and this research will further inform my thinking on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 &mdash; 2010, all development, unless specifically exempted under the Acts or associated Regulations, requires planning permission.  Any development that is carried out without planning permission, or that does not comply with the terms of a planning permission, is unauthorised development, and may be subject to enforcement action by a planning authority.</P>
        <P>Planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers and duties under the Planning Acts.  A planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development, or other unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development).  There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued or a court order should be sought, under section 160 of the 2000 Act.  Where a planning authority establishes, following an investigation, that unauthorised development (other than development that is of a trivial or minor nature) has been or is being carried out, and the person who has carried out the development has not proceeded to remedy the position, then the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice or seek a court order, unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.</P>
        <P>An application for retention permission is required to be assessed by a planning authority in the same way as any other application, that is, the planning authority is required to consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by my Department.</P><Col N="343"/>
        <P>The facility to apply for retention permission was curtailed in the 2010 Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 where its was provided that a planning authority may not accept an application for retention permission in respect of a development which would have required that one or more of the following was carried out:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />an environmental impact assessment;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />a determination as to whether an environmental impact assessment was required; or</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />an appropriate assessment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The above provision was commenced on 23 March 2011.  Section 57 of the 2010 Act makes provision to allow developments which would have required an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment to be the subject of applications for substitute consent, but only in very limited circumstances e.g. the development had a permission which was found defective by a court or the Board judge that there are exceptional circumstances such that the developer should be given leave to apply for such consent.  Section 57 will be commenced very shortly.</P>

	<P>The rent charged on the local authority&rsquo;s equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates. Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority&rsquo;s share, the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.</P>
        <P>In addition, an annual subsidy towards rent payments under the Shared Ownership Scheme is available, through the Rental Subsidy Scheme, to households with a gross household income of up to &euro;28,000 per annum in the preceding tax year.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 552, 556 and 575 together.</P>
        <P>I have established and am chairing the National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments to oversee implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments, together with the Government&rsquo;s response to the recommendations.   Both documents were published on 9 June 2011 and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website &mdash; <i>www.environ.ie</i>.  The Committee is meeting on a regular basis with the aim of publishing a report on progress achieved within the next 12 months.  In the meantime, work is ongoing on implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group and real progress is already being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.</P>
        <P>To date, my Department has made allocations totalling some &euro;2.16 million to fifteen local authorities from the &euro;5 million funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues. The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting, and other works to secure sites. My Department will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed.  I can also report that planning authorities are already making progress <Col N="345"/>in securing the co-operation of developers, financial institutions and/or bond holders, thereby obviating the need to use Exchequer resources to fund such work.</P>
        <P>Developers and owners of unfinished housing developments (or their receivers, where appointed) have the primary legal obligation in addressing outstanding problems associated with these developments.  Any public funds expended under this provision should ultimately be recouped from the developer/receiver.  Estates which fall under the direct control of NAMA, or receivers appointed by NAMA, are being managed by them and as a consequence do not fall within this scheme.  Details of the allocations made to date are in the table.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to a recent environmental report which stated that nearly 600,000 consumers here are drinking tap water that contains excessive levels of trihalomethanes (details suppled); the steps he will take to ensure that this problem is addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I am aware of the report referred to in the Question.  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No 2) Regulations 2007, drinking water must comply with a number of microbiological and chemical parameters.  The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for the<b></b>supervision of drinking water supplies in Ireland.  In February 2011 the EPA published The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland &mdash; a Report for the Years 2008-2009.   The report states that 15.6% of all samples covering 156 public and group supplies failed to comply with the parametric value for trihalomethanes.  Trihalomethanes are formed in drinking-water primarily as a result of chlorination of organic matter present naturally in raw water supplies.</P>
        <P>At the time of the media report, I understand that the EPA stated that the health risks from disinfection by-products, including trihalomethanes, are much less than the risk from consuming water that has not been disinfected.  As part of its supervisory role under the Regulations, the EPA maintains a list of public water schemes where remedial action is required to address operational or infrastructure deficits. Schemes failing to meet the parametric value for trihalomethanes are placed on this remedial action list (RAL).   My Department provides capital funding to local authorities for works required to address schemes on the RAL. Since 2008, &euro;28m has been provided from the Rural Water Programme for this purpose.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the incidents reported in respect of the company referred to in the question.  Major waste infrastructure is subject to stringent environmental standards set out in national and EU environmental and waste legislation.  The Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities are tasked with implementation, and the Agency has significant oversight and enforcement powers in order to safeguard the environment and to ensure compliance with specific waste licence conditions.  I am satisfied that a rigorous and risk based enforcement regime, including emissions monitoring, inspections and audits, is actively pursued by the EPA.  As standard good practice, the EPA also requires the development of Environmental Management Systems at licensed facilities, to help in preventing environmental pollution and promoting continual improvements in environmental performance.</P>

	<P>22 Volunteer Centres act as &lsquo;brokers&rsquo; between potential volunteers and organisations seeking volunteers. The centres are linked by a common database and a common best practice approach, and they provide a valuable service in promoting and coordinating voluntary activities around Ireland.  They also work with organisations to develop their volunteer management capacity as well as carrying out Garda vetting for smaller organisations.</P>
        <P>Details of the funding provided by my Department to the 22 Centres are set out in the table.  In addition 1% of funding under the Local and Community Development Programme is for volunteering activities.  This funding is paid directly to Volunteer Centres which operate in LCDP areas.  The table details the number of volunteer centres by county, the number of staff employed in each centre, the number of volunteers registered and placed in 2010 and the funding received under the Department&rsquo;s Volunteering Subhead.</P>

        <Quest> the amount that was granted to Limerick County Council for the housing aid for the elderly grant scheme and the housing adaptation grant scheme to date in 2011; if, in view of the fact that the area offices are reporting that they are out of the necessary funding, he will be releasing further moneys this year; and the planned allocation moneys for Limerick County Council in 2012. </Quest>

	<P>The suite of Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability is funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed to each of the various grant measures, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within their allocation.</P>
        <P>Exchequer funding totalling &euro;1,375,380 was allocated to Limerick County Council to meet expenditure arising under the schemes in 2011.  So far, some &euro;921,469 of this has been drawn down by the Council.  All of the funding available under the grant schemes has been fully committed at this stage.  My Department monitors expenditure under the schemes on an ongoing basis and requests for additional funding will be considered in the context of savings arising due to an under-spend by any local authority of their 2011 allocation.</P>
        <P>Allocations to local authorities next year will be considered in the context of the 2012 budgetary provision for the grant schemes and local authorities will be notified of these as soon as possible after the publication of the 2012 Estimates for Public Services.</P>
        <P>My Department is aware that these schemes are very heavily subscribed and available funding has been heavily committed in many areas.  To provide for continuity in the processing of applications and the payment of grants under the various grant measures, local authorities are advised by my Department that they can commit up to 50% of their current year allocation in respect of grant payments falling due in the following year.</P>

	<P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the commencement of water conservation contracts to the value of &euro;18.79 million during the programme period in County Kerry.</P>
        <P>Since the publication of the programme, Kerry County Council has completed its countywide watermains rehabilitation strategy required as part of its water conservation programme.  This strategy identifies specific defective water supply networks requiring rehabilitation and/or replacement.  The Council is also identifying the works to be included in the Countywide Water<Col N="351"/>mains Rehabilitation Project Phase 1 contract to be progressed and funded under my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &mdash; 2012.</P>
        <P>My Department recently approved an advance works proposal for the replacement of watermains submitted by Kerry County Council.  The Council has also submitted additional information requested in relation to another advance works proposal and this is currently under examination.  A decision will be conveyed to the Council as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>Provisions governing mortgage lending by local authorities are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009 and associated credit policy.  To ensure effective targeting of resources, loan finance continues to be available to first time buyers only. Income limits are also in place, distinguishing between single and dual income households and a maximum loan limit is applied.  In assessing loan applications local authorities take account of the household&rsquo;s ability to finance the loan based on their net household income.  While, as a general rule, the credit policy provides that loans are not available to those in receipt of unemployment/social welfare benefits, an exception may be made where there is a primary income of a permanent waged/salaried nature, and where the secondary income is from the Department of Social Protection.  In such cases long term social welfare payments can be considered, provided the long term nature of the payment is confirmed.  The final decision on whether to grant/refuse an applicant lies solely with the relevant local authority.  All local authorities must satisfy themselves on the financial risk they are undertaking.  These provisions apply for purposes of mortgage lending by all local authorities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has committed to the introduction of competitive tendering for household waste collection, under which service providers will bid to provide waste collection services in a given area, for a given period of time and to a guaranteed level of service.  A public consultation process has recently concluded on this matter, the purpose of which is to inform policy development. The responses received are currently being examined and I intend to bring policy proposals to Government before the end of the year.  However, there are no plans to centralise waste collection with a single service provider.  On the contrary, I would like to strengthen competition for household waste collection.</P>

	<P>Information regarding the ratio of Assistant Chief Fire Officers to Fire Service Personnel and staffing costs for Chief Fire Officers and Assistant Chief Fire Officers is not routinely compiled in my Department. </P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management, however, conducted a Baseline Study of the fire and rescue services in Ireland in 2008/2009.  Each local authority was requested to complete a survey document to gather information on fire services across the State.  The primary purpose of the Study was to provide a benchmark of the current status of local authority fire and emergency services, against which future progress would be measured.</P>
        <P>The survey identified 271 officers (including 30 Chief Fire Officers and 100 Assistant Chief Fire Officers) and 3,416 fire fighters countrywide, who provide and manage the delivery of fire services from 220 fire stations, using a fleet of some 500 vehicles.  On average, there is one operational fire officer for every 44 fire fighters covering a population of 15,000 people.  The returns also indicated one chief fire officer for every 114 fire fighters.  Accordingly, I consider that the Irish Fire Service is appropriately structured and I appreciate the high quality of services provided and managed by our senior fire officers and front line fire fighters.</P>
        <P>The annual budget provided by local authorities for running fire services is of the order of &euro;240m.  Requests for staffing in the fire services have been approved, following consideration of individual requests, within the Employment Control Framework. </P>
        <P>Salaries of Chief Fire Officers and Assistant Chief Fire Officers are aligned to those of engineers in local authorities.  The current salary scales are contained in the tables.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> his plans regarding to fire services here, specifically if it is envisaged that there will be a national fire service to replace the individual full and part time services that currently exist in each county. </Quest>

	<P>The provision of a fire service, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable is a statutory function of 37 statutorily designated fire authorities under the provisions of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003.</P>
        <P>Fire services are structured and delivered by the thirty principal local authorities on a shared services basis.  These fire authorities are supported by my Department through setting general policy, the provision of training support, the issue of guidance on operational and other related matters, and by the provision of capital funding.</P>
        <P>A Review of Fire Services in Ireland conducted in 2002 concluded unambiguously that provision of fire services by the local authorities was an appropriate approach, which should be continued and strengthened.  The report also recommended that national oversight, co-ordination and leadership of fire services should be strengthened.  The establishment in 2009 of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management within my Department gave effect to this recommendation.  The Directorate has taken over the functions of the Fire Services Council in an approach in keeping with the need to reduce the number of agencies, while providing appropriate political accountability.</P>
        <P>While the National Directorate is not a national fire service, and fire authorities continue to deliver this service under the aegis of the local government system, it has recently set out a national blueprint and programme for developing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Fire Services.  This is contained in the Irish Fire Services National Development Framework 2010-2015, available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.  The Framework sets out policies and key actions in the areas of Fire Services Role in Society; National Processes and Standards; Staff Learning and Development; Quality Assurance Systems and Reporting Performance; and Service Infrastructure and Legislative Support.</P>
        <P>The National Directorate, in collaboration with fire authorities, is currently developing national guidance on a range of issues in the interests of enhanced community safety.</P><Col N="355"/>
        <P>Given that both the fire authorities at local level and the Directorate at national level are working well and meeting their respective mandates, I have no plans to establish a National Fire Service.</P>

	<P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Wicklow.  Three contracts under the Arklow Sewerage Scheme are included in the Programme amongst the list of contracts in the county to start in the period 2010-2012.</P>
        <P>The major contract relates to the proposed wastewater treatment plant.  The unsuccessful applicant to the High Court for a judicial review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision to grant approval for the wastewater treatment plant was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court and exercised that option.  The hearing was held in December 2009 and the Supreme Court issued its decision in July 2011.  The Court dismissed the appeal.</P>
        <P>Following from the Supreme Court decision, Wicklow County Council must complete the planning for the scheme and is preparing a programme for its delivery within the earliest possible timeframe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU on Urban Waste Water Treatment recognises that it is not possible to construct collecting systems and treatment plants in a way such that all wastewater can be treated during situations such as unusually heavy rainfall.  Member States therefore have to decide on measures to limit pollution from storm water overflows.  In Ireland, the extent and impact of such discharges is regulated through the wastewater discharge licence issued by the Environmental Protection Agency for the particular agglomeration.  In addition, my Department has published performance standards in a document.  Procedures and criteria in relation to Storm Water Overflows. </P>
        <P>In the case of the Athlone area, in common with all early municipal combined sewer networks, the sewers in the old core of Athlone carry storm water as well as foul sewage and are fitted with combined sewer overflows, which in times of heavy rainfall may spill a mixture of storm water and sewage to the watercourse &mdash; principally to the River Shannon. The licence issued by the EPA to Westmeath County Council requires some improvement works to ensure that a number of such discharges conform to the Departmental performance standards.  It is <Col N="357"/>proposed to address these issues as part of the upgrade of the Athlone Sewerage Scheme which is included in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012.  The Athlone Sewerage Scheme provides for a combination of new sewers, sewer replacement and provision of storm water holding tank to contain excess storm flow and return it to the sewer network &mdash; and hence to the wastewater treatment plant &mdash; when the rainfall event has passed.  The elimination of the combined storm overflows to the River Shannon will be a major benefit of the Scheme. Westmeath County Council has submitted a Project Inception Report for Athlone Sewerage Scheme to my Department and this is currently under consideration.</P>

        <P>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, which sets out the detail of the charge, defines residential property as including flats, apartments and bedsits. The charge is payable in respect of each unit of accommodation used, or suitable for use as a separate dwelling, whether or not any amenity or facility in the building or premises may be shared. The owner of a house split into a number of residential units is thus liable for the charge on each unit in that house.The view was taken when the Bill was being debated in the Oireachtas that this was the fairest approach.

	<P>Local authorities have developed an on-line tendering/quotation solution LAQuotes.ie to streamline procurement processes for a range of supplies and services.  This solution was developed by Kerry County Council in 2003 and is centrally managed by the Council on behalf of participating local authorities.  </P>
        <P>The development of LAQuotes.ie has introduced greater efficiencies into the procurement process in the local government sector resulting in on-going savings and benefits both to the sector and to suppliers.

The Group is to report to me at regular intervals with its first report to be submitted shortly.</P>
        <P>The Implementation Group recently considered a submission on procurement from the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association.  Local authorities are committed to exploiting the potential that exists for additional savings in this area, primarily through increased aggregation in procurement at regional level, maximising the use of National Procurement Service Framework Agreements, where appropriate, extending low value purchase cards across the sector and further developing the LAQuotes system.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 588 to 590, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>Section 3 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 was introduced to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of Articles 9.3 and 9.4 of the Aarhus Convention.  It ensures that where individuals have standing in law, they can bring environmental cases to court without facing prohibitive costs; it is part of a suite of measures that have been implemented to help Ireland comply with the requirements of the Convention.</P>
        <P>In respect of legal actions related to the issuing of consents or licences, Judicial Review is the appropriate mechanism for such actions. The costs rule which applies for Judicial Review, where the consent is one that is relevant to either Directive 85/337/EC on Environmental Impact Assessment or Directive 2008/1/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control, is set out in Section 50B of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as inserted by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 and amended by the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011). This costs rule is similar to that introduced in Section 3 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.</P>
        <P>Enforcement actions where no consent or licence has been obtained are a matter for the appropriate regulatory body, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, local authorities or other State body, as the case may be. Such actions are not subject to the costs rule introduced by the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 as I do not believe that operators who engage in licensable activities without the appropriate licences should have the benefit of such a rule.</P>
        <P>I intend to proceed with ratification of the Aarhus Convention in the near future, following an analysis of all implementation measures by my Department in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General</P>

	<P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Kerry.  The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of over &euro;92 million in Kerry during the period of the Programme.  However, the Caherdaniel Sewerage Scheme was not amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the current Programme.</P>
        <P>The Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth.  A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Kerry County Council, in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time.</P><Col N="362"/>
        <P>Progress under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012  , has recently been reviewed and through this process, consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme.  No proposal for the Caherdaniel Sewerage Scheme was received from Kerry County Council in response to the review process.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government   includes a commitment to address noise pollution through the introduction of fixed payment notices (also known as on-the- spot fines) and provision for mediation between neighbours.  The development of new noise legislation by my Department will be considered in the context of this commitment; however, it is not possible at this time to indicate when the legislation will be published.</P>
        <P>Currently, a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet A Guide to the Noise Regulations, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.environ.iehttp://www.environ.ie/</i>.</P>

Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their temporary accommodation needs. </P>

        <P FLI="0">The Deputy will appreciate that the Irish Sports Council is not a body that operates under the aegis of my Department.  However, I can inform the Deputy that it has played an important role, in co-operation with the Garda Central Vetting Unit, in recent years in rolling out Garda vetting services to sporting organisations around the country.  The Garda Central Vetting Unit maintains ongoing contact with the registered sporting organisations and the Irish Sports Council to ensure the maintenance of best practice in the vetting process.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has approved the draft scheme of a National Vetting Bureau Bill which will establish a statutory basis to underpin vetting procedures for persons to work with children and vulnerable adults.  The Bill will be published in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.</P>

The amendments permit the Property Registration Authority (PRA) to register such an easement without a court order where there is no disagreement between the parties concerning entitlement to the easement concerned. The period during which easements acquired, or in the process of acquisition, prior to 1 December 2009 (the date the 2009 Act came into force) may be registered has also been extended from 3 years to 12 years.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the new PRA scheme will require changes in the Land Registration Rules. I understand that the Registration of Deeds and Title Rules Committee will meet soon to make the rules which are necessary to facilitate the scheme.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the waiting period for persons applying for free legal aid; if his further attention has been drawn to some instances people are waiting between four to five months to be provided with public representation; his plans to rectify this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that under the Civil Legal Act 1995, as passed by the Oireachtas, the Legal Aid Board is independent in the operation of its functions. However, as a courtesy to the Deputy I have obtained the information sought and am providing it to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Board that there has been a very significant increase in demand for general civil legal aid services in the last number of years and particularly since the economic downturn. The number applying for services in the first six months of this year was almost the same as sought legal services in the whole of 2007. This has given rise to increased waiting times in most areas for matters that are not prioritised. Prioritised matters continue to get an immediate or near immediate service. The sort of matters prioritised include cases involving domestic violence, the risk of children going into care, child abduction, and critical dates being close to expiry. Some other cases that are heard in the District Court are also given earlier appointments.</P>
        <P>The Legal Aid Board has in place an &lsquo;advice only&rsquo; service for non-prioritised matters where an applicant is likely to be waiting to for more than four months to have a first appointment with a solicitor. The aim of this service is that the applicant gets legal advice about their problem prior to getting a substantive service. The Board is keeping all of its services under review with a view to trying to ensure that its resources are used as efficiently and effectively as possible.</P>
        <P>I should point out that what is provided is &lsquo;legal aid&rsquo; and not &lsquo;free legal aid&rsquo;. The vast majority of persons receiving services from the Legal Aid Board pay a small financial contribution.</P>

        <Quest> his views <Col N="370"/>on a proposal to speed up the Garda vetting process by introducing a system that allows a person who receives Garda clearance to benefit from that clearance for the lifetime of the relevant position of employment, and it would be valid for one full year if that person wishes to apply for a voluntary position or another job within that time; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Garda vetting certificates are issued to specified registered organisations in respect of a particular post or employment in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request.  Decisions on the suitability for the recruitment/engagement of the person concerned rest at all times with the recruiting organisation.</P>
        <P>The Garda Vetting certificate is non-transferable.  It is important to emphasise that it is a disclosure to the requesting, registered organisation of the position in respect of a person at the time when it is issued.  Furthermore, non-transferability protects against the risk of fraud or forgery of such certificates and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting system.</P>
        <P>I fully appreciate the importance of processing vetting applications within a reasonable time frame and I am determined to address this aspect of the process. The present, average processing time for applications is approximately 10 weeks.</P>
        <P>A number of measures are being taken to improve the situation.  The sanction of the Department of Finance has been obtained to retain the services of ten temporary employees in the GCVU.  A further sanction has been obtained to engage an additional ten temporary employees for the Unit and the process of recruiting these is underway.   In addition, further steps are under consideration with a view to improving processing turnaround times. All of this should have a positive impact.</P>

        <Quest> if he will review the delay in processing of Garda vetting of persons seeking work in some professions in which Garda clearance is required; and if his attention has been drawn to the fact that it is prohibiting and delaying many persons acquiring work regarding both temporary and full time jobs.</Quest>
        <QRef>[22716/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the average processing time for vetting applications received at the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) is approximately 10 weeks. I appreciate that it is important to process these applications in as timely a manner as possible and that the length of time currently being taken is a matter of concern which I am determined to address.</P>
        <P>A number of immediate steps are being taken to improve the situation.  The sanction of the Department of Finance has been obtained to retain the services of ten temporary employees in the GCVU.  A further sanction has been obtained to engage an additional ten temporary employees and the process of recruiting these is underway.    Other measures aimed at improving turnaround times are also under consideration. All of this should have a positive impact on processing times.</P>
        <P>I should mention that, in processing an individual vetting application, additional time may be required in cases where clarification is needed as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  It should nevertheless be understood that while the Garda&iacute; make every effort to reduce the time to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out what are very necessary checks, there will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting appli<Col N="371"/>cation.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection processes.</P>
        <P>In addition, the average processing time for vetting applications also fluctuates in line with periods of increased demand.  The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives from around 188,000 in 2007 to almost 292,000 in 2010.

        <P FLI="0">As can be seen, the amount of money spent on taxi services has been significantly reduced over the period in question with every opportunity taken to reduce costs in light of budgetary constraints.  My Department also re-tendered in 2010 for the provision of taxi services and the contract was awarded to a new provider which has resulted in further savings. In addition, the  Department has made use of two official vehicles which can be configured as the need arises for use as people carriers or for carrying materials. The use of these vehicles not only assists in the efficient discharge of Departmental business but has also given rise to significant savings in taxi costs which would otherwise be required in the absence of such a facility.<b> </b> The Departmental policy is that taxis may only be used by staff for business reasons where absolutely essential and where public transport or other cheaper alternatives are either not available or are not viable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The removal of individuals from the State in compliance with the provisions of the law is, by its nature, a difficult process. It is however a necessary feature of the enforcement of immigration-related legislation where individuals do not exercise the option available to them to leave the State voluntarily when they have not got permission to remain in the State, or where they may not be in a position to exercise that option.</P>
        <P>In enforcing the law in this respect, Ireland is no different to other countries who also remove individuals who have no lawful right to remain within their territory.</P>
        <P>In all cases, the members of the Garda&iacute; attached to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) who exercise the removal function do so in keeping with the law, upholding human rights principles and treating individuals fairly and respectfully. In this regard, the Garda&iacute; act no differently than they do when discharging any of their many other law enforcement functions.</P>
        <P>The detailed arrangements governing deportation flights are complex and require co-operation between many agencies. These flights also require a large degree of co-operation from other countries; some of which have no diplomatic representation here. Flight plans, overflight permits, landing permits, refuelling stops, identity papers, passports or other identity-type documents and so forth all have to be agreed with the authorities in the receiving jurisdiction. In some instances, similar issues may arise when removal flights pass through third country airspace. Ensuring that all these logistical and diplomatic issues are in order is a complex task and occasionally difficulties can arise very late in the process where, for example, a country may refuse entry to its airspace even where an overflight permit is in place for a charter flight. This is in fact what occurred with a charter flight which departed Dublin in July of this year to go to Lagos, Nigeria and on to Kinshasa, DR Congo. Despite having a valid permit to fly through Algerian airspace, when the flight reached Algeria, the Algerian aviation authorities refused permission for the charter to enter their airspace. Numerous attempts were made to resolve this problem during the flight but ultimately the flight had no option but to return to Dublin.</P>
        <P>Every effort is made to avoid such occurrences by, for example, working with other EU member states or by liaising with  consular officials, including those based in the UK where there is no diplomatic representation here.</P>
        <P>In the other case referred to by the Deputy, the aircraft in question developed mechanical difficulties while on a scheduled stop at Athens airport. This was immediately prior to Christmas in 2010 in the period with very severe winter weather  causing huge disruption to all flights. In those circumstances, it was not possible to secure an alternative aircraft at short notice.</P>
        <P>In both instances, the events which gave rise to the two flights in question not proceeding to their final destination were completely outside the control of the GNIB or my Department. Notwithstanding that however, all aspects of these flights were reviewed to ensure that where possible, all reasonable steps are put in place to avoid a recurrence of the events that gave rise to their non-completion.</P><Col N="373"/>
        <P>In relation to the issue of costs regarding the two flights referred to by the Deputy, I can confirm that the costs of chartering each plane in December 2010 and in July 2011 respectively were fully borne by the company appointed to provide chartered aircraft and ancillary services to my Department.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy may be assured that while the non-completion of these flights is unfortunate and has given rise to inconvenience, there is no question of the human rights or safety of individuals having been compromised on the occasions in question.</P>

	<P>The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 will provide a statutory  framework within which immigration policies will be developed and amended as the need arises.  It is not proposed  to set out  in primary legislation the detailed rules for different categories of migrants.  This will be better achieved through regulations and administrative guidelines.  </P>
        <P>New guidelines for volunteer workers came into effect on 1 January 2011 and these guidelines are available on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website (<i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>).</P>
        <P>The three year duration applies only to volunteers who are permitted to enter the State on or after 1 January 2011.  It is not my intention at this time to extend this duration beyond three years.  For volunteers lawfully present in the State prior to 1 January 2011 the guidelines provide for those persons to have their immigration permission renewed annually beyond the three year limit subject to the person meeting certain conditions.</P>
        <P>I understand that the organisation which the Deputy refers to has been accommodated over the years regarding their intake of non-EEA volunteers.</P>

        <AskConj><b> </b>asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice and Equality</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the direct provision system that is in need of fundamental reform; his plans to review this system; and when that review will be expected to take place. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22851/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to this question, I will firstly explain the direct provision system, how it came about, why it remains a necessary feature of the State&rsquo;s asylum and immigration system, and why legislative proposals before the House will, if passed, of necessity reduce the length of time persons stay in the system.</P>
        <P>The accommodation of asylum seekers through the direct provision system is the responsibility of the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department.  Direct Provision means that the State, through RIA, assumes responsibility for providing for asylum seekers suitable accommodation and certain other services on a full board basis. All accommodation costs, together with the costs of meals, heat, light, laundry and maintenance are paid directly by the State. Asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation also receive a weekly cash allowance which takes account of board and lodgings and other ancillary benefits provided through the direct provision system. Asylum seekers can also apply to Community Welfare Officers for assistance to meet a particular once-off need by way of an exceptional needs <Col N="374"/>payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme. Payments under this category cover once-off costs such as back-to-school clothing and footwear.</P>
        <P>In addition to full board accommodation, RIA coordinates, through other Government bodies, a number of ancillary services to asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation. All asylum seekers are offered free medical screening on arrival in the State and are allowed access to health services on the same basis as for Irish citizens.  Asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation will generally qualify for a medical card whereby they are eligible to receive a wide range of health services free-of-charge including GP services and prescribed medicines. Other HSE-provided supports include Public Health Nurse service as well as a dedicated asylum seeker psychological service in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Asylum seeker children are entitled to access free Primary and Post-Primary education on the same basis as an Irish citizen. In addition, English language supports are made available to adult asylum seekers; in some cases facilities are provided on-site in RIA accommodation centres for such classes. At a number of centres, the RIA has provided facilities for on-site preschool services.</P>
        <P>As of today, RIA has 40 asylum seeker accommodation centres throughout the country. The system is a constantly evolving one, taking account of the ebb and flow of residents and of the financial resources available to RIA. Overall demand for RIA services is declining. At the beginning of 2009, RIA was accommodating an overall number of 7,002 asylum seekers. Today, it is accommodating just over 5,600 persons, a reduction of almost 20 % during this period.</P>
        <P>The direct provision system was a necessary response to the increasing number of asylum seekers arriving into the State. Before 1999, these asylum seekers were treated as homeless under the then structures in place.  These structures were entirely unsuited to the situation facing Ireland and the homeless service of the then Eastern Health Board could not cope and there was a serious prospect of widespread homelessness among asylum seekers.</P>
        <P>In response to this serious and unprecedented challenge, the organisation which was subsequently named the Reception and Integration Agency was established to coordinate the scheme of dispersal and direct provision for asylum seekers</P>
        <P>The direct provision system is only one element of the State&rsquo;s response to its international obligations on the asylum issue. As well as educational, health and welfare costs there is the asylum determination system itself, as well as the downstream judicial and policing costs.  In the period 2005 to 2009 inclusive, the total amount spent across the whole of Government on asylum seekers was &euro;1,275.31 million of which &euro;424.43 million was spent on the direct provision system.  Quite clearly, meeting our international obligations in this respect consumes very considerable public monies. But Ireland is not unique in this respect.  All countries which take their responsibilities in this area seriously are faced with similar calls on their financial resources.</P>
        <P>There are no cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system.  In fact, if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system. This was a key finding in the recent Value for Money Report on the direct provision system which was published in 2010 and is on the RIA website &mdash;   <i>www.ria.gov.ie.</i></P>
        <P>On the matter of application processing times and consequent length of time spent in the direct provision system, some cases can take significantly longer to complete owing to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and <Col N="375"/>high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.</P>
        <P>For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to point out that persons who are refused a declaration under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, enter what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; process which generally has two elements to it: an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process. The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive and there are no quick or easy decisions to make. Given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.</P>
        <P>I have taken steps to speed up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 which I recently restored to the D&aacute;il Order Paper provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion. The Deputy is probably aware I am developing a number of amendments to the Bill before commencing Committee Stage which I hope to be in a position to take in the near future  .</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the position with each of the persons referred to by the Deputy is as follows.  </P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the first named person concerned was notified, by letter dated 25th November, 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her. In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  To date no representations have been received from or on behalf of the person concerned. However, on 8th March, 2011, the person concerned, through her legal representative, informed my Department that she wished to withdraw all outstanding applications for permission to remain in the State and to return voluntarily to her country of origin. My Department wrote to her legal representative on 8th March, 2011 in response to that letter seeking certain clarification and documentation but to date no reply has been received in my Department from the legal representative.</P>
        <P>The application of the second named applicant is registered at the appeal stage of the asylum process. As this application is the subject of Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the third named person concerned was notified, by letter dated 14 December 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of <Col N="377"/>leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  To date no representations have been received from or on behalf of the person concerned.  However, on 8th March, 2011, the person concerned, through his legal representative, informed my Department that he wished to withdraw all outstanding applications for permission to remain in the State and to return voluntarily to his country of origin. Consequently, no further consideration will be given to the case of the person concerned under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).</P>
        <P>I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</P>

	<P>My Department carried out a review of the Dublin Drug Treatment Court which was published in May 2010. The findings of the Review suggested there is some evidence that participants on the court&rsquo;s programme have reduced rates of recidivism and improved health, education and social skills which impact positively on the participants themselves and the community.  However, the Report identified issues to be addressed in terms of the court&rsquo;s management and operation and particularly its throughput.  As a result of that review an Advisory Committee was established which has met regularly to progress and monitor the implementation of the recommendations with the aim of improving the programme&rsquo;s throughput and effectiveness.</P>
        <P>Drug treatment courts can make an important contribution as a restorative justice measure but international studies also indicate that they need to continuously evolve and develop. The aim with the Dublin Court is to develop its potential but to do so in line with international experience by continually reviewing the effectiveness of the programme to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and, if it is doing so, to continue to expand the use of the Drug Treatment <Col N="378"/>Court as an alternative to prison.   I am happy to inform the Deputy that, following the work mentioned above, the catchment area served by the Drug Treatment Court has now been significantly expanded with effect from July 2011 and the court is now in a position to deal with offenders from a much wider catchment area including offenders who are resident in all areas of Dublin north of the river Liffey and to offenders receiving treatment in the Castle Street Drug Treatment Centre which provides services to people residing in Dublin 2,4,6 and 8.  This welcome initiative has been undertaken with a view to increasing throughput with cooperation from the Health Services Executive in the provision of vital testing and treatment support services.  It is intended that this expansion will be evaluated as part of a further review of the Drug Treatment Court in 2012.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that judges are independent in the matter of sentencing as they are in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  Insofar as the role of the  Houses of the Oireachtas is concerned, the traditional approach to sentencing is to lay down the maximum penalty and for a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The Deputy will be aware however that there are a small number of particularly serious offences, such as murder and drugs and firearm misuse where mandatory sentencing is required under statute. </P>
        <P>The judiciary has also, under the current Chief Justice, voluntarily established a committee to oversee the development of an electronic system which will collate information on the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions. The resulting website, the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) became operational as a pilot in August 2010.  This publicly accessible resource includes statistics on sentencing, synopses of relevant court judgments and access to a database on actual sentences imposed in various crimes and cases. It provides a qualitative overview and a snapshot in time of how the courts treat various offences, who committed them and the circumstances in which they took place. It also provides references to leading cases on sentencing, summaries of particular judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the area of sentencing law and links to the judgments of that court and academic materials on the subject of sentencing.  In my view this website has the potential in time to be a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those of us concerned with the needs of victims and their families. I understand that ISIS will be evaluated after it has been operating for some time.</P>
        <P>With specific regard to a sentence of life imprisonment, this means that the prisoner is subject to that sentence for the rest of his or her life. Such prisoners have no right to be released at any stage.  Imposing multiple life sentences does not increase the severity of the sanction and has no effect in practice or law.  While a prisoner who has been given a life sentence may apply for some form of temporary release to the Parole Board, should this be granted he or she remains subject to the original sentence and can be recalled to prison at any stage.  Issues such as the gravity of the crime and the danger to the public posed by the individual would obviously be taken into consideration before any decision to grant temporary release is made.  There is no automatic right to temporary release and prisoners who have committed particularly grievous crimes and continue to pose a threat will be kept in custody indefinitely.</P>
        <P>On the subject of the introduction of tariffs on prison sentences, it has not been the practice of this State to operate such a system. The term &ldquo;tariff&rdquo; is normally used to describe the <i>minimum</i>   amount of time an offender should spend in prison as decreed by the Courts. Such a system allows no flexibility or acknowledgment of, for example, mitigating factors such as a particular commitment by a prisoner to rehabilitation that might warrant a shorter time in prison. Nor does it allow for any acknowledgment of the fact that offences and the circumstances giving rise to them can vary.  Likewise, fixed sentences for certain offences such as 25 years for murder, restrict the discretion of the State to acknowledge differing factors prior to, and after, the commission of the offence, such as, for instance public safety in the context of the release of a prisoner.  Even in the UK, for example, where such a tariff system operates, life sentence prisoners do not automatically receive parole on the expiry of their tariff.  Instead, their release is a matter for the Parole Board who may decide that detention beyond the tariff is required.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might also be interested to note that the subject of criminal sanctions, including sentencing guidelines, has been a key component in the White Paper on Crime process which <Col N="380"/>my Department has been engaged in since 2009. It was addressed specifically  in a consultation seminar held last year and was part of a discussion document and a call for written submissions.  A wide range of detailed submissions was received in response to the discussion document and a report on these submissions, along with a summary of the consultation meeting, was published last year. These reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website (<i>www.justice.ie</i>). The input received will feed into the overall White Paper process and will provide a comprehensive framework for future crime policy in the form of a National Anti-Crime strategy.</P>
        <P>Finally, I wish to inform the Deputy that I am satisfied that the Criminal Injuries Tribunal does provide decisions to applicants more quickly, and without the need for expensive legal representation, than similar claims in the Courts.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The general position is that the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 as amended, prohibits gaming except as permitted by that Act.</P>
        <P>The position concerning casinos and private members clubs derives from section 4(1)(a) and (3) of that Act. Section 4(1)(a) states that  &ldquo;  <i>No person shall promote or assist in promoting or provide facilities for any kind of gaming:  (a) in which by reason of the nature of the game, the chances of all players, including the banker, are not equal, ...</i>  &rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The effect of that provision is that casinos are not permitted. As a result, there is no provision for the licensing of casinos. However, section 4(3) states that    <i> &ldquo;Gaming shall not be unlawful if no stake is hazarded by the players with the promoter or banker other than a charge for the right to take part in the game, provided that:-</i></P><Col N="381"/>
        <P LI="2"><i>(a) only one such charge is made in respect of the day on which the game is played, and</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><i>(b) the charge is of the same amount for all players, and</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><i>(c) the promoter derives no personal profit from the promotion of the game&rdquo;.</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">Section 4(3) is relied upon by the private clubs, with the result that they are operating despite having no licence. In April 2009, the Gardai were unsuccessful in a prosecution against a private club for unlawful gaming in breach of section 4. The defence relied, inter alia, on section 4(3). That case highlighted the difficulties in bringing a successful prosecution. It   demonstrated beyond doubt the need for reform of the present law. The confused state of the law on private clubs is but one issue needing reform, I am also aware that the present law makes no provision for, for example, on-line gambling.  I hope to be able to say more soon on my plans in this area.</P>
        <P>Despite the difficulties outlined above, I want to emphasise that these clubs are subject to the general law on gaming, as set out in the 1956 Act, as well as to the public order and other relevant laws. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitor and visit these clubs as part of their general policing operations. In addition, persons directing private clubs offering casino games to members must comply with the  Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  That Act requires private members&rsquo; clubs at which gambling activities are carried on to register with my Department; my Department&rsquo;s anti money laundering unit follows up with inspection visits and other controls.  It must be emphasised, however, that registration does not in any way convey any legitimacy on or regulation of the general gaming activities of these clubs.</P>

	<P>I can assure the Deputy that the development of appropriate and effective criminal justice responses to both prostitution and drug trafficking is the focus of ongoing work within my Department and its agencies. </P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policing Plan for  2011 sets out the commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in organised criminal activities, including prostitution and the importation, sale and supply of illegal drugs. To this end, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to the use of intelligence-led operations and tactics, including those of specialist national units such as the National Bureau of Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau is being actively utilised to identify and target funds accumulated by criminals, in order to seize such assets and to deprive them of the profits of their criminal activity.   A dedicated unit within the Garda National Drugs Unit has been established to liaise with the Criminal Assets Bureau to particularly target those criminals and criminal groupings believed to be deriving profits and assets from drug-related criminal activity.</P>
        <P>This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and using available criminal legislation to its fullest extent.</P>
        <P>In addition, relevant Garda operations, such as operation &lsquo;Quest&rsquo; which encompasses all Garda action against organised prostitution within the State,  are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure their effectiveness.</P>
        <P>With regard to the strengthening of the laws which underpin the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this area, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government includes a commitment to strengthen the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau in relation to the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime. Work in this regard is ongoing.</P>
        <P>In relation to the particular question raised concerning the law governing prostitution and the purchase of sexual services, I can inform the Deputy that in this jurisdiction, the criminal law governing prostitution is aimed at protecting society from the more intrusive aspects of such activity from a public order perspective, while also seeking to protect prostitutes from exploitation.   Under the existing law the sale or purchase of sexual services is not an offence.  However associated activities which cause a public nuisance such as soliciting by either party to a transaction or the exploitation of prostitution such as pimping or running a brothel are criminal offences.</P>
        <P>In 2010, the Swedish Government completed an evaluation of its 1999 legislation criminalising the purchase of sex. The Dignity Project, a research project funded by the EU, arranged a visit to Sweden to learn more about the evaluation and the delegation included representation from my Department.</P>
        <P>I am examining a report prepared by my Department following the visit to Stockholm and which was submitted to the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office. I am also examining the Attorney&rsquo;s recent advices concerning the legal and constitutional implications of introducing a ban on the purchase of sex.</P><Col N="383"/>
        <P>More generally, the Deputy may also wish to be aware that my Department has engaged in a public consultation process to develop a White Paper on Crime with a view to developing a policy framework for future strategies to combat and prevent crime.</P>

	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision.  Direct provision allows asylum seekers to be provided with full board accommodation and certain ancillary services while their applications for international protection are being processed. Today, RIA has contracted to it 40 accommodation centres around the country accommodating just over 5,600 persons, including the centre which is the subject of this question.</P>
        <P>In fulfilling its general accommodation responsibilities, the RIA does not lease or rent premises from commercial contractors.  Rather, it &lsquo;contracts-in&rsquo; a comprehensive range of services and facilities, which include accommodation, housekeeping etc., for a fixed sum over the period of the contract.  RIA endeavours to achieve the best value for money in relation to such contracts, in respect of which negotiations can take place with a number of commercial entities.  It is not in the interests of the taxpayer that details of current individual contracts are known to the public or to other parties who are, or may be in the future, engaged in negotiations with the RIA. Therefore, details of current contracts are not provided.  Per diem payment rates to contractors, which may be gleaned from past data, are not necessarily a guide to current rates. For example, in 2009 negotiations took place with contractors to amend contracts to reduce costs to the taxpayer in the light of the prevailing crisis in the public finances and rates in new contracts also reflect the current financial reality.</P>
        <P>In relation to the centre in question, details from the first contract beginning in July 2004 to the contract ending in October, 2008 are shown in the table below.  It shows the number of accommodation places provided during the currency of each contract and the overall value of each of the contracts. Note that contracts are not generally made for periods matching a calendar year and can span a number of years or simply a number of months.  It can be said that the contract which began after October 2008, and which is ongoing, provides for a current accommodation capacity of 255.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 630 and 642 together.</P>
        <P>I share the impatience of many people at the pace of the investigations into possible criminal behaviour at Anglo Irish Bank.  I do not intend this as any criticism of investigators and prosecutors, who face tough challenges as a result of the complexities of the matters being investigated.  At the same time, I am concerned to ensure that I do not say anything that could prejudice any possible prosecutions or any court hearing.  It is imperative that such investigations are conducted in a thorough, methodical and comprehensive manner, so as to ensure that account is taken of all pertinent matters.  If this is not done, there is a risk that any prosecutions that may proceed would be jeopardised.</P>
        <P>It was in the light of my concerns that I gave priority to the passage through the Oireachtas of the Criminal Justice Act 2011, which was enacted on 2 August and most of which was commenced on 9 August.  This new legislation is intended to speed up investigations and prosecutions in relation to white collar crimes, both future investigations and those currently underway, by improving a number of important procedural matters and strengthening Garda investigative powers.</P>
        <P>On becoming Minister, I sought and received assurances that there were sufficient resources available to the investigations.  I can assure the Deputy that this Government will continue to provide sustained support for the investigation in terms of resources,  as well as the necessary  legislative and administrative supports, and that if those involved in the investigations believe at any stage that additional resources are required that will be responded to.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, following the submission by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation of two substantial investigation files relating to matters in Anglo Irish Bank to the Director of Public Prosecutions last December, a supplementary investigation file was submitted in May.  The files remain under consideration by the DPP, and his directions are awaited.</P>
        <P>The investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is ongoing, in respect of both of these two investigations and also of other complaints received of alleged malpractice at Anglo Irish Bank.   I understand that it is intended to submit further files to the DPP in the near future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 632 and 633 together.</P>
        <P>The function of the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) is to provide employment vetting for organisations in Ireland registered with the GCVU which employ/engage persons, who in the course of their work, will have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults. This would, of course, include organisations who engage healthcare professionals.</P>
        <P>The GCVU has no function in determining whether any individual or categories of individuals should be exempt from the requirement to obtain a Garda vetting certificate. Furthermore, there is no distinction drawn between individuals resident within this jurisdiction and those from abroad.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that, at present, the average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately 10 weeks. The processing time for vetting applications does fluctuate in line with periods of increased demand.  In some cases additional time may be required where clarification is needed as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that in order to observe equity and fairness in respect of applicants for Garda vetting, the general processing procedures are such that applications are processed in chronological order, from the date of receipt at the Vetting Unit.  However, in order to cater for very exceptional circumstances, arrangements are in place with the HSE to expedite the processing of very urgent applications.</P>
        <P>It is clearly important that applications are processed within a reasonable time. While it is a fact there will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process an application, the length of time currently being taken is a matter of concern which I am determined to address. In that context, a number of immediate measures are being taken to improve the situation.  The sanction of the Department of Finance has been obtained to retain the services of ten temporary employees in the GCVU.  A further sanction has been obtained to engage an <Col N="386"/>additional ten temporary employees for the Unit and the process of recruiting these is underway. Registered organisations have been advised to take account of the time required to process applications in their recruitment and selection process and other measures aimed at improving turnaround times for applications are also under consideration.</P>
        <P>I would like to point out that the Garda&iacute; make every effort to reduce the time to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out what are very necessary checks.</P>
        <P>The Government have approved the draft scheme of a National Vetting Bureau Bill which will establish a statutory basis to underpin vetting procedures for persons to work with children and vulnerable adults.</P>

	<P>The Council of Europe 1983 Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons provides a mechanism whereby prisoners sentenced abroad may be returned to Ireland in order to serve their sentences.  The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts 1995 and 1997 provides the legislative basis for this Convention in Ireland. </P>
        <P>The purpose of the Convention, which is based on humanitarian considerations, is to overcome the difficulties posed for prisoners serving sentences in foreign jurisdictions, such as absence of contact with relatives and differences in languages and culture.  Each case is decided on its own merits and in this regard consideration is given as to whether the person concerned would be ordinarily resident in this jurisdiction, were it not for their imprisonment.</P>
        <P>All applications for transfer are subject to a three way consent mechanism;  that of the applicant, the sentencing state and the receiving state.  It should be noted, however, that, even where all of the conditions are satisfied, there is no obligation on a State to comply with a transfer request.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that disqualification from driving may occur in three ways, by court disqualification, penalty point disqualification and the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  A court disqualification may be consequential (a disqualification as a penalty for a specific offence), ancillary (a disqualification imposed at the discretion of the court without prejudice to any other penalty imposed) or a special disqualification (applied for by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where in the opinion of the member the person concerned is deemed by reason of disease or physical or mental disability unfit to drive).</P>

At present, there are approximately 55,000 applications in the course of being processed.<b> </b>  I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that at present there is a total of five Garda&iacute;, 76 full-time Garda civilian personnel and ten temporary civilian personnel assigned to the GCVU.  This represents a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development in Garda vetting began in 2005.</P>

        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 13th April, 2011, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protec<Col N="390"/>tion in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that the Subsidiary Protection application lodged by the person concerned will be considered on its individual merits having regard for the information provided by the applicant in his application as measured against relevant, up to date, objective information relating to his country of origin. All documentation submitted in support of the application, including the documentation referred to by the Deputy, will be examined before a decision to grant or refuse Subsidiary Protection is arrived at.</P>
        <P>I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

        <P>I would remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that under the Civil Legal Act 1995, as passed by the Oireachtas, the Legal Aid Board is independent in the operation of its functions. However, as a courtesy to the Deputy I have obtained the information sought and am providing it to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>At the outset, I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board provides &lsquo;legal aid&rsquo; and not &lsquo;free legal aid&rsquo;. The vast majority of persons receiving services from the Board pay a small financial contribution.  I also wish to clarify that the Board provides services through, inter alia, law centres. However, FLAC (Free Legal Advice Centres) is an non-governmental organisation and is not connected to the Board in any way.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Board that the waiting time by reference to each law centre as of 31 August 2011 is set out below. As of 1 September 2011 there were 4,482 persons waiting for a first appointment with a solicitor. The Board prioritises matters that it considers require an immediate service. The sort of matters prioritised include cases involving domestic violence, the risk of children going into care, child abduction, and critical dates being close to expiry. Some other cases that are heard in the District Court are also given earlier appointments. The Board does not generally prioritise matters simply because there is a court date. It considers that this is unfair and inequitable to other applicants, many of whom may be seeking to get to court. Persons who have a court date and are not given an appointment prior to the court date are given a letter detailing their application which they may produce to the court.</P>

        <P>Rathcoole Garda Station opens to the public daily between 10am-1pm and 2pm-6pm. During the hours the station is not open to the public, there is call diversion in place to Clondalkin Garda Station.  Any increase of the opening hours at Rathcoole Garda Station would necessitate the employment of additional Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties who in the view of the Garda authorities may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.</P>

	<P>IT expenditure for the Department in 2010 was &euro;18,868,523.  This figure comprises expenditure for the following areas:</P>
<P LI="2">1. The Department itself and the bodies/offices/agencies 
         on its IT Shared Service (see full list below)</P>
        <P LI="2">2. Irish Prison Service</P>

        <P LI="2">4. Financial Shared Services</P>
        <P LI="2">5. Equality divisions &amp; agencies, until their transfer to the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P LI="2">The budget for 2011 is made up of expenditure to date, &euro;9,825,546, and expenditure to year-end, projected at some &euro;8,892,500.  The figures include expenditure in relation to divisions and agencies, including the Equality divisions and agencies which transferred into the Department of Justice and Equality earlier this year.</P>
        <P LI="2">The Department&rsquo;s IT Shared Service, operating since 2003, provides centralised IT services to approximately 2,000 users in the Department and 25 agencies nationally and internationally.  This approach ensures that the Department achieves economies of scale for the provision of these services, whilst reducing administration costs.  Contracts and expenditure are regularly reviewed, and suppliers engaged with, to ensure that products and services are delivered at the most cost-effective rates.  All IT procurement, by the Department and its agencies, is undertaken in accordance with the procurement requirements imposed by legislation and Government Directives.  By going regularly to the market, and by utilising the economies inherent in existing public sector contracts, the Department drives continuous increased efficiencies and cost savings in the services delivered.  At present the Department has a series of wide ranging ICT procurement exercises underway and is confident that these will reduce its costs in the medium term &mdash; it is also engaged in <Col N="394"/>the inter Departmental Cloud Computing group which it anticipates will produce substantial operational savings in the medium to long term.</P>

      </Qst><Col N="399"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains a comprehensive series of provisions aimed at protecting children and other persons.  The Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements under its Part 2.  The provisions of the Act also extend to any offenders convicted abroad of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of 8 September, 2011, there were 1,164 persons subject to the requirements of Part 2 of the Act.</P>
        <P>Notifications are received on a regular basis regarding convicted sex offenders who enter the State. In turn, the relevant nominated Divisional Inspector involved in the monitoring of sex offenders is notified immediately.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the information requested relating to the number of such notifications is not readily available and would require a disproportionate amount of time and resources to collate.</P>
        <P>Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling, publishing and responding to queries regarding recorded crime statistics.</P>
        <P>I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy in relation to the number of prosecutions and convictions in 2009, 2010 and to date in 2011 in respect of breaches of Part 2 of the Act.</P>

        <P>The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.</i></P>
        <P><i>The person concerned was subsequently notified of his entitlement to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006. The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</i></P>
        <P><i>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.

	<P>The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) informs me that the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question has been granted as an exceptional measure, temporary permission to remain in the State until 04 July 2014.  I am advised by the INIS that the holding of this permission does not extend to the issuance of a temporary travel document.</P>
        <P>In exceptional cases an application for Irish temporary travel document may be considered in respect of qualifying non Irish nationals who are resident in Ireland.  In all such cases, the INIS must be satisfied that there is no alternative open to the applicant before an Irish temporary travel document will issue.  The person concerned has to show that they have made reasonable and formal efforts to obtain a national passport, that it has been formally and unreasonably refused and that their own consular authorities are unable to offer consular assistance to them whilst resident in the State.</P>
        <P>The INIS informs me that the person concerned had a recent application for Irish temporary travel document refused on 11 August 2011. He was advised to contact his own consular authorities to establish the procedures to be followed which would allow for him to procure a national passport whilst resident in this State.</P>
        <P>It is open to the person in question to submit a new application for a temporary travel document accompanied by the relevant supporting documentation to the Travel Document Unit of the INIS which is located at 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2<b>.  </b>Full information in this regard and the applicable application form is available at &ldquo;<i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I should<b> </b>remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made direct to the INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</P>

        <P>The Act also provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are that the applicant must&mdash;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />be of full age or be a minor born in the State</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />be of good character</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />The parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to a child born in the State who did not at birth have an entitlement to Irish citizenship may apply for a certificate of naturalisation on their behalf using Form 8A, which is available on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website at <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>. This is an e-form, which is filled in and submitted elecronically.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 29 June 2005.  His asylum application was refused by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 10 November 2006, of the proposal to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the option of making representations as to why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  The representations made by the person concerned were considered under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) and a Deportation Order was made in respect of the person concerned on 1 September 2010.  Judicial Review proceedings were initiated in the High Court on 14 October 2010, challenging the decision to make a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned.  These proceedings are ongoing and, as such, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 215 of 7 July 2011.  The position is unchanged since then.  The reply was as follows:</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person referred to by the Deputy is the subject of a  Deportation Order, following a comprehensive and thorough examination of his asylum claim and of his application to remain temporarily in the State. He has been evading his deportation since 3 November 2009 and should he come to the notice of the Garda authorities, he would be liable to arrest and detention. He should, therefore, present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau without any further delay.</P>
        <P>As a general matter of policy, it would be logistically inconsistent to reward persons who have failed a very fair and comprehensive asylum process, and who have thereafter proceeded to evade their deportation for several years, by granting such persons residency in the State.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 700 and 701 together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a series of post-imprisonment restraint orders for violent and sexual offenders to include electronic tagging and other restrictions, which may be imposed at the time of sentencing.  The Sex Offenders Act 2001 introduced the sex offenders&rsquo; register, post-release supervision orders for sex offenders and civil orders restricting sex offenders in certain ways.  Proposals aimed at amending the Act are at an advanced stage of development.  Legislative proposals being considered include measures for the electronic monitoring of sex offenders in specific circumstances and changes with regard to civil sex offender orders to make it easier to apply to a court for such an order.  Apart from the post-release orders applicable to sex offenders, the law provides for a range of orders that may apply, post-release, to people convicted of other offences.  They include the registration requirement for drug trafficking offenders under Part 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006), the monitoring and protection of persons orders under section 26 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 and post-release orders in the case of serious offences under section 14 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  My current priority is measures relating to sex offenders.  When they have been finalised, consideration will be given to what new measures may be appropriate to violent offenders.</P>

	<P>The Programme of the Government for National Recovery 2011-2016 undertakes to &ldquo;establish independent regulation of the legal profession to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&rdquo;.  These undertakings complement those structural reforms in the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland aimed at removing restrictions to trade and competition relating to the legal professions and legal costs, namely to establish an independent regulator for the legal professions and implement the recommendations of the Legal Costs Working Group; and to implement the outstanding Competition Authority recommendations to reduce legal costs.  The commitment of the Government is to a strategy that is comprehensive, provides more independent regulation of the legal professions, better regulates legal costs and will ensure that the complaints procedures are as effective as possible. The strategy, when implemented, will improve the overall system of delivery of legal services in the State.  The details of my proposals for implementation of the various commitments I have mentioned will be announced by way of publication of the Legal Services Bill early in this session.</P>

	<P>In June of this year I announced a series of measures within my Department to provide for speedier processing of citizenship applications to bring about a substantial reduction in the processing timescale.  The new arrangements include improved application forms that came into force on Friday, 24 June 2011, and are currently available online with an associated online residence checker, streamlined and accelerated procedures for certain types of application and plans to recruit interns under the new Internship Programme. These measures are targeted at clearing the backlog of applications awaiting a decision in excess of six months by spring of next year and from that time on the aim is, other than in exceptional circumstances, that people applying for citizenship will be given a decision on their application within six months.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has already made towards meeting this objective.  Since I came to office, I have made decisions on some 11,500 naturalisation applications.  By the end of September, I will have issued over 8,000 certificates of naturalisation.  During the corresponding period in 2010, a total of 4,200 decisions were made with 3,600 certificates of naturalisation issued.  In addition, I have also introduced citizenship ceremonies at which candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation in a more meaningful and dignified manner.  Steps are being taken to recruit an initial ten interns through the JobBridge National Internship Scheme to the citizenship section to afford them meaningful work experience and to assist in addressing the backlog that built up during the term of office of the previous Government.  It is hoped ultimately to recruit a total of 30 interns to the section.  Some 64 applications have been received.  The citizenship division has commenced the selection process including short listing applicants. It is anticipated that the first group of interns will commence work by mid-October.</P>

To be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had inquiries made.  The Courts Service has informed me that a total of 75 tipstaff are employed by the Courts Service in the grades of usher and crier.  Ushers report to members of the Judiciary assigned to the Supreme and High Courts.  Criers report to members of the Judiciary assigned to the Circuit Court.  Of the 75 serving tipstaff, seven ushers are assigned to Supreme Court judges, 36 ushers are assigned to High Court judges and 32 criers are assigned to Circuit Court judges.  The pay scales for Ushers and Criers are as follows:</P>

	<P>In the correspondence referred to by the Deputy, it is suggested that business owners should have a legal right to exercise their discretion in refusing entry to their premises to shoplifters.  Business owners may reserve the right of admission to their premises where there are valid, non-discriminatory grounds for so doing.  Business owners providing goods and services are, however, prohibited under the Equal Status Acts 2000-2008 from discriminating on nine grounds in providing a service or in disposing of goods to the public generally or to a section of the public.  They are not precluded under equality legislation from refusing access to goods and services where they are of the belief, on grounds other than discriminatory grounds, that to do so would produce a substantial risk of criminal or disorderly conduct or behaviour or damage to property.  The discriminatory grounds under this legislation are gender, civil status, family status, race, age, disability, sexual orientation, religion and membership of the Traveller community.  I am not considering any change to the equality legislation in this regard.  Businesses wishing to understand and implement best practice in promoting equality in their sector may, however, seek advice from the Equality Authority.</P>

To be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made.  The Courts Service has informed me that in 2009 the Master of the High Court made 663 orders giving liberty to enter judgment.  The Courts Service has further advised that statistics are not maintained in such a way as to provide details of the number of such cases that subsequently proceeded to judgment, or were reviewed and varied by the High Court.  This information could only be obtained by an examination of each individual case which would require a disproportionate amount of staff time that cannot be justified in current circumstances.</P>

        <P LI="1">Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 23rd November, 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.

	<P>The Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention of drug smuggling into the country and responsibility for the prevention of crime rests primarily with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, the White Paper on Defence, (2000), provides for a security role for the Naval Service to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work.  The Joint Task Force on Drug Interdiction was established in 1993 as a Government measure to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs and consists of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service.  Drug interdiction is carried out by Naval ships on receipt of intelligence from the Joint Task Force.  The Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships, which are tasked with coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies.  The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State&rsquo;s obligations as a member of the European Union. </P>
        <P>The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time.  All vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on fisheries patrol. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels are deployed to other duties including drug interdiction operations.  The acquisition of the two new Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service will ensure that the Service can continue to carry out its drug interdiction and other roles in increasingly difficult and dangerous sea conditions in the Atlantic.  Preparations for their construction have commenced at Appledore in the UK and the first vessel is scheduled for delivery in early 2014.  The second vessel will follow one year later.</P>
        <P>The Naval Service, as a member of the Joint Task Force, is also committed to an international initiative, the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &mdash; Narcotics, (MAOC-N).  The Centre, which was established in 2007, has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea.  MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force with access to national tasking agencies and requires participation and resources from all active members.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service have full-time officers based at the Centre in Lisbon.  Irish Naval Service personnel travel to the Centre when requested by the Joint Task Force.  Naval Service ships at sea carry out a variety of taskings simultaneously and therefore, it is not possible to break down the Naval Service effort in the detection of the illegal importation of drugs as a percentage total of budget.  Naval Service involvement in the detection of illicit drugs varies widely from direct interdiction to continuous surveillance, presence/deterrence and intelligence gathering.  The drugs seized by the Naval Service in the three years in question had a street value at the time of &euro;675 million.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the <i>Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces</i> (the Gleeson Commission), Military Service Allowance (MSA) was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990. This approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.In the Final Report of the <i>Commission on Public Service Pensions,</i> which was published in November 2000, the Commission specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances (including the MSA) and the consequences for public service pensioners generally. However, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected (such as military pensioners), together with long-standing public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, the Commission did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned. The Report was considered and broadly accepted by Government. Aside from pre-August 1990 Defence Forces pensioners, the other groups affected include certain retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Prison Service and retired teachers. In the context of the Government&rsquo;s subsequent consideration of the Commission&rsquo;s Report, no change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised or is contemplated.</P>
<P>At present, there are approximately 10,650 persons in receipt of military occupational pensions under the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes (including almost 1,600 spouses and children of deceased personnel). About 2,900 of these are pre-August 1990 military pensioners who do not qualify for the MSA in their pension. The direct cost to this Department of extending the benefit of MSA to them is currently estimated at &euro;6.1 million a year.</P>
<P>The position of these Defence Forces pensioners cannot be looked at in isolation of the wider public service. Any departure from established pensions policy for one group would give rise to significant cost repercussions in other areas of the public service. Accordingly, there is no scope for departing from settled public service pensions policy in the case of MSA.</P>

	<P>The person in question established a plantation in December 2007 under a pilot project for the Forestry Environment Protection Scheme (FEPS).  The pilot scheme had a higher rate of top-up payment than that which applied to the FEPS scheme which was subsequently implemented. It was decided that applicants who had planted under the pilot scheme were entitled to retain the higher rate of top-up payment once they continued to fulfil all the terms and conditions of the FEPS scheme. Therefore, this applicant was entitled to the higher top-up rate.</P>
        <P>As a result of a control check of FEPS files, the client was informed that he had been overpaid on the basis that he should have been paid at the lower standard FEPS rate. However, a further review of the applicant&rsquo;s file revealed that the FEPS top-up payments made to him were at the correct rate.  Arrangements were made to cancel the previous request to the client for repayment of the overpayment. The Forest Service has written to the client to notify him of this.</P>

	<P>On Thursday 8 September 2011, I signed into law the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Agriculture) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 456 of 2011) to address the findings of the European Court of Justice against Ireland in the manner that the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive (85/337/EEC), as amended, was transposed into Irish law. </P>
        <P>The Court found that Ireland was over-reliant on size thresholds and did not take other relevant criteria, such as the cumulative impacts of development, the location of the development or activity relative to sensitive sites etc, into account.</P>
        <P>The Regulations relate to three categories of projects&mdash;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />restructuring of rural land holdings,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />the use of uncultivated land or semi-natural areas for intensive agriculture, and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />land drainage works on lands used for agriculture</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, as the lead Department in the infringement proceedings, worked closely with my Department to put a legal framework in place to comply with the judgement.</P>
        <P>Two sets of Regulations have been introduced to address the judgement. It was considered by both Departments that, with the exception of drainage and reclamation of wetlands, all of the other activities are more appropriate outside of the planning system, and should therefore be regulated by my Department. These elements have therefore been removed from the planning system by exemption under the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2011, introduced by my Ministerial colleague Mr. Phil Hogan T.D., Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and have now been included in my Department&rsquo;s Regulations.</P><Col N="433"/>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s Regulations provide for a screening and consent system that will not only satisfy the requirements of the Directive but will also provide a practical and workable solution for farmers.</P>
        <P>Activities under the thresholds set out in the Regulations that do not have an adverse impact on the environment can proceed without having to be screened by my Department. Above these thresholds farmers will have to apply to my Department for screening as to whether the proposed activity should proceed or that it requires an Environmental Impact Assessment to be conducted. There will be no cost involved in the screening application. It will be a relatively straightforward process and each application will be adjudicated upon on a case by case basis in a timely manner, taking into account the relevant criteria outlined in the Directive.</P>
        <P>Mandatory Environmental Impact Assessments will only be required for larger projects which are above specific thresholds set out in the Regulations.</P>
        <P>The implementation of this practical system provides a workable solution that will minimise the administrative burden on farmers, keep the process, with the exception of drainage and reclamation of wetlands, outside the planning system and also ensure that Ireland should not be open to the imposition of very large daily fines for non-compliance with the European Court of Justice finding.</P>

	<P>Agroforestry is a land use system which facilitates the growing of trees with crop and livestock production on the same land unit.  There are several types of agroforestry systems but it commonly involves growing crops or grazing livestock between rows of trees planted at wide intervals.  Agroforestry is not widely practised in Ireland, but it offers considerable potential on many Irish farms to plant trees in ways which contribute actively to a better environment, while complementing existing farming practice.  While there appears to be some increased interest in agroforestry among some farmers, there are no immediate plans to introduce a specific agroforestry scheme.</P>

	<P>Under the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 the regulation of coursing is chiefly a matter for the Irish Coursing Club (ICC) subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon, which is the statutory body with responsibility for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing. </P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government Under section 34 of the Wildlife Act 1976 also has responsibility for the issue of an annual licence to the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares.</P>
        <P>A Monitoring Committee on Coursing was established in 1993/94 comprising Departmental officials and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the ICC to monitor developments in coursing.  Both wildlife rangers (NPWS) and a veterinary inspector attend coursing meetings on a random basis in an observer capacity and report on their findings.  The Monitoring Committee also arranges to have any complaints or reported incidents investigated.  As a result, the situation is kept under constant review.</P>
        <P>This Department monitors the situation to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interest of animal welfare both for hares and greyhounds alike. Consequently the Government does not plan to ban hare coursing.</P>

	<P>Under the EU provisions of the governing EU Regulations, farmers must declare an eligible hectare for each payment entitlement held to benefit from full payment under the Single Payment Scheme. </P>
        <P>The EU Regulations do, however, provide that under certain circumstances a farmer can apply to consolidate their payment entitlements. In other words, while the overall value of the Single Farm Payment would remain the same, the number of entitlements held could be reduced and their value increased. One of the measures that are covered by the consolidation process is the afforestation of land under the Afforestation Aid Scheme. If an applicant considers that he or she is eligible to consolidate his or her entitlements in a particular scheme-year, an application must be made by the deadline for the receipt of Single Farm Payment applications in that scheme-year. This date is normally 15 May or the next working day if the 15th   May falls on a weekend.</P><Col N="436"/>
        <P>As the person named did not submit an application for the consolidation of entitlements before the deadline for the receipt of applications during the period 2007 and 2010, the payments issued to the applicant in respect of those years were in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations.</P>

        <P>In general, most areas of county Kerry are suitable for afforestation.  However, there are some areas of the county that are silviculturally unsuitable for growing trees, such as areas of infertile blanket peat; coastal areas which are prone to marine exposure and salt deposition; and elevated areas over 300 metres.  Areas designated for nature conservation such as SPAs, SACs and NHAs, and areas deemed to be &ldquo;potentially acid sensitive&rdquo; by the EPA, may also restrict opportunities for afforestation in some areas of the county, even in areas that may be silviculturally suitable for forestry.</P>
        <P>All applications submitted to my Department for approval to undertake afforestation are examined by reference to the silvicultural and environmental suitability of the site for forestry.  This includes an assessment of issues such as soil type, soil fertility, exposure etc., along with an assessment of the potential impact of the project on water quality, landscapes and nature conservation.  My Department cannot use Exchequer funds to support the establishment of new forests in areas that are silviculturally unsuitable for forestry or where forestry may negatively impact on the environment.</P>

        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, is engaged in a comprehensive programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of aquaculture sites located within Natura 2000 areas.

The comprehensive data collection programme together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives will enable all new and renewal applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. Once the relevant data has been collected, conservation objectives for the site have to be established by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS). The establishment of these conservation objectives by NPWS will allow individual licence applications to be assessed against the conservation objectives.</P>

        <Quest> the current requirements to import sheep from Scotland to here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Intra-Community trade in sheep is governed by the provisions of Council Directive 2003/50/EC which amends Council Directive 91/68/EEC.  These controls apply to breeding sheep whether they are imported or exported and all sheep must be certified with regard to their health status.  Under these rules, breeding and fattening sheep must be certified as having been continuously resident on a holding of origin for at least 30 days prior to export including a standstill period of 21 days prior to export during which time no sheep have been introduced on to the holding.  A derogation applies where sheep introduced during the standstill period are completely isolated from all other animals on the holding.</P>
        <P>Breeding sheep must have been obtained from a holding and must only have been in contact with animals from such a holding in which in the previous 6 months contagious agalactia of sheep, in the previous 12 months paratubercuosis or caseous lymphadenitis, and in the previous 3 years pulmonary adenomatosis or Maedi Visna, have not been clinically diagnosed. Ireland is free from Maedi-Visna (MV). Imports of sheep from Scotland should be accompanied by a supplementary health certificate issued by an official veterinarian providing additional guarantees for freedom from Maedi Visna.</P>
        <P>Breeding rams must also come from a holding on which no case of contagious epididymitis (Brucella Ovis) has been recorded in the last 12 months and they must have been kept permanently on the holding for 60 days prior to export.  Breeding rams must also be tested for contagious epididymitis (Brucella Ovis) with a negative result, within 30 days prior to export.  The rules in relation to scrapie are that all breeding sheep must either be of the ARR/ARR prion protein genotype, or have been kept in a scrapie monitored flock for at least 3 years with no cases of scrapie being confirmed during this period.  Sheep for slaughter must be certified as having been continuously resident on the holding of origin for at least 21 days prior to export during which time no sheep have been introduced on to the holding. All sheep for slaughter must be consigned to a slaughterhouse. There are no scrapie requirements on the health certificate for sheep for slaughter.</P>

	<P>The person named was approved into the AEOS scheme with effect from the 1st November 2010.  Under the EU Regulations governing the Agri-Environment Options Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue. Payments have commenced as the administration checks have been completed satisfactorily. However, the checks have highlighted a discrepancy between the amount claimed on the AEOS application and the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) application of the person named. A letter has issued to the person named outlining the problem and asking the person named to amend the application in line with his SPS application. Once a reply is received the file will be processed further.</P>

        <Quest> the budget available to his Department for information technology, IT, expenditure in 2010 and 2011; the provisions within his Department for the purchasing of IT equipment; the efforts that are being undertaken to ensure value for money and cost reductions in this regard; if there are budgets and procedures in place for the purchasing of IT equipment for each State agency under his remit for 2010 and 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The IT expenditure budget allocation for my Department in 2010 was &euro;22,379,200 and in 2011 was &euro;21,079,505.  My Department provides a robust and resilient ICT infrastructure to customers, staff, agents and partners including shared service offerings to state agencies and other Government Departments. It also supports a wide range of modern and efficient IT systems that underpin the Department&rsquo;s critical business processes. Savings are achieved on an ongoing basis by leveraging maximum value from existing investments, negotiating reductions on contracts and software licences, and careful management of external resources for software development.</P>
        <P>My Department ensures that all public procurement procedures in relation to IT equipment, as outlined by the Department of Finance, are adhered to during the procurement process. As part of these processes every effort is undertaken to ensure value for money and achieve cost reductions. IT expenditure is based on competitive tendering with extensive use of Central Government and Department specific frameworks which continue to drive costs down.  As part of the Croke Park Agreement, a 5% saving in ICT expenditure will be achieved in each year from 2012 to 2014. In relation to agencies under the aegis of my Department,<i> </i>the budgets and procedures in place for the purchasing of IT equipment for each State agency is an operational matter for the agencies themselves.</P>
        <P>In order to provide the Government with a comprehensive set of decision options to meet the funding constraints in the National Recovery Plan, 2012-2014, the Department has carried out a comprehensive review of both current and capital expenditure. This Review which covers all areas of the Department&rsquo;s activities will be considered as part of the overall pre-budget deliberations and the 2012 Estimates process of the Government.</P>

	<P>There are as yet no proposals from the Commission regarding the future arrangements for the grant of payments to farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Commission proposals for the future of the CAP including its proposals for direct payments to farmers will not be published until mid October. While some draft early versions of Commission proposals have been mentioned in media, the final proposals from the Commission may differ from these drafts in many respects.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, in its communication of November 2010 the Commission announced its intention of moving towards uniform regional or national rates of payment and there is pressure from the European Parliament and many Member States to do this. However I, along with Ministers from other Member States, strongly pressed for greater flexibility for member states to adopt payment models suitable to their own conditions. I will continue to stress this point in the upcoming negotiations.</P>

        <Quest> his views on recent centralised movement monitoring system, CMMS, data showing the reduction of 177,000 cattle in the country; his further views on the tight nature of finished cattle supplies at present; and the impact that this is having on prices for farmers. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Animal Identification and Movement (AIM formerly CMMS) system is a generic traceability system that allows my Department to track trends in the bovine population. The most recent data on the cattle herd profile sourced from the AIM system show that there was a reduction of over 172,000 head in the number of cattle aged from 12 to 30 months at 1 June 2011 compared to the same date in 2010. Clearly, a reduction in cattle numbers of that magnitude in this age cohort will adversely impact on supplies for the remainder of 2011 and throughout 2012. Changes in cattle numbers can occur for many reasons but the current decline in young male cattle, which collectively account for some 165,000 of the decrease, is largely attributable to the effects of the strong live export trade in previous years together with an increase in young bull production.</P><Col N="445"/>
        <P>A tight supply situation, both nationally and internationally, is contributing to strong price returns for domestic producers. Total cattle throughput at Irish meat export premises to the end of August was almost 53,000 head (or 5%) down on the corresponding period in 2010. To date this year, average prices paid by Irish meat plants for all categories of stock are between 14% and 17% higher than those prevailing during the same period in 2010. This is welcome news for livestock farmers who must also contend with higher input costs for feed, fertiliser and energy which typically constitute of 70% of total costs in beef production after stock purchases are taken into account.</P>
        <P>The outlook for the remainder of the year is that prime cattle availability will remain considerably tighter than last year while export demand is likely to increase because of falling EU production and supplies. According to Bord Bia estimates, supplies at domestic export plants will reach around 1.54 million head for the year, which would equate to a fall of 100,000 on 2010 levels. Given these favourable market conditions, the immediate prospects are for a strong autumn trade which should help further boost producer profitability in this important indigenous export sector.</P>

	<P>Grass re-seeding, if correctly carried out, is a cost effective means of significantly increasing productivity on the majority of livestock farms. Modern grass varieties are bred to meet the varied demands of these intensive enterprises.  As a result of the grass seed evaluation programme carried out by my Department the current grass varieties recommended for use in this country have the ability, when grown on good soils, to produce excellent yield and quality while also extending the grass growing period.  Over the last decade the annual rate of reseeding of pasture land in Ireland has been in the region of 2.5%.  However in the 2010/2011 season, following strong promotion of the economic benefits of reseeding by Teagasc and others organisations such as Irish Grassland Association, this rate has increased considerably and this is a welcome development.</P>

	<P>REPS 4 is a measure under the Rural Development Programme, 2007-13, and is subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications to be completed before payments can issue.  These administrative checks have been completed and of the 30,300 farmers due a payment in respect of 2010, approximately 750 applicants are currently awaiting their initial 75% payment for the year. This is due to queries which have arisen during these administrative checks. Outstanding queries are being rectified on an ongoing basis, including through correspondence with applicants, and payments issue as soon as the queries are resolved. My Department is also currently making arrangements to process the outstanding 25% payment to farmers in instances where penalties have been imposed. I now expect that these outstanding payments <Col N="446"/>will commence in October to approximately 2,000 farmers with penalties.  Arrangements are also well advanced to issue payments in respect of 2011 and I expect that these payments will commence in November.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 783 and 784 together.  </P>
        <P>The position with regard to this case is as outlined in reply to a question from the Deputy on 20 July 2011, which is as follows.</P>
        <P>My reply of 14 July, 2011 sets out the procedures that are followed in relation to changes to a herd number.  On 9 December 2009 a copy of the death certificate of the person in whose name the herd number was registered was received by my Department.  In accordance with standard procedures in such circumstances, the herd owner was then registered under personal representatives of the deceased person.  An application was received on 4 January 2010 from the personal representatives of the deceased person to register details of the herd number in the name of the son of the deceased person.  The application was accompanied by a copy of Probate of the Will of the deceased person, indicating that the son was the executor and sole beneficiary of the Estate.  Following an on-farm inspection on 27 January 2010, it was decided that no change in registration of the herd number should take place pending clarification of the issue of ownership of the land and or cattle thereon.  In the meantime, the herd keeper role, which assigns responsibility for the care and maintenance of the cattle to a nominated person, was assigned to the son of the deceased person in whose name the request for transfer of the herd number had been received.  An on-farm inspection was carried out by the DVO on 27 January 2010 and all of the cattle present on the holding were inspected and found to be in order.  As outlined in my earlier reply, a nominated keeper may or may not be the legal owner of the animals held under a herd number or the holding where the animals are held.</P>
        <P>With regard to entitlements to certain farm payments, under EU Regulations governing the Single Payment scheme, entitlements are not attached to land and do not transfer automatically with land.  Entitlements form an independent asset that is owned by a specified person and, upon the death of that person, is governed by normal testamentary procedure.  In accordance with the will of the deceased person, the son was the executor and sole beneficiary of the Estate. Therefore he became the beneficiary of these entitlements which he subsequently sold to third parties from 2008.</P>
        <P>With regard to Suckler cow and Disadvantaged Area payments, any payments due under these schemes issued into the bank account of the deceased person and hence the normal testamentary procedure regarding execution of the will and her estate would have applied to those payments.</P>
        <P>On 5 May 2011 an application for registration as a herd owner was received from the daughter of the deceased person.  Evidence of ownership of land accompanied this application.  This application is currently under consideration and it is anticipated that a decision will be made in regard to that application in the near future.</P>
        <P>The late owner of the registered herd-number referred to, made a Will, and a Grant of Probate was extracted in due course by the nominated executor.  It is a fundamental principle of the Single Payment Scheme that Single Payment entitlements are not attached to land, otherwise specified in the will and do not transfer automatically with land.  Entitlements form an independent asset that is owned by the person for whom they were established and, upon the death of that person, is governed by normal testamentary procedures.  My Department is satisfied that the entitlements in question were transferred in accordance with the Will of the deceased and were subsequently sold to third parties from 2008.</P>

	<P>The person named commenced REPS 4 in 2008 and has received full payments for the first two years of his contract.  In addition, 75% of their third year payment issued on 31st December 2010.  An area based discrepancy was discovered following a cross-check between the Single Payment Scheme application for 2010 from the person named and the REPS agri-environmental plan.  This over-claim has resulted in the imposition of a penalty and a delay in processing the final 25% payment due under REPS 4 for 2010.  My Department is currently making arrangements to process outstanding payments to farmers of the 25% due in respect of 2010 in the cases where penalties were incurred and I expect payments to commence in these cases in October.</P>

	<P>REPS 4 is a measure under the Rural Development Programme, 2007-13, and is subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications to be completed before payments can issue.</P>
        <P>These administrative checks have been completed and of the 30,300 farmers due a payment in respect of 2010, approximately 750 applicants are currently awaiting their initial 75% payment for the year.  This is due to queries which have arisen during these administrative checks.  Outstanding queries are being rectified on an ongoing basis, including through correspondence with applicants, and payments issue as soon as the queries are resolved.  My Department is also currently making arrangements to process the outstanding 25% payment to farmers in instances where penalties have been imposed.  I now expect that these outstanding payments will commence in October to approximately 2,000 farmers with penalties.  Arrangements are also well advanced to issue payments in respect of 2011 and I expect that these payments will commence in November.</P>

	<P>The issue of cuts in professional fees is, in the first instance, a matter for consideration centrally by the Department of Finance or by Government in the context of the annual budgetary process.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s Vote contains a number of dedicated budget lines for the payment of professional fees for services rendered.  The total Vote provision in 2011 amounts to &euro;34 million, most of which relates to fixed fees payable to temporary veterinary inspectors involved the public health and animal health areas.  The Vote also provides for the cost of legal services that may be required by the Department.  The level of professional fees incurred under this heading varies from year to year and is dependent on a variety of factors.  In addition, the Department may engage, as required, other professional services such as IT specialists.  Engagements in these areas are subject to public procurement procedures and to signed contracts which are designed to ensure best value for money and that fees reflect prevailing market prices.</P>
        <P>In order to provide the Government with a comprehensive set of decision options to meet the funding constraints in the National Recovery Plan, 2012-2014, the Department has carried out a comprehensive review of both current and capital expenditure.  This Review which covers all areas of the Department&rsquo;s activities will be considered as part of the overall pre-budget deliberations and the 2012 Estimates process of the Government.</P>

Work is underway in relation to the preparation of the Bill, in consultation with the Adoption Authority, to provide for a structured and regulated way of providing access to information and contact for those <Col N="453"/>affected by adoption.  I intend to take this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.</P>
        <P>The National Adoption Contact Register was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  Already 440 matches have been made on the Register representing over 900 individuals who have now received a service.  The operation of the Register was reviewed in 2007 and a major upgrading of it has just been completed.</P>
        <P>The then Adoption Board, together with the adoption societies, the HSE and the adoption support groups, developed the &ldquo;Standardised Framework for the Provision of a National Information and Tracing Service&rdquo;.  This was published in November 2007 and sets standards and provides guidance and advice for information and tracing services providers nationally.</P>
        <P>The issue of a centralised register is not currently under active consideration but such a development may receive attention in the context of the drafting of the legislation referred to above.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The National Vetting Bureau Bill will provide a statutory basis for the vetting of all applicants for employment and employees working with children.

	<P>I have responsibility for implementing the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.</P>
        <P>It is a fundamental principle of the programme that the preschool year be provided free of charge to a parent whose child qualifies under the programme. However, participating service providers may charge parents for optional additions such as extra hours or various one-off or on-going activities or services such as outings, specific teaching resources such as dance or music, and food; but should not include activities which would generally be regarded as a normal part of a preschool service e.g. general arts and crafts activities.</P><Col N="455"/>
        <P>It is a condition of the ECCE programme that, where optional activities are provided during the required period of preschool provision, appropriate programme-based activities be provided to children not participating in these optional activities.  Both groups of children must be, at the same time, under the required levels of staff supervision required by the programme.  Any additional optional activity must not be provided in a way that would leave non-participating children feeling excluded.  If a service is unsure as to whether or not this would happen, then these optional activities should take place outside the normal times of the session.</P>
        <P>The City and County Childcare Committees continually monitor the programme in order to ensure that all parents benefit from the free preschool provision as intended.  The Childcare Directorate of my Department will also request Pobal, who assist with the implementation of the programme, to carry out additional visits to ensure compliance where any issue arises in relation to the delivery of the free preschool provision.</P>

As regard the latter category, the Deputy might wish to note that my Department has a number of initiatives in which children and young people under the age of 18 are involved and attend meetings and events in Dublin or other parts of the country.  These initiatives are conducted under Goal 1 of the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy which states that children and young people will have a voice on issues that affect their lives.  The children involved in these initiatives travel from all parts of the country and in keeping with best practice in child protection, taxis are ordered when necessary to bring the children from bus/train stations or from their homes to meetings and events.  Older teenagers use public transport where appropriate and possible.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s travel policy in relation to taxi usage generally is that their use should be kept to a minimum and should only be hired in circumstances where no suitable public transport is available.</P>

	<P>I acknowledge that the HSE&rsquo;s Child Welfare and Protection service is operating against a background of increasing service demand.  This is reflected in a significant increase in the number of children in care.</P>
        <P>The HSE has statutory responsibility under the Child Care Act, 1991, for the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  I have had discussions recently with the HSE National Director for Children and Family Services, Gordon Jeyes, in relation to the issue of demand and the arrangements within the HSE for the management of this demand. Mr Jeyes has recently completed a national review of the HSE&rsquo;s screening and assessment process in respect of reported concerns.  He has confirmed that all unallocated cases are the subject of ongoing evaluation by social workers.  In order to assist in the management of these cases an audit and alert system for child protection cases is being introduced by the HSE.  This will include a regular reporting system that will extend from front line managers to the National Director.</P>
        <P>The Government is continuing to support the HSE in terms of strengthening the response capacity of social workers.  One of the principal commitments in the Implementation Plan prepared following the publication of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse is the recruitment of additional social work staff.  The HSE has been given approval to recruit a further 60 social workers in 2011.</P>
        <P>The issue of case management is a key priority in reforming our child welfare and protection services.  I will be continuing a dialogue with the HSE to seek to make further improvements in this area as we move to the establishment of the new Children and Families Support Agency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to thank the Deputy for bringing the matter to my attention.  Under the Child Care Act 1991 the Health Service Executive (HSE) has a statutory responsibility to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. The Act requires the HSE to identify such children and to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
        <P>In the specific situation raised by the Deputy, best practice is for the relevant employer to discuss with the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the relevant statutory authorities, all available information and to come to a determination as to how best to manage the situation described.  The immediate priority should be to ensure that no child is exposed to unnecessary risk.  My Department has, in the interim, forwarded the details supplied to the HSE Children and Families Service in line with Children First.</P>

	<P>Under EU telecoms rules agreed in 2009 the 116000 number is reserved in all EU member states for a missing children hotline.  I have expressed my commitment to establish this hotline in Ireland.</P><Col N="457"/>
        <P Just="Left">It should be noted that in June 2011, ComReg, who have responsibility for allocation of this number in Ireland sought expressions of interest to run the hotline and no substantive responses were received.  However, I am aware of and have met Irish NGOs that may be interested but their estimated costings vary significantly.  My Department is working with the Department of Justice to seek to examine how best to proceed and I hope to have further details to announce shortly.  It must be remembered that operational responsibility for missing children rests with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

These limits are 8 and 4 whole-time equivalents respectively.  In addition, a Minister may also appoint two civilian drivers who are not considered &ldquo;office&rdquo; staff and are therefore not encompassed by the limits set out above.

	<P>The free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 as a universal programme to provide children with a free preschool year, normally in the year before they commence primary school.  There is no entitlement under the ECCE programme for a second year of free preschool provision.  Where a child has special needs, his or her parents can apply to have the preschool year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the scheme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  However, I understand that the pro-rata option has not been availed of in the case referred to by the Deputy and the child in question availed of the full free preschool provision in the academic year 2010-11. </P>

	<P>The Programme for Government 2011 states that the referendum on Children&rsquo;s Rights is a priority, and that the wording will be along the lines of that proposed by the All Party Oireachtas Committee.  On taking office I instructed the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) to work with the Office of the Attorney General, with a view to preparing a draft wording which will more closely reflect the work of the Joint Committee, than that which the previous Government approved in draft form. </P>
        <P>Accordingly the preparation of a draft wording is being undertaken by Parliamentary Counsel in association with the Advisory Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General and officials in my Department.  I would hope to be in a position to submit the outcome of this work to Government for approval in the Autumn.  It is envisaged that Government will be asked to approve the drafting of a Bill based on the wording submitted and to request the approval of the Oireachtas for the holding of a Constitutional referendum.  The Taoiseach has stated that the referendum will not take place on the same day as the presidential election. There is a concern that to do so may unnecessarily and unhelpfully politicise children&rsquo;s rights, and that a separate referendum is more appropriate for this important and sensitive issue.</P>

	<P>A key component to the delivery of health and social services is to ensure that services are of high quality, safe and effective for all the people using them.  In pursuit of this aim, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) was established in May 2007 as an independent authority to drive improvements in the quality and safety of health and social care on behalf of patients.  HIQA&rsquo;s healthcare quality function includes the setting and monitoring of standards and the conduct of investigations.  HIQA incorporates the office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services.  HIQA also has functions in relation to Health Technology Assessment and Health Information.  Government funding is provided to HIQA in order to allow HIQA undertake its statutory role in order to improve patients&rsquo; experiences and outcomes.</P><Col N="462"/>
        <P>The Programme for Government 2011-2016 commits to the establishment of a Patient Safety Authority to incorporate HIQA.  The Programme describes a regulatory function for the PS as one of the features central to the overall reform objective of the establishment of a system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI) and of the establishment of public hospitals as independent not-for-profit trusts.  The current and future structures of health care in this country will pave the way for a new culture of patient safety, openness, transparency, learning and accountability.</P>

        <Quest>  the way he is planning for and anticipating his shared role in ensuring greater cross-departmental and cross-sectoral working and ultimately implementing the upcoming National Positive Aging Strategy; the way in which his anticipation of his role in implementing the National Positive Aging Strategy is being incorporated into the Budget 2012 considerations.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government published in March 2011 has committed to completing and implementing the National Positive Ageing Strategy so that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives.  Traditionally, policy relating to older people has tended to deal almost exclusively with health and personal social services. </P>
        <P>In recognition that a much wider range of policies, programmes and services impact directly on the lives of older people, development of the Strategy is being assisted by a Cross-Departmental Group (CDG), comprised of officials from 11 Government Departments, the Central Statistics Office and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and is chaired by the Director of the Office for Older People.  An NGO Liaison Group comprising representatives of twelve national-level non-governmental organisations with an interest in older people&rsquo;s issues is also assisting in the development of the Strategy.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the Strategy will set out a common framework for the development of operational plans by Government Departments.  These operational plans will clearly set out each Department&rsquo;s objectives relating to older people. Mechanisms designed to monitor the <Col N="463"/>implementation of measures contained in these operational plans will also be developed in consultation with Departments.</P>
        <P>The Strategy will require a consideration of the inter-related nature of many of the actions needed to enable older people to age positively in Ireland.  This means that no single Department or agency can be expected to deliver the Strategy alone.  In addition, in the short term, when implementation will require a reconfiguration of existing programmes and services, collaboration between Departments will be important.</P>
        <P>Work on developing the Strategy is on-going and taking place within the constraints posed by the present fiscal situation.  This work will not be concluded before the end of the year.  It is not the intention that it will propose new service developments, rather it will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 825 and 828 together.</P>
        <P>I have stated on a number of occasions that the waiting times for admission for patients attending Emergency Departments in many hospitals are not acceptable.  I am determined to address this situation. In this regard the Deputies will be aware that recently I established the Special Delivery Unit and assigned to it as a priority the task of addressing the many issues arising in Hospital Emergency Departments.</P>
        <P>The difficulties in Emergency Departments cannot be solely resolved within the Emergency Departments themselves. Instead they must be addressed on the basis of a health-system wide approach.  In particular, overcrowding in Emergency Departments has many causes and any solution to the problems that may arise from this issue must reflect this reality.  Any solution must start with ensuring that patients are treated in the most appropriate way in the most appropriate location.  This means that where and whenever possible, patients who can be treated in the primary care setting receive their treatment there.</P><Col N="464"/>
        <P>The issue of staffing levels in Emergency Departments, as in the other areas of hospitals, is a matter for the management of the hospitals and the HSE in the first instance.  My officials are in contact with the HSE and relevant authorities to ensure that the necessary steps are being taken to ensure ongoing safe delivery of service in hospitals and, in particular, Emergency Departments.</P>
        <P>I am confident that with careful planning, with leadership from the Special Delivery Unit, the implementation of the HSE&rsquo;s Emergency Medicine Programme and related clinical programmes and with the roll-out of Acute Medicine Units we will be in a position to reassure patients that the difficulties in Emergency Departments will be addressed.</P>

	<P>In response the Minister asked for a full examination of the funding situation, to be conducted jointly by the Department of Health and the HSE. The examination identified a number of factors that are putting pressure on the overall budget for 2011. These included:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />an unexpected increase in the average length of stay for nursing home patients,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />a resultant higher net demand for nursing home places, and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />an increase in nursing home costs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The processing of approvals for financial support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme was suspended for a month from May to June while an examination of funding was being carried out.  However, the HSE has been issuing funding approvals again since the 13 June.  Almost 1,700 people have been allocated funding since that date.  The HSE is continuing to process applications within the funding limits available to the scheme and in accordance with the legislation.  The HSE intends to deal with those currently awaiting approval within the next 6 weeks.</P>
        <P>By the end of the year, the HSE intends that any delays in awarding funding will be eliminated.  The situation will be closely monitored to ensure that funding is allocated as soon as it becomes available.  It is anticipated that any delays will be resolved in the final quarter of 2011.</P>
        <P>With regard to the variation of payments to nursing homes in the same area, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has statutory responsibility for the negotiation of prices with <Col N="466"/>private and voluntary nursing homes.  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State.  The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.  This method of negotiation is necessary in order to ensure that the State obtains the best value for each individual in a nursing home and to comply with competition law.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 833 to 839, inclusive, and 842 to 845, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="467"/>
        <P>The efficiency of services in the Louth/Meath Hospital Group is being reviewed by the HSE in light of the current budgetary and financial position.  As part of this process, draft documentation has been prepared by the HSE but no definitive plans have been made regarding changes to services for patients.  The HSE has advised my Department that no decision has been taken to alter the hours of services in any of the Minor Injuries Units (MIU) in the Louth/Meath Hospital Group.  At present there is a 24 hour MIU service in operation at both Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda and in Navan Hospital and a full daytime service in Louth County Hospital.</P>
        <P>I would like to emphasise that changes driven by budgetary issues must be clearly distinguished from change driven by pure safety concerns.  In relation to the Emergency Department and outpatient clinics at Navan Hospital, I have emphasised that any changes need to be carried out in a planned way and that all changes will be fully communicated.  The HSE has indicated that no change to either service has been made at present.</P>
        <P>Similarly in relation to Louth County Hospital, there are no plans for changes to the number of beds.  The HSE has clarified that the stroke rehabilitation beds at the hospital which are due to come on stream following completion of the current refurbishment of wards are part of the complement since July 2010 and do not represent additional beds.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be  aware I commissioned an independent Review around a number of issues relating to the location of the new hospital on the Mater Campus. The Review was carried out under the joint auspices of the National Association of Children&rsquo;s Hospitals and Related Institutions (NACHRI) and the European Health Property Network (EUPHN). NACHRI is a not-for-profit organisation of children&rsquo;s hospitals with over 200 members worldwide, which promotes the health and well-being of children and their families through support of children&rsquo;s hospitals and health systems. EUPHN is an independent organisation with international expertise in the area of capital planning of health facilities, including major hospitals. I announced the outcome of the Review on the 6th   of July 2011.  The independent experts who formed the Review Team, having examined all the issues in accordance with the Terms of Reference set by myself, came to the unanimous and unequivocal recommendation that the development of the new hospital should proceed on the Mater Campus.</P>
        <P>I confirmed the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of the recommendation of the Review Team and has now requested the National Paediatric Development Board to proceed with a planning application to an Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, was introduced in October 2009 in order to address the fundamental inequity in the treatment of public and private long-term nursing home residents and to alleviate the financial hardship being experienced by long-term residents in private nursing homes.</P>
        <P>However, the new scheme supports the individuals in need of long-term nursing home care, not the facilities providing the care. This means that money follows the patients, regardless of whether they choose public, private or voluntary nursing homes. It ensures that these facilities are not being funded for empty beds.  In order to qualify for the scheme, all private nursing homes and voluntary nursing homes previously funded under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, including Valentia Hospital, must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This is a necessary feature of the scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person&rsquo;s contribution.</P>
        <P>The Scheme only applies to long-term nursing home care. The hospital can continue to have separate agreements with the HSE for the provision of other services, e.g. day care, respite and convalescence. I understand that there have been ongoing discussions between the Board of Management of the hospital and the HSE with regards to future service provision.  Indeed my colleague the Minister for Health met a delegation from Valentia Hospital in early June to discuss the issues raised by the Deputy.</P><Col N="471"/>
        <P Just="Left">This Government is committed to ensuring the health and safety of residents in nursing homes, whether they are private, voluntary or public.  In order to ensure this it is vital that we have effective mechanisms in place to maintain and enhance public confidence in the delivery of quality services.   The Health Act, 2007 provides a regime designed to protect residents through an independent inspection and registration system.  On 1 July 2009 Statutory responsibility was given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to carry out this function.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive regulatory framework and National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.  All nursing homes are subject to the same core standards and regulations in relation to quality and safety in order to ensure the well-being of their residents. In this context the Minister cannot accede to the Deputy&rsquo;s request.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 865, 893 and 896 together. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme.  However, the terms of the scheme will be reviewed in the context of the Government&rsquo;s proposals for Universal Health Insurance and free GP care at the point of delivery.</P>
        <P>Under the Drug Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than &euro;120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
        <P>In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</P>

	<P>I would like to clarify for the Deputy that, should a future prohibition be introduced, it will not look to restrict the rights of adults to decide what is best for them. Rather, any such prohibition would look to protect the rights of children; that is, persons under the age of majority to whom the State has a particular duty of care and who are otherwise reliant on parents and carers to avoid smoking in order to protect them from environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in the enclosed space of a car.</P>

	<P>While I recognise that the public health service, as with all health systems, requires managers and administrators to run effectively, nonetheless, I am of the view that there is scope for a reduction in the number of management/administrative staff in the health sector. This is necessary to ensure that we have streamlined and effective structures and also to enable staffing resources to be focused to the maximum extent on front-line patient care. The Government is committed in line with the Programme for Government to reducing numbers in the Civil/Public Service in the period to 2015, while protecting front-line services as far as possible.  A comprehensive review of expenditure is underway to examine all areas where savings and numbers reductions might be identified.  The results of this review are expected in the Autumn when the Government will consider its recommendations.  There are, however, no plans at this time to introduce a voluntary redundancy/early retirement scheme in the Civil/Public Service. </P>

	<P>The development of Primary Care Teams (PCTs) and Primary Care Centres (PCCs) is a priority under the Programme for Government.  The aim is to provide up to 95% of health and social care in local communities.  This will be achieved by increasing activity in the primary care setting and redirecting services away from acute hospitals to the community. </P>
        <P>The HSE has identified a need for 518 Primary Care Teams and 384 of them have commenced operation with varying degrees of activity.  40 of these Teams are located in newly acquired Primary Care Centres and 344 Teams are based in existing HSE accommodation.  The remaining 134 Teams are at varying stages of development.</P>
        <P>It is the HSE&rsquo;s plan that the majority of PCCs will be provided by the private sector through leasing agreements.  In this context, the HSE has developed a generic design model for PCCs with accommodation for up to three Teams per centre.  17 PCCs have opened to date under leasing arrangements and a further 21 are due to open by the end of March 2012.</P>
        <P>Primary Care Centres in disadvantaged urban and rural areas will continue to be funded from the Exchequer. 15 of these are currently accommodating PCTs.</P>
        <P>There are currently 4 Exchequer funded centres in development and it is expected that these will become operational by the end of 2012.  These are located in Inchicore, Ballyfermot and Rathfarnham in Dublin and Glenties in Co. Donegal.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Irish Health System provides for two categories of eligibility for all persons ordinarily resident in the country, i.e. full eligibility and limited eligibility.  Full eligibility is determined mainly by reference to income limits and is granted to persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  Persons with full eligibility are awarded a medical card.  Determination of an individual&rsquo;s eligibility status is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Persons with full and limited eligibility are eligible for in-patient and outpatient public hospital services including consultant services, subject to certain charges for non-medical card holders. With respect to outpatient services, there is currently a charge of &euro;100 for attendance at an Accident and Emergency Department, subject to defined exemptions including medical card holders and persons who have a letter of referral from a G.P. and persons whose attendance results in an admission as an in-patient.</P>
        <P>The nature of emergency services means that it would be inappropriate that either a patient&rsquo;s ability to pay or their insurance status might be a factor in their getting preferential treatment in an A&amp;E Department.  All patients who present to A&amp;E Departments in public hospitals, are by default, public patients.</P>

	<P>Garda vetting is a pre-employment check carried out if any prospective employee, volunteer or student on placement will have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults.   It provides for the disclosure by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) to the prospective employer of details available to the Garda of prosecutions and convictions of the candidate.  It is a matter for the employer to assess the implications of the information before a decision is taken on the candidate&rsquo;s suitability to take up duty.</P>
        <P>In the case of the Health Service Executive, its recruitment policy provides that all new employees, at any grade, and not just those dealing with vulnerable clients, are subject to Garda Vetting.  Candidates who have resided outside of Ireland, for a period of six months or more, must provide a Police Clearance Certificate from each country  in which they have resided, dated after departure from that country, stating that no convictions have been recorded against them.  This is in addition to the Garda Vetting process.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Health Service Executive seek to maximise the recovery of income in a socially responsible and cost effective way. Initial follow up on outstanding charges is carried out by each hospital and includes the use of reminder letters. Collection agencies are used when the normal collection process has been exhausted. The HSE employs the services of debt collection agencies in twenty three of its statutory acute hospitals. Of these hospitals, sixteen notify the relevant debt collection agency on a real time/daily basis. Four hospitals notify on a weekly basis and the remaining three hospitals notify the debt collection agency on a greater than weekly basis. The HSE will direct all acute hospitals to update collection agents on a real time/daily basis.</P>

	<P>I established a Special Action Group on Obesity to identify a number of specific issues which could be progressed to help make an impact on our obesity levels.  Calorie posting on restaurant menus was one of the issues identified and my Department met with representatives from the food and drinks industry  in this regard.  I now intend writing to Irish fast food outlets, with parent companies involved in the calorie posting programme in the US, requesting that they participate in a similar scheme here.  At the same time my Department is examining the feasibility of extending the initiative to other restaurants.</P>

	<P>There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme.  However, the terms of the scheme will be reviewed in the context of the Government&rsquo;s proposals for Universal Health Insurance and free GP care at the point of delivery.</P><Col N="481"/>
        <P>Under the Drug Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than &euro;120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
        <P>In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</P>

	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern about the wastage of expensive medicines. For most medicines pharmacists are able to dispense the exact amount required for a month&rsquo;s supply even where products are supplied in packs greater than a month. For a small number of medicines, however, storage conditions are such that dispensing in the original pack is essential.</P>
        <P>However, if it is the case that a medicine has been over-prescribed then the patient should make this known to their GP to assist in ensuring that the medication is prescribed in the appropriate amounts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE held a centralised recruitment competition for Staff Grade Physiotherapists in 2008.  Since then 237 permanent posts have been filled from this panel and a further 110 temporary appointments made.  These appointments were to fill many of the service developments for both Primary Care Teams and Disability services, together with replacements for existing physiotherapists who were promoted or were on maternity leave.  This panel is still live with a potential 246 candidates remaining.  As this panel dates from 2008 it does not contain any recent graduates.  However, I have asked the HSE to carry out a validation of the panel to determine how many of those on it are still available for employment.</P>
        <P>The Employment Control Framework 2011-2014 gives effect to Government priorities on employment policy in the public sector and provides that there will be a net reduction in employment to 2014.  However, the Framework allows for some growth in certain grades which are exempt from the moratorium on recruitment including Physiotherapists in order to deliver on key priority services.</P>
        <P>You may also wish to note that I have asked the HSE to develop proposals in relation to providing internship opportunities for qualified physiotherapists under the new JobBridge Scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s policy for the planning and delivery of services to people with disabilities is that they should be given the opportunity to live as full a life as possible and to live with their families, and as part of their communities, for as long as possible.  The position in relation to the transfer of people with an intellectual disability currently residing in psychiatric hospitals will be addressed through the HSE&rsquo;s Corporate Plan 2011-2014 which is currently being drafted.  Closure plans which are currently being developed for large psychiatric hospitals (where there are approximately 277 people with intellectual disability according to the NIDD report of 2009) will include arrangements for the transfer of those individuals to appropriate community residential facilities. An example of these arrangements currently being progressed is St Ita&rsquo;s in Portrane for the transfer of clients from the psychiatric hospital to appropriate community facilities in Knockamann. </P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the publication of A Vision for Change, a Working Group was established by the HSE to consider Mental Health Service Delivery Models and Inpatient Capacity for Persons with Intellectual Disability and Mental Health Problems. This Working Group completed its Report in September 2006.</P>
        <P>The strategy outlined in the report was developed in collaboration with specialist healthcare professionals as well as voluntary and independent service providers in the sector.  The objective was and still is to more appropriately cater for the specific needs of individuals with a dual diagnosis of intellectual disability who also require acute psychiatric care.  The strategy involves the provision of regionally based facilities to provide a flexible and effective continuum of care based on need.  These include acute, assessment and rehabilitation beds and services, day hospital and respite places.</P>
        <P>There is also a significant review on-going at present in relation to the provision of disability services generally which is expected to be concluded by the end of this year and that may provide further input to the way in which the dual diagnosis programme is developed.</P>
        <P>Proposals for taking this work forward are currently under discussion between my Department and the relevant Assistant National Directors with responsibility for mental health and disability services in the HSE.</P>

	<P>The amount spent by my Department using credit cards held by Departmental staff over the past four years is &euro;45,382.  There are two corporate credit cards for official business purposes currently in use in my Department.  A Bank of Ireland Visa credit card is issued to my Private Secretary and a second card is issued to a nominated officer in my Department&rsquo;s Finance Unit.  This card is used to cover a range of costs such as publications, seminar and conference fees, annual membership fees, transport costs and software purchases where payment by credit card is required.  The credit limit on both cards is &euro;15,000.  The amount spent by my Department on state and official entertainment using the credit cards over the past four years totals &euro;4,882.  In addition, a credit card was also issued to the Registrar of the Adoption Board and, up to the establishment of the Adoption Authority of Ireland on 1 November 2010, this card&rsquo;s payments were met by my Department. <Col N="486"/> The total amount spent on the Adoption Board&rsquo;s credit card over the past four years totals &euro;15,451 with &euro;9,469 of this spent on state and official entertainment.</P>

	<P>The introduction of a sugar tax is one of  a number of issues which is being considered by the Special Action Group on Obesity.  I established this Group earlier in the year to identify a number of issues to help address our obesity problem.  The Deputy will be aware that obesity is a factor in our growing rates of Type II Diabetes. </P>

        <Quest> the cost, to date, of the provision of accommodation, board and so on for Indian and Pakistani NCHDs to be recruited through the temporary registration process; if he will provide a breakdown of the figures involved; the number of such NCHDs recruited to date; the number issued with temporary registration; and the number awaiting approval of such registration; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The costs incurred by the HSE up to 9 September 2011 in respect of accommodation and food provided in Dublin for NCHDs recently recruited from India and Pakistan is &euro;80,709.  Details of the costs incurred in other regions are being collated by the HSE and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as they are available.  The recruitment of these additional doctors will facilitate the generation of significant pay savings through reduction of NCHD overtime and spending on agency NCHD staff.</P>
        <P>In July 2011, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 was amended to allow for the creation of a new &lsquo;Supervised Division&rsquo; on the Medical Register.  Registration in the Supervised Division means that a person is registered for a period not exceeding two years in an identified post approved by the Medical Council and subject to supervision by the employer in line with criteria set down by the Medical Council. Medical Council systems are in place to ensure that patients will be treated by a doctor who has the education, training and skills to provide safe and appropriate care. In the interests of patient safety, doctors can therefore only be registered in the Supervised Division once they have met all of the registration requirements. The Medical Council and the HSE are working to ensure that the necessary procedures to facilitate the registration of doctors are completed as quickly as possible, so that they can take up duty.    There are a number of elements to the processing of these applications.</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) The paper based application by the candidate submitting all relevant documentation on qualifications, home state clearance etc;</P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) The passing of the (practical) examination stage; and</P>
        <P LI="2">(iii) The approval of the posts by the HSE including a declaration from the hospitals regarding the appropriate supervision of the applicants.</P>
        <P FLI="0">All three stages of the registration process have been run concurrently to expedite the registration of doctors identified as part of the HSE&rsquo;s recruitment drive in India and Pakistan. <Col N="487"/> Approximately 70 candidates who have passed the practical examination have not yet provided the Medical Council with satisfactory evidence of their qualifications.  Valid declarations from hospitals are a requirement for registration and detail the supervisory arrangements that are in place to protect patients and I understand that there are some 65 declarations outstanding at present.</P>
        <P>Out of a total of 266 doctors, 236 passed specialty-specific examinations set by the Medical Council in August 2011.  Approximately 120 of these have met the requirements for registration to the Supervised Division of the Register of Medical Practitioners and have been registered. This figure is subject to change on a daily basis as further applications are processed that have satisfied all the above requirements.</P>
        <P>The HSE and the Medical Council are working actively to expedite submission of the necessary documentation so that the remaining doctors can be registered as soon as possible.</P>

        <Quest> the professions which have completed registration to the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and qualify to use the title of a designated health and social care profession and when the determination of complaints relating to their fitness to practice has been completed under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Health and Social Care Professionals Council (HSCPC) was established in March 2007, under the provisions of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  The Act provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for twelve health and social care professionals as follows; clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psy<Col N="491"/>chologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  Registration will apply to the twelve professions regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector or are self-employed and is the first time that fitness to practice procedures will be put in place for these professionals on a statutory basis.</P>
        <P>The main focus of the council to-date has been the setting up of organisational structures, the progression of corporate and general processes and the identification of robust financial/HR and governance systems.  The Council has undertaken considerable preparatory work to provide for the establishment of the registration boards and is developing governance arrangements, financial management systems, fitness to practice procedures and ICT systems.  A Code of Corporate Governance, a Strategic Statement/Business Plan 2010-2012 and a Communication Strategy 2010-2013 have also been drawn up. In addition, the National Social Work Qualifications Board (NSWQB) was dissolved  and its staff, property and liabilities transferred to the HSCPC on the 31st March 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first registration board to be established under the Council, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, and the associated Social Workers Register opened for receipt/processing of registrants on Tuesday 31 May, 2011.  With the opening of this register, this is the first step in the regulation of social workers as a profession and the Social Workers Registration Board will be considering applications for registration from an estimated 2,500 registrants of the profession.  As part of this process, a new statutory Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Social Workers has been adopted to underpin the regulation of the profession.  The Code specifies the standards of ethics, performance and conduct required of registered social workers in a clear and accessible manner. The new system of regulation will give the public confidence that they are dealing with a fully qualified and regulated professional whenever they encounter a social worker.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the provisions of the 2005 Act, there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which social workers currently employed may apply for registration.  From May 2013, every social worker wishing to use the title will be required to be registered. The name of every registered social worker will be published in the register, which will be accessible online.  Only social workers who have satisfied the board that they hold an approved qualification and are &ldquo;fit and proper&rdquo; to engage in the practise of the profession will be entered on the register.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 6 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 refers to issues concerning complaints and disciplinary sanctions in relation to registrants. The related fitness to practice regime, to be introduced within the next two years, will allow concerned members of the public to make a complaint about a registered social worker.  If upheld, disciplinary sanctions can be imposed, including preventing that person from practising as a social worker. The implementation and operation of a robust fitness to practice process will underpin and ensure adequate patient safety provisions.</P>
        <P>The considerable preparatory work undertaken by the HSCPC to-date, and the structures implemented to facilitate the opening of the first registration board and register, will greatly assist the HSCPC in making further progress.  It is envisaged that at least five additional registration boards will be established before end-2012, with subsequent registration boards to be established as soon as possible after that.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Department of Public Expenditure Circulars 2/09 and 2/11 relating to the arrangements for ICT expenditure in the Civil and Public Service outline a range of initiatives designed to reduce risk and achieve better value for money. These circulars require all Departments and Offices including my Department and its agencies that spend monies from Voted Funds on ICT expenditure to comply with Department of Public Expenditure circulars, advisories and best practice guidance relating to ICT expenditure and to submit a breakdown of all ICT budgeted expenditure planned to that Department and my own Department for approval prior to any funds being expended. In addition to the Department of Public Expenditure guidance, the Department of Health&rsquo;s procurement policy provides detailed guidelines and procedures for staff to follow when carrying out procurement functions in compliance with national and EU rules. In pursuing efficiency and value for money my Department and the HSE uses, where ever possible, national framework contracts organised by the Department of Public Expenditure and CMOD for ICT related equipment. Other measures in relation to the value for money involve engaging in regular procurement exercises and also on-going evaluation of expenditure in this area.  The ICT Unit within my Department provides ICT shared services to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Office of the Disability Appeals Officer and the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office as a significant contribution to efficiency and value for money in this area. My Department is currently meeting with the small and medium sized health agencies in relation to shared services including the provision of ICT related services.</P>

	<P>Under current eligibility arrangements the decision to see a medical consultant as a private patient results in a private contract between the consultant and the patient.  The patient then remains private for the duration of their episode of care.  </P>
        <P>The Medical Council&rsquo;s Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners states that the fees charged by them should be appropriate to the service provided and that patients should be informed of the likely costs before the consultation and treatment.</P>
        <P>It is my belief that the fees charged by the majority of consultants at present are too high and while I, as Minister for Health, have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect clinicians to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.</P>
        <P>The Government is embarking on a major reform programme for the health system.  The aim of this reform is to deliver a single-tier health service that will deliver equal access to care based on need, not income.</P>

        <P>I am aware that claims have been made in respect of the possible health benefits of cannabis-based medicinal products such as Sativex for patients suffering from certain conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis. I am also aware that cannabis-based medicinal products may be legally prescribed in other countries. However, as the law currently stands, it is not possible for cannabis-based medicinal products to be prescribed by a medical practitioner in Ireland. However, my Department is examining the issues associated with applying controls, similar to those that apply to other controlled drugs that can be misused, such as morphine and methadone, to cannabis-based medicinal products to permit them to be prescribed and dispensed in Ireland.</P>

	<P>The Health (Amendment) Act 2005 and the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005, as subsequently amended, provide the legislative basis for charges, and related exemptions, for in-patient services where such services are provided for in excess of 30 days over a 12 month period.  The legislation provides for two different classes of person for the purpose of levying a charge. Class 1 refers to persons in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. Class 2 refers to persons in receipt of in-patient services where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. The current schedule of charges is set out by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 2011. Under the legislation, the Health Service Executive may waive or reduce the charges to avoid undue financial hardship.</P>

	<P>Government policy is to support older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible and, where this is not an option for whatever reason, to support access to high quality long term residential care.  Such community based supports, including Home Care Packages, are not a statutory entitlement and are subject to resource limitations. In some cases, where services are approved and funded by the HSE, these may be undertaken by the Executive through a partnership arrangement with non-statutory providers to maximise service delivery.</P>
        <P>In addition to supporting older people and their families, Home Care Packages are directed at the most vulnerable older people to help relieve pressures on the Acute Hospitals, and Long Term Residential Care systems.  Arising from an Evaluation of Home Care Packages published in December 2009, the Department of Health accepted the need for a more standardised approach to the provision of  HSE home care services generally. Therefore the HSE, in conjunction with the  Department, progressed during 2010 and 2011 various improvements to the planning and delivery of home care provision, including Access and Needs Assessment for Home Care Packages. The HSE Service Plan for this year commits the Executive to developing its model of care to maximise community services to vulnerable older people. The provisions include:-</P>

        <P>It is not the intention that it will propose new service developments; rather it will set the direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.

The Government is embarking on a major reform programme for the health system.

        <P>While universal health insurance is the ultimate destination of this Government&rsquo;s reform programme, there are a number of important stepping stones along the way and each of these will play a critical role in improving our health service in advance of the introduction of universal health insurance.</P>
        <P>Key reform initiatives include the establishment of the Special Delivery Unit, significant strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients, the introduction of a more transparent and efficient &ldquo;Money Follows the Patient&rdquo; funding mechanism for hospitals and the introduction of a purchaser / provider split, whereby hospitals will be established as independent, not for profit trusts.  The Government has recently given approval for an Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance, details of which are currently being finalised and will be announced in due course.  This Group will have responsibility for assisting the Department in preparing a <i>White Paper on Financing Universal Health Insurance </i>which will outline the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance. The <i>White Paper on Financing Universal Health Insurance </i>will be published within the Government&rsquo;s current term in office.  However, it must be emphasised that the precise cost of universal health insurance will significantly depend on the success of various reform measures, such as those outlined above, over the next 3-4 years.  This will influence the development of the <i>White Paper</i>   and, as such, it is not possible to be more specific regarding its publication at this stage.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed in line with the Programme for Government to reducing numbers in the Civil/Public Service in the period to 2015, while protecting front-line services as far as possible.  A comprehensive review of expenditure is underway to examine all areas where savings and numbers reductions might be identified.  The results of this review are expected in the Autumn when the Government will consider its recommendations.  There are, however, no plans at this time to introduce a voluntary redundancy/early retirement scheme in the Civil/Public Service.</P>

	<P>The HSE plan implementing the changes to the Emergency Department at Roscommon County Hospital came into effect on 11 July. This saw the establishment of an Urgent Care Centre in place of the Emergency Department. People with acute or life threatening conditions such as heart attacks are being brought by ambulance to larger hospitals, such as Galway, with higher volumes of patients and better outcomes for such conditions.</P>
        <P>The Urgent Care Centre operates from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week and the service is provided by non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs), with clinical governance provided by an emergency medicine consultant at Galway. As part of the transitional arrangements, an NCHD was also available at the Urgent Care Centre from 8pm to 8am for a four week period, supervised by an on call consultant.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An enhanced ambulance service has been put in place. During the day, four ambulances staffed by paramedics are available, while three are available at night. In addition, there is a special Rapid Response Vehicle, staffed by advanced paramedics on a twenty four hour, seven day basis. An out of hours GP service is also in operation. A Medical Assessment Unit is open from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.  This is a medical admission pathway and accepts referrals from a range of sources, including general practitioners.  I was briefed on the plan by the HSE in advance of its implementation. The plan was necessitated by the serious patient safety concerns of the HSE and of the Health Information and Quality Authority in relation to the emergency service at Roscommon, following the publication of the Authority&rsquo;s  Report on Mallow. This was compounded because of NCHD recruitment difficulties.</P>
        <P>Roscommon Hospital has a clear future and will continue to provide key services to the people of the area. I believe that smaller hospitals can and should provide as wide as possible a range of services, close to the local community. The key concern is that they are safe.</P>
        <P>Too often we have focused on what we are taking away rather than what we can add to services in smaller hospitals. I intend to prepare a framework for the development of smaller hospitals, which will set out how they will develop to reach their full true potential.  This will specify what services are transferring to them from the larger hospitals.</P>
        <P>All of this will be done with full regard to the safety issues highlighted by HIQA, in its reports on Ennis and Mallow Hospitals.  When it is implemented, smaller hospitals will have vibrant roles, doing more work &mdash; not less &mdash; and meeting as many as possible of the needs of their local communities.</P>

	<P>The report of the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) was published in June of this year. The SCHER report has not made any findings of negative health or environmental effects concerning fluoridation of water.</P>
        <P>SCHER concluded that water fluoridation is effective in reducing levels of dental decay. Its opinion that the topical delivery of fluoride is more efficient than water fluoridation is not accepted by the European Association of Dental Public Health or by the Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.</P>
        <P>The SCHER Report also states that a narrow margin exists in children between achieving the beneficial effects of fluoride in reducing dental decay and the potential adverse effect of dental fluorosis. It is true regardless of the source of fluoride, whether from water fluoridation or other sources, such as ingested toothpaste. It should be noted that dental fluorosis is a cosmetic or aesthetic condition which refers to the way teeth look and is generally easy to treat. This is in contrast to the treatment of tooth decay which may on occasion involve the use of general anaesthesia and hospitalisation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups. There are no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, on which HSE spent approximately &euro;4.78 million in 2010, and which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.</P>

	<P>The regulation of cosmetic surgeons  is  provided for under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.   Under that Act, medical practitioners,  including cosmetic surgeons, who practise medicine in Ireland must be  registered with the Medical Council, which has responsibility  for the registration of medical practitioners and the regulation of their activities.    In addition, my Department is developing legislative proposals to  amend  the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to make it mandatory for all medical practitioners engaged in clinical practice to have clinical indemnity cover in place.  The new  provisions will enable the Medical Council  to refuse to grant registration to a medical practitioner who fails to provide certification that he or she has appropriate medical indemnity cover.    In a separate initiative, my Department is developing legislative proposals for the licensing of public and private health care providers and licensing of cosmetic surgery is being considered in this context.   </P>
        <P>I would also stress that people who avail of the services of doctors performing cosmetic surgery should ideally discuss this decision in advance with their general practitioners and should endeavour to seek the services of reputable providers.  When invasive procedures are being arranged, people would be strongly advised  to check that the services are provided by a medical practitioner who is appropriately registered with the Medical Council.   Before agreeing to undergo any procedure, people should also ascertain the level of follow-up medical support which will be available to them after surgery.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The European Commission recently affirmed that EU Directive 2004/33/EC on certain technical requirements for blood and blood components states that blood establishments in Member States should defer as donors <i>http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/dalli/index_en.htm</i> &ldquo;persons whose sexual behav<Col N="511"/>iour puts them at high risk of acquiring severe infectious diseases that can be transmitted by blood.&rdquo; The Commission also noted that &ldquo;&lsquo;sexual behaviour&rsquo; is not identical with &lsquo;sexual orientation&rsquo;&rdquo;.  It also noted that Member states are obliged to implement EU Directives in full respect of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and notably of its Article 21 which prohibits discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, to assure the continued safety of the blood supply, the IBTS currently asks those people who may have a particularly high risk of carrying blood-borne viruses not to give blood.  This includes men who have ever had sex with another man / men (MSM). The reason for this exclusion rests on specific sexual behaviour (such as anal and oral sex). There is no exclusion of gay men who have never had sex with a man nor of women who have sex with women.  The decision is not based on sexuality or orientation, but on specific actions.</P>
        <P>The IBTS has a responsibility to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of safe blood to meet the needs of patients. In order to supply blood for transfusion all decisions on donation criteria are based on a review of the evidence bearing in mind the desire of individuals to donate, the safety of the recipient, and the tolerance of society in general of any transfusion related infection occurring.  For Ireland, the view of IBTS is that taking all of these aspects into account, a permanent deferral for men with a history of MSM behaviour should remain in place.  This and donor deferral policy in general will be kept under constant review.</P>
        <P>The exclusion of men who have/or had sex with other men (MSM) from donation is based not only on risk factors for HIV but on other blood borne agents known to be associated with MSM behaviour.</P>
        <P Just="Left">MSM continues to be over-represented in donors who test positive for blood borne infections.  Irish HIV statistics compiled by the National Disease Surveillance Centre show that the number of new cases of HIV in the MSM category comprised roughly 30% of new cases in 2009/2010 (138 out of a total of 395 cases and 134 out of a total of 331 cases in each year respectively). While there  has been a reduction in the number of new cases of HIV, there is a continued  rise in the number of new HIV cases among MSM, who are now the majority of new  cases of HIV infection in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 993 to 1000, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>My recent visit to China was to identify and evaluate Chinese interest in investing in healthcare in Ireland and to explore opportunities for Irish health education facilities. The trip also allowed for opportunities to promote the potential for Irish pharmaceutical companies operating in China.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy appreciates, China represents enormous untapped potential on a range of levels. In particular it seeks investment opportunities and as Minister for Health I was keen to ascertain whether such funding could have value in the Irish healthcare system in areas such as Primary Care.</P>
        <P>The trip was arranged through the Department of Health and while in China I had the support of officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The original outline itinerary is included at the end of the reply. I also attended a number of other meetings in addition to those listed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the additional meetings involved Wison biotechnology and biopharma. The company is the lead producer of vaccines in China. This major company, which is certified by the World Health Organization, is expanding and has expressed an interest in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Arising from meetings with the Shanghai Health Bureau and the Zhejiang Health Bureau, an invitation has issued for interested Irish medical schools of general practice to visit both regions. China is developing its primary care services on a major scale. The Jiao Tiang Children&rsquo;s Hospital, which I visited on the 31st   of August is a 500 bed facility due to be expanded to one with 1,000 beds. The hospital carries out a very high number of cardiac operations &mdash; in 2010 over 3,000. I discussed a range of matters with senior figures in the hospital.</P>
        <P>I also met with representatives from the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to discuss opportunities for new and existing companies in China. The discussions also involved companies targeted by the state agencies for investment in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I had indicated my interest in going to China earlier this year to explore its potential for Irish healthcare. Such a trip does not require the approval of the Secretary General of my department but as I have already indicated the visit was organised through the Department of Health and also involved officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>I was accompanied by my Parliamentary Assistant Mr Tom O&rsquo;Leary and by my Private Secretary Mr Darragh Scully. (Mr O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s wife travelled with the party &mdash; meeting her own costs.)</P>
        <P>Neither the issue of the SARS epidemic nor the issue of health cover formed part of my discussions while in China.</P>
        <P>You will appreciate that the final costs of the trip cannot be fully identified until all invoices are received, including those from the Department of Foreign Affairs, and all Travel and Subsistence forms are certified and paid.  Costs identified to date are:</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
        <Quest> his estimate for the savings that will be made from measures to reduce the cost of medicines in our health system, including centralised wholesale distribution of drugs, using lower cost generic drugs and tackling over-prescription and wastage. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24043/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Health is not currently considering any proposals regarding the introduction of centralised wholesale distribution of drugs. There have been a range of measures introduced to reduce costs to the State associated with the distribution of drugs to community pharmacies by wholesalers. These include a reduction in the wholesale mark-up paid to community pharmacists from 17.66% to 8% for the majority of drugs reimbursed under the community drugs schemes. There has also been a reduction in the mark-up paid to wholesalers from 17.66% to 10% for the supply of drugs under the High-Tech scheme.  Savings under these measures are estimated at approximately &euro;100 million.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health is finalising the Heads of the Pricing and Supply of Medicines Bill. This legislation will introduce a system of reference pricing and generic substitution for prescribed drugs and medicines. A number of high volume medicines are expected to come off patent in the coming years and this legislation will increase the scope for savings through the greater use of generic medicines. It is expected that the legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in significant savings for taxpayers and patients.</P>
        <P>The HSE is working in partnership with key health professionals to develop pathways for quality prescribing, promoting an extended role of the use of clinical protocols for the delivery of evidence-based prescribing and developing the role of community pharmacists and the introduction of patient-held prescribing records. In addition, the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service has introduced an on-line facility for GPs to review and self-audit their individual prescribing practice in comparison with the national average, which has been standardised for the individual GP&rsquo;s patient profile.</P>
        <P>I intend to undertake a closer examination of prescribing patterns and I hope to finalise the details of this initiative shortly.</P>

	<P>It is not possible to calculate a precise figure in this regard, as the Deputy has not specified what salary scale or other contractual remuneration arrangements he has in mind.  Under the existing contracts, the total cost in 2010 of consultant <Col N="515"/>remuneration, including payment for additional attendance and allowances for extra responsibilities but excluding employers&rsquo; PRSI, was approximately &euro;470m.  If all consultants (who number approximately 2,500) were subject to an absolute cap on public earnings of &euro;150,000, the total cost would amount to approximately &euro;375m.</P>

	<P>There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme.  However, the terms of the scheme will be reviewed in the context of the Government&rsquo;s proposals for Universal Health Insurance and free GP care at the point of delivery.</P>
        <P>Under the Drug Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than &euro;120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
        <P>In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</P>

 </tgroup><P Just="Left">* The average number of bed days available by specialty for the reporting period. This should not include day beds and should also be reflective of any bed closures during the reporting period</P>
</table>
        <P FLI="0">The total number of acute hospital beds, excluding acute psychiatric beds, is approximately 13,000. This includes in excess of 11,000 inpatient beds at any one time, as well as 1,800 day beds. The exact number of beds available at any one time fluctuates, depending on planned activity levels, maintenance and refurbishment requirements and staff leave arrangements. Beds may also be closed from time to time in order to control expenditure, given the need for every hospital to operate within its allotted budget. The HSE compiles weekly data on acute bed closures. However, hospitals use different criteria for bed closures and the HSE recently decided to audit bed data collection and develop standard criteria.   The Executive is at present reviewing the existing methodology for measuring bed closures in acute hospitals in order to ensure that a consistent approach is applied across the public hospital system.</P><Col N="522"/>
        <P>The main issue concerns which beds can be reopened and which have been closed for an extended period and are realistically no longer available.</P>
        <P>The HSE continues to collect data on the existing basis, to monitor national and local trends. New standardised figures are expected to be available by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>It is important in any case to emphasise that hospital beds represent a service input and are not in themselves a measure of how the system is performing.  In recent years there has been a much-increased emphasis on improved efficiency in acute hospitals.  In particular, the focus has been on reducing inpatient care activity levels through the provision of more appropriate service responses, delivering a shift to care on a day case basis where appropriate, and on performance improvements such as surgery on the day of admission and reducing inappropriate lengths of stay.  Specific targets under these heading are included in the HSE&rsquo;s 2011 National Service Plan.</P>

	<P>After making further enquiries on the issues raised by the Deputy, my Department has received the following information from the HSE: </P>
        <P>Since its formation in January 2005 the following Mental Health assets have been sold by the Health Service Executive:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />30 Mount Pleasant Square, Dublin 3</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Adare House, 227 North Circular Road, Dublin 1</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Verville Retreat, Clontarf</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />49&amp;60 The Grey Square, Portrane</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Land at St. Loman&rsquo;s, Mullingar</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Land at St. Sennan&rsquo;s, Wexford</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Lands at Letterkenny</P>
        <P FLI="0">The total value of these sales amounts to &euro;12,155,532.</P>
        <P>The sale agreement for the lands at St Loman&rsquo;s is that payment will be made in 3 individual tranches of &euro;1.157m in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The 2010 payment has been received and is included in the above total.</P>
        <P>In 2009 the Department of Finance agreed that the proceeds of sales of all surplus assets may be reinvested in priority Mental Health projects. In 2009 &euro;25m of additional capital funding was allocated from the proceeds of the sale of assets from 2005 to 2009 previously returned to the exchequer. In the 2010 letter of sanction the HSE was permitted to reinvest the proceeds of the sale of all surplus assets (up to a ceiling of &euro;50m) in the Mental Health Investment Programme. Similarly in 2011 reinvestment up to a ceiling of &euro;15m is permitted.</P>

	<P>The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has statutory responsibility for the negotiation of prices with private and voluntary nursing homes for the purposes of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process. This method of negotiation is necessary in order to ensure that the State obtains the best value for each individual in a nursing home and to comply with competition law. </P>
        <P>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme provides financial support in respect of the cost of long-term residential care. The services which fall within the scope of long-term residential care are:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />bed and board,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living, and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />laundry service.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Incontinence wear is provided free of charge by the HSE to all Fair Deal residents within approved nursing homes.</P>
        <P>A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drugs Payment Scheme, is unaffected by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. In other words, a person can continue to receive goods and services in accordance with the terms of these other schemes regardless of whether they are in a private nursing home or elsewhere.</P>
        <P>A person who avails of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme should not be charged any additional fee over and above this agreed price, except where he or she chooses to obtain additional services over and above long-term residential care services, for example, hairdressing or the delivery of daily newspapers. Under the Health Act 2007 statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), for the independent inspection and registration of certain categories of designated centres.  This includes residential care settings for older people.  Since the 1st July 2009 all nursing homes (public, private and voluntary) are registered under the Health Act 2007 (Registration of Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, as amended, by the Chief Inspector. All nursing homes are inspected under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, as amended, and must meet the <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.</i>     Article 28 of the Regulations provides that the registered provider shall agree a contract with the resident within one month of admission and that the contact includes details of the services to be provided and the fees to be charged.</P>
        <P>The Chief Inspector has the power to refuse to register, attach conditions to a registration or cancel the registration of a designated centre in the event of non-compliance with the regulations or the standards.</P>

	<P>Under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000, the management of personal injury and property damage claims against the State and of the underlying risks was delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). When performing these functions, the NTMA is known as the State Claims Agency (SCA). The State Claims Agency therefore deals with actions taken against State agencies, including the HSE, in accordance with the system which has been established. While I appreciate the uncertainty for individuals and their families awaiting closure on their cases through the State Claims Agency, unfortunately the legal process takes time, and I have no role in this process.  However, my Department is currently reviewing its overall policy framework in regard to clinical indemnity and a literature review on international models has been commissioned in this regard. </P>

	<P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to recruit, manage and deploy its human resources, including medical consultants, to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department <Col N="526"/>has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

The review will enable the necessary further reforms of the sector to allow consumers to have confidence in the taxi system while also ensuring that legitimate and competent operators and drivers can be rewarded fairly by operating under a regulatory framework that is adequately enforced.</P>
        <P> The issues raised in the above questions are particularly relevant to specific work being undertaken to strengthen licensing systems and enforcement so that we have a licensing regime that can be readily enforced to protect the interest of consumers. Good progress is being made in exploring how current system weaknesses can be tackled as regards safeguarding the good repute and suitability, including tax compliance, of SPSV driver or vehicle licence holders. I am confident that the review will lead to a positive outcome in those key areas.    </P>

	<P>It is standard practice across the EU and internationally for driving licensing laws to provide for routine medical and eyesight reports for older drivers. The cut-off point in Ireland has been fixed at age 70 since these rules were first introduced in 1964. The reason why a medical practitioner rather than an optician is specified is that the level of testing envisaged is meant to pick up not only deterioration in visual acuity but also incipient age-related ocular disease. I appreciate that this involves a cost to individuals, but I believe it is necessary in terms of road safety, and also beneficial to the individuals undergoing these tests. I would also like to point out that a person over the age of 70 is not required to pay a fee to renew their licence. As the fee for a licence to drive a car is currently &euro;85, this represents a significant saving to the applicant. The level of medical costs is, of course, not a matter for my Department.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, under the Harbours Act 1996 once she was elected to the D&aacute;il she could no longer serve as a director of New Ross Port Company. </P>
        <P>In April this year, Kilkenny County Council sought to nominate another Councillor to fill the vacancy on the board. I responded to the Council in May explaining that, due to the changes introduced in the Harbours (Amendment) Act 2009, the Council no longer has the power to nominate directors to the board. These changes were made for a number of reasons, but primarily in order to eliminate any potential conflict of interest between the very different roles of a State company director and a local councillor, particularly when it comes to zoning and planning matters and the conflict that may arise when the interests of the port company are not aligned with the desires and wishes of the community who elected the councillors concerned. A board member&rsquo;s primary duty must always be to the company and to no other interest. This, of course, does not preclude me from appointing councillors where they have specific skills which are needed on the board, and I am satisfied that any appointee would be able to put the interests of the company ahead of any other concern. </P><Col N="531"/>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware from her time as a director of the company that New Ross Port has suffered declining traffic and turnover for a number of years. The Company has sought to address its difficulties through a number of measures. The board has played its part in reducing costs. A number of years ago the board proposed that the number of directors be reduced to six and it also voluntarily reduced the directors&rsquo; fees. The board currently has seven directors, which is considered adequate for the present.  Even at that, the board has more members than the company has employees. I also indicated that I have no immediate plans to fill the vacancy, but will keep the matter under consideration.</P>

	<P>The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport does not have a role in the provision of Sail Training. Prior to the sinking of the Asgard II this was a function carried out under the aegis of Coiste an Asgard and the Department of Defence.</P>
        <P>Given the current fiscal position where significant savings are being sought in both current and capital expenditure from my Department&rsquo;s allocations, there are no proposals to expand the Department&rsquo;s role into additional areas such as sail training given the significant additional costs that this would entail.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1050 and 1052 together.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, 58 projects have been or are being dealt with under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme. Of these, 46 have been completed and 4 have passed Tender Report stage, Loughrea, Co. Galway, New Ross, Co. Wexford, Ballybofey, Co. Donegal and Loughlinstown, Co. Dublin.  8 other projects are at various stages of the Programme. 4 projects are at contract documents stage, Buncrana, Co. Donegal,  Castlebar, Co. Mayo, Dunmanway, Co. Cork and Clara, Co. Offaly. 3 projects are at Preliminary Report stage, Edenderry, Co. Offaly, Ballaghaderreen, Co. Roscommon and Balbriggan, Co. Dublin.  1 project is at Tender Document stage, De Paul, Navan Road, Dublin.  </P>
        <P>The Department provides grant aid to local authorities towards the cost of building new pools or refurbishing existing ones. The success of the Programme therefore depends on local authorities&rsquo; ability to progress the projects through the various stages. The local authority is then also responsible for building the pool. The viability of the remaining 12 pools in the process  is therefore subject to constant review between the local authority and the Department. A measure of the viability of the remaining pools in the current programme can be seen from the fact that already this year the project at Clara has had its Preliminary Report approved,  De Paul has had Contract Documents approved and 2 projects (Ballybofey and Loughlinstown) have had Tender Reports approved and the maximum grant of &euro;3.8m allocated allowing construction to commence. </P>
        <P>It is not intended to add any further projects to the present 12 pools remaining under the current round of the Programme, and no decision has been made in regard to the timing of a new round of the Programme. No project is being delayed on the basis of the Department&rsquo;s ability to meet its commitments under the Programme and there is sufficient funding in the subhead to meet all commitments arising in 2012.   </P>
        <P>At Tender Report stage, the local authority&rsquo;s funding package for the project is examined in the Department to ensure that there is sufficient Local Authority matching funds, outside of the grant available from the Department to the Local Authority,  to complete the project. <Col N="533"/> Information is set out hereunder in tabular form on the estimated cost of developing the 4 projects out of the remaining 12 in the Programme that have reached Tender Report stage.  In the case of the other 8 projects, the information on estimated total cost and grantee matching funds will only become available to the Department when the Tender Report stage is reached.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Last April I introduced the Essential Driver Training (EDT) scheme, which is one component of the Graduated Driver Licensing Scheme (GDLS) developed by the Road Safety Authority (RSA) during 2010. EDT <Col N="535"/>means that learner drivers are for the first time required to take a comprehensive series of lessons with Approved Driving Instructors (ADIs) which will cover the entire range of skills necessary for driving. I believe this is a major step forward which will help to improve road safety for all, especially for younger drivers.</P>
        <P>As part of GDLS, the RSA aims to strengthen the role of the accompanying driver in the learning process. The practice which learner drivers do with a qualified driver &mdash; referred to as the sponsor &mdash; should be recorded in the log book issued as part of EDT. I am aware of the concerns of ADIs regarding this aspect of EDT. However, the role of the sponsor is not mandatory, beyond the pre-existing rule that learners must not drive unaccompanied. Lessons alone, without practice and experience, will not produce good drivers. Before EDT, learner drivers were not required to undertake any lessons and were gaining their skills by practising with an experienced accompanying driver. Now they will learn driving skills with a qualified ADI and practice them in the company of an experienced driver. The sponsor&rsquo;s role is simply putting on a regular footing something which was already happening, and should reinforce rather than undermine the mandatory lessons.</P>
        <P>EDT will be subject to re-evaluation after two years to see what improvements, if any, may be needed to the scheme, and ADIs&rsquo; contribution will of course be crucial to this process.</P>

        <Quest> if he will deal with a matter (details supplied) regarding the new Road Traffic Act, which will lower the current blood alcohol limit of 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood to 50 mg per 100 ml; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The new lower blood alcohol limits are contained in the Road Traffic Act 2010. The recommendations to lower the drink driving limits were informed by a number of issues including known driver behaviour, past offending rates, enforcement practicalities, best international practice and analysis of data held by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. </P>
        <P>Alcohol, even in small amounts, has well recognised effects on driver capacity.  These effects include psychomotor skills, cognitive functioning, choice and simple reaction times, visual function, vigilance, perception as well as a person&rsquo;s ability to divide attention and absorb information can all be affected by alcohol consumption. By reducing the limits, we will be helping to reduce driver error, the risk of involvement in collisions, deaths and serious injuries as well as the cost to the State.</P>

	<P>The Department operates a &ldquo;sunset clause&rdquo; which is notified to each grantee at the time the grant is provisionally allocated. This gives each grantee a period of time (typically fourteen to eighteen months) from the time the grant is allocated to complete a substantial amount of the work. The grantee is also notified at this time that the Department retains the right to withdraw the grant after this date, and without further notice, if the required conditions are not met by the grantee. A reminder letter also issues to the grantee after the &ldquo;sunset clause&rdquo; date is reached requesting a written update from the grantee on the status of the grant.</P>
        <P>The Department makes every effort to assist grantees to drawing down the grant, and grants are only withdrawn with the club&rsquo;s consent or when it is evident to the Department that there is no realistic prospect of the grant being drawn down within the foreseeable future.</P>

	<P>The budget approved by the Department of Finance for ICT expenditure in my Department for 2010 was &euro;17.4 million. The actual ICT expenditure for 2010 was &euro;10.3 million. The proposed ICT budget in my Department for 2011 is &euro;9.9 million.</P>
        <P>All purchases of ICT equipment, regardless of value, are subject to national guidelines and European procurement regulations. There is a continuous effort by my Department to identify and implement savings in the purchasing of ICT equipment. Where appropriate, this Department uses the ICT framework agreements developed by the Department of Finance for the procurement of common ICT equipment and systems. The pooling of ICT procurement will help ensure competitive responses from suppliers and achieve efficiencies.</P>
        <P>The State agencies under the remit of my Department have been forwarded a copy of your enquiry relating to their ICT budgets for 2010 and 2011. They have been requested to respond <Col N="539"/>to you directly. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme. The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. </P>
        <P>Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware, a comprehensive review of capital spending is now under way, the results of which will form the basis of a new National Development Plan. The review will also take account of new funding realities. A major priority will be to ensure funding to protect and maintain investment made to date and to maintain safety standards. No decision will be made on funding projects over the next year until the capital review is complete and my Department&rsquo;s budget is known.</P>
        <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that under the 4-Year National Recovery Plan approved by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government, there is no provision for the construction of any new national secondary roads projects in 2012, 2013 and 2014.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Matters relating to the re-opening, or alternatives uses for, unused rail lines are a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann in the first instance. There are currently no plans to re-open the Mullingar to Athlone rail line.</P>
        <P>The level of funding available for public transport investment from 2012 to 2016 will be dependent on the outcome of the review of capital expenditure which is being overseen by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and is currently underway. This review, which takes place against a background of new funding realities, is examining  capital programmes and projects taking account of their overall economic impact and job creation potential. A major consideration for transport investment over the next five years will be the need to prioritise funding to protect investment made to date and to maintain high safety standards. This of necessity will greatly limit any possibility of re-opening unused rail lines. Moreover, I will have to reduce operating subsidies paid to Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann considerably over the next two years which make it impossible to take on any new lines that will not make an operating profit.</P>

	<P>The standards to be met by those wishing to receive Certificates of Professional Competence (CPCs) are set out in the European Communities (Vehicle Driver Certificates of Competence) (No. 2) Regulations of 2008. These Regulations constitute the transposition into Irish law of EU requirements. The CPC regime is one of a range of measures which are aimed at ensuring higher standards of safety on our roads. The Regulations provide for compulsory periodic retraining. Under the Regulations, it is a matter for the Road Safety Authority (RSA) to determine the syllabus to be followed for each category of vehicle during this retraining. </P>
        <P>I have, therefore, referred the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding the requirements and standards of courses to the RSA for direct reply.

	<P>In 2010, my Department estimates that it spent approximately &euro;3 million in respect of a range of professional services including for example consultancy services, IT contracting, legal services and general premises maintenance etc. A 25% reduction in fees therefore might be expected to generate savings of the order of &euro;750,000.</P>
