        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  the current state of affairs at Allied Irish Banks; the implications of State ownership for members of the bank&rsquo;s board of directors; if he proposes to allow to continue in office those directors who remain in place since before the introduction of the original blanket bank guarantee in 2008; the position in relation to the proposed sell off of good assets by Allied Irish Banks to a new or expanded National Assets Management Agency vehicle, in view of comments recently attributed to the head of Financial Regulation, Mathew Elderfield; if he will estimate the likely capital requirements of AIB once the revised PCAR analysis has been carried out in early 2011; when he expects that these new capital requirements will have to be met; to the extent that the State will be meeting these capital requirements, the mechanism he intends to use to achieve this; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[1444/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The board strength of AIB prior to the introduction of the Government guarantee in September 2008 was 15.  Only three of those who were in place at that time still remain, all three having joined the board in 2007.  Prior to the recent State investment in the bank, the then managing director and executive chairman stepped down from their positions on the board in October and November 2010, respectively.  Since September 2008, there have been six new appointees to the board, including the now interim executive chairman in October 2010 and the deputy chairman.  One of the principal objectives of the new interim executive chairman will be to assist the group in its search for a long-term non-executive chairman and a group chief executive.</P>
        <P>I have indicated previously that a wholesale change of board personnel at all of the covered institutions was neither desirable nor practicable.  Our actions to date have been consistent with that policy of progressive replacements, which will continue.  I have encouraged AIB and the other institutions to make progressive changes both in terms of new appointees and retirements which have resulted in substantial changes in the composition of their boards.  In addition, the Central Bank issued new corporate governance rules for banks and insurers that are to apply with effect from 1 January 2011 and designed to ensure that proper oversight exists to avoid or minimise the risk of a future crisis.  Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 deals with the duties of directors of relevant institutions and requires them to take the public interest into account.</P>
        <P>In December 2010, AIB received a net capital injection of &euro;3.7 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, as part of its revised capital requirement of &euro;9.8 billion which must be raised by the end of February.  The remaining &euro;6.1 billion capital requirement is expected to be met through a combination of fresh capital from the State, the execution of a liability management exercise in respect of existing subordinated debtholders and other capital generative measures by the bank.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank is in the process of conducting a revised PCAR exercise regarding AIB.  At this stage, it is premature to speculate on the outcome of this analysis.  As to the extent to which the exercise identifies additional capital requirements for the bank, the most appropriate <Col N="3"/>method by which this capital will be provided will be decided at the time in consultation between my advisers, the Central Bank and board of directors of AIB.</P>
        <P>As part of the agreement with the EU, the IMF and the European Central Bank, the State has agreed to adopt deleveraging measures and implement restructuring of the banking sector.  To this end, target funding ratios for 2013 will be established for each of the banks, non-core assets will be identified and an adjustment path to these targets based on specified non-public annual benchmarks will be set.</P>
        <P>The 2011 PCAR is being conducted with the assistance of various external advisers, as announced on 6 January.  The metrics and various possible structures are being examined and will be included as part of the process scheduled for completion by 31 March.  It is expected that the capital requirements will be met shortly after completion of the exercise, but a definitive date has not been set.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the comments made by the Financial Regulator last week that restructuring of our banks could involve sales of good assets by the banks.  However, I must point out that the analysis of all the options that could be used in a restructuring exercise is still ongoing.  Proposals arising from such an analysis would of course need to be considered by the Government before they could be adopted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Before Christmas, he mentioned a figure of &euro;6.4 billion as regards extra money for AIB.  Others have suggested the figure will be almost &euro;10 billion.  Will he clarify what he now expects the figure to be?  What is the State&rsquo;s net loss to date on its so-called investments in AIB?  When the Minister introduced the bank guarantee, we were spun a story to the effect that such an investment in the banks would yield good returns.  In fact, it has undermined the State disastrously, as the guarantee linked the debt of this and other covered institutions with that of the State.  Does the Minister agree this is why the IMF came in to take over the country before Christmas?</P>
        <P>How much are the further injections into AIB?  Do they amount to &euro;6.4 billion, bringing the total to almost &euro;10 billion?  What does the Minister intend to do with the cash balances of the NTMA?  Will he take those balances and place them directly into the bank or will he use a mechanism for transferring support to the bank along the lines of promissory notes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the answer makes clear, in December AIB received a net capital injection of &euro;3.7 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund as part of its revised capital requirement of &euro;9.8 billion, which must be raised by the end of February 2011.  That is part of the revised capital requirement.  The &euro;3.7 billion was in any event a requirement since last March under the original requirement set by the regulator.  Under the higher capital ratio now set in the EU-IMF-ECB agreement, the revised figure is &euro;9.8 billion, of which &euro;3.7 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund is part.  The remaining &euro;6.1 billion capital requirement, the difference between &euro;3.7 billion and &euro;9.8 billion, which will be outstanding until February, is expected to be met through a combination of fresh capital from the State; the execution of liability management exercises for existing subordinated bond holders and other capital generative measures that bank has ongoing.</P>
        <P>I am trying to deal with all of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I want Deputy Burton to be able to ask a brief supplementary question, we are already over time on this question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>How much extra cash must the taxpayer put into this bank through the NTMA mechanism from its remaining cash balances?  What figure does the Minister expect?  He talks about an asset management exercise, which means the selling down of assets <Col N="4"/>through a credit enhancement process, where the State would guarantee maximum losses for the buyers of those assets.  Will the Minister specify how much he expects the asset management exercise to generate?  Could he specify what other asset sales will take place and outline how much the State has lost on the investment in AIB so far?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Credit enhancement measures are separate from meeting the capital requirement; they do not arise as part of the answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  They are separate initiatives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>They do arise because they have an effect upon who buys what assets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to disagree with the Minister because if he thinks that, he is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will endeavour to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question and she can issue any statement she likes afterwards but I am entitled to answer the questions she asked.  To date I have only been able to give partially complete answers because of a lack of time.</P>
        <P>The Deputy pertinently asked how much actual cash will be required for the proportion of the total capitalisation.  It is not possible to fix a precise cash figure because, as I indicated in my initial reply, it is proposed to conduct a liability management exercise with subordinated bondholders.  When those subordinated bondholders take whatever pain is inflicted upon them, it will have a material bearing on the amount of cash involved.  In addition, the amount of cash is further reduced by the fact that part of the capitalisation is being executed through the conversion of the existing preference shares to ordinary share status.  Clearly the investment in the existing preference shares has already been made and those shares will be converted to ordinary risk capital as part of this publicly owned institution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>So there are no figures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give Deputy Burton as many figures as possible at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will call Question No. 67 next and apologise for discommoding the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Question No. 67 can be grouped with the initial question tabled by Deputy Noonan, I think.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for the Minister to decide.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  the input he has had into the endeavour of the International Market Commissioner, Michael Barnier, to assess sentiment on a proposal that, in future, bond investors would share the burden of any bank collapse; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[1443/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the European Commission has the right of initiation for legislative proposals within the European Union legal framework. In that context, I welcome the Commission&rsquo;s consultation document, Technical Details of a Possible EU Frame<Col N="5"/>work for Bank Recovery and Resolution, published 6 January 2011, which includes an annex examining the issue of debt write-down as an additional resolution tool. The Commission is seeking stakeholders&rsquo; views on possible mechanisms to write down the debt of a failing bank or to convert it to equity, as a means of restoring the institution&rsquo;s capital position and suggests that this tool would be for cases where the standard resolution tools are not suitable options or other tools would not be sufficient to achieve the objectives of a resolution. My Department will be responding to these issues on my behalf as part of its overall response to the Commission&rsquo;s proposal.  It should be noted that this work is still at an early stage, as there is not a clear international consensus as to the specifics of how such bail-in tools would work in practice.</P>
        <P>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, issued for consultation on 19 August 2010, is a proposal to ensure that all regulatory capital instruments are able to absorb losses in the event that the issuing bank reaches the point of non-viability.  The consultation period is complete but the committee has not yet issued its assessment of the comments received.</P>
        <P>In terms of my input to the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, it is the case that the crisis management has been the subject of detailed discussion by European Finance Ministers over the past number of years.  I welcome the broad direction of the approach taken by the Commission and I have discussed the general direction of Commission policy on this matter with Commissioner Barnier.</P>
        <P>In June 2009, the Economics and Finance Council, ECOFIN, called on the Commission to bring forward appropriate proposals to develop a comprehensive cross-border framework to strengthen the EU financial crisis management systems.  Extensive discussions have taken place at ECOFIN of the Commission&rsquo;s work in this area including its communication and public consultation on an EU framework for cross-border crisis management in the banking sector which was published on 20 October 2009, its communication on bank resolution funds which was published on 25 May 2010 and its communication on a new EU framework for crisis management in the financial sector which was published on 20 October 2010.  As well as these discussions at ministerial level, my Department also participates in the Commission&rsquo;s expert group established to assist the Commission in its development of legislative proposals for a framework for EU crisis management.  I look forward to continuing my engagement with the Commission and other member states in the development of EU policy in this area.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by making two further points.  Future resolution mechanisms will only apply to a future insolvency or failing bank or distressed institution.  They will not have application to the problems we in Ireland have already had to face and any proposals by the Commission have to be judged in that context.</P>
        <P>Second, the general debate illustrates the fundamental truth of the proposition that if we are to make progress on this issue with regard to our current institutions &mdash; we endeavoured to make some progress during the recent EU-IMF discussions &mdash; it can only be made on a multilateral European basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This question is being taken as a stand-alone question and I will revert to Deputy Noonan&rsquo;s question subsequently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has until March to make his submission.  Will this be discussed by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and will the Opposition have a say?  Our view is slightly different from the Minister&rsquo;s, unless he has changed his way of how he does business.  Up to now the Minister does not seem to want to go after the bondholders.  This is a discussion paper about a fairer way of dealing with bank debts, not just the taxpayer taking the burden which has been the Minister&rsquo;s policy to date.  Can I take it that the Minister might not necessarily agree with the Commission that bondholders should take <Col N="6"/>on more debt-sharing in the future?  We think they should.  Will there be an opportunity to discuss this at the finance committee and will the Minister take advice on it?  Will the Opposition have an opportunity to give its views to the Commission or will it just be the views of Ministers?  This needs to be properly thought out and hopefully it will not be needed in the future, but it might be.  If it had been in place, taxpayers would have been saved a lot of money.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister be recommending that in future the bondholders will take more of a hit and the taxpayers a lesser hit?  This is not his current policy and I ask him to clarify the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;have been made in a context in which we have had to deal with actual distressed institutions.  I have in no way prejudged in any statement what future policy should be in this matter.  As I indicated in my reply, I am supportive of the Commission&rsquo;s approach.  I would welcome a discussion by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and would be pleased to take its views into account when formulating a position on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his willingness to discuss the issue but he was specifically asked for his views on dealing with the debts of banks.  Will he recommend that in future bondholders will take a bigger hit than was the case under Government policy to date?  I accept he will argue that he was unable to do this previously, although we think differently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and in enunciating policy in recent years I have made it clear that Europe does not have legislation equivalent to that introduced in the United States in response to the savings and loans crisis.  That has created a very different context for the domestic debate on bondholders and the degree to which they should contribute to the resolution of difficulties in institutions which are extremely distressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Minister&rsquo;s view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the arguments used in this jurisdiction were derived from sources in the United States, where an entirely different legal context applies.  If the Deputy is asking me whether we should move towards the legal context of the United States, I think we should be open and positive about doing so but I would express the reservation that any proposals have to be judged in terms of the impact they will have on the capacity of institutions to raise funds.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  his understanding of his commit<Col N="7"/>ment in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland actions to be completed by end Q3 2011 that he will consider an appropriate adjustment, including to the overall public service wage bill to compensate for potential shortfalls in the projected savings arising from administrative efficiencies and public service number reductions; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[1441/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated in the Budget Statement, the policies set out in the joint programme of assistance closely reflect our national recovery plan.  The programme sets out key points where the Government will assess the delivery of its current policies as set out in the plan to ensure they are achieving the savings and adjustments necessary to help restore the country&rsquo;s budgetary position, building on the significant savings already achieved over the last two years.  The Government proposes to meet its target for further reductions in the cost of delivery of public services through planned reductions in the number of public servants and through greater efficiencies in the way public services are delivered.  The savings targets for 2011 are set out in the budget Estimates and now form part of the allocation for each Department and agency over the coming year.  These savings targets are based on an overall reduction of public service numbers to 301,000 by the end of 2011 and other savings to be realised through a range of efficiencies and reform measures, including those set out in the Croke Park agreement.  The agreement will allow the necessary changes to working practices to be made to enable priority services to the public to be sustained in a period of reduced resources.</P>
        <P>The EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland states that by the end of the third quarter of 2011, the Government will consider an appropriate adjustment, including in the overall Public Service wage bill, to compensate for potential shortfalls in the projected savings arising from administrative efficiencies and public service number reductions.  Prior to that, and in accordance with a commitment under the Croke Park agreement, the first annual review of the position concerning public service pay and the sustainable savings arising from the implementation of the agreement will be undertaken.  That review will be based on the same quarterly data on the public service wage bill and the number of employees as will be provided on a quarterly basis under the joint arrangement.  There is therefore a synergy between the plan and the agreement.  The reviews under the agreement will demonstrate clearly whether it is delivering savings in the costs of public service delivery, primarily through reductions in public service numbers, with the related changes in working practices necessary to ensure that priority public services can continue to be sustained or improved.  In the event that the necessary sustainable savings are not being achieved, the Government is of the view that further cost saving measures will be necessary to achieve those reductions.  A number of options would be available to the Government in those circumstances to reduce the cost of the overall pay bill.</P>
        <P>In that regard the main commitments the Government gave under the agreement, namely those on pay rates, job security and superannuation entitlements, do not apply to any public servant which is represented by a union or association that has not accepted the agreement.  Any union or association in that position should now give careful consideration as to whether it is best representing the interests of its members in adopting that approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the savings envisaged under the Croke Park agreement in the public pay bill are not achieved, then the Minister will have straight pay cuts, if he happens to be still around at the end of quarter three.  Does he agree that the fact this is written into the memorandum of understanding is evidence that neither the IMF nor the European Union institutions believe the targets under the Croke Park agreement?  If he is still in office, does he envisage raising this issue when the review of the Croke Park agreement takes place in early March?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="8"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept what Deputy Noonan indicated or inferred because this particular procedure was inserted in the national recovery plan prior to any agreement with the EU and the IMF.  The position under the national recovery plan is that we will seek to reduce the cost of the public service payroll through reductions in the numbers and a very clear schedule of numbers is outlined there.  Were those savings not to be secured in accordance with the Book of Estimates published for this year, then the ultimate option of other methods to reduce the cost of the public service payroll would be resorted to.  That was made clear in the national recovery plan and I made it clear on many occasions before and after the agreement that it must deliver the necessary savings.  Whatever government is in office at the time will have to take measures to ensure costs are contained accordingly.  I have every confidence this Government will be in a position to deliver the necessary savings through the primary route identified in the Estimates this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree the Minister signalled this in the national recovery plan but the wording I used, and the question I posed today, is not taken from the national recovery plan but directly from the memorandum of understanding with the IMF and the EU institutions.  It states very bluntly that if he does not achieve the targets envisaged under the Croke Park agreement, he will have to cut public service pay.  Has the Minister worked out the process, procedure and legal base for possible future cuts in public service pay or is that something he has put on the back burner until there is a change in government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Noonan is aware, the officials from the IMF, EU and ECB were very impressed with the national recovery plan.  They viewed it as a very impressive document, unlike the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One of the features of the agreement is that to ensure there is delivery on public service reform, there must be some mechanism to ensure the savings are procured in any event.  That is in the national recovery plan and it is confirmed in the EU-IMF agreement.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is not the only measure in the agreement which ensures budgetary discipline on the part of future Governments.  There are many other provisions, for example, the cash limiting of Government departmental allocations on the non-pay side, the appraisal of projects on the investment project side, the restrictions of Supplementary Estimates and the requirement to bring savings forward to future years and not to reallocate them.  All of these measures will ensure a path of strict budgetary discipline is followed by whatever Government is elected by the people.  Indeed, the measures adopted in the EU-IMF agreement, and confirming what is in the plan, ensure that a path of strict fiscal control will be exercised by any future Government.</P>

        <Quest>  if he will explain the statement by the EU Commission that Anglo Irish Bank will receive a guarantee covering certain off balance sheet liabilities in addition to the payments to recapitalise the bank; the duration and estimated cost of this guarantee; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer Deputy Noonan to my reply of 7 December 2010 concerning this matter.  In November 2010, following a request from Anglo Irish Bank, the State provided a guarantee to the bank&rsquo;s derivative, repo and clearing type counterparties.  These counterparties did not have the benefit of support under any other existing guarantee arrangements.</P><Col N="9"/>
        <P>As with all banks, Anglo Irish Bank is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties in the normal course of its business activities.  I would stress that these exposures relate solely to normal activities of the bank.  The bank&rsquo;s balance sheet exposure to these risks, taken together with the risk mitigation provided by derivatives, are managed within risk limits which are approved by the bank&rsquo;s board of directors.</P>
        <P>Anglo Irish Bank indicated in late 2010 to the authorities that owing to the bank&rsquo;s financial position and recent rating actions, unguaranteed counterparties required the provision of such a guarantee if they were to continue transacting with the bank.  The bank has committed to entering only into arrangements which are to manage balance sheet risks and the bank does not take positions outside the limits approved by the board of directors.</P>
     
        <P>The bank has committed to keeping the NTMA regularly informed of the potential exposures arising under the guarantee and the NTMA monitors these exposures to ensure that any risk to the Exchequer is minimised.</P>
        <P>The State has incurred no cost arising from this guarantee.  The guarantee is a continuing guarantee and can be terminated by the Minister on 90 days&rsquo; notice.</P>
        <P>The European Commission&rsquo;s approval was necessary under state aid rules since the institution was benefiting from a guarantee and hence the reference by the Commission to this matter in its approval of the injection of capital to the bank in December 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the cash value of these additional liabilities which are being covered by the guarantee and which were brought to the public&rsquo;s attention on the EU website when the Government had to proceed <i>in camera</i> in court to put extra capital into one of the banks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will need to write to the Deputy on that matter and I undertake to do so.  Giving a precise cash value on a guarantee, which is a contingent exposure, is a very difficult exercise, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, and would require evaluation, but I am sure an approximate figure can be given.  As the Deputy knows, this bank is wholly owned by the taxpayer and we have a duty to ensure the bank can continue in the ordinary course of its business to transact the amount of business it is permitted to transact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Would it not be reasonable to ask the potential liability the Government is covering with this guarantee?  For the Minister to offer to write to me does not give me a good answer.  The public in general were unaware that there were additional liabilities the Government was covering in December.  This was brought to the attention of the public on the EU website and it was repeated on the Anglo Irish Bank website.  I will put the question again: the Minister is the man who issued the guarantee and so what was the quantum he was guaranteeing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The guarantees is for certain derivatives, repo and clearing-type counterparties.  As noted previously, the bank is committed to entering only into arrangements which are to manage balance sheet risks and the bank has confirmed that it does not take positions outside the limits approved by the board of directors, and the bank keeps the NTMA informed.  The vast majority of the derivatives are covered by collateral support agreements, which require the posting of collateral in the event that the derivative is out of money &mdash; in other words, if it becomes a liability.  The collateral is netted against the State&rsquo;s exposure in the event that the guarantee is called.  The guarantee has not been called.  The Deputy asked me to give the House an estimation of what it would cost and I said it was not possible to give such an estimation.  The Deputy sought a market value cost of the guarantee which I could not <Col N="10"/>give him.  In terms of the maximum net exposure were all the derivatives to arise as a liability, assuming the guarantee was called, it would be less than &euro;10 million.</P>
        <P>The other exposures relate to collateral valuation movements for repos, intraday balances on clearing accounts &mdash; these accounts are cleared to nil each day &mdash; and a backstop facility for the bank&rsquo;s commercial to paper programme.  To take an exemplary week, the total maximum net exposure to these transactions during the week ended on 31 March 2010 was &euro;600 million.  That would have been the total exposure were there a call on any of those that week.  Those are the figures I can give the Deputy.  However, I cannot give a market price for the guarantee, which he asked me originally, although I outlined the reasons it was difficult to do so.  We could attempt the exercise and provide him with the information if he wishes.</P>

        <Quest>  his views on the elevated level of business closures and job losses in 2010 particularly in the retail and domestic services sectors, the continuation of these trends into 2011, and their likely impact on economic growth and on the public finances; if he will set out the expectations for employment trends, business closures and economic growth underpinning his budget day forecasts; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[1445/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The challenging economic climate that has existed in Ireland and the broader international economy over the past three years or so has led to difficult trading conditions for many firms and significant job losses, most notably in the construction and retail sectors.  This is in part due to the rebalancing of the Irish economy away from unsustainable growth dominated by construction in recent years.  It should also be noted that, even during periods of sustained economic growth, there are always businesses closing and new businesses opening.</P>
        <P>On a more positive note, after experiencing two years of significant falling output, it is now clear that growth returned during the latter part of last year and, for 2010 as a whole, GDP is expected to have stabilised.  The strength of the corporate sector is also reflected in the performance of corporation tax receipts in 2010 which were marginally up on the 2009 level and almost a quarter greater than expected.  The Government has been actively attempting to improve the business environment in Ireland and to foster the development of new and existing companies.  Labour cost competitiveness has been improved as a result of the demonstration effect of the public service wage bill, the air travel tax has been cut, the commitment to retaining the 12.5% corporation tax rate has been reinforced and the business expansion scheme has been revamped.</P>
        <P>Clearly, economic growth is essential if we are to have real improvements in living standards and get employment growing again.  In this regard, growth will be achieved through an export-led recovery, driven initially by the mainly capital intensive manufacturing side but also by the more labour intensive services sector.  As exports grow, domestic activity will gradually expand.  Encouragingly, exports in the third quarter of 2010, as shown in the national accounts, grew by 12.9% for goods and 13.6% for services.  Data released today by Bord Bia show that food and drink exports expanded by 11% in 2010 exemplifying the broad nature of the recovery.  It is a recovery that is not confined to the multinational sector, but has taken place within indigenous exporting as well.</P>
        <P>Indicators of activity, such as the Quarterly National Accounts and the Quarterly National Household Survey and soft data from sources such as the Purchasing Managers&rsquo; Indices, indicate that economic growth patterns are in line with those contained in the budget.  These <Col N="11"/>indicators support my Department&rsquo;s forecasts that economic growth is expected to be 1.7% in GDP terms and 1% in GNP terms in 2011.  My Department expects that this growth will be mainly driven by exports, with domestic activity continuing to contract, albeit at a much slower pace.  The unemployment rate, which has shown signs of moderation in the final quarter of 2010, is expected to fall marginally to 13.2% this year.</P>
        <P>The 2011 budget day growth forecasts take account of the impact of the consolidation in the public finances of &euro;6 billion that was necessary to achieve a general Government deficit of 9.4% of GDP this year.  In 2010, the Government stabilised the public finances and this year we will start to see the reduction in the deficit ratio, which is essential to meet the 2014 target.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Does he understand the levels of fear and despair in towns, cities and villages all over Ireland for businesses that are in very serious trouble, particularly in the retail sector, the hotel and licence trade, and businesses dealing with tourism?  Does he know how many such businesses went to the wall in 2010, and how many are likely to go to the wall in 2011?  Has the Government any proposals to assist such businesses?</P>
        <P>Many of the retail businesses are closing.  We heard the unfortunate story of the collapse of the bookie&rsquo;s business of a former Member of this House, Mr. Ivan Yates.  That business was typical of many.  The rents that businesses are paying on shops and the lease costs are such that they are not capable of being met under the current deterioration in trade.  For the past two and a half years the Labour Party has asked the Government to change the upward-only rent review rule on existing leases so that businesses can renegotiate with their landlord a lower rent plus a profit share if profits return.  There are many workable models in other European countries.  Has the Minister any intention in the remaining months of the Government of doing anything to help the struggling businesses, many of which are dying, in every town, village and city in this country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>A report last week by corporate restructuring specialists Kavanagh Fennell showed that more than 1,500 firms went into liquidation, receivership or examinership last year.  A large proportion of these firms were in the construction sector and other related sectors.  This is in part due to the rebalancing of the Irish economy away from unsustainable growth dominated by construction in recent years.  On a more encouraging note, the business information firm and risk assessment agency Vision-net states that 14,015 companies were incorporated in Ireland last year, which was an increase of 5% over 2009.</P>
        <P>The national recovery plan provides a blueprint for Ireland&rsquo;s return to sustainable economic growth.  It identifies areas of activity which will provide increased employment opportunities as Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery takes place.  The plan sets out a range of specific actions and supports designed to improve competitiveness across all sectors of the economy, including the small and medium enterprise sector.  There are measures to cut costs to business, the removal of barriers to employment creation and a range of sector-specific actions to increase exports and domestic demand.  The specific issue raised by Deputy Burton is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance has a responsibility for the general economy.  Businesses are being killed by problems relating to leasing rents and costs and the impossibility of breaking those clauses unless the business goes into liquidation and has a capacity, perhaps on a more reduced scale, to start elsewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="12"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not mention that the other day tourism was reported as being back to 1998 levels.  Does the Minister or his Government have any proposals in this regard?  Not everybody will be a fourth level postgraduate worker in a multinational company doing information technology.  We want people back working in shops, hotels and other tourism areas.  Has the Government any proposals, such as graduate employment placement or business guarantee loan schemes?  The Labour Party has made such proposals for two and half years in order to get business and people working again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of these schemes can be availed of by the tourism sector and I agree with the Deputy that the sector can see growth if the Government makes decisions.  For example, the Government made a decision on the minimum wage which was bitterly opposed by the Deputy&rsquo;s party.  That was primarily sought by the tourism sector.  The recently announced budget involved a substantial reduction in the air travel tax, which is a cost the Exchequer will have to bear in order to ensure greater access of tourists to Ireland.  I agree that tourism sector is very important and the Government is taking a number of initiatives in that regard.</P>

	<P>As is normal in these circumstances, officials of my Department are in ongoing contact with their counterparts in the EU Commission, the IMF and the ECB with regard to implementation of the joint programme of financial assistance agreed for Ireland.  I understand that frequent contact is also taking place between the staff of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s office and the external funding agents.</P>
        <P>The policy conditionality associated with the EU-IMF programme for Ireland is set out in the memorandum of economic and financial policies and in the memorandum of understanding on specific economic policy conditionality.  These documents, together with the technical memorandum of understanding, which are collectively referred to as the MoU, have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>As regards the fiscal consolidation aspects of the agreement, as the Deputy will be aware, the release of the first instalments of financial assistance is conditional on the successful adoption of budget 2011.  In this regard, the Social Welfare Act 2010 is in force and the finance Bill 2011 is due to be published on 20 January 2011.  As part of the quantitative performance criteria of the technical memorandum of understanding, a target for the end-2010 Exchequer primary balance &mdash; the Exchequer balance excluding debt interest payments &mdash; of minus &euro;15.3 billion was set.  Excluding debt interest payments of just under &euro;4.1 billion, the Exchequer primary balance in 2010 was minus &euro;14.65 billion, meaning the target was met.  This data was relayed <Col N="13"/>to the IMF, European Commission and European Central Bank on Wednesday, 5 January.  I can also confirm that the data provision obligations on my Department, the NTMA and the Central Bank are being pursued in line with annex 1 of the memorandum of understanding.  The technical memorandum of understanding also set targets for cumulative end-quarterly Exchequer primary balances in 2011.  There has so far been no reason to change these targets.</P>
        <P>In the financial sector, the Deputy will be aware that the memorandum of understanding sets out a deadline of end-December 2010 for agreement with the Irish authorities and the ECB, European Commission and the IMF on agreed loan to deposit ratios for each of the banks.  However, following further discussions with the ECB, EU and IMF, it has been agreed that it would be more appropriate to decide on the loan to deposit ratios for 2013 when the information from the prudential capital assessment review and the prudential liquidity assessment plan is available.  This does not in any way diminish the commitment to appropriate restructuring of the banks in the relevant period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the House last met, the lead negotiator on behalf of the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Chopra, and the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, have both stated publicly that it is open to a new Government, following an election, to renegotiate with the lending agencies in respect of the terms of an agreement.  Is this also the Minister&rsquo;s position?</P>
        <P>In light of the point raised by Deputy Noonan about the Croke Park deal, which was negotiated last April and came into effect last June, what savings have accrued to the economy to date from the deal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the views expressed by the Governor of the Central Bank in this matter in their entirety.  What the Governor said was that it is available to any future Government, as it is to this Government, to renegotiate the fiscal and compositional elements of the EU-IMF agreement.  He did not say that the rate of interest or the total quantity of the adjustment can be renegotiated.  What he indicated and what has been clear from the inception of the agreement is that the relevant balance of tax and expenditure and relative weight to be attached to different expenditures can be adjusted, albeit only in a fiscally credible way.  That is the position and it is the constraint that will apply to any Government.</P>
        <P>The rate of interest and the total amount that must be secured over the programme period of three years are fixed by the agreement.  I agree it is somewhat confusing that the programme period is three years because the plan period is four years and the Stability and Growth Pact period is five years.  As far as the programme period is concerned, the total amount that must be secured within the period and the interest rates are fixed, while the other matters are up for discussion.</P>
        <P>On the Croke Park deal, I do not have information on the matter raised but I have dealt with it in answer to Deputy Noonan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that we are in a transition period to a general election and a likely change of Government, does the Minister agree that it would be appropriate for the information supplied to the International Monetary Fund and European Union by the institutions to which the Minister referred to be made available to the Opposition parties at the same time as it is provided to the IMF and EU?</P>
        <P>On a related matter, will the Minister agree to put in place contingency arrangements given that a change of Government is likely prior to the conclusion of the first reporting period at the end of March 2011, as set out in the memorandum of understanding?  In the run-up to the most recent general election in the United Kingdom, contingency arrangements were made <Col N="14"/>for the change of government.  Is it not appropriate, therefore, to have in place contingency arrangements with the Opposition with regard to this terribly important matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will reflect in a constructive way on the two requests made by Deputy Burton.  While I am not in a position to confirm this afternoon that I will comply with her request that certain information which is being transmitted should also be transmitted to the Opposition, I will consider it in a constructive way.  The Deputy&rsquo;s second request related to contingency arrangements.  It is not clear whether she is referring to contingency arrangements in the lead up to the poll or in the period after the poll.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>That will depend on the Green Party and the date of the election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">The period for adjustment for meeting the Stability and Growth pact target has been extended by one year to five years.  The original period the Government agreed with the European Union institutions was four years.  Does the Minister accept that the EU having to arbitrarily extend the period by one year demonstrates a complete failure of the Government&rsquo;s negotiations with the EU institutions?  The Government was told by my party at the time that it had failed as it would take six years to meet the target.  Similarly, does the Minister agree that the targets arrived at in the deal with the International Monetary Fund and European Union institutions under the bailout constitute an utter failure on the part of the Government because they cannot be met?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The negotiations resulted in a good arrangement for this country, which confirmed the national recovery plan the Government had already adopted.  The Government had already embarked on contingency planning for the difficulties we face in respect of funding the State.  Those contingency plans were finally formulated in a national recovery plan, which is the sovereign decision of the Irish Government and was accepted by the international authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to the impossibility of renegotiating the very high interest rate attached to the package.  With respect, he is not correct.  The rate is renegotiable but not at the level of the Minister for Finance; it is renegotiable at the level of Council of Ministers and heads of state, obviously because everything is.  Does the Minister realise that when the first tranche of money was transferred to Ireland, it was borrowed by our partners in Europe under their guarantee at 2.9%?  That element was lent on to Ireland at a rate in excess of 6%.  This is the first time the EU decided to make a profit in providing funds to member states.  It confirms the very bad negotiation conducted by the Minister and his officials.  These negotiations should be re-entered.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="15"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is useful to get the Minister&rsquo;s view, which is the same as that of Professor Honohan and Mr. Chopra, that renegotiation is possible.  Once there is agreement on general parameters and we sign up to the targets, the ways and means of achieving the targets are a matter for the new sovereign Government.  The Minister is <i>ad idem</i> with others.</P>
        <P>We are eight months into the Croke Park deal.  Can the Minister tell us, in money terms, how much has been saved?</P>

	<P>In response to Deputy Noonan, the interest rate charged to Ireland was raised with the EU authorities at a press conference earlier this afternoon on the new growth survey.  Commissioner Olli Rehn pointed out that the interest rates charged to Ireland are in line with Council decisions last year on the euro area loan facility to Greece following intensive discussions with member states.  That is the position on the interest rates.</P>

	<P>I take it Deputy Noonan is not questioning the IMF interest rates, which are locked in, nor is he questioning the stability mechanism, which is also locked in.  He is envisaging renegotiating with 27 member states.  That is theoretically possible but to suggest there were bad negotiations because we have a better arrangement than Greece, which Greece subsequently sought, is inaccurate and misleading.</P>

As regards pension contributions from public servants, a preliminary estimate for 2011 is of the order of &euro;700 million.  More detailed estimates will become available in the context of the Revised Estimates volume, which is in preparation at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the reply.  Does the Minister agree it is important that all information about public service pensions is put out there?  There are some 13,000 public sector pension holders and 4,300 spouses of deceased public servants who receive pensions.  The bulk of pensions are below &euro;12,000 a year and only one public service pension is in excess of &euro;150,000 a year.  Perhaps the Minister can tell us who is the lucky retired public servant who receives &euro;150,000 a year.  What is the net cost of public service pensions?  We are provided with figures on gross cost when most public servants contribute significantly to their pensions.  I am delighted the Minister told us the pension levy now produces &euro;1 billion per year.  The extra pension contributions will raise an additional &euro;800 million, with &euro;100 million <Col N="16"/>from retired pensioners in 2011 and &euro;700 million in additional pension contributions.  It would be useful to set out this and to set out who gets what.  What is the average public service pension?  Most people receive less than &euro;12,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to set out this information in the public domain after the publication of the Revised Estimates volume.  Revised legislation for public service pensions is among the items of legislation of essential budgetary importance that require enactment before the dissolution of the House.  We will have a considerable opportunity in that context to discuss public service pensions.  I will take into account the suggestion of the need to provide information on the numbers, the amount of their entitlement and related matters in the context of the presentation of that Bill.</P>

	<P>All banks publish their gross and net derivative trading and hedging positions in their audited financial statements.  The NAMA derivative position is included in NAMA quarterly reports that are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Banks utilise derivatives as part of their normal risk management hedging operations, primarily to control their exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.  The net exposure to hedging derivatives in each of the financial institutions at the most recent published annual account date at AIB was &euro;777 million, at Bank of Ireland &euro;145 million, at INBS &euro;88 million, at Anglo Irish Bank &euro;83 million, at EBS &euro;39 million and at Irish Life &amp; Permanent &euro;433 million.</P>
        <P>I am advised by NAMA that it does not enter speculative derivative positions but utilises derivatives to manage to the greatest extent possible, the balance sheet foreign exchange and interest rate exposures arising from the transfer of assets from participating institutions.  For example, NAMA has to use currency derivatives to hedge the foreign exchange exposure which arises on the purchase of foreign currency loans with euro denominated NAMA securities.  In addition, NAMA uses interest rate derivatives to assist in hedging interest rate risk arising on NAMA securities and borrower derivatives which transferred to NAMA.</P>
        <P>I am informed that EBS, INBS and Irish Life &amp; Permanent do not use derivatives for trading purposes.  Anglo Irish Bank no longer uses derivatives for trading purposes.  The other banks take proprietary trading positions in derivatives with a view to earning a profit.  Where such activities are carried out, it is within pre-defined trading limits set by the bank&rsquo;s board and monitored by independent risk management functions within the banks.</P>
        <P>In the case of Bank of Ireland the fair value of trading derivatives at the time of their last published annual accounts was a net liability of &euro;358 million.  This total includes derivatives entered into with economic hedging intent but classified as held for trading under international accounting rules.  The same applies for AIB, which had a net liability of &euro;226 million.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that any profits or losses on traded derivatives are fully recognised in the banks&rsquo; annual accounts.  The information for NAMA is contained in the quarterly reports produced by the agency, the latest one of which I will shortly lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>This question arose because the Minister issued a blanket guarantee at the end of November before the budget on Anglo Irish Bank exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange transactions.  The reason it became necessary, which may have been recommended to the Minister by the board of NAMA, was that Anglo Irish Bank went down to junk bond status and many of the derivative positions essentially became closed.</P>
        <P>Based on what the Minister knows about the operations of Anglo Irish Bank before the fall, and in view of the kind of behaviour the bank was engaging in, what does the Minister know about the derivatives it had entered into?  The derivatives of most Irish banks were related to hedging, foreign exchange swaps and so on &mdash; routine business.  It is basically a form of insurance.  Then there were the geniuses who ran Anglo Irish Bank.  If one is clever in the markets, there is a lot of money to be made from derivatives.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister reviewed the derivative positions of Anglo Irish Bank?  He should take account of the fact that at the end of November he was forced to issue an extra guarantee for all the derivative positions of the Anglo Irish Bank.  Does he have a chart showing when those positions expire and thus the risk ceases?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>No; I am referring to the information at my disposal about the derivatives of Anglo Irish Bank which required the posting of collateral in the event that the derivative was out of money, which is what Deputy Burton is talking about.  In that case, the derivative becomes a liability.  That collateral is netted against the State&rsquo;s exposure in the event that the guarantee is called in.  Let us take as an example, for illustrative purposes, the week ending 31 December 2010.  In that week, the maximum net exposure of the State to derivatives, assuming the guarantee was called in &mdash; which is was not &mdash; was less than &euro;10 million.  I have every confidence in the current management and board of Anglo Irish Bank.  They are doing their job, and the approach taken in this matter was essential to stabilise the institution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister reviewed all of the outstanding derivative positions of Anglo Irish Bank?  Is he happy that has been done and that there has been due diligence?  Has he spoken with the various parties now looking after Anglo Irish Bank?  Is he satisfied that he has been advised of all potential exposures?  Does he have a list of the dates on which the derivatives expire?</P>

	<P>A national programme of catchment flood risk assessment and management studies, CFRAMs, which will lead to the development of comprehensive flood risk assessment and management plans for areas of significant flood risk, is being rolled out by the Office of Public Works.  The appointment of consultants to undertake catchment-based flood risk assessment and management studies for the River Shannon is being finalised as we speak, and an announcement will probably issue later this afternoon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Good news.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The summer flooding of the Shannon Callows between Portumna and Athlone will be specifically examined in this study to reflect the social and environmental damage it causes in the catchment.  In general, this summer flooding arises from the restricted capacity of the River Shannon at this location.  Flooding can occur as a result of large flows from the River Suck, the Upper Shannon from Lough Ree, or a combination of both.  The River Brosna can also contribute to flooding in this area.  I am pleased to note that minor works were carried out on the Little Brosna last summer, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service has now approved further minor works at Shannon Harbour, which will be carried out when water levels and environmental windows permit.</P>
        <P>The OPW has examined flood profiles for various flood events, large and small, to identify localised constrictions to flood flow between Banagher and Meelick.  Arising from this investigation, minor maintenance involving the removal of low-lying branches and some trees on the New Cut and a number of small islands downstream of Banagher has been proposed.  A license application has been submitted to the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the OPW is currently awaiting a decision on the matter.  The proposed maintenance would be directed towards the mitigation of smaller floods.</P>
        <P>The Shannon Callows is an important asset to the farming community and traditional farming practices are recognised as contributing to the economic, social and environmental management of this unique area.  There is no doubt that the recent pattern of flooding in the Callows has caused significant hardship to many members of the community.  I visited the Callows area in 2008, and in 2009 I accompanied the president of the IFA, local residents and public representatives to see the situation for myself and talk through the issues.  I am conscious of the serious <Col N="19"/>impact on both farming and the environment in the area due to the annual winter flooding and periodic summer flooding.</P>
        <P>I have instructed my officials to identify any interim measures to be pursued in advance of the Shannon CFRAM study.  A combination of further minor works and refined management of water levels will continue to assist in mitigating flood impacts.  The impacts in 2010 were significantly less than those experienced in the previous two years.</P>
        <P>In parallel with the commissioning of the CFRAM study for the River Shannon, the OPW is holding ongoing discussions with Waterways Ireland and the ESB to review water management protocols for the major storage areas in the Shannon system.    Control of outflows from the Callows area is managed by the ESB and Waterways Ireland.  The OPW has engaged with Waterways Ireland and the ESB to examine the most effective management of the sluices at Meelick and Lough Ree.  Waterways Ireland has indicated that it will examine an upgrade to Meelick Weir with a view to automating the control of water levels at the weir.</P>
        <P>In September 2010, the ESB carried out discharges from Lough Ree with a view to providing storage in the lake against winter floods.  This allowed for some reduction of the level of Lough Ree prior to the winter rains.  The ESB has also engaged with each local authority in the Shannon catchment, issuing twice-weekly e-mail updates on the status of the Shannon lakes and alerts about major spills at Parteen Weir.  This data is based on three- to five-day rainfall forecasts and allows for several days&rsquo; warning of potential flooding.  In addition, a number of information sessions have been held for local authority officials, and further sessions will be held for council members.</P>

Will the work be done under contract or directly by the OPW?  The Minister of State also mentioned that part of the solution to the problem was the storage of water from the River Shannon.  Does that mean that in order to drain the Callows it is essential that we proceed with the proposal to take the water out of the Shannon and pipe it to Dublin?  Is that what the Minister of State meant by his reference to storage?</P>

        <Quest> if he and the Governor of the Central Bank have had any discussions with the European Central Bank on their concerns regarding certain provisions of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Bill 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The legal drafting of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Bill by the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel could not begin until the conclusion of the negotiations with the IMF, the European Central Bank or ECB, and the European Commission which resulted in the programme agreement.  Once a near final draft of the Bill was available, this was shared with the European Central Bank which was aware that the provisions in the Bill were required on an urgent basis to effect the restructuring of the banking sector.  While the timeframe available for the consultation process was short, in advance of the circulation of the draft Bill to the ECB, my officials were in close contact with ECB services to facilitate an efficient and speedy consultation.  It should be noted that the ECB welcomed the broad powers provided for in the Act.</P>
        <P>The ECB opinion was received after the Bill had passed all Stages in the Oireachtas.  My Department is carefully considering the ECB opinion, working closely with the Attorney General.  I will be responding formally to President Trichet shortly on the main points raised in the opinion.  In advance of this, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the detail of the ECB&rsquo;s opinion although I believe that the main legal issues raised in the opinion can be fully addressed.</P>
        <P>Regarding any discussions that the Governor and the Central Bank may have had on the content of the Bill with the ECB, the Deputy will note that I would not be a party to these discussions and I am not, therefore, in a position to make any comment on them.  It is important to make the point that, as I highlighted in my speech on Second Stage, the fundamental purpose <Col N="21"/>of the legislation was to ensure that the national authorities had the legislative tools to achieve the restructuring of the banks which we are committed to under the terms of the joint programme agreement with the EU and IMF, agreed in consultation with the ECB.</P>
        <P>Regarding the opinions on the independence of the Governor and the Central Bank, section 5 of the Act provides that nothing in the legislation affects any obligation arising under the EU treaties, and protects the treaty principle of central bank independence.  In regard to the position of the ECB as a creditor, which was the main focus of the opinion, I would have to take account of the position of the ECB when forming an opinion regarding the effect of orders and other obligations of the relevant institutions under section 61.  The Central Bank of Ireland will be closely involved in the planning and decision making on any transfer measure.</P>
        <P>As regards the concern raised by the ECB on the constitutionality of the Act, I believe this is not within the competence of the European Central Bank.</P>

	<P>Despite the Minister&rsquo;s sweet words to the House in response to the ECB&rsquo;s views on this Bill around Christmas time, not since the time of the Third Reich was a Bill so radically put through a democratic parliament.  Is the Minister not stung by the clear and deliberate criticisms that have been levied at him and the Government for the manner in which the legislation was put through the House, as well as its provisions?  Am I correct in saying that, to date, the Minister has not formally responded to the ECB&rsquo;s stated opinion?  What is causing the delay?</P>

	<P>I have already indicated in my reply, which was not a sweet comment, that the European Central Bank has no competence in judging the constitutionality of measures in this State.  The opinion was out of order in that respect, although the proper constitutional procedures were followed.  As the Deputy knows, the President, rightly within her functions, convened a meeting of the Council of State and ultimately signed the legislation.</P>
        <P>As regards the other matters of concern raised by the European Central Bank, which related to its position as a creditor and the ECB&rsquo;s independence, these matters are adequately covered by the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister&rsquo;s reply not reflective of the hubris with which the Fianna F&aacute;il Government has dealt with the EU over the last 13 years when we were cock of the walk?  Does the Minister recall that the ECB is currently extending credit facilities of &euro;100 billion at 1% to Irish banks?  Many people in the ECB now seem to be taking the view that perhaps that could be pushed over to the Regling fund at the Minister&rsquo;s wonderfully negotiated rate of5.8%.  The Minister is constitutionally correct in saying that the ECB has no role concerning legislation in Ireland.  From a negotiating viewpoint, however, given that we are getting &euro;100 billion at 1% for our banks but our citizens will pay 5.8%, does the Minister not want to mend his fences with Mr. Trichet?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="22"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  What I made clear was that certain valid concerns were raised by the European Central Bank in the opinion, and those concerns are already addressed or can be addressed in the correspondence with the president.  I indicated to the House, as I hope any Irish Minister would, that the ECB does not have a function in the constitutional validity of legislation enacted in this House.  That is the position.</P>

	<P>The longer this sham of a Government continues, the more unfortunate it is for our people and for our country.  Last Sunday, the <i>Sunday Times</i> revealed two hitherto undisclosed meetings between the Taoiseach &mdash; both formerly, as Minister for Finance, and as Taoiseach &mdash; and Mr. Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick of Anglo Irish Bank.  I want to make it clear that I have no objection to the Taoiseach meeting people or playing a round of golf.  What this does, however, is to cement in people&rsquo;s minds the close, cosy relationship between the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, big business and bankers.  In its own way, it has destroyed public confidence both in politics and in the future of our country.  As a consequence, it has put so many people in fear, anxiety and financial difficulties.</P>
        <P>On three occasions last year, the Taoiseach refused to say that matters about Anglo Irish Bank were discussed at a dinner function he had with the board of that bank.  On 31 March, in response to a question from myself, he said he treated this with contempt.  On 10 November, in response to a question from myself and Deputy Burton, he said he had spoken about the economy in general and that no matters relevant to Anglo Irish Bank were discussed at that dinner.</P>
        <P>A book entitled <i>The Fitzpatrick Tapes</i>, published last Sunday, describes in some detail the setting of that last supper.  The Taoiseach, flanked by Mr. Drumm and Mr. FitzPatrick, was given an account from the various sections of Anglo Irish Bank of the loan position and was informed that the NTMA did not wish to invest in the bank.  The Taoiseach was asked to do something about this, to which he indicated he would look into it.  The background to this has destroyed the confidence of so many people and it is for them that my concern is &mdash; the suppliers who are not being paid by subcontractors, the young mother whose father has Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;whose sister has mobility problems and who has now lost her job, and so many thousands of people who see their wages and salary cheques being reduced by higher income taxes and other levies.</P>
        <P>I have two questions for the Taoiseach.  First, can we now take it that the three occasions where he met Mr. FitzPatrick and where he was in contact with him &mdash; the telephone call to Kuala Lumpur on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, the occasion of the dinner with the board of Anglo Irish Bank, and the round of golf &mdash; represent an end to the social and business contact he had with him?  Second, in the light of the direct contradiction between the Taoiseach&rsquo;s report of the Anglo Irish Bank dinner and the report of Mr. FitzPatrick in the book published last Sunday that there were matters relevant to Anglo Irish Bank discussed there and that the Taoiseach undertook to do something about it, will the Taoiseach indicate which is the truth?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="23"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not too sure if it was just in relation to the introductory statement Deputy Kenny made that I regarded whatever he said with contempt, but there was basically the assertion that in some way there is an untoward issue that arises as a result of any contact that took place.  That is a narrative which has been conducted by the Opposition on an ongoing basis.  When one gets to the nub of it, the claim is that this triangle they talk about, of Anglo Irish Bank, Fianna F&aacute;il and developers, means that in some way Fianna F&aacute;il has been involved in subjectively protecting people and all this sort of stuff.  This has been the constant narrative.  I want to refute all of that as without foundation.</P>
        <P>Second, in regard to what Deputy Kenny has asked me, I do not recall at any time such a request coming to me from Mr. Drumm to talk to Dr. Michael Somers.  I suppose the best way of deciding whether it happened or not is to know whether I did make such a request, which I did not, and that has been confirmed by Dr. Somers himself.  That is as far as I can take it.  There is no question of any inappropriate behaviour by me in respect of that matter at any time during my period as Minister for Finance or as Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s second point relates to what he called a cosy relationship.  Any Minister for Finance would know the chairmen of the three biggest banks in Ireland.  I had no closer a relationship with Mr. FitzPatrick, based on my job as Minister, as any of my predecessors would have had with him or with the chairman of AIB or the chairman of Bank of Ireland.  I have met them all from time to time in the conduct of my duties.</P>
        <P>In the first instance in regard to the telephone call in March, I was away in Malaysia and Vietnam doing St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day work on behalf of the Government.  I was in Vietnam by the time a telephone call was made to me.  I was away on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day when, as people will be aware, a share price drop happened in Anglo Irish Bank.  It was related to the fact that Halifax Bank of Scotland&rsquo;s share price had dropped considerably, and there was a read across to Anglo Irish Bank which had a similar monoline-type portfolio.  That was one issue.  I had been notified in early March by the former Central Bank Governor, Mr. Hurley, who has confirmed this, that there was market intelligence suggesting that Se&aacute;n Quinn had taken a contract for difference position in relation to Anglo Irish Bank and that this was an issue that was being looked at to try to verify the extent of it.</P>
        <P>Before I took a telephone call from Mr. FitzPatrick, as I felt was the appropriate thing to do as Minister for Finance, I telephoned the Central Bank Governor asking for an update.  I had heard that there had been a share price drop since I was away &mdash; my private secretary from the Department of Finance would have accompanied me on those trips.  My wife also accompanied me and at that stage we had completed our work and were taking a couple of days in a resort in Vietnam whose name I forget.  The Governor told me that there had not been any further developments since he had spoken to me last.  I said that was fine and then telephoned Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick as requested, or perhaps he telephoned me.  Fintan Drury would have been the person who telephoned me to say Mr. FitzPatrick was looking to talk to me.  When Mr. FitzPatrick spoke to me he brought me up to date as to what had happened.  I said to him that this was a matter that would be dealt with by the Central Bank Governor, or by the regulator as CFD issues are a regulator issue.  I telephoned Mr. Hurley and told him the position and said to him to make sure it was followed up.  On the following day, Good Friday, heading into the Easter weekend &mdash; Easter being the weekend after St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day week that year &mdash; the Central Bank Governor and the Financial Regulator met with Anglo Irish Bank in Central Bank offices.</P>
        <P>In my opinion, that was the appropriate way a Minister should handle that situation, and it was subsequently followed up by the Financial Regulator.  There was then a change of Administration where I became Taoiseach and Deputy Brian Lenihan became Minister for Finance. <Col N="24"/> The Minister has outlined to various committees the situation from then on.  In July, as people will be aware, it became public news that the Quinn position had been unwound and we were told that other investors had been found.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, would not have had available to him under the law the names of those investors, and nor had I at any time.  We now know, subsequent to the guarantee and subsequent to a due diligence procedure which was done in Anglo Irish Bank, that  corporate governance issues arose and that matters were referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement and to the Garda.  That investigation is ongoing and is now with the DPP, so I cannot say anything more than that about it.</P>
        <P>The third issue was in regard to the situation in July.  On 23 July we had our last Cabinet meeting before the break after which I went to play golf at the request of a friend of mine, Fintan Drury.  Also in attendance at that time was Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick.  I do not play much golf and have not played golf with Mr. FitzPatrick before then or since.  It was the only time I ever played golf with him.  That game took place and I did not discuss Anglo Irish Bank matters with him throughout that period.  The appropriate way to behave if one is having a serious discussion about something like that is that one would bring the person to the Department and there would be officials in attendance.  As Taoiseach, I would bring the Minister for Finance if he was available and such a discussion would take place.  I am not in a position to concoct a story to say that there was some part of the day when it was discussed, because it was not discussed and that is the truth.  I have no reason to say otherwise.  Those are the three incidents.</P>
        <P>If I may, A Cheann Comhairle, for the purpose of bringing this to a complete position, I will deal with the politics of it.  The whole charge behind all of this, when one comes to the nub of it, is that Fianna F&aacute;il did something it should not have done on the night of the guarantee for these people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the truth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the narrative that the Labour Party and Fine Gael &mdash; the latter from time to time, though not as often &mdash; have put about non-stop.</P>
    
        <P>Of course, it resonates for them and they are obviously getting some votes out of it.  I want to make it as crystal clear as I possibly can that every decision we made at a time of great crisis in this country was objectively based.  Everything we did was for the purpose of seeking to protect the interests of this country.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>If people want to read the reports, including the Honohan report and Regling-Watson report, but particularly the former, they may do so.  The Honohan report outlines the seriousness of the situation that faced this country on the occasion in question.  It outlines what had happened over the weekend in question.  It outlines the closure or failure of Fortis bank, it refers to the growing problem in Bear Stearns and states the TARP toxic asset plan in Congress was rejected over the weekend in question.  All of that meant we had a systemic problem facing us on the night.  It did not pertain solely to some specific institution because the whole system was at risk.  The Honohan report confirms that if the guarantee had not been implemented, the doors of the banks would have been closed within days.  I paraphrase the report.  Those are the facts.</P>
        <P>The argument of the Labour Party, which at the time in question totally opposed the guarantee and said there should have been none &mdash; it has modified its position since then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is beyond question that is the case.  Let us not distort the facts.</P>
        <P>One of the points I would like to make in the House, which I will finalise in terms of the first of the questions Deputy Kenny asked me, is that people can have differences of opinion about many matters.  In any crisis, one can consider a number of options and decide what is the best approach.  We took the most assertive action and the action we believed was the right one to take.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government panicked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We were the first country to have to take the guarantee option.  Subsequently, Denmark came forward with a guarantee option and used senior debt.  The template of all the guarantee options is that of Sweden, which introduced a blanket guarantee in the 1990s when it had to try to save its banking system.  Of course, circumstances are different in every country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Even if one considers the initial Northern Rock guarantee, one will note it had to be widened by the British Government a short time after its introduction because it did not, I presume, provide sufficient credibility for the markets to ensure the run on the bank would stop.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Hindsight is great and people do not want to talk about the subordinated debt, which was 3.3% of the total.  The Labour Party is 100% wrong because there is an argument about that.  There was a reason one would include subordinated debt, and it has been set out <i>ad nauseam</i> to finance committees and Opposition spokespersons and Government Deputies, all of whom quite rightly asked questions on the possibility of a default being established and there being a cross-over between dated subordinated debt and senior debt.  That is a technical issue.  However, it is absolutely clear that there was an objective necessity to introduce a guarantee for the Irish banking sector because of the systemic nature of the problem we faced, and that if it had not been introduced, there would have been disorderly closure and a failure of seismic proportions in our economy.</P>
        <P>Those are the facts.  One can argue the matter any way one likes but must acknowledge those are the facts.  Therefore, I reject utterly the contention to the contrary in the interest of the good name of the people who support my organisation and who enter this House as democrats and make the right decisions by their best lights, and the people who support us in government. <Col N="26"/> We made that decision for those reasons and for no others.  No game of golf, telephone call or dinner will change that.  To suggest otherwise is to circulate a patently absurd conspiracy theory which is perpetuating the problem and doing a greater disservice to politics in this country than any actions this Government honourably took in a crisis.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach has taken quite a long time to answer two simple questions I asked him.  He did not answer either of them.  I made no assertion against him.  I did not assert that he intervened in any wrong way.  I asked him two simple questions.  I noted the intensity of the Minister for Foreign Affairs as he was looking at the Taoiseach when replying.

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach spoke for at least ten or 12 minutes in his response.  I did not ask the Taoiseach whether Mr. FitzPatrick whinged or moaned his way around the golf course, or even whether he gave him that putt or who took the money, if there was money on the game.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach offered a long litany.  He quoted Professor Honohan and did so last weekend.  What happened in July 2008 is referred to in Professor Honohan&rsquo;s report.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In the week to 04/07, Irish financials fall sharply and underperform European peers. [...] S&amp;P also lowers its [...] outlook for Anglo&rsquo;s A rating from &lsquo;stable&rsquo; to &lsquo;negative&rsquo;.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">In the week to 10/07, Irish financials continues their sharp fall. [...] There are negative comments on Irish banks from Goldmans, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Lehmans and RBS. [...]</P><Col N="27"/>
        <P LI="1" el="0">In the week to 18/07, [...] the use of contracts for difference (CFDs) come into focus over the period amid media reports that Ireland&rsquo;s richest man [...] is estimated to be nursing a &euro;500mn to &euro;1bn loss from his 15pc leveraged derivative position in Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Taoiseach would have known all this.  He would have known, when he telephoned Mr. FitzPatrick at the request of Mr. Drury, having spoken to the Governor of the Central Bank, that there was certainly a problem.</P>
        <P>Professor Honohan stated in his report: &ldquo;it became quite clear to top FR decision-makers that senior Anglo figures were well-liked in political circles, and it cannot be excluded that this played a part in their subsequent continuation in office for some months after September.&rdquo;  I wonder who Professor Honohan was talking about when he wrote that.  It is fair to state, in terms of the facts we now know, the Taoiseach did make a call back when he was Minister for Finance, did meet the board of Anglo Irish Bank over a dinner and did have a round of golf.</P>

        <P>The Anglo Irish Bank files show clearly that the Department of Finance was informed regularly about the so-called golden ten in regard to the overhang of Quinn shares.  Am I to believe the Department of Finance and the Taoiseach, who had recently vacated the office of Minister for Finance at the time in question, were not so informed, having had telephone calls from and other contacts with Mr. FitzPatrick?</P>
        <P>Regarding the two questions I asked the Taoiseach, does he deny what was reportedly said by Mr. FitzPatrick as printed last Sunday in the book, namely, that Mr. FitzPatrick asked his people at the dinner to give the Taoiseach loan perspectives on their various sectors within the bank?  Does he deny he was informed that the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, would not invest in Anglo Irish Bank and that he undertook to do something about it?  Can I take it the three contacts of which we now know &mdash; the telephone call, the dinner with the board of Anglo Irish Bank and the game of golf &mdash; were the Taoiseach&rsquo;s only social or business contacts with Mr. FitzPatrick and that this is an end to it?</P>

        <P>This is not the point anyway.  The central suggestion here is that, by having this contact, I did things I should not have done, I asked or directed people to do things they should not have done, I did this or I did that.  It is not true.</P>

At no stage did we do anything inappropriate.  Everything we did we believed was in the best interests of our country in the context of the crisis facing us.</P>
        <P>As regards social contacts, I do not believe I have had any further social contact with Mr. FitzPatrick since then.  I am almost sure that is the case.  In the job that one does as Minister for Finance, it would be extraordinary for one to spend one&rsquo;s time in office without meeting people who run banks during some stage in the course of one&rsquo;s duties.</P>

	<P>This is an absurd sense of puritanism that we need to avoid.  I want to make it clear again that nothing untoward was done at any time.  Regarding the specific call Deputy Kenny mentioned, I was away at the time.  Before I took the call, I spoke to the Central Bank Governor.  I also spoke to him afterwards.  There was a meeting between him and the Financial Regulator the next day in his offices, followed by subsequent meetings.  I do not see what is the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>

	<P>This month, everyone who is fortunate to still have a job will open his or her pay packet to find a large hole in it.  The same is true for people in receipt of social welfare payments.  People who run businesses and put up signs about 50% off this and 60% off that are still having difficulty getting people through their doors.  All of this is occurring because of the decision the Government asked the D&aacute;il to make, namely, to provide a blanket bailout, guarantee or whatever one calls it that included Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach stated in his reply to Deputy Kenny, the Labour Party opposed the guarantee at the time.  We clearly differ on the matter and I do not want to go back over the arguments, although we can if the Taoiseach wants.  The reason there is interest in what he discussed with Mr. FitzPatrick while playing golf, during the dinner and so on is simple.  When the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance asked the House on 30 September 2008 to agree to the blanket bailout, did the former know Anglo Irish Bank was a bust bank?  We want to pursue him on the question of his contacts with the board members and senior officers of Anglo Irish Bank because every time we asked him about his state of knowledge of the bank&rsquo;s position, how large a hole it was in and whether it was insolvent, he did not tell us about any of his contacts with Mr. FitzPatrick or the bank&rsquo;s senior officers.  He never told us that Mr. FitzPatrick telephoned him in Malaysia, as the Taoiseach has now acknowledged.  The House discussed the dinner which the Taoiseach attended at the invitation of the bank&rsquo;s board, as I understand it, but we heard nothing about the game of golf.</P>
        <P>Let us take it from the top.  The Taoiseach has now told us about the telephone conversation.  A number of weeks after that conversation, he was invited to dinner with the board.  To date, he has given the impression that the bank was not discussed at the dinner.  He sat between Mr. Drumm and Mr. FitzPatrick.  They claim Mr. Drumm made a presentation to the Taoiseach and asked that the NTMA provide deposits.  Until now, the Taoiseach has given the impression that he just sat between the two men.  I do not know what they talked about.  Maybe it was the plot line of &ldquo;Eastenders&rdquo;.  The impression the Taoiseach has given is that, whatever it was they discussed, they did not discuss banking business.</P>

	<P>In July, the very month during which the Taoiseach told the House the Quinn issue with Anglo Irish Bank was being resolved, the Taoiseach was playing golf with Mr. FitzPatrick.  Given the comments made by the Taoiseach and on his behalf since the weekend, we have been led to believe he constructed some kind of Chinese wall down the fairway between him and Mr. FitzPatrick, in that they never discussed bank business.  I would find it extraordinary &mdash; I would even blame the Taoiseach more &mdash; if he did not discuss the bank business with Mr. FitzPatrick.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Here was a bank, the shares of which had been in trouble since March and the Taoiseach had two opportunities to raise the matter with it.  I acknowledge the <Col N="30"/>Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments about formal meetings, the presence of officials and so on.  However, it is incredible that the Taoiseach, a man who sat in the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s office and would have a certain amount of knowledge about the issue, did not at least ask about the bank&rsquo;s problems, whether they had been resolved or how things were going.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>He is about to put the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is what the Taoiseach has led us to believe.  Let us be clear.  First, did the Taoiseach discuss the bank&rsquo;s business at the dinner or the golf outing?  Second, will he put on the record of the House all of his contacts with Anglo Irish Bank between the beginning of 2008 and the time of its nationalisation?  I am referring to his meetings, formal, informal, social or whatever, with the bank&rsquo;s officers or members of its board of directors.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach went to considerable length to address the Labour Party in his response to Deputy Kenny, but is the bottom line not that the Government provided a bailout, a guarantee, to a bust bank and that the people must now pay for this through reduced incomes and social welfare payments, additional taxes, a loss of business and the economic problem with which they are trying to cope?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer the Deputy directly.  First of all, the difficulties we are facing in the economy, the cutbacks in expenditure and the tax increases with which we have to contend relate to the economic situation we are in, which relates to the economy itself, namely, the difference between what we are spending and what we are earning.  As difficult as dealing with both this situation and the banking crisis is, if we did not have any banking crisis, we would still have these policies to pursue in terms of reducing our day-to-day expenditure and having a sustainable fiscal policy going forward.  We are as mindful of this situation as anyone else in the House.  We are implementing policies we believe are necessary to bring us back to recovery as quickly as possible so people can have a better future and we come out of recession.  As we stabilise the economy and as our budgetary policy worked during the course of this year, as difficult as things are, we are now looking to the implementation of a four year plan to bring us back to growth, with all of the difficult decisions that involves.  They are the right decisions for the state of the economy as it stands and it is because we want to get back to improving social services in due course on a sustainable basis and creating more jobs that we are taking these decisions.  It is only by a consistent approach in being prepared to do that and having the political will to do it, as distinct from people talking about percentages and then coming up with policies that do not get us to those percentages, that we will actually be able to address the problems this country faces in every family and in every townland and in every village in the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My state of knowledge, like the Government state of knowledge, was based on the information that was being provided to it by the people who were serving, the regulators and the Central Bank and, as we know and as the reports point out, there are issues that have had to be reformed and had to be changed and we have changed them; we have brought in changes to address those issues, as we were recommended to do in those reports.  Clearly, and it has been set out in terms of both the international and the domestic issues that affected this situation, there have been many reports and many recommendations that have come forward that confirm the analysis was wrong.  External surveillance organisations, including the IMF, provided projections which did not turn out to be accurate either.  That is no comfort to any of us who have had to deal with the outcome of the decisions that were necessary as a result of <Col N="31"/>the financial system crisis with which we have had to contend and with which we still contend in the work we are doing.</P>
        <P>As has been said in those reports, the primary focus of the regulatory system was on the liquidity issue.  There is no doubt we had reached a situation on 28-29 September, as a result of what had happened over the weekend internationally and at home with deposits leaving, that it was necessary for us to bring forward something that would stabilise that situation and save the financial system.  My state of knowledge was based on the advice we were getting.  There was no other state of knowledge available to any of us and we were dealing with that situation based on those assessments that were before us.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yes, there were options, but it was clear that on 28 September we had got to a point where we had a systemic problem, not simply a bank-specific problem, and there was no way in which we could take out of the equation any one of those institutions and in that respect, Anglo Irish Bank.  In fact, Mr. Honohan in this report said that such a proposal would be an academic exercise since the disorderly failure of a bank that was not included in the guarantee would have had spill over effects right across not only the Irish economy but into the European banking system and the British banking system as well.  In a current affairs programme on Monday night, Deputy Rabbitte spoke about this and has some knowledge and strong views on this area perhaps, but I take the point that he was saying there was incandescent rage with what we did from elements of British political circles.  The point was this, we had no choice, we had to save the system here.  The fact is we did not have a European-wide system in that case and we were the first country to introduce that guarantee system in the present crisis.  It was subsequently taken up by other countries who were facing similar type problems.  Those are the facts, that is the context in which we operated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am of the view &mdash; I state it for the reasons I have given, and I believe the reports are far more in favour of the decisions we took than any other suggestion that has been made &mdash; that the guarantee had to be decisive and assertive and had to confirm that we were going to stand behind the system at that time and it was that which avoided a disastrous, seismic economic shock in this country that would be far greater than what is being suggested.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When Deputy Gilmore mentioned that he did not agree with the guarantee for Anglo Irish Bank, what would have been the cost of letting that bank go at that time and in those circumstances?  We would have had to pay up on the deposits that existed and that would have been far greater and the taxpayer would have to find billions of euros, including for credit unions and other pension funds, that were part of the deposit base of that bank.  Let us be clear: we are not talking about some eclectic group of people in some other part of the world.  We are talking about moneys that are part of the savings and part of the futures of working people in this country and people in credit unions and elsewhere.  It was not an option and all of the objective evidence points to that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People should consider that and get away from the game playing and get away, frankly, from the politics of smear they have tried to dress up in some sort of respectable fashion &mdash; the smear Deputy Gilmore has refused to withdraw, that I made decisions, or the Government I led made decisions, that were about protecting personal interests rather than defending the common good and defending our country at a time of serious financial crisis.  I reject that assertion with contempt.  There is not one shred of evidence for Deputy Gilmore to make that contention.  He is continuing with the political narrative from which he has drawn a reservoir of votes for the past two years at our expense or at my personal expense by suggesting I am an economic traitor.  I am no economic traitor; I have sought to do this job to the very best of my ability with my colleagues in the common interest for the public good.  I do not mind disagreement in political discourse but I still say to Deputy Gilmore, and say it to him honestly, <Col N="32"/>as a colleague whom I do not personally dislike, that despite the severity of that criticism, there is no basis in fact for that contention, and it should be withdrawn because it does nothing for the debate and creating confidence in the integrity of our system in this country.</P>

	<P>Why did the Taoiseach not tell the garda&iacute; about his contact with Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have never made a personal attack on the Taoiseach in this House and I am not going to start now.  What I said, and what I stand over, is that if the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government knew Anglo Irish Bank was insolvent and asked the Irish taxpayers to bail it out and to pay the cost we are now paying for it, that was and is economic treason.  I stand over that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach responds to me with a lot of &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo;: what if the guarantee had not been given and the bailout had not been given.  Let us concentrate on what is and that is the fact the Irish people are now having to pay a very big price for that mistake.  The Taoiseach tells us that if there was never a banking crisis, we would still have a fiscal problem with the public finances.  If we did not have the bank crisis, if the banks and their debts were not tied to the hip of the State, as happened under the bank guarantee, we would not be in the IMF.  Yes, we would have a problem with which we would have to deal but we would be capable of dealing with it.  It is because we have the bank crisis that the first line of the IMF deal is the money from our savings, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, must now go into bailing out those toxic debts and toxic banks.</P>
        <P>In the entire reply he gave, the Taoiseach did not answer the questions I asked.  I asked him to clear up whether he did or did not talk about bank business at the dinner and on the golf course &mdash; it is a straightforward question &mdash; and to tell us what other contacts, if any, he had with that bank and its officers.  There is perhaps a more fundamental question.  We are going back over the past and the Taoiseach talked about getting to the bottom of it and wanting to tell us everything that happened about the contacts with the banks.  We asked for an inquiry into this that would include the political decision making, which we are now discussing, and the Taoiseach refused.</P>
        <P>This is a new year and we are in a terrible place with the economy.  People are being forced to emigrate, pay is being cut and families are having difficulties surviving.  Most families in this country are now dealing with survival of the business and the household.  In a new year, people want to move things on, they want to get the country working again and to get a Government that works.  They want to get back to work.</P>
        <P>Can the Taoiseach answer this question?  How long more is he going to stay in office?  How long more is his Government going to stay in office?  How long more is he going to hang on before he gives the country the opportunity to move on and solve at least some of the problems which he and his Government have created for us?</P>

	<P>Yes.  With regard to this golf outing, I know for a fact that if I could say, &ldquo;Yes, we might have discussed something at some particular hole&rdquo;, the Deputy would find that more believable than if I decided not to do so.

	<P>I am trying to deal with the pejorative innuendo that continually emanates from the questions asked by the Deputy and his vitriol against my party and against my philosophy, which is just as good and as decent as his.  So far as I recall, there was no discussion about Anglo Irish Bank, none.  I invite the Deputy to check with other people who were present and see if they back up what I am saying.  I am stating my recollection.  I did not go there for that purpose, I was not there for that purpose, I was there for a broad economic discussion.  This dinner had been arranged some months before and not as the result of a telephone call.  I had not been able to fulfil the engagement at the time it was arranged and I subsequently fulfilled it before I left office and went on to become Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about the future.  The Government and I were elected by a majority of the D&aacute;il.  We have made a decision regarding the rest of our parliamentary programme, our legislative programme.  We have to give legislative effect to the budget.  This country needs <Col N="34"/>certainty.  International and domestic investors need to know that these decisions will be given legislative effect.  Other legislation is at an advanced stage and requires to be completed because it will bring benefits to our citizens&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Government legislative programme will not be prolonged in doing so.  When the Finance Bill is concluded, we have indicated that during the course of the spring we will go to the people and put our case.  All parties can put their case although many seem to be presuming the outcome.  However, on this specific issue, on this controversy which has been created for the purpose of suggesting that I have been involved in some sort of nefarious activity that was wrong and unbecoming of a Taoiseach, I never did anything for anyone, at any time, in any ministerial office I held, for the purpose of undermining the public good, as I saw it.  I do not claim to have the monopoly of wisdom in everything I ever did in my life but every decision was motivated for that purpose, as has been the case regarding any other Deputy who held ministerial office &mdash; I have never suggested otherwise &mdash; yet this charge is daily spoken against me.  I do not consider it is necessary and the evidence does not suggest in any way that this should continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in from the Technical Group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree with his Cabinet colleague, the Green Party leader, Deputy John Gormley, that he should have revealed the details of all contacts with Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, when the issues and the questions were first put to him in the House?  Having up to that point withheld the information that he had received a telephone call from Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick on St. Patrick&rsquo;s day 2008, while in Malaysia, and also not revealing the detail of the fact that he had shared a golf outing and evening meal with him and others, in July of that same year, why did the Taoiseach think it was relevant then to make the point that he entered into a wedding reception area at the invitation of this Deputy, which I acknowledge he readily agreed to do and this was appreciated by all concerned on the day?  This is an important fact to put on the record of the House again.  However, only last Sunday, on &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; programme, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, could not finish his second sentence without repeating that clear irrelevancy.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach not accept that the offering of that information against the fact that he has withheld real, important and critical information, and has yet to shed even a scintilla of light on what it is that he may have discussed with Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick and Mr. Fintan Drury or whomever, is clearly a further Fianna F&aacute;il attempt to muddy the waters and to divert attention from the real core issues?  The Taoiseach should make no mistake about it but that the core issue is his suitability, his credibility as Taoiseach and that of this Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach not understand that it is not only a credibility deficit in terms of Opposition or the wider public but it is clearly also a credibility deficit for many of the voices on his own benches and also for the Green Party, as evidenced by yesterday&rsquo;s press conference?  There is a large credibility deficit.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy who made the approach to the Taoiseach that day &mdash; I have already acknowledged his willingness and response &mdash; I have to put the question.  We have been told the Taoiseach was in the company of Mr. Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick and his acknowledged long-time friend, <Col N="35"/>Mr. Fintan Drury.  However, thinking back to two and a half years ago when I walked into that bar, I have no information nor can I offer any factual further comments&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking questions and with the same fairness, I would hope.  Was there anyone else in the company?  It is now some time later but my recall, from trying to work my way back through that two and a half years, is that it was apparent to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Deputy go back a bit further?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;there were a number of people in the wider company and more than two.  I was not introduced to them, I did not know them personally, I had never met Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick before or since.  Those are the facts.</P>
        <P>It is important that the House knows the full truth of the matter.  For instance, was any other official of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department or any other Department or of a State agency or anybody else involved in the course of that day&rsquo;s engagement, either peripheral to the golf outing or the meal or in any casual way over the course of the day, which would be relevant to this House to know and to have an understanding of what was taking place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s first point about credibility, in doing one&rsquo;s work one meets people from all walks of life.  In July 2008 I attended a golf outing with Mr. Drury.  Mr. FitzPatrick was also there and I played a game of golf.  It is true that when we moved indoors Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in came over to speak to me.  That was a social outing.  We were joined that evening by Alan Gray, an economic consultant, Gary McGann, the chief executive of Smurfit Kappa, and my Garda driver, who also attended the lunch.  These individuals came for dinner but only three of us were on the golf course.  When Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in came over, I went to the wedding breakfast as he suggested.  The reason I said that was not to muddy the waters.  There was no suggestion of meeting surreptitiously in a corner or a room.  As the Deputy can attest, we were in the open part of the area where one is served a meal after a golf outing.  Those individuals joined us and we spent the evening there.  That was it.</P>
        <P>In regard to the second point raised by the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>

	<P>The Taoiseach has not shed a scintilla of light on what he discussed over the course of that afternoon and evening.  His denial of any mention of Anglo Irish Bank is not being bought.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, allow the Taoiseach to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if the Deputy knows the song &ldquo;Suspicious Minds&rdquo; but I cannot help him if he believes that one starts to discuss these issues when one plays a game of golf.  It was the first day off after that D&aacute;il session.  The last Cabinet meeting took place on 23 July and we probably quit on the Friday.  We met on the Monday of the following week.  I assure the Deputy it was a relaxing day and my purpose was to play a game of golf and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;shoot the breeze or talk in a social way with people with whom I was acquainted.  While it might help the Deputy to believe me if I said I discussed a lot of things <Col N="36"/>relating to Anglo Irish Bank, that did not happen.  I will not say it happened just because it might make me more plausible to him.  I have to explain it to him the way it was and that is it.  I do not want to over egg the issue but these are the facts.</P>
        <P>In regard to the question of regret, we know a lot of things have happened since then.  At no time during those contacts was I asked to do anything inappropriate by the person concerned.  I remember the telephone call as taking place on 20 March because we had finished our official engagements at that point.  I had been informed by the Governor of the Central Bank of the emerging market intelligence on the issue arising in Anglo Irish Bank regarding CFDs and the position taken by Mr. Quinn.  I was away on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, when the share price was hit very hard.  Mr. Fitzpatrick informed me about those developments.  To paraphrase, I said to him: &ldquo;Fair enough, I will talk to the Central Bank Governor and you can arrange to take it up with the appropriate authorities to see how this matter can be proceeded with from here.&rdquo;  A meeting took place the following day with the appropriate authorities in the Central Bank and it moved on from there.</P>
        <P>When I was asked specifically in the D&aacute;il about this famous dinner, I was dealing with the issues that arose in the context of the questions.  What happened in respect of that telephone call was already in the public domain.  Comments had already been made on the issue in early March.  What would presumably have emerged from the meeting was an outline for the authorities as to where they saw the thing at that stage, what was happening and what was the extent of it.  When the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, came in, as I said, I outlined that.  In July, that part of the issue had supposedly been resolved.  I am not saying it was resolved because, as we know, due diligence conducted subsequently revealed all these matters had to be investigated in terms of how that was organised.</P>
        <P>These are the facts.  I have no more knowledge than that other than what comes into the public domain or is reported to the Cabinet.  I assure the House, for the final time, that we are all in politics.  To answer the question about perception, I am acutely aware that people can draw wrong conclusions because we are in a fraught atmosphere and subsequent events occurred that were obviously projected back onto those issues.  I want to make it clear that I have always sought, to the best of my ability, to do this job in the appropriate and proper manner.  We all know right from wrong and I try to do the very best I can.  As I have said, I have never accused anyone else in any other Government of not doing the best by their own lights or doing what they think is the right thing in the circumstances.</P>

	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in may ask a brief supplementary question.  We have spent an inordinate amount of time on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the additional people who the Taoiseach acknowledged were in attendance for the evening meal, were they invited by the Taoiseach, Mr. Fitzpatrick or Mr. Drury?  Can he indicate the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> for the selection of the particular group of individuals who were not part of the golfing outing?  Is that the normal group of people with whom the Taoiseach spends social evenings?  He has to acknowledge the considerable question mark that exists in the public mind.  In July 2008, Anglo Irish Bank put together a list of ten names in an attempt to boost its collapsing share price.  Se&aacute;n Fitzpatrick has denied that he was ever exposed to the details of that list or the names involved but his successor, David Drumm, has contradicted him by stating clearly that he was fully informed about the names and the intent and purpose of the list.</P>

	<P>We have a situation whereby the outgoing chief executive and his smiled upon successor are at loggerheads.  Both of them cannot be telling the truth.  Clearly there is a major issue.</P>
        <P>I recognise that innocent situations can present in all our lives but it is stretching credibility to claim that the Taoiseach was involved in a social engagement with a key player who has been accused by his successor of not telling the truth.

	<P Just="Left">I know it is.  I suppose that is what the Deputy was sent in to say.  The point is that it is easy to throw that around but I am telling him the situation as it was.  He said he had a problem with what I had to say.  I am telling him that this is the situation.  I am aware of <Col N="38"/>the perception issue and how one might be able dress it up.  It is a political charge and the Deputy wants to continue with it and leave a suspicion that, in some way, I did something.  He cannot add it up nor can he adduce some evidence.  However, he talked about July and about this, that and the other.  He can make up a lot of dots and try to come up with a picture.  I have explained those specific issues in detail.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to 28 and 29 September 2008, which have always been the core dates in terms of the controversy, I have explained precisely the motivation, reasoning, rationale, extent and the circumstances in which we had to make decisions and why we believe the great weight of evidence subsequently adduced is greatly in our favour.  It is supported by the European Union institutions, in that all we have done has been acknowledged to be the way to try to address this problem.  It continues to be a big problem and I do not wish to suggest it is yet solved.  All of that evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Will the Taoiseach elaborate on the other invitees to his party?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That would have been organised by Fintan Drury, who organised the golf outing.  It was about being able to sit down with people at the end of the day and having a chat about the economy.  The Deputy will recall we had a mini-budget and saw recession on the horizon and a big slowdown in our economy.  As Taoiseach, I was there chatting to see if there were ideas and to find out other people&rsquo;s views of things and to see if things could be done which might be helpful.  As the Deputy will know, those people would have some views on that.  That was basically the total sum of it.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, and 147 together.</P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputies in regard to appointments I have made since I became Taoiseach in May 2008 is in the table.  In respect of vacancies, last month I signed the National Economic and Social Council (Alteration of Composition) Order 2010  facilitating changes to the structure of the NESC to reflect the inclusion of the environmental pillar into social partnership and to allow for an increase in the number of independent members to provide greater external input to the work of the council.  Following finalisation of these changes, I am now in a position to appoint a new council and I expect to do so shortly.  The majority of the membership is appointed on the basis of nominations received from social partner organisations.</P>
        <P>In addition, the National Statistics Board has one vacancy due to the departure of an Assistant Secretary from my Department.  Other than in these areas, there are no vacancies on the boards of agencies or other public service bodies for which I have Ministerial responsibility.</P>

	<P>Since the Green Party announced its decision to leave Government at the end of November, at least 35 appointments have been made by Ministers and the vast majority have been made by the leader of the Green Party, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.</P>

	<P>When to decide to go to the country, or to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s sole prerogative.  There will be much comment about appointments to vacancies.  The Taoiseach should suspend any appointments, unless they are essential to the country&rsquo;s interests, and wait until whatever Government the people decide to elect at the general election and let it get on with the business.</P>
        <P>I have to admit that Governments in which my party was involved made appointments in the hiatus between the general election held being held and a new Government being appointed.  However, given where we are and the level of cynicism about politics, unless an appointment is essential, I suggest the Taoiseach issue a directive to Ministers not to make any further appointments until the people make their decision.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to point out that some people might be in an election mode but an election has not been called.  As the Deputy said, previous Governments of all hues have filled vacancies when in office.  There is no legal compromise appointing people if the vacancies exist.  I faced a situation when I came into office in 1997 when there was the purported appointment of 24 people to health boards before the vacancies even occurred.  The vacancies arose in my term but my predecessor sought to appoint 24 people to vacancies on health boards which arose after the change of Government.  That had to be rectified.</P>
        <P>As vacancies arise, where there are competent people available to do the job and if they are needed for the purpose of proper governance of these agencies, they should and can be considered.  I take the point that we need to be mindful to ensure that when elections are called, a prudent approach is taken to these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The renewed programme for Government makes a commitment to legislate for new transparent means to make appointments.  We have discussed this here before.  In the case of important appointments, such as the chairmanships of essential State bodies and agencies, there should be some parliamentary input from an all-party committee or whatever and those being considered for serious appointments should be able to say to the committee what they have to offer from their expertise or experience.</P>
        <P>The list of legislation published by the Chief Whip does not include this.  He made the point that the list of Bills are ones likely to be considered in the remaining lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  I cannot force the Government not to make appointments but I ask the Taoiseach to be cognisant of the fact that a raft of these appointments will be coming up.  I agree that in many cases it is difficult to get good people to serve in many of these positions given all that goes on in politics.  Where serious appointments must be made, and in light of the commitment in the renewed programme for Government to legislate for this, could some contact be made with Members <Col N="42"/>of the Oireachtas to get their views on the qualifications, suitability or advantages of making a particular appointment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We must look at these matters in the future to see how best to achieve this.  We need to ensure there are people who want to serve and that they get the opportunity to put forward their case to serve.  That would be good.  On the question of suitability, Ministers must get people who they believe would be up for the job.  In many cases, they are not based on political allegiances or whatever, as is often portrayed.  It is about getting the right people for the job.</P>
        <P>On many occasions, as incoming Minister, I have reappointed people appointed by a previous Administration because they were good and I was well advised that they had made a good and strong contribution to the development of the agency or organisation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">We need to keep an open mind.  It has to be about how we build public confidence for those who are being asked to serve.  As we know, very strenuous duties of care come with membership of boards.  We need to be clear and careful that when issues of accountability need to be addressed we do so in such a way that does not mean people, who otherwise would be able to do well and fix the problem, cannot continue to contribute.  Accountability here is sometimes portrayed as, when a mistake is made it means that is it and no one is fit to serve on anything.  It is about how one deals with mistakes and errors that counts as far as I am concerned &mdash; that is the litmus test of being accountable rather than a culture of perfection, which usually ends up with no one doing anything and having a very process-driven operation without getting very much out of people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>In his reply to Deputy Kenny, the Taoiseach mentioned that a general election has not yet been called and that therefore the interregnum period between the calling of a general election and the election of whatever government arises from the general election does not arise yet.  However, in reality it does because at the moment we have an unusually long interregnum period.  The general election, in effect, has been called.  The announcement by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, that the Green Party would withdraw from government and that we would have an election called before the end of January effectively means the life of this Government is now on notice.  It is clear that members of the Government clearly believe that and we have seen a number of Ministers and Ministers of State indicate they will not stand for re-election.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In that interregnum period we need to address two issues.  The first is the administrative decisions that may be made by different organs of Government &mdash; Departments and State agencies &mdash; based on the understanding of those Departments and agencies of the policies of the current Government.  Clearly care will need to be taken that they do not anticipate or prejudice any policy changes that might be made by a new Government.  The second is the question of appointments.  We are not talking about the normal five to six weeks between the calling of a general election and the reconvening of the D&aacute;il.  In the past there have been attempts at sharp practice whereby governments of different hues have attempted to make appointments in that period.  We now have a much longer period of time and therefore a greater number of appointments that will be due to be filled.  I accept that some of those appointments are effectively nominations made by various bodies to boards of State agencies, with which there is no issue.  Some of them are discretionary appointments made by Ministers and some of those appointees may well find favour right across the House.</P><Col N="43"/>
        <P>Given the likely length of the interregnum period, would the Taoiseach agree to a mechanism that seeks to reach agreement in the House on an all-party basis about the appointments that arise between now and the reconvening of the D&aacute;il after a general election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of the interregnum period that would apply would need to be considered.  However, we can have a look at that.  I am prepared to co-operate on these sorts of matters at the appropriate time.  I do not buy into the Deputy&rsquo;s argument that it is from here on out.  Until a general election is called the Government has its duties and functions to perform.  One cannot decide that is not the case.  It is in the context of a post-general election situation, recognising the outcomes, that one tries to ensure any functions performed by the Government are consistent with a transitional period, whatever that is.  We need to be sensible about this.  The Government cannot abdicate its responsibilities and at the same time some sensible discussions could possibly take place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I take some comfort from what the Taoiseach has just said, although I am concerned that he is defining the interregnum period as just the period between the calling of the general election and the reconvening of the D&aacute;il.  In reality everybody knows the general election is going to take place &mdash; when it will take place is another day&rsquo;s work.  The phrase being used today is &ldquo;before the end of spring&rdquo;, which could be the end of April.  Last week we were led to believe it would take place by the end of March.  In December it was supposed to be the end of January.  The general election date is a moving target.  The reality is that we are in that interregnum period.</P>
        <P>I know there is always argument about what political appointments are being made, who is being appointed and so on.  However, there is also the very real issue where appointments are being made &mdash; I am thinking in particular of chairs of State bodies and so on who have a significant role to play in the running of the State apparatus.  In many cases appointments made now could last for five years &mdash; in effect, the entire lifetime of a government.  Unless we have an all-party agreement on appointments to be made between now and the reconvening of the D&aacute;il, a new government might find itself having to ask new appointees to voluntarily resign so that the new government would be in a position to make appointments.  It is undesirable that people who are now being asked to serve on boards would be put in that position by the present Government.  There is a way to avoid that by agreeing a cross-party mechanism for clearing or agreeing.  There would not be any great difficulty with nominations from designated bodies to various boards and so on.  In many cases where Ministers are exercising discretion there may be no argument and the appointee may be perfectly appropriate and agreed.  However, in cases where there is disagreement, it would be better to have that addressed on a cross-party basis rather than having appointments made that may need to be undone after the general election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No self-respecting government will cede its legitimate authority unless and until we are into a general election period.  In terms of coming to an accommodation on these matters there is a need to be sensible.  I know the Deputy might be able to say we are just lagging along here; a lot of important work has to be done.  There are four Finance Bill-related pieces of legislation and other legislation which is at an advanced stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Any excuse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  They will be done in parallel with the processing of the Finance Bill, which is the most important legislation.  If we do not have that, how do we confirm certainty for the upcoming financial year?  It is in everybody&rsquo;s interest.  Behind all the rhetoric, there is an understanding from everybody that must happen.  We would be very foolish if we did not <Col N="44"/>do that.  In the question the Deputy raises, he is going a bit far in suggesting the Government should at this stage decide it is not in a position to make decisions.</P>
        <P>I agree that we should be able to come to some mechanism that would enable us to get a greater degree of agreement when that period arrives.</P>

	<P>In October 2009, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, indicated that mechanisms would have to be found and put in place to ensure that the &ldquo;right people&rdquo; would be appointed to State boards.  We did not have long to wait to get an idea of what he was actually talking about when he referred to &ldquo;right people&rdquo; because shortly afterwards we saw the appointment of several failed local government candidates of the Green Party,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P Just="Left">We have seen another set of appointments here in the dying weeks of this Government and yet there is no indication at all that the Minister&rsquo;s suggestion about introducing mechanisms is in any way in the offing.</P>

	<P>In fact, in the revised programme for Government the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party and the Green Party have clearly committed, under the heading &ldquo;Enhancing Our Democracy and Public Services&rdquo;, to introduce on a legislative basis a more open and transparent system of appointment to State boards.  The revised programme clearly states that the legislation &ldquo;will outline a procedure for the publication of all vacancies likely to occur, invite applications from the general public and from the responses, create a panel of suitable persons for consideration of appointment&rdquo;, and it also goes on to commit to identifying the process for Oireachtas committees to also have a direct role in nominations to that panel.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The publication today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is what I am addressing.  Make no mistake, in the publication today by the Chief Whip of the so-called legislative work programme, or what is to cover for it over the remaining weeks of this D&aacute;il, this commitment to ensure that there is a more transparent, more appropriate and legislatively underpinned process for appointment to State boards does not appear.  It has gone clearly off the agenda of this Government.  Would the Taoiseach agree, having had that as a commitment in the programme for Government and in the closing weeks when he is not even going to address it at all, that truly, as was already put to him here this afternoon, he should suspend making any more appointments because the process is flawed and open to further discrediting of the political process itself in its wider understanding among the broader electorate?  The appropriate course of action at this point in time is to put a hold on any further appointments until the commitment he had in the prog<Col N="45"/>ramme for Government, which I supported, welcome and want to see implemented, is introduced by a new Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government and revised programme for Government were based on a number of issues, including the prospect of the Government completing a full term, which now, obviously, will not happen, and the prospects of completing the programme in a much shorter timeframe, as ambitious as it was, is not available to us.  Therefore, we have outlined the legislative priorities for the remainder of the term that is before us.  That is a realistic and proper way to proceed.  There are many reforming pieces of legislation that can be considered by the Oireachtas in the future.  Unfortunately, there are some which will not be completed in this term.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Ceann Comhairle the brevity issue is not a problem on my part, at least today.</P>
        <P>In the focus of the particular questions on appointments by him, would the Taoiseach respond on any vacancies that may present or are current in terms of State boards or agencies under his Department&rsquo;s aegis?  Would he agree that the appropriate course of action is to leave them on hold until such time as the opportunity arises to introduce on a legislative basis, as he proposed to do in the revised programme for Government, a new, transparent and openly public supportable process for such appointments in the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not agree with that as a matter of principle to be applied.  Boards cannot function unless they are properly constituted.  One needs a proper skills mix.  One needs to ensure that people attend in sufficient numbers and quorums are met, and business is conducted.  In many cases there are economic and other consequences, and, indeed, many social benefits, that derive as a result of the effective functioning of boards in implementing Government policy working with efficient and effective executives.</P>
        <P>As a matter of principle, apart from the practicality of the matter, it is not a good idea.  As I say, we should work in a sensible and pragmatic fashion, and in a way in which the Government is entitled and has a duty.  Not only is the Government entitled, but it has a duty to fill vacancies when they arise to ensure that statutory requirements are being adhered to and complied with.</P>

        <Quest>  the criteria for recruitment to the position of advisory counsel in the office of the Attorney General.</Quest>
        <QRef>[1133/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
        <P>Recruitment competitions for positions as advisory counsel are run by the Public Appointments Service.  For the most recent competition, in June 2008, the essential requirements for candidates were to have been called to the Bar of Ireland; since qualification, to have significant experience as a barrister practising in the State; to have an ability to analyse and advise, orally and in writing, on complex legal issues; to have a good knowledge of constitutional, European and administrative law; to have advocacy and litigation skills, sound judgment and the ability to work under pressure; and to possess the requisite knowledge and capability, including the ability to communicate effectively, to discharge the duties of the position.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Attorney General that the approach to recruitment which has consistently been taken by successive Attorneys General reflects the need of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office to have available to it the broad range of skills and expertise required to enable the Attorney General to discharge his constitutional functions as adviser of the Government in matters of law and legal opinion.  This recruitment approach ensures that the office avails of the particular skills and expertise offered by the two branches of the legal profession, namely solicitors and barristers.  The allocation of functions within the office reflects the reality that the legal profession is divided, that the two branches of the profession perform generally different functions and that both branches of the profession offer different sets of skills and expertise reflecting different systems of education and training, both of which are required by the office.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This distinction is also mirrored in restricting to solicitors recruitment to all legal positions in the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office.  Some 113 positions in the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office are restricted to solicitors while only 35 positions as advisory counsel in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, and the 14 advisory counsel seconded from that office to Departments are confined to barristers.  Positions as Parliamentary Counsel &mdash; legal drafters &mdash; in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office are open to and held by barristers and solicitors.</P><Col N="49"/>
        <P Just="Left">Under Article 30 of the Constitution the Attorney General is required to advise the Government in matters of law and legal opinion.  The current Attorney General and his predecessors believe that the constitutional obligation is best discharged by ensuring that the position of advisory counsel is occupied by lawyers who have been trained in and have significant practice and experience of conducting trials in the courts.  A core function of advisory counsel involves the handling of, and providing advice relating to, litigation against the State.  In particular, barristers, by virtue of their professional training and experience as barristers, have specialist knowledge and skills in presenting legal arguments to the courts and assessing and advising on evidential issues relating to court proceedings, and they have empirical knowledge of the multiplicity of factors that affect the outcome of litigation.</P>
        <P>Whereas advisory counsel also provide specialist advice on matters which may not involve, or have the potential to involve, litigation, it is a core function of every advisory counsel to advise on litigation and litigation-related issues.  In addition, barristers in practice give specialised legal opinions and advice and such advisory work is also a core function of advisory counsel in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  Such opinions and advice are at the request of a briefing solicitor and are sought because the solicitor recognises the special expertise of the barrister in such matters.  The fact that solicitors may be appointed judges does not mean that the role of advisory counsel should be open to solicitors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU-IMF memorandum of agreement indicates that the Government agreed to introduce legislative changes to remove restrictions to trade and competition in the sheltered sections, including the legal profession, establishing an independent regulator for the profession and implementing the recommendations of the legal costs working group and outstanding Competition Authority recommendations.  Prior to the negotiations with the EU and IMF, had the Government already decided to introduce such legislative changes?  Will the Taoiseach give us a brief summary of that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is expanding the scope of the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to check that.  What is involved is further consideration of reforms that would help in reducing professional costs in order to make the sector more efficient and effective.  I will have to get back to the Deputy on the timing of those issues.</P>

	<P>The director general and the deputy director general in the Office of the Attorney General are both advisory counsel.  How many advisory counsel are working within the Office of the Attorney General under each of the three different grades, with grade 1 as assistant secretary, grade 2 as principal officer and grade 3 as assistant principal officer?  I may have the order in reverse.  Has the Taoiseach, in his response, details of the number of people working as advisory counsel to the Attorney General in the course of carrying out of the function of legal adviser to the Cabinet?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="50"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the main body of the reply I referred to the fact that there are 35 positions as advisory counsel in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  I cannot provide specific grades if they apply but I will check that for the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach furnish that detail with regard to each of the three grades applying within the office?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask to see if the information is available and get it for the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Did the Taoiseach have his tongue in his cheek in replying to the question?  As a former solicitor, like me, did he not consider that the extent of appointments of barristers in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office over solicitors might have had something to do with the fact that the Attorney General of the State, to date, has always been a barrister?  The approach would tend to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is straying from the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">From the perspective of recruitment, there would possibly be a tendency to focus on appointments from the barrister side of the profession as opposed to the solicitor side.  Has any current assessment been done on a possible fusion of the two professions so that we could consider the possibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not contemplated by this question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There could be a united profession in this country as there is in many other countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Both sides of the legal profession come with skill sets.  As I stated, there are 113 solicitors in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and 35 advisory counsel in the Office of the Attorney General who are barristers.  For the purposes of legal drafting, traditional training would be more in line with the barrister profession than with the solicitor profession, although that is not exclusively the case.  There is a case to be made for considering some reforms in this area and making some appointments &mdash; in both directions &mdash; to assist cross-pollination. </P>
        <P>On the question of changes that need to be made and which are referred to in the EU-IMF plan, the plan indicates legislative changes that the Government will introduce to remove restrictions to trade and competition.  Details regarding the legal profession would be by way of publication of proposals that in due course would be approved by Government in this area.  The legal costs Bill will provide for better regulation of costs.  It is also intended to establish a regulator to replace the Office of the Taxing Master.  Consideration is being given in the legal costs Bill to the question generally of more independent regulation of the legal professions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In respect of the legislative programme published by the Whip, as the Taoiseach will recall, before the Christmas break interest focused on the importance of getting through the budget, in order that a signal would go out internationally that at least the big decisions had been made and, subsequently, the social welfare Bill.  Both the budget and social welfare Bill were passed and it was decided the House would return one week earlier than planned for the express purpose of dealing speedily and effectively with the finance Bill.  We now learn that the Bill will not be published until next week and will not be debated until 25 January.  The Government has suddenly gone all regulatory by having a two week break before Committee Stage and a further break before Report Stage.  The Bill will then go before the Seanad and will not be finished until towards the end of February.  The Taoiseach knows well that if the Government was serious about moving the Bill through the House in a more expeditious manner, this could be done.  Before Christmas I stated that if it wanted assistance from this side of the House, the Bill could be passed before Christmas if it was in a form that would allow that to happen.  My offer was, of course, rejected.</P>
        <P>If the finance Bill moves through Second Stage quickly and a two week break is not necessary, is the Government willing to bring it forward?  People have always objected when sufficient time was not provided for legislation.  However, much of the content of the finance Bill has been discussed and the main provisions of the budget have been introduced.  Is the Government fixed on the timescale which was laid out without consultation with the Opposition Whips?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is normal in the case of any finance Bill for the Minister for Finance to provide an indicative timeframe within which he believes his officials and the Revenue can come forward with proposals and possible amendments and Opposition amendments can be considered, etc.  Last year, the Finance Bill concluded on 6 April.  The Government, consistent with doing its work properly, is expediting the process in a sensible manner that meets the requirements of the situation and allows the finance Bill to be dealt with.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The finance Bill is only one of the legislative requirements for completing the budget process.  Budget-related legislation includes the public services pensions (single scheme) Bill, the betting (amendment) Bill &mdash; it is important to bring into effect changes in this area &mdash; and the social welfare (miscellaneous provisions) Bill.  The Minister for Finance has to deal with all of these issues and we have given an indicative timeframe only in respect of the finance Bill.</P>
        <P>Issues also arise on Committee Stage regarding civil partnership and tax provisions must come into place to reflect the coming into force of new arrangements on 1 April.  As a matter of policy, it is important that all this is done.  We are indicating in an up-front manner the requirements of the situation.  Considerable work needs to be done.  The NAMA (amendment) Bill also has to be introduced  in the first quarter as part of the implementation of the EU-IMF programme.  The Whip and Government have sought to outline and indicate what the legislative programme will look like for the purposes of dealing with the issues at hand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislative programme produced by the Whip appears to be more rushed than those to which we are accustomed.  We are used to having them provided in different colours of paper &mdash; blue, red and green &mdash; and with the A, B, C and D lists to which Deputy Durkan frequently refers.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I can provide the A, B and C lists if the Deputy wishes.  The only problem is it keeps me here until 1 o&rsquo;clock every Wednesday.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach is being up-front today.  However, although nobody seems to want the Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill 2010, it is being rammed through the House for the gratification of the absent Green Party Ministers.  The Climate Change Response Bill, which is now the big issue for the Green Party, was the subject of discussion at an all-party committee.  What the Government is doing in this respect is attempting, through legislation, to make guidelines binding targets to which any future Government can be held to legal account.  We have never measured up to any of the targets or guidelines agreed either in the Kyoto Protocol or since and here we have absent Ministers seeking to force the issue.  While we agree with the Bill in principle, it is poor form to force through legislation that makes guidelines or targets legally binding on a future Government which may be held to account in a court of law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same issue, the Government has published the Climate Change Response Bill which the Green Party has been promoting.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue is related to a Bill that is included in the legislative programme for this session.  Will the Government proceed with the Bill and, if so, will the Fianna F&aacute;il Party support it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is being introduced in the Seanad today.  While I did not hear directly what Deputy Fahey said, he made the point on the basis of being able to call the election at an appropriate time.  As a Government, we are setting out a substantive legislative programme for the greater part of this session.  This work needs to be completed and runs in parallel with an expeditious conducting of the finance Bill.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I explained, we have to do this work.  The NAMA (amendment) Bill must be enacted under the IMF-EU programme by the end of the first quarter.  The Oireachtas has responsibilities which it must discharge in the interests of the people.  An election will be called at some point in the spring.  Everyone would regard that as a responsible and sensible arrangement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Before Christmas, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government called a press conference and told the country it was important the general election be held soon.  He gave the reasons for this.  He said the Green Party would remain in government to see the budget through and the general election would be called before the end of January.  It is open to interpretation whether he meant that the election would take place before the end of January or the dissolution would take place before the end of January.  That issue is not at stake.  The intention was that the budget would be announced, the finance Bill would be published and debated in the D&aacute;il and a general election called before the end of January.  When the Government announced we were returning on 12 January, it was expected <Col N="53"/>that this was in pursuit of that objective.  The expectation was that we would take two to three weeks to pass the finance Bill and the general election would then be called.  Since then, we have been told there are four Bills that must be dealt with in order to give effect to budgetary measures.</P>
        <P>On top of that, the Taoiseach says we must pass the NAMA Bill because it is required by the EU-IMF agreement.  As I read the agreement, one can argue that any item of legislation the Government wants to pick from the legislative programme can be justified as being necessary and required by the EU-IMF agreement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This is all about promised legislation.  On top of that, we are told there are a few sweeteners to keep the Green Party firmly in the pocket of Fianna F&aacute;il and to stop them from squeaking.  The Climate Change Response Bill and the Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill will be taken.  On top of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore must find another way to deal with this.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>This is the way.  I am entitled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am raising questions and making a point about the legislative programme the Government published today.  In addition to the Bills I referred to, the Government has found a number of additional items of legislation about which it showed very little enthusiasm for the past three years.  However, if it is going to prolong the pathetic life of this Government and allow it to continue in office for longer than the people want, it is quite happy to go along with it.  According to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, we were going to have an election before the end of January.  The end of January then did not mean the end of January and was adjusted to include the finance Bill so that the election might be in February or March.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore is abusing the normal arrangements on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, was on the radio saying it will take place at the end of March and now it may be April.  Then there will be Easter, after that there will be the royal wedding, the Queen&rsquo;s visit and any excuse to keep Fianna F&aacute;il in office.  This will not be acceptable.</P>

	<P>We accept that the House is back and there is an expectation to deal with the finance Bill but if the Taoiseach thinks he can include items of legislation here and there and find some justification or extenuating reason to link it to the budget and the EU-IMF deal and hold on in the hope that something will turn up, he has another thing coming.  The Labour Party will not accept that.</P><Col N="54"/>
        <P>What is the timetable?  When does the Taoiseach expect the finance Bill will be enacted and when will the D&aacute;il be dissolved so that we will have the general election the Minister told us we would have before the end of January?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a wonderful flight of rhetoric.  To bring Deputy Gilmore back to the facts, the budget must be enacted to give legislative effect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>This is a process that will be undertaken.  Those Bills will be taken when we are dealing with the finance Bill, which was completed last year on 6 April.  The indicative timeframe at the moment is the end of February.  Whether it is the end of February or the first week of March is a matter to be decided in terms of what work must be done.  I have indicated that work must be done on civil partnerships to bring them into line with tax requirements by 1 April.  As a matter of policy, that work must be done.  It is being done and the finance Bill will be enacted at least one month sooner than was the case last year.  Deputy Gilmore has been coming into this House for the past two years quite rightly asking about Bills.  We are now in the process of finalising legislation and we should use the time available to us to do so.</P>

	<P>The published, so-called legislative work programme &mdash; although I am not sure how to describe the document published by the Chief Whip &mdash; indicates a number of items of legislation in respect of which the Government partners are committed to full enactment.  It only refers to a specific number of those: the finance Bill, the public service pensions Bill, the betting (amendment) Bill and the social welfare (miscellaneous provisions) Bill.  Everything is predicated on how long the D&aacute;il will proceed.  If, as the opening remarks of the Taoiseach indicate, we are to arrive at the NAMA (amendment) Bill, which the Taoiseach is strongly of a mind to pass, that is not what the document states.  It appears the Government partners are only agreed on a specific number.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can clarify this point.  Nowhere in this document does it state the publication date of the finance Bill.  It is not included in the missive from Deputy Curran.  Can the Taoiseach tell us when the finance Bill will be published?  When will the social welfare (miscellaneous provisions) Bill be published?  Last week, Deputy Sargent published a Bill to amend the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>With regard to the announcement by the Chief Whip of the focused legislative work programme for publication and enactment, what is the position of the legislation to facilitate the forthcoming constitutional amendment on children&rsquo;s rights?  The Minister of State with responsibility for children indicated on a number of public occasions during the recess that it was his hope and that of the Government &mdash; indeed, the objective of the Government &mdash; that the referendum would take place in conjunction with the general election.  The omission of the facilitating legislation from the work programme is disappointing.  Is it the intention of the Government to proceed with the referendum to amend the Constitution to enshrine a greater corpus of children&rsquo;s rights?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, will consult with spokespersons on the opposite side regarding a wording which has been approved by the Government for the purpose of engaging in such consultation, and convey the results to the Government.  Much excellent work has been done over the last two and a half years.  The proposal introduced by the Minister of State is a substantial piece of work and will <Col N="56"/>be welcomed by those who see it.  After consultation with the spokespersons, we will determine the approach to be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Government not have any timescale in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We intend to bring it to the attention of spokespersons.  It was brought to the Government this week and it is now a matter for the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I say that because I read that the Minister of State, on behalf of the Government, was seeking consultation.  As somebody who might expect to be involved in such consultation, I can say that on no occasion has any member of the Government, let alone the Minister of State with responsibility for children, been in contact with me, although he may wish to tell the national media otherwise.  I have heard nothing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, the all-party Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children did a lot of work on this, and the Minister of State responsible has introduced what I believe is a good proposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which has been approved by the Government and will now be the subject of discussion with party spokespersons.  I am not saying the spokespersons were consulted during the course of the work that was done within the Government, but the Minister of State will talk to them and others about it now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify a matter to do with the legislative work programme, which was raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  It is curious that the first page of the legislative programme states: &ldquo;The Government partners are committed to the full enactment of the Finance Bill and other budget related pieces of legislation including the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) Bill, the Betting (Amendment) Bill and the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill&rdquo;.  I presume that means that these measures are to go ahead and that there is a full commitment to them.  However, it seems there is not a similar full commitment to the other Bills mentioned in the programme.  Are the other Bills temporarily being proposed as items that might or might not be dealt with?  I ask the Taoiseach to explain why the commitment to these Bills is less than full.</P>
        <P>I refer the Taoiseach to No. 81 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper, the Twenty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2011.  A reference was made to this earlier but the Taoiseach did not respond to it.  This Bill, published by Deputy Sargent, is a proposed constitutional amendment on economic treason.  As I understand it, it is published on behalf of the Green Party, including the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who is not Sherlock Holmes but behaves more like Inspector Clouseau.  Have the Green Party Members asked in Cabinet that time be given for this Bill, and will the Government make time available?  Are the Taoiseach and his colleagues aware that the passing of the Bill would leave every current member of Cabinet, their predecessors back to 2002, and every D&aacute;il Deputy who supported the Government&rsquo;s economic policy liable, if such a referendum were successful, to criminal charges of economic treason?  Does the Taoiseach have a view of that?  I heard the Taoiseach complaining about Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s use of this term, but it seems that Deputy Sargent, a former Minister and leader of the Green Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We will let it rest for a moment.  I am sure the Taoiseach will respond.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="57"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is quite happy to incorporate it into legislation, and apparently he is supported by the rest of the Green Party Members.  Could the Taoiseach explain what this Bill is doing on the Order Paper?  Have the Green Party Members asked that priority be given to this measure?  If not, could he explain to the House why it has been published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a priority in the legislative work programme.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Bills mentioned in the work programme, the Chief Whip mentioned in the first paragraph that the Government was &ldquo;setting out our legislative priorities for publication and enactment in advance of the election later in the spring&rdquo;.  He was simply pointing out that priority is being given to the finance Bill and related legislation.  The programme also lists the Bills that have commenced their passage through the House, some of them at advanced Stages, those that have already been published, and those whose publication is expected.  The list is not exhaustive.  The intention is clear with regard to enacting the legislation in the timeframes we have set out.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>

Other urgent Bills have been put through the House in 24 hours, although I am not suggesting that the finance Bill should be treated in such a fashion.  We have offered the Government additional days in the D&aacute;il in order to pass the Bill quickly but it seems, as Deputy Gilmore has said, that we will have every bit of legislation possible, including the regulation of tiddlywinks in Ballymagash, to delay the ultimate fall of the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The VHI has given both the Government and the people of the country a slap in the face.  Despite the introduction of a levy to support it, which raised the cost of insurance for all those insured under the age of 55, it has now promised an increase of 45% in the cost of some health insurance plans.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>On promised legislation.  This is the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about pending legislation, although &ldquo;pending&rdquo; is the operative word, because this legislation has been required since the inept risk equalisation legislation fell in the courts in 2008.  We were promised that risk equalisation would be introduced within three years, but the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moloney, told us on the airwaves only last week that it would be another two years.  Risk equalisation is extant in other jurisdictions; we do not need to re-invent the wheel.  When will the risk equalisation legislation come before the House?  Does the Government have any plans to ensure people are protected from the outrageous hikes in VHI premiums?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is because the Government has delayed the introduction of proper legislation on risk equalisation for more than two and a half years that elderly people who have paid into the VHI all their lives are now finding that their premiums have increased by up to 45%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made her point.  We are inquiring about the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Taoiseach tell the House what progress has been made in those two and a half years in drafting proper legislation on risk equalisation?  It should not take that length of time.  That is the reason elderly people are now being asked to pay increased premiums.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.  The so-called simple little problem raised by the Supreme Court was in fact the transfer of money, which is a big problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Two and a half years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Other issues were also raised by the court, although they were not part of its judgment and no opinions were given.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It has been suggested that there is just one little problem that needed to be resolved, and which should have been resolved in the last year or two.  However, to bring forward the legislative proposal would probably involve a further court challenge by competitors in the market and put us in the precisely the same position we were in already.  We devised a tax-based solution in terms of the levy taxed at source, which was increased before Christmas from 50% to 65%.  It increases the subsidy from young lives to older lives where the differential between the cost of plans between younger and older lives is attributed for the older person by 65% of the difference being provided for by the younger life.  To do that in a way that did not attract a challenge was an important innovation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the commercial freedom of the VHI, it was that organisation&rsquo;s decision to increase these fees.  It was not a matter for the Government to deal with in that sense.  The VHI had the authority to do that.  The purpose is to set up help lines with the HIA to ensure that people get an opportunity and are made aware how they can transfer if they so wish.  They have an entitlement to similar plans to those they already have under the VHI, which would help to reduce costs.  Some 62% of all subscribers are with the VHI and 80% of those are elderly.  The <Col N="59"/>VHI lost &euro;172 million last year and to avoid trading recklessly, the board has had to take its decisions.</P>
        <P>We must ensure that the spread of risk is facilitated by reason of the fact that there is a legal entitlement for people to have the same entitlements they have under the VHI plans elsewhere if they are getting a more competitive rate.  That will help initially but the introduction of risk equalisation, which requires EU approval to come in by 2013, is the way forward.  Legislation will be introduced during the course of this year to try to give it some transitional effect in 2012.  We have set that out as the policy objective since May last year.</P>
      </Speaker>

One page lists legislation to be published, including the environmental protection Bill.  The word &ldquo;published&rdquo; appears in graphic, bold print.

I thought the new year would start on a better note, but my questions have been refused in the usual format, which states that &ldquo;the Minister has no responsibility to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in these matters&rdquo;.  I have received two such questions from the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office today.  I do not want to go into the details, or have coffee and a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with him.

	<P>Given the Taoiseach&rsquo;s stated objective of running useful legislation in tandem with the finance Bill and related legislative provisions which must be enacted before the Government decides to dissolve the D&aacute;il, did the Cabinet not consider dealing with the code of practice for the retail and grocery sector?  It seems the consultation process that was established to agree a voluntary code has run aground.

      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 6 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 4, lines 4 and 5, to delete &ldquo;a fine not exceeding &euro;400&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a class E fine&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These amendments arise from the new classification system introduced by Part 2 of the Fines Act 2010 in the case of fines for summary offences.  Henceforth, fines will no longer be expressed in monetary amounts in the case of summary offences but will instead be referred to by class.  The Fines Act established five classes, from A to E.  Each class has a ceiling, for example, class E relates to fines not exceeding &euro;500, class D covers fines not exceeding &euro;1,000, and so on.  The classification system relates to fines not exceeding &euro;500,000, the maximum amount that may be imposed on summary conviction.</P>
        <P>The Fines Act provides that all legislation enacted after the commencement of Part 2 must use the classifications in that Part wherever fines are provided for in respect of any summary offences.  Part 2 was commenced with effect on 4 January and the requirement to use classifications rather than the maximum monetary amounts therefore applies to this Bill.  The purpose of these amendments is to replace the amounts currently indicated with references to the corresponding classes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 1 relates to the maximum fine proposed in section 2 in cases where there is a conviction for begging.  It does not alter the part of the penalty which stipulates that the person may additionally, or as an alternative, be sentenced to up to one month&rsquo;s imprisonment. <Col N="64"/> The maximum fine originally proposed was &euro;400, which is a class E fine.  Similarly, amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 6 amend sections 3, 4 and 6, respectively.  The offence under section 3 arises where there is a failure to comply with a direction to cease begging and to move from the area.  A maximum fine of &euro;300 had been proposed, which is a class E fine under the new classification.  In section 4 a maximum fine of &euro;200 was proposed in regard to the offence of failing to give a name and address or giving false information, which is also a class E fine.  In section 6, which concerns the offence of living off the proceeds of begging, a maximum fine of &euro;5,000 is replaced by a reference to a class A fine.</P>
        <P>As a result of these amendments, we are, for the first time in Irish legislation, setting fines by reference to class rather than monetary amount.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his clarification of these amendments.  Fine Gael has no objection to the proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a great deal of discussion in the House today about what legislation may be enacted in the lifetime of the Government.  Looking at the Government&rsquo;s press release, it is difficult to assent to the proposition that a Bill on begging should be a priority given the other matters and challenges that confront the country.  Having said that, I have no objection to the Minister&rsquo;s amendments.  They are necessary in order to bring the legislation into line with the Fines Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason this Bill was mentioned in the Chief Whip&rsquo;s press release is that it is one of the Bills which is nearing completion in the House.  Equally so, it is a fairly simply Bill but one with an important effect.  Given the High Court decision in the Dillon case some years ago, which set down the parameters for the law and for the constitutional constraints that exist in this regard, the Oireachtas was obliged to set down those parameters and to produce this legislation.  Some have argued it does not go far enough while others say it goes too far.  I am confident it represents a balanced approach.</P>
        <P>It is incorrect to suggest that there is somehow a skewing of priorities at play.  As a Dublin representative, Deputy Rabbitte knows this is an important issue and that action has been called for by representatives of traders, particularly in Dublin&rsquo;s city centre, for a long time.  However, it is equally an issue in my own town and in towns throughout the State.  A great deal of time was taken up by this issue on Joe Duffy&rsquo;s popular radio programme in recent days.  It is important that we pass the legislation as soon as possible.  These amendments marry the Bill with provisions of the Fines Act, the relevant portion of which was commenced on 4 January.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to hear the Minister is listening to Joe Duffy&rsquo;s radio programme.  If he does so consistently he will find a great many other issues are raised on that programme which warrant legislation.  However, let us be grateful for small mercies.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 6, to delete lines 19 to 21 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These amendments increase the penalties for offences under section 5, which creates an offence of organised begging.  Persons being prosecuted under the section may be proceeded against summarily or on indictment.  Subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) deals with summary proceedings.  It originally proposed maximum penalties of up to six months&rsquo; imprisonment or a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or both.</P>
        <P>We had a discussion on Committee Stage about these penalties and the question of aligning them with the penalties provided for in the event of a conviction for an offence under section 6, that is, living off the proceeds of begging, that offence also being a summary one.  I undertook to reflect further on this matter.  Following a thorough examination of the matter, I am satisfied it is appropriate to increase the penalties.  Amendment No. 4, therefore, increases the penalty from a maximum of six months&rsquo; imprisonment to 12 months&rsquo; imprisonment.  The fine is also to be increased to a maximum of &euro;5,000 but, due to the commencement of Part 2 of the Fines Act, which we have just discussed, it is necessary, since the offence is a summary offence, to express the fine as a class A fine.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage, we also discussed the penalties in cases where there is a conviction on indictment under subsection (2)(<i>b</i>), particularly the level of the fine.  Currently, the Bill provides for a maximum fine of &euro;50,000, or up to five years&rsquo; imprisonment, or both.  Following further consideration, I am satisfied the fine should be increased significantly in light of the dangerous and sinister activities of those who organise and direct begging.  Such activity is very lucrative.  We are entitled to take these factors into account in setting the penalty and, therefore, I propose a maximum fine of &euro;200,000.  That, together with the potential sentence of up to five years&rsquo; imprisonment, provides the clearest signal to those involved in or contemplating operating an organised begging operation in this State that we regard this type of organised crime as being just as unacceptable as any other form of organised crime.  These new penalties will act as a deterrent to anyone planning such activity.</P>
        <P>I listened to the arguments of both sides of the House on this issue and accept we should send out a very strong signal.  The biggest problem with begging in this country is the strong possibility that it is being organised not necessarily by large organised criminal gangs, but by a number of individuals.  On Joe Duffy&rsquo;s show this week, at least one listener who rang in indi<Col N="66"/>cated clearly that there are people who deliver people to city and town centres with a view to having them beg and to taking the proceeds from them when they have finished.  Most public representatives would be aware of the phenomenon.  It is important that we respond to it.  We had discussions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the matter.  While the Garda is not substantially worried about the matter, it is important that we send out a very strong signal to those who are organising begging on a large scale or living substantially off the proceeds of begging.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very ironic that we are dealing with this legislation when the IMF is in town and the State itself is looking for assistance.  We had our own begging bowl out.  The week in which we discussed this legislation on Committee Stage was the week the IMF came to town, despite the fact that it was said by certain individuals that it was not coming.</P>
        <P>Begging is associated with poverty, homelessness and the need for access to social services.  The Government would be best to consider why people end up begging.   I welcome the two amendments because I raised this issue on Committee Stage.  There are criminal gangs directing the most vulnerable people in society to beg and organising begging.  I welcome the amendments and certainly support them.  They encompass what I was trying to achieve in my amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept there is a qualitative difference between the ordinary, everyday beggar on the street and one who is organising begging and living off the proceeds of begging by some of the more unfortunate citizens and individuals who may not be citizens of this State.  I accept there is a distinction to be drawn between pimping on the misfortune of people at the bottom of the ladder in society and the activity of the common or garden everyday beggar on the street.</P>
        <P>The Minister warned us at the time of the taking of the Estimates about where more severe penalties and mandatory sentencing are landing us in terms of the acute problem in our prisons.  I would have thought these amendments would only be justifiable if the Minister had hard evidence that there are organised begging rackets in this country.  I confess ignorance of the phenomenon.  I do not confess ignorance of begging as one only has to walk outside this House of Parliament to witness begging by unfortunate citizens and others.  However, I do not know or did not know that there are criminals in this country exploiting people by way of setting them about begging.  I am open to persuasion based on information the Minister and his agents may have.  Is profiteering of the kind in question achievable from begging?  It is scarcely like pimping and prostitution, which undoubtedly constitute a lucrative business in this country.  We briefly touched on this matter on the Order of Business.  From the way I read the statement of the Minister in that regard and from the way it was presented in the paper of record, I believed he had committed to publishing legislation to criminalise the purchase of sex.  I ask him to permit us to read the outcome of the study of the Dignity project.  A number of individuals are anxious to see the evidence for proceeding to deal with what is undoubtedly a very serious matter in this State.  What evidence has the Minister to suggest we have a serious problem owing to individuals, irrespective of nationality, organising begging?  I have some difficulty in believing organising beggars on the streets of Dublin, Ennis or Dundalk is a meritorious enterprise.</P>
        <P>It is ironic that Deputy Joe Carey should mention the fact that we have handed over our economic sovereignty to the IMF.  The iconic photograph that was published on the front page of the <i>Financial Times</i> will forever be the epitaph of this Government&rsquo;s period in office.  I do not know whether the photograph was staged.  It depicted a beggar thrusting his begging bowl towards Mr. Chopra of the IMF and his colleagues from the ECB.  The photograph brought <Col N="67"/>home to Irish people in a most dramatic way the implications of what has happened and what has contributed to their humiliation over the pass to which we have been brought.  The analogy used by Deputy Joe Carey is useful.</P>
        <P>I am prepared to assent to the amendments before the House if the Minister can demonstrate his reason for increasing the penalties contained within the original Bill.  There is no point in us talking tough in the House if there is not a real problem.  The figures shown to me yesterday indicated that the increase in committals between 2008 and 2009 of persons serving three months or less was 63%.  These are the Prison Service&rsquo;s figures.  Every Deputy will appreciate that this situation cannot continue.  I am not saying that the offence in question is a minor one.  I draw a distinction between the poor unfortunate citizen who for whatever reason finds himself or herself begging on a street or the appalling sight of children begging and the Minister&rsquo;s claim of people profiteering and exploiting the phenomenon.  If the latter is the case, it should be addressed, but we should respond in a proportionate and balanced way that is based on evidence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In principle, I am in favour of changing the law regarding prostitution and of moving in the direction recently indicated.  I have stated this in reply to parliamentary questions.  I was encouraging of the visit by the Dignity Project.  Some officials from our human trafficking unit also visited Sweden to review its experience since changing the law more than a decade ago.  However, there is a difference.  While Sweden experienced a dramatic decreasein prostitution on open streets, there has not been as much of that trade on Irish streets in recent years.  In principle, the Oireachtas should consider the matter in the coming years as well as the constitutionality of any change.  For this reason, it has been sent to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Rabbitte knows, there is no exact parallel.  However, there are some parallels between the issues of street prostitution and street begging.  The 2007 Dillon case clearly set down strict parameters as to why the legislation cannot ban begging, namely, freedom of communication, freedom of expression, freedom of congregation and the other human freedoms built into the Constitution.  As much as possible, the Bill will set down legislation within the parameters outlined by the Dillon case.  As I stated on Committee Stage, we examined the possibility of appealing the case to the Supreme Court.  On the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice, it was believed that the High Court&rsquo;s judgment was correct.  We have gone as far as we can with this legislation.</P>
        <P>Regarding organised begging, the Garda does not allocate resources to investigating activities that are not currently offences, so there is no official evidence in respect of begging.  However, we asked the Garda to give us indications.  I am not referring to an organised collection of data.  I will give an example from this document.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">A member in a large rural town stated that in his view Roma Gypsy women and children are being dropped off in various urban centres around the country on a daily basis for the purpose of begging.  They are then collected at the end of the day with their &ldquo;takings&rdquo;.  The member welcomes the proposed legislation to deal with begging.  He further states that the begging activity engaged by the Roma Gypsy network is also, at times, accompanied by young children.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">A Chief Superintendent whose area covers South Dublin states that there is evidence of organised begging.  An example of this occurred over the summer months at a Church.  Local Garda&iacute; observed a group of up to five foreign nationals (all adults) gathering each Sunday morning at mass times in the vicinity of the church.</P><Col N="68"/>
        <P LI="1" el="0">These persons would sit at each of the entrances to the church begging.  Garda&iacute; used their powers under the Public Order Act, 1994 to move them on, where applicable, but they were limited in how they could follow up the matter owing to the lack of legislation regarding begging.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Another example states: &ldquo;In January 2010 a Chief Superintendent for a Division covering the Inner City tasked the crime prevention unit with putting in place an operation to establish to what extent begging was organised and if there was evidence of directing and living off the earnings of begging activity.&rdquo;  According to this document:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">A total of 172 incidents and intelligence reports were recorded.  Initially the majority of these incidents were recorded against members of the Roma Gypsy community.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Examination of these reports showed that organised or planned begging was attributable to begging by individual family members of the Roma Gypsy Community only.  These people were mostly female and they belonged to different Roma families.  It appeared that identified families had established their own specific begging beats and they strictly adhered to those areas.  From surveillance carried out these females were clearly observed handing over the proceeds of their begging activities to a family head, usually the father or grandfather.  It was subsequently discovered that this handing over of monies was in part due to the fear of their money being confiscated by the courts or Garda&iacute; when arrested.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The families were also observed assembling on a daily basis with family leaders directing the women to their optimum begging locations.  Together with the above (collecting of monies) this constitutes a form of organised begging.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Another Chief Superintendent for Dublin states that there is one continuing occurrence of begging which could be interpreted as &ldquo;organised begging&rdquo;.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">This incident occurs every Saturday and Sunday along a busy road.  These individuals will enter traffic which has stopped at the red lights and beg for money or attempt to wash car windows in return for money.  Some members of this family can be quite forceful and Garda Stations receive a number of complaints in relation to same.  These individuals move on when approached by a Garda however they return when Garda&iacute; have left the area.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">There are no incidents of begging recorded on PULSE for this area to date in 2010, however there are 11 incidents of Traffic Endangerment.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This last point is because the begging in question is not an offence as such because the legislation was knocked down in 2007.  According to the document, the 11 incidents of traffic endangerment:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0" el="5">relate to foreign nationals walking through moving traffic on the road attempting to beg.  There are also 681 Public Order Incidents recorded on PULSE for this District to date in 2010, a handful of which relate to foreign nationals begging who have failed to comply with Section 8 of the Public Order Act 1994.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">While &ldquo;organised begging&rdquo; is not an issue in a district covering a North Dublin suburb, members attached to the District Detective Office have been in regular contact with members of the Romanian Community who engage in the act of begging in Dublin City Centre on a daily basis.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This contact was made as part of an investigation into a particular murder in 2009.  The document continues: &ldquo;Further intelligence gathered suggested that members of the Romanian Com<Col N="69"/>munity operated as an organised begging ring in the Dublin City Centre area&rdquo;.  While the Garda does not have official figures, it is accepted that there is a substantial element of people living off the proceeds of organised begging on a relatively small scale.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Perhaps with tongue in cheek, the Deputies equate this to the deal with the International Monetary Fund and the EU.  I do not accept that we have given up sovereignty through the deal.  One cannot equate the two issues.  Equally, without that deal we would not be able to fund this country.  The majority of that money was obtained by this country to ensure we can continue to have the services our people desire.  It goes back to our problem, irrespective of who is on this side of the House, that we are spending more than we are taking in and as a result we must borrow or reduce services.  It is far better to borrow the money from the IMF and the EU than to go into the market like Portugal did today to pay 6.7%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the logic of the Bill, although I did not get the opportunity to attend the debate on Committee Stage.  I have been aware for many years of organised begging; it is not a new phenomenon.  Having said that, there are many other laws that could deal with this sort of organised begging.  Given the scale of the problems we face economically, the urgency of this Bill is hard to understand.</P>
        <P>There is organised begging, and I have seen it myself in Dublin and heard of it from people in other large towns.  I take the Minister at his word that this legislation will not be used to harass those who are down on their luck and who are begging in the streets because they are in genuine dire straits, or to harass buskers, but that it will be used by the garda&iacute; to target those who intimidate people going about their daily business, particularly those who are abusing children.  That is a key element; many of those ferried into towns and cities are children and child abuse and public order legislation should be used to address the problem.  Even the Road Safety Act could be used to prevent these activities.</P>
        <P>In view of the organised begging, people who genuinely wish to help those in need have stopped providing donations of money and food to those down on their luck.  Genuine cases of hardship are suffering because the unscrupulous are trying to make a trade of begging.  I would prefer to see a situation where we did not have begging and people were not down on their luck but we seem to be able to pass laws on begging while we cannot lock up those who have defrauded the people of billions.  There is proportionality involved and this legislation is ironic when we consider there will be increases in the numbers suffering hardship and who will end up begging due to the policies of this Government.</P>
        <P>There are also those who do not want to see the consequences of the collapse of the economy, who do not want to see people begging in the streets.  That has always been the case and it is shameful that a country might think the poor would be better hidden away.  There are those who would like to criminalise the poor and the display of poverty.  They would do better to concentrate on the criminalisation of poverty and making it illegal for people to made so poor.</P>
        <P>I support the Bill on the understanding that it is intended to address the problem of organised begging.  I have heard of older people being genuinely afraid to withdraw money from ATMs because of the activities organised in the fashion outlined by the Minister on Second Stage.  I am sceptical because many laws have been passed in this House with one specific intention that end up being used for a different purpose later on.  I appeal that this law be only used in the circumstances set out, to tackle the odious trade of organised begging, where people profiteer on the good will of the Irish people, because Irish people have been very generous to those down on their luck here and abroad.  We do not want anyone to prey on that and that is what organised begging leads to.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I mentioned prostitution because there is an analogy, as the Minister accepts, with the Dillon case.  The Opposition tabled an amendment that would have criminalised the purchase of sex when the Human Trafficking Bill or the first version of the Immigration Bill was proceeding through the House.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor opposed the amendment and while I do not want to misrepresent him as saying it could not be done, he said it should not be done and seemed to believe there were constitutional obstacles in the way.  I raise that because people have been in touch with me to ask if the present Minister, Deputy Ahern, meant what he was reported as saying he meant in <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
        <P>I heard the remarks made by the Minister and by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh about organised begging.  I do not know what Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has in his arsenal to adduce in support of his case but if the Minister was before a judge, he would not have compelling evidence.  He started out by saying there is no official evidence before quoting from individual senior garda&iacute;.  Both he and Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh may be right but I do not know enough about this.  Is the Roma Gypsy issue cultural or is it organised begging?  I agree with the Minister that traffic endangerment is involved, I have personally experienced it, and there is no doubt members of the Roma community congregate and beg.  I would like to know, however, and we have a lot of information about immigration these days, if this is cultural or organised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One cannot help but be struck by the irony that we are legislating for beggars while our laws are inadequate when it comes to dealing with those bankers who beggared the country and its people.  The only reason there has not been more progress and that the Director of Corporate Enforcement has not brought the cases to a conclusion is that, I suspect, our law is defective.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to open a debate with the Minister about the IMF but we are not in the IMF and subject to the rescue package because our fiscal balance is out of kilter.   We would have been able to handle fiscal correction. It is the fact that the banks have beggared us on top of that and it is this that has us in the hands of the IMF.  There is some irony at this critical juncture in politics that we are legislating to cope with beggars on the street but the bankers, who have beggared the country, seem to be able to transfer their assets to their spouses and seem to be able to escape with impunity.  This is what is driving much of the anger in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept there is anger and there are none more angry than members of the Cabinet who have had to deal with this issue over the past two and a half years.  I do not accept that the laws are inadequate.  The problem, as always, is to obtain proof on the offences on the Statute Book.  Last May I requested the Garda Commissioner, in light of the investigations into Anglo Irish Bank and associated issues, to propose suggested amendments to legislation and to tell us if, in his view, there was an inadequacy in the law.  His response now forms part of the criminal procedure (white collar crime) Bill which is part of the Chief Whip&rsquo;s announcement and it is intended to publish the Bill towards the end of this month and to have it passed before the D&aacute;il rises.  We also liaised with the Director of Public Prosecutions with regard to the Bill but they are reasonably small changes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe it is accepted we have sufficient laws to bring those people to court who, beyond all reasonable doubt, committed crimes.  Ultimately, this will depend on the DPP&rsquo;s independent assessment of the evidence.  It all boils down to evidence.  I refer to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s point that this Bill should not be used as a sledgehammer.  It is a proportionate response to the parameters laid down by the Dillon case which stated that every individual under the Constitution has a right of expression and a right of communication and that to prevent this by banning begging would be flying against the Constitution.</P><Col N="71"/>
        <P>On the question of begging, leaving aside the offences of organised begging and living off the proceeds of begging, general begging is banned and is a criminal offence when carried on in the vicinity of ATMs and business premises.  This begging is intimidating and a nuisance to individuals.  Before a prosecution can be taken, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has to work within the provisions.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">We should favourably consider a change in the law on prostitution.  I have asked the Attorney General to examine the report and I have requested his views on the legal and constitutional implications of introducing such a ban.  I have no difficulty in publishing the report once the Attorney General has examined it.  From my knowledge of the law, there may very well be constitutional impediments to a complete ban.  I am also somewhat reluctant to try to cure a problem and create another problem by bringing in a total ban which would make prostitution go more underground. There is a school of thought that a ban would do this, given the circumstances in this country.  In principle, if I continue in this job and if there is an opportunity to look at the Dignity report before the Government falls, I would like to bring forward legislation in this area.</P>

I have heard many Ministers down the years give commitments in the House about what they intended but this does not count for very much if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the day decides to use this legislation against the common or garden beggar or somebody playing music in Grafton Street, for instance.

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael proposed this motion in recognition of the hardship that has been caused by water restrictions and disruptions during the recent cold weather.  Our outdated and inefficient way of dealing with these problems contributed to this social and economic hardship.  The lack of water conservation measures allows too much water to escape from an inadequate network of pipes.  When we previously raised this issue in January 2010, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicated that he intended to take action to remedy the problems but no new initiative has been introduced since then.  In preparing the motion, I had an opportunity to review the debate between Fine Gael Members and the Minister on similar issues resulting from last winter&rsquo;s flooding and severe weather.  The Minister indicated then that he would reallocate resources to deal with water conservation and unidentified leaks.  Given that he made the same statement on this occasion, I presume the &euro;300 million he proposes to spend is the same money he announced 12 months ago.</P>
        <P>These problems have been coming down the tracks for quite some time but there has been no planning on the part of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to deal with them.  We have experienced several harsh winters, the likes of which many younger people have not previously witnessed.  The shoddy workmanship during the building boom of the Celtic tiger era has been exposed by these recent weather patterns.  It is now evident that the quality of building materials and our pipe network, as well as the supervision of workmanship under the building regulations, is inadequate and caused unnecessary hardship.</P>
        <P>People are increasingly becoming accustomed to the notion that water is a finite resource that cannot be taken for granted.  In the past, people left taps running, washed their cars or allowed water to flow indiscriminately around their properties.  The State can no longer fund inadequate conservation of water by businesses and households.  In the Dublin region alone, considerable planning will be required to develop a more certain supply of water from the River Shannon to cope with the inability of the eastern region to guarantee the water supplies needed to underpin future economic development.  It is unacceptable that water supplies have not yet been restored to certain parts of Dublin city and elsewhere in the country three weeks after the crisis arose.  The Minister and his Department have clearly failed to work with local authorities to plan for this issue.</P>
        <P>Local authorities&rsquo; outdoor staff have gone beyond the call of duty over the past several weeks in order to help local communities.  They came out on Christmas Day to restore water supplies for vulnerable people.  They are to be praised and lauded for the work they have done in appalling conditions.  That, however, should not allow us to forget that leadership is required from the Department if we are to restore water supplies within a reasonable timeframe.  We should be able to learn lessons from the past two winters of severe cold weather.  The Minister has not learned anything from the winter of 2009-10 because he has not implemented any new initiative that would deal with the problems arising this winter.  I suppose we will see action eventually.</P><Col N="74"/>
        <P>Fine Gael put forward proposals 18 months ago to set out a new way of dealing with capacity issues and meeting our obligations under the water framework directive in order to avoid fines for poor water quality.  Sewerage treatment plants cannot be allowed to continue pouring waste materials into our streams and rivers.  Local authorities and the Department have failed to ensure good quality ground water and allowed this type of indiscriminate release of waste.  A different approach is required to the current structure of 34 separate entities if we are to meet our obligations under the directive.  We must acknowledge that the current way of doing business is not providing good quality supplies of water to the citizens and businesses of this country.  The Government has belatedly acknowledged this problem in so far as it is mentioned in the memorandum of understanding between Ireland, the IMF and the EU.  We will be required to attract investment into the water services programme.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposals have, therefore, been favoured by the Government, the IMF and the EU.</P>
        <P>However, the question that arises is when the Minister will finally come to the same conclusion.  He alleges that we will privatise water supplies.  I assure the House this is far from our intention.  We want to keep the pipe network in public ownership because we are well aware of what happened to telecommunications when Eircom was ravaged by investors to the detriment of the citizen and the service.  The company&rsquo;s failure to implement the promises made before its privatisation was due to a failure of regulation.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael wants to restore good quality and consistent water supplies.  Much of the water pipe network dates back to the Victorian era and will have to be renovated or replaced.  Considerable infrastructural investment will be required if we are to modernise our systems and it will be a challenge for any future Government to provide the necessary resources over the coming years.  We have identified funds from the NPRF and private sources that can be invested in a new semi-State entity called Irish water, with local authorities acting as agents in providing an essential part of our infrastructure.  If we do not have good quality telecommunications services, transport networks and water systems, we will not be able to provide a good quality of life to our citizens or a business environment that provides employment.</P>
        <P>I regret that the Government will be proposing an amendment to this motion because it was tabled with the intention of providing a constructive opportunity for agreement on a policy that has been forced on us by the IMF and the EU.  For political reasons, the Minister was unable to allow the House to show unity on the provision of good quality water through prioritised investment over the coming years.  Given that establishing a single publicly owned water utility company is now Government policy, I cannot understand why he cannot accept our proposal.  A new utilities commission would merge existing regulators, of which, God knows, we have a lot even if some of them forgot to regulate in the past.  We would support the Government if it took responsibility for regulating a new water utility regime.  We would investigate the ways resources could be allocated in such a way that would meet the immediate demands of the citizen in terms of restoration of water supply and having a good quality supply while also eliminating unidentified leaks.</P>
        <P>Water conservation measures have been successful in parts of Dublin but have not been as successful in other parts of the country given the figures produced showing that, on average, 43% of water escapes into the ground in unidentified leaks.  That has been going on for a long time.  Therefore, one must question how the resources which have been allocated in the past have been deployed and have had such poor effect, especially outside Dublin, in identifying leaks and implementing water conservation measures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have tabled this motion to highlight the difficulties the citizen has had this winter.  People have had the same problems in the previous winter but the Minister for the Environment, <Col N="75"/>Heritage and Local Government does not seem to have a plan as to how we will minimise the impact on citizens and businesses over the next few years.  It seems clear that we will have the same difficult winter conditions for the foreseeable future and we must be able to plan effectively for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is disappointing the Minister is not in the House considering the water crisis we have had again this winter following on from a different type of water crisis last winter which was caused by flooding.  Again our water infrastructure has been exposed for what it is &mdash; outdated, inadequate and broken.  Our management of water delivery systems has also been again exposed as inadequate for the country&rsquo;s needs.</P>
        <P>What Fine Gael is trying to do is to put forward a solution rather than beat the Government over the head for the lack of reform it has introduced in its decade or so in government.  We have been putting forward this solution for almost two years.  We agree with the Minister that we need to invest significant sums of money upgrading a totally out of date water pipeline infrastructure of 25,000 km because at least 40% of it is not fit for purpose.  The proof of that is that almost 50% of water in many counties leaks through the pipes into the ground before it gets to its destination.  That figure has increased following the two extremely cold spells we have had.  When people on radio, television and elsewhere say that supplies of water cannot meet demand, what they are saying is that part of that demand is water leaking through pipes into the ground.  It is not to people&rsquo;s homes or businesses.  A significant portion of demand for water usage, which costs us all a fortune to produce, simply leaks into the ground.  That is a waste this country can no longer afford and it is also resulting in people&rsquo;s water being turned off while we try to contain the level of leakage in cities such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway and in many rural areas.</P>
        <P>We agree with the Minister that we need to spend considerable sums of money and we need to find ways to finance upgrading the infrastructure over time.  We also agree with the Minister that we should put in place domestic water meters as part of that process.  What we do not agree with the Minister on is how he proposes to do that, which is to put more taxpayers&rsquo; money into a management system which is neither working nor delivering.  We are financing water delivery to 4 million people through 34 local authorities.  How can it make sense to use 34 agencies to deliver water to a population which is the same as that in a reasonably sized European city?  It makes no sense and as a result when we have a crisis, nobody takes charge or responsibility.  There was a crisis in Northern Ireland and the chief executive officer of the company involved had to resign.  We had just as big a crisis here but nobody resigned because nobody was in charge.</P>
        <P>Some 34 county and city managers take responsibility for their own patch.  Many of the water engineers and managers in local authorities are doing a really good job considering what they have been asked to deal with.  However, one cannot have a national response to a water crisis if one asks 34 agencies to respond in their own patches without having co-ordination between all those agencies.  It cannot be done.  There is duplication and wastage and it does not work.</P>
        <P>The country cannot afford the &euro;2.8 billion the Government proposes to spend over the next three years on water infrastructure.  We do not have it and we cannot borrow it, so we need to find new ways to finance this infrastructure, to put in place a national water strategy and to deliver water in a co-ordinated way through one entity.  Fine Gael proposes to set up a new State company to build a new water infrastructure which we would finance through commercial borrowing and supplement it by raising money through the National Pensions Reserve Fund and selling certain State assets to help the capital expenditure programme.  That is realistic and costed and it makes sense.</P><Col N="76"/>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot understand why the Minister does not agree with that constructive suggestion.  The excuse or reason he gives for not agreeing with it is absolutely farcical.  He says he cannot agree with what Fine Gael is saying because it is the thin end of the wedge to privatising our water networks.  What a load of nonsense.  If that was the case, we would never have set up a State company to roll out telecommunications infrastructure when that was needed.  We would not have set up ESB when we needed to roll out electricity infrastructure when that was needed.  We would not have set up Bord G&aacute;is when we needed to roll out gas pipelines across the country to deliver gas to towns and cities.</P>
        <P>Just because one proposes a State owned company to operate on a commercial basis does not mean one wants to sell it.  Water infrastructure is a strategic State asset which Fine Gael in government will hold on to.  However, we want to manage, develop and invest in it in a commercial way which makes sense.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We want to reshape the way in which we pay for water.  Currently, we spend approximately &euro;1.2 billion per year through capital and current expenditure to provide clean drinking water and 40% to 50% of the water leaks through the pipes.  People can do the sums for themselves as to just how much wastage there is.  Anybody who thinks water is free because a lot of rain happens to fall in Ireland is deluding themselves.  Each time somebody turns on the tap to fill up a glass, it costs the State almost as much as it would cost Ballygowan if it was to give one the water for free in a Ballygowan bottle.  In some cases, it probably costs the State more because it needs to treat and transport the water along a long broken pipeline infrastructure to get it to the tap.  The same applies each time one flushes the toilet.  One uses approximately ten litres of water each time one flushes the toilet.  There are 1 million people in Dublin.  How much water do they flush down the toilet?  How much money and State funds do we flush down the toilet each day?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have an insane approach to water management, delivery, conservation and valuation.  Fine Gael will change that in government by putting in place a commercial entity to manage a water network and to bring large amounts of water from parts of the country which have excessive amounts of fresh water which can be treated for parts of the country which are short of water, such as Dublin.  When we wanted to put a national motorway in place efficiently, we set up the National Roads Authority to do it because we could not do so through all the local authorities.  We need to do the same now with water.</P>
        <P>We agree that we need to introduce domestic water meters and we will grasp the difficult political nettle of proposing water charges in the future, but only if we put in an efficient delivery system that ensures homeowners are only paying for the cost of the water they use and not the tens of thousands of litres of water that leaks through the pipes every day on the way to people&rsquo;s homes, which would be an unreasonable request.</P>
        <P>We will be up-front in telling homeowners that the taxpayer will continue to pay the majority of the cost of delivering water to their homes.  People will be given a free quota of water based on the average daily usage per person, but if they go above that average on the user pays principle, the more water they use the more they pay.  People who wash their cars, sprinkle their lawns or have swimming pools will need to incur the cost of that rather than asking the taxpayer to do so, which continues the fallacy that somehow water is free in Ireland; it is not.  We have a broken infrastructure that we need to fix.  We have a way of fixing it through a State-owned company that can manage, develop and plan for an efficient treatment and delivery system for water and the Government should listen to our proposal.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="77"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree entirely with my colleagues&rsquo; proposal.  I have been around this House for a long time and have been involved with group water schemes for many years.  Can one imagine a system that tries to deliver treated water to every house in the country?  It all needs to be treated and the cost of treatment is extremely high.  As that water flows along the pipe, half of it is lost before it reaches the house.  It is one thing to pump raw water into a house, but it is another matter altogether to pump in all the treated water with 50% of it being lost.  One can see straightaway that this is out of all proportion from an economic point of view.</P>
        <P>From an engineering point of view, there is no problem.  It was possible to put water into houses 100 years ago.  Let us consider what Tr&oacute;caire is doing in sub-Saharan areas with the money donated from Ireland.  However, successive Governments have taken their eye off the ball.  It is not possible to expect a pipe laid in 1960 to be an efficient carrier of water today.  Of course it will burst somewhere and that is what has happened.  With pumps the pressure had to be increased dramatically, which immediately blew the pipes out of the ground.</P>
        <P>Against that background what has been said here this evening is that we need to get an overall semi-State utility organisation so that all 34 local authorities will be singing from the same hymn sheet.  In several locations there was plenty of water on the Roscommon side of the Galway border but it could not be delivered to Galway because another local authority was involved.  They would not allow it to cross the border.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have seen it many times.  I have seen a ludicrous situation whereby people within ten miles of Ballinasloe only had their water restored yesterday.  In some of the new housing developments &mdash; some of which are now under the remit of NAMA &mdash; the pipes burst and the council engineers had no alternative but to fix them to allow the water to flow out into the countryside, which gives an idea of the horrendous trouble the people on the ground had.  I attach no blame to them; they did the best they could.  The provision of water is one of the most important aspects of family, development etc.  Somebody took their eye off the ball.  Fine Gael is advocating installing a meter is outside every house, which will conserve water in itself.  However, the pipes are so bad at the moment they could not take a meter in several places and that issue also needs to be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the motion to the House.  Flushing toilets would not be my favourite subject, if I had to pick a topic.  Some people say a lot of rubbish is spoken in this House, but a lot of sense comes from this side of the House.  I do not know if there is a prism somewhere in the vicinity of the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s chair, but when it filters through that prism very little seems to get through to the Government.</P>
        <P>I commend Deputy Hogan on proposing this policy.  Regardless of what body is established to manage water, there needs to be accountability.  This time last year we wanted the NRA to centralise salt supplies.  When we had the centralisation of salt supplies this winter the NRA would not give it to the local authorities to grit the secondary roads.  What good is faith without good works?  What good is responsibility without accountability?</P>
        <P>I commend the great work carried out by local authority workers.  Many houses and public buildings suffered considerable damage during the period.  Every household should have a simple mechanism for turning off the water.  The vast majority of people do not know how and where to turn off their water.  All public buildings should have a switch.  I know of schools that were destroyed with ceilings collapsing over the period.  If they had a little switch at the door, when they are heading off for the Christmas holidays they could knock it off and thereby save considerable Exchequer funding on repairs.</P><Col N="78"/>
        <P>Shortly in Government we hope to introduce proposals to install a mechanism allowing the water to be heated to deal with a decrease in temperature.  I understand it costs &euro;70 or &euro;80 to install such a mechanism, which would alleviate considerable difficulties.</P>
        <P>I heard Deputy Connaughton suggest that there should be a water meter outside every house.  I would argue that there should be a water meter inside every house because at the moment water meters are outside business premises and the owners will not pay their water charges because they have no confidence in the mechanism of charging.  They do not know where the leak is &mdash; if there is a leak; and they do not know how to read the water meter &mdash; people will not go out on their hands and knees with a torch lifting up a manhole on the side of the road shining down the torch trying to work out what is beneath them.  Why can we not have meters in the house as we have ESB meters?</P>
        <P>Without a system in which people have confidence, they will not pay their bills.  Every local authority should hold seminars outlining to people in business how they are charged for water and how they can check if they have a leak.  Various private enterprises installed meters a short while ago and most businesspeople do not really care about it.  They do not want to know about it because ultimately they feel they will not be pursued by the local authority because the system is chaotic, which needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Unlike our colleagues in Connacht, in Leinster we are very generous.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows we supply water from Wicklow to Dublin and we get lots in return from the capital &mdash; we get a lot of its waste back in return.  We take that and we are glad to take it.  The water systems in Wicklow that supply Dublin are in danger of collapse.  They have been in place since the 1860s or 1870s and considerable funding is required to get them up to scratch.  I commend the motion to the House and I hope the next Government will introduce the measures outlined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak tonight.  I commend Deputy Hogan on tabling this timely motion.  The importance of running water to hundreds of thousands of householders was brought home to them over the Christmas period.  I am attached to a local group water scheme and was without water for eight days.  It was not just householders, as farmers and businesses were also badly affected; that period was a nightmare for many people.  As other speakers have said, the problem was compounded by a Third World mains infrastructure system.  Much of the antiquated system is more than 30 years old and is unable to cope with the number of houses built over the Celtic tiger period.  I commend the local authorities on the work they did and in particular Clare County Council in my constituency and the local fire service which mobilised water tankers and set up standpipes in the affected areas.  That was done very quickly and these people are to be commended for this.  Throughout the holiday period local authorities had to deal with thousands of leaks and it put considerable pressure on local authorities.  I am told that in Ennis alone there were 360 breaks since St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day in one small area, which shows the extent of the problem.  A significant number of businesses now find themselves in dire straits as a result of the bad business trading period before and after Christmas.  While I am here, I appeal to local authorities to be flexible in dealing with the rate bills of these businesses which had to close during the period because of water shortages.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to highlight one area in my constituency.  Last year we had the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, down to open the Ennis augmentation plant, on which more than &euro;10 million was spent.  In the treatment plant in Castle Lake and Sixmilebridge, which supplies the water to a considerable catchment area stretching <Col N="79"/>from Kilkishen, Sixmilebridge and Shannon Airport, there is a problem at present.  The obvious solution is to upgrade the Sixmilebridge plant and feed the water into Ennis, three quarters of the pipework has been already done and a new reservoir needs to be built in the Ballybeg area which would help alleviate the low pressure which residents living in that area must endure.</P>
        <P>We need to take a more integrated approach to our water distribution network.  We need direct connections.  I commend Deputy Hogan&rsquo;s motion on setting up a State-owned water authority to co-ordinate the water networks in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the many conditions of the IMF was, under the heading of infrastructure, that the Government would carry out an assessment of the transfer of responsibility for our water service provision from the local authorities to a national utility and would prepare proposals for implementation with a view to start charging by 2012-13, and this assessment was to be completed by the end of this year.  What progress has been made on that?  That time line is not a mere suggestion we might consider at some stage.  This is a mandatory requirement because it is a precondition to the introduction of the universal water charging system.  Without it, we will not meet the fiscal targets and if we do not meet the fiscal targets, there will be no IMF money.  We do not have much choice about this.  This is to what the Government has signed up.  As other countries, which have been forced to go to the IMF for funding, have found out, the IMF does not hang around waiting for countries to make up their minds.  If there is any dragging of feet, the IMF comes in and forces the issue.  The IMF will bring in, as it has done in countries in South America, large international water providers such as Veolia Water and Anglian Water.  I do not want that to happen here.</P>
        <P>We have a plentiful supply of water.  It is a basic, plentiful natural resource, albeit that we have woefully mismanaged and abused it.  It is a resource which we certainly should be capable of harnessing, managing and conserving in our national interests.  The Fine Gael NewERA policy is the way to go.  The notion of a national utility, as opposed to the 34 local authorities of which we spoke earlier, is exactly what the IMF is recommending.  It is not just the IMF recommendation.  It is also international best practice that there should be a single provider.</P>
        <P>At least here in Dublin there is a high degree of co-operation between the four Dublin local authorities.  Even so, we are inefficient because we are drawing water from outside our catchment which is not best practice.  Ideally, for efficient management and distribution, the water source should be the centre of one&rsquo;s catchment.  The same applies throughout the country.  We are taking water from Wicklow and, as time goes by, we will go even further to remote areas to get our water.  Ideally, everybody should draw from either the same source, or at least a limited number of sources, instead of  the 34 local authorities and various schemes all seeking to provide their own water sources and their own distribution networks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The tragedy, which others have mentioned, is that during the Celtic tiger years the Government did not make an investment in the collection, storage and distribution of water.  My own area of the south side of Dublin and a great proportion of Dublin city centre gets its main supply from the Victorian network which is collapsing.  The local authorities are making valiant efforts to try to hold it together but we need total replacement of the system.  The result is that on many occasions Ireland is like a Third World country, unable to guarantee a water supply to homes, businesses, restaurants and hotels.  I hear the Government boasting that we are building a smart economy.  It is laughable to speak of building a smart economy when we cannot guarantee a supply of water to our taps.  There is one pharmaceutical company in Dublin that uses the same amount of water, and pays for it &mdash; I am not complaining about the company which provides many jobs &mdash; as the entire city of Cork.  If another similar company wanted to set up in Ireland, we would have to turn it away.  This is not just a conservation or a fiscal issue, it is a jobs issue.  I recommend the motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am delighted the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has come to the House because I am anxious about a number of places in Tipperary that need investment before he leaves office.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I will start by mentioning places such as Mullinahone and Drangan.  The Burncourt water scheme has been dragging on for ever so long.  Some progress has been made, but I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the people of Mullinahone who have endured a very bad water supply.  There is a need for new pipes to be laid and a entirely new system between Burncourt and Drangan and the Fethard area.  I hope the Minister will sort out that before he leaves office.</P>
        <P>I am sure nearly every person in the country was affected over Christmas by difficulties with the water supply.  It brings home to us the need for change and why we, the people and local authorities must learn from this.  That is why the Fine Gael motion tonight is timely.  I commend our spokesman on the environment, Deputy Hogan, on giving us an opportunity to speak on this.</P>
        <P>The reality is that 43% is a significant amount of water to waste nationally out of our pipes before it gets to the homes, the farms, the hotels and wherever it is needed.  We are losing that amount of water.  We saw the pipes breaking down in mile after mile of road over the Christmas period.  Nobody could stand over such a system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the local authority workers who went out in the freezing cold and the wet and who often had water sprayed into their faces.  They had to endure difficult circumstances and they worked hard for long hours.  If the Minister were to ask any one of those who were down the holes trying to fix the pipes what is needed, he would be told the entire system needs to be changed.  The way local authorities go about their business needs to change.  What my party is proposing is the best way forward.  Taking the NRA and the way it dealt with the roads as an example, if there were a single agency to deal with our water system there would be a far better supply to consumers.  If a system such as this were put in place, it would attract a great deal of industry to the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have read the amendment into the record.  Let me start by saying that I am in agreement with Fine Gael on at least two factors.  First, I share the Fine Gael concerns about difficulties &mdash; in some cases severe difficulties &mdash; that the recent disruptions to water supplies have caused for families, businesses and the farming community, particularly during the festive season and following on from very harsh weather conditions in the lead-up to Christmas.  It is only when supply is disrupted that the importance of this service is fully brought home to us.</P>
        <P>Before I go into more detail on the background to this problem, the steps taken to deal with it in the short term and the longer term plans for rehabilitating defective water mains and modernising the water sector, I want to place on the record of this House my gratitude for the efforts of local authority staff and their contractors in responding to the situation as quickly as possible in what were exceptionally challenging circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister left out the following sentence in the script.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The last five weeks of 2010 saw unprecedented severe weather across the country.  Spells of exceptionally cold weather brought home the real difficulties we must <Col N="82"/>face during such weathers, and we experienced some of the lowest temperatures ever recorded in Ireland, together with heavy snowfalls in places.  Temperatures remained below zero for nine consecutive days in some inland areas.  Many records for low temperatures were broken on the nights of 24 December and 25 December.  There was a dramatic change over the Christmas period and a rapid change to milder weather during St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day and the following day, Monday, 27 December.  An overall change of on average 20 degrees Celsius over a 24 to 36 hour period was experienced. This led to a very rapid thaw in most areas of the country, with most of the snow melted in the southern half of the country by Tuesday and the thaw taking effective hold over the rest of the country by Wednesday, 29 December.</P>
        <P>The very rapid thaw caused movement in the ground which led to pipes bursting.  This occurred not only in public mains but also at the point of consumer connections to mains and on consumer service pipes.  In addition to finding and fixing leaks on the public networks, many authorities had to assist in fixing consumer side leakage or disconnect properties in order to protect the overall network and restore supply to the wider community as well as making alternative supplies by standpipes or tankers where necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Significant evidence of leakage on private property was found in the greater Dublin area, necessitating a number of disconnections of private properties.  The number of these disconnections in the greater Dublin area exceeded the number of required repairs to connections between public mains and consumer supplies.  Outside of the greater Dublin area, the indications from local authorities are that the leaks were predominantly found at connection points to the network, with one third of the problems on the consumer side.  Nationwide, over 2,500 unattended properties had to be disconnected due to leakage on the consumer side.</P>
        <P>Almost 3,400 local authority staff and their contractors were involved over the period since 26 December in finding and fixing these leaks.  Some 250,000 person hours of work were involved over the period. Many of those people had also been involved in the run-up to Christmas in responding to the severe weather.  Workers who had salted and gritted roads during some of the most severe weather on record in this country then drove tankers to ensure that people had adequate access to drinking water.  Staff in the water services area in local authorities were willingly assisted by roads, housing and other support staff in a combined effort which is the hallmark of public service.  I commend them for their commitment and wholeheartedly thank these workers on behalf of the Government for their efforts.</P>
        <P>As a result of this work, progressive improvements were made on a daily basis throughout the period so that restrictions could be reduced and eliminated in many places.  This work continues and some restrictions continue to apply to ensure reservoirs are replenished to normal levels.  It is important to highlight that this response was part of the wider response to the severe weather, which has involved many statutory, voluntary and private bodies.  The close co-operation at local level of these groups and their participation in the national severe weather co-ordination group has ensured a focused response to the extreme conditions.</P>
        <P>This did not happen without appropriate planning.  Lessons have been learned from weather events in 2009 and earlier in 2010.  With water services, local authorities put in place contingency arrangements before Christmas in the light of the anticipated thaw.  This included demand management measures to seek to reduce demand and replenish reservoirs during the period of freezing weather, mainly through pressure reductions and night-time restrictions.  In addition, authorities ensured that staff would be available throughout the Christmas and new year periods to manage production, find and fix leaks, provide alternative supplies through tankers and standpipes and provide information through websites and other media outlets.  It was important to communicate with large numbers of people through various media.</P><Col N="83"/>
        <P>Once the thaw took hold and leaks began to appear, local authorities immediately mobilised response crews to deal with the affected areas.  The overall response at national level to the severe weather and to the disruptions to water supply is already being reviewed by my Department and the other Departments and agencies involved; we will learn from the experience and further develop our response mechanisms.</P>
        <P>The second point on which I am in agreement with Fine Gael is the need for substantial investment in water services.  However, the party is very much a late convert to this position and to the importance of enhancing our water infrastructure.  Since entering Government, I have made water infrastructure a priority and as a result ensured record investment in our infrastructure.  Since taking office, the investment has averaged in the region of &euro;500 million a year, and a high level of investment has been maintained in 2011 despite the downturn in our economy. We have had a legacy of historical underinvestment, a legacy that Fine Gael showed little interest in addressing when it had the opportunity in Government.  The party, in its motion, is also conveniently ignoring the strategies now in place to radically transform the sector in the coming years.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a very diverse water supply system, with over 950 public supplies producing some 1,600 million litres of water daily through a network of 25,000 km of pipes.  The extent of burst water mains places a particular focus on the vulnerability of the Irish water distribution system, in particular given its age, the high levels of leakage in the system and the lack of investment historically in mains rehabilitation.  Water is a precious resource, with costs associated with both treatment and distribution.</P>
        <P>While one might accept that larger networks have greater inherent risks in terms of leakage, the levels of unaccounted for water in the Irish network are completely unacceptable.  Improvements have been made in the Dublin area, with unaccounted for water reducing from some 42% to closer to 30%, but many other areas have rates of more than 50%.  From both an economic and environmental perspective, there must be a strong focus on addressing leakage in our water systems given the increased demands for water, greater pressures on raw water and more stringent drinking water standards.  This is being addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The focus of investment over recent years has been on investing to ensure compliance with the European directives on drinking water standards and urban waste water discharges and improving water supply to keep pace with population and economic needs.  More than &euro;5 billion in Exchequer resources was introduced between 2000 and 2010 in water services infrastructure.  This investment has been complemented by local authorities&rsquo; own resources to bring total expenditure to more than &euro;6 billion over the period in question.  Under the water services investment programme, 476 major public water and waste water contracts and schemes were completed in the period 2000 to 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the beginning of the decade of the programme, there were two paramount challenges for the water services sector.  First, there were drinking water quality issues in a number of supplies, predominantly in the group water sector where there were unacceptability high incidences of e.coli detection.  As a result, the European Court of Justice found Ireland in breach of its obligations under the waste water treatment directive on secondary waste water treatment at the beginning of 2000.  As a result of the Exchequer investment of &euro;2.8 billion in waste water infrastructure over the ten years since 2000, compliance with the EU waste water treatment directive on secondary treatment stood at 92% by the end of 2009.  This investment has also led to an increase in secondary waste water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.7 million in the same period.</P>
        <P>This investment has been accompanied by a range of measures to support a radical transformation of water services in recent years.  This has included the passage of the Water Services <Col N="84"/>Act 2007 which provides a modern and comprehensive legislative framework for the delivery of water services, consolidating more than a century of legislation relating to water and waste water services.</P>
        <P>In addition to the substantial Exchequer investment in drinking water infrastructure, the Government also put in place a comprehensive regulatory framework for the monitoring of drinking water supplies.  The European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations 2007 prescribe quality standards to be applied as well as supervision and enforcement procedures for drinking water.  The regulations provided for enhanced supervision and enforcement of drinking water provision and assigned the Environmental Protection Agency responsibility for the supervision of public water supplies and the local authorities responsibility for the supervision of all other water supplies within their functional area.</P>
        <P>We have also enhanced the regulatory framework for waste water services.  The Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations 2007 provide for the authorisation by the Environmental Protection Agency of discharges from local authority waste water treatment works and collection systems that are released to all types of receiving waters.  The EPA, in considering applications for authorisations, can stipulate conditions to ensure compliance with standards for various substances and conformity with obligations under a number of EU environmental directives.  It can periodically review discharge authorisations granted and failure by local authorities to comply with conditions attaching to an authorisation will be an offence.  The agency, local authorities and my Department are working together to continually improve the quality of the services being provided to consumers.  This collaborative approach has contributed greatly to improvements in the quality of our water resources.</P>
        <P>The other marked change in recent years has been the move to a river basin catchment approach to water resource management.  The adoption of river basin management plans last year marked an important step in the implementation of the EU water framework directive and provides the strategic direction for much of our future actions and investment in the sector.  Continued investment in the sector is required to ensure the progress made is consolidated and plans for future improvements implemented.  A greater proportion of investment in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 will be dedicated to improving water supply infrastructure with water conservation being accorded top priority.</P>
        <P>The publication of the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 followed on from a root and branch review of water services capital investment.  This included a review of all projects included in the previous programme which had not substantially advanced to ensure the contracts and schemes to proceed were fully aligned with key programme economic and environmental priorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 2010-12 programme sets out an expanded investment in critical mains rehabilitation with contracts with a value of some &euro;320 million set to commence over the period of the programme.  This is more than double the investment of &euro;130 million in water conservation measures in the period 2003 to 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Expenditure to date on water conservation outside Dublin has largely been in technology-based water management systems.  These systems proved invaluable during the recent difficulties both in managing production and providing data to assist in leak detection.  The data from these systems provide the platform for the development of mains rehabilitation strategies to guide critical mains rehabilitation whereby water distribution pipelines are relined or replaced and ensure that the greatest water savings result from such investment.  While the Dublin authorities' programme of rehabilitation is the most advanced, other authorities were <Col N="85"/>finalising their programmes of works during 2010 to allow for contract commencements this year.</P>
        <P>The investment of &euro;435 million in water services in 2011 under this programme will, in addition to prioritising water conservation, allow for the progression of priority contracts for expansion of supply or the improvement of security of supply in a number of hubs and gateways.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that sustained investment in line with that envisaged in the water services investment programme could reduce the rate of unaccounted for water by 10% nationwide by 2016.  In addition, I have placed particular emphasis on the training of water services personnel by making available a dedicated funding stream in 2010.  Through this fund, some 500 days of training on leakage detection were provided in 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Investment and training can only do so much.  How we use water also needs to be addressed and water charges based on usage have a major part to play in this regard.  My Department is finalising proposals to give effect to the Government decision to introduce water charges in a way that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied.  The national recovery plan proposes that the introduction of water charges for domestic customers would be preceded by the commencement of a national metering programme, which will be funded by the National Pensions Reserve Fund, to install meters in households connected to the public water supply.  While the metering programme is likely to take a number of years to complete, the objective is that it will be substantially advanced over the next three years.  My Department is analysing the various options to ensure the delivery of the metering programme in the most cost-effective manner.</P>
        <P>The installation of water meters in households connected to public supplies will encourage householders to conserve water and result in savings in the significant operational costs faced by local authorities in providing water and waste water services.  It will also complement the significant increases in investment on water conservation measures in the water services investment programme.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The Government recognises that a crucial element of implementing this initiative will be the appointment of a water regulator.  It is intended that the water regulator would be responsible for the economic regulation of water services to both the non-domestic sector and the domestic sector.  Independent regulation will ensure greater transparency and fairness in water pricing for both sectors and provide that charges can be clearly linked to the delivery of a reliable and good quality service.  In addition to overseeing the rates of water charges, the water regulator will also be responsible for establishing standards for service delivery and performance.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Consideration is being given to assigning the responsibility for regulation of the water sector to an existing regulatory body, although a final decision has not yet been taken on this matter.</P>
      
        <P>Notwithstanding the efforts of the local authorities in quickly dealing with the disruptions to water supply, and the difficulties experienced by the national water authority in Northern Ireland, the Fine Gael motion still envisages the consolidation of water maintenance functions under one single national authority as originally proposed in the NewERA document published last year.  This ignores the fact that our capacity to quickly respond and deal with the water supply disruptions over the past few weeks has been due in large part to local authorities being able to mobilise resources locally to deal with local problems.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael said earlier that it does not want to privatise but it is fair to say that the party says a number of things.  Looking at the NewERA document in greater detail, there is reference to <Col N="86"/>the water company investing &ldquo;an additional &euro;250 million on fixing or replacing leaking water pipes&rdquo;.  The Government has already committed &euro;320 million to do the same thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the same &euro;320 million as last year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We are spending an unprecedented amount of money and I hope Deputy Hogan appreciates it.  The Fine Gael NewERA document also refers to its plan to &ldquo;facilitate more rapid urban development when the property market recovers by investing an additional &euro;1 billion in extra water delivery and waste water infrastructure for high density urban residential and commercial development, with a particular focus on NSS hubs and gateways&rdquo;.  This Government carried out a root and branch review of the water services investment programme in 2010 and has already committed to advancing 100 water and wastewater contracts in the greater Dublin area and in the national spatial strategy gateways and hubs to the value of almost &euro;800 million in addition to water conservation measures in all of these areas.</P>
        <P>The NewERA document also refers to a plan to &ldquo;ease the cost burden on Irish businesses by delivering economies of scale in the costs of operating and upgrading Ireland&rsquo;s water infrastructure (by putting the water operations and investments of the 34 local authorities under one roof) and by spreading the cost of water investment over 30 years&rdquo;.  The Government recognises the importance of ensuring a good quality, reliable and competitively priced water service is provided to all consumers and the appointment of an economic regulator, which we are proposing, will be a key factor in ensuring this.</P>

        <P>Economies of scale and value for money have been key determinants of project development processes as evidenced through the bundling of projects and the use of public private partnership arrangements through design, build and operate contracts.</P>
        <P>Finally, the NewERA document states that the Irish water company will provide security of supply for drinking water by providing for greater interconnection of water supplies.  The Dublin area water supply, which accounts for over one third of all water produced in Ireland, already has a very high degree of interconnection and co-ordinated management, serving a population of approximately 1.4 million across seven authorities.  There are appropriate connections in other cities and a number of the contracts and schemes included in the water services investment programme 2010-12 are designed to further improve security of supply.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>What is of most concern about the Fine Gael proposal for establishing a national water company is the lack of evidence or research to back up its approach to the proposed centralisation of water functions.  Admittedly, several policy reports and publications have recommended structural reforms for the delivery of water services.  The reports of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes and of the high level group on green enterprise both recommended the establishment of a national water authority, while a regional or river basin approach to water services was recommended by the local government efficiency review group and in the OECD environmental performance review of Ireland.</P>
        <P>While the Government has not ruled out assessing the need for and role of a national water authority, unlike Fine Gael it will consider this issue on an informed basis.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department will shortly be initiating an independent assessment of the transfer of responsibility for water services provision from the 34 county and city councils to a national water authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>That sounds familiar, it sounds very like Fine Gael policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This assessment will be completed by the end of this year, probably just in time for Deputy Hogan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gormley will not be around, although the way the Government is going, he might be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is intended that the assessment will review the existing structures for the delivery of water services and will determine the most effective structures for delivering high quality, competitively priced water services to customers and for infrastructure provision.  The review of the current delivery structures will include an examination of the performance of local authorities in recent years in the provision of water services and will determine whether the existing structures are the most efficient and effective for the delivery and operation of water services.</P>
        <P>The assessment will also have regard to other structural reforms that are ongoing, including the establishment of the regulator for water, the introduction of metered water charges, the implementation of the recommendations of the local government efficiency review group and of the value for money study of the water services investment programme as well as the structures necessary for the implementation of the river basin management plans.</P><Col N="88"/>
        <P>The Government is committed to continued high levels of investment in water services.  This investment is informed by a clear strategy that prioritises water conservation, improvement in water quality and provision of capacity to facilitate enterprise needs and to underpin economic recovery.  Over time, this will further improve the general condition of Irish water services infrastructure.  While any infrastructure will be vulnerable to unprecedented weather events, the investment should improve the resilience of the infrastructure.  Combined with the Government proposals to commence a programme of domestic metering to be funded by the National Pensions Reserve Fund and to establish an independent regulator for the water sector, this will build on the investment already made in the sector to radically transform our water services sector over the coming decade.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the difficulties the unprecedented weather caused for communities, and I commend all public organisations, voluntary groups and communities that worked together throughout the five week period to ensure the social and business life of this country could continue as much as possible.  We will continue to learn from these experiences to ensure that all actors are appropriately engaged to ensure optimum response and continuance of public service in such challenging circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputies Joe Costello and Ciar&aacute;n Lynch.  My sympathies are with the families and individuals affected by the water shortages and restrictions throughout the country after the extreme cold weather spell.  People had different experiences throughout the country and there were different causes to the problems.  I spoke to people in my area for whom the water was stopped on Christmas Day because of burst pipes in their homes.  That was followed by water restrictions in the following week.  Some people experienced great difficulties, especially the elderly and families with children.</P>
        <P>I commend the work of local authorities and other agencies in attempting to fix the problems that have arisen.  Many local authority workers, as the Minister mentioned, were working over the Christmas holiday period, trying to locate and fix burst pipes and mains and communicate to the public information such as the times of water restrictions.  Much work went on and there has been much improvement among councils in getting the message out.  This may not be the case in every local authority, but many local authorities used local and national newspapers, the broadcast media, including RTE, and Internet services such as Twitter and Facebook to communicate notices.  My local authority, South Dublin County Council, regularly e-mailed local representatives with updates, which I was able to communicate to some of my constituents.</P>
        <P>Communication is important, because if people are given plenty of notice that their water will be cut off or restricted, they can take steps to ensure they have a water supply.  It is important that they are told what to do if they have no water and where they can obtain water.  Much work was done in this regard.  I commend the media for being more informative than I ever remember them being in the past.  There were good communication channels between local authorities, the national severe weather co-ordination committee and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and most of the time there was fairly good communication with the media, which was important for people who might not have had access to the Internet.  I am not saying it was perfect; there are always improvements to be made.  There could have been improvements in anticipating the problems that arose.  We knew the cold weather spell was coming up and the circumstances were similar to those of January last year.  I am not an engineer, but perhaps it would have been possible to implement more water restrictions before the shortages occurred in order to build up a surplus in advance.</P><Col N="89"/>
        <P>This debate is timely as it is our first day back in the D&aacute;il, and this was the big issue over the Christmas holidays.  It is good that Fine Gael tabled this motion for debate.  However, something is missing from the motion: it does not call for strategic investment in our water infrastructure to rehabilitate the mains, although it calls for the reallocation of future water funding from the Exchequer to prioritise water conservation by investment in water mains weather-proofing.  Unaccounted-for water is a problem not only during bad weather, but all year round, as has been identified in a number of reports, including the national water study carried out in 2000.  It is one of the indicators in local government reports and is a major problem.</P>
        <P>People often ask whether there is a scarcity of water in Ireland, but of course there is not.  Compared to other countries, we do not have a water scarcity problem.  We use about 1.7% of our available water resources, compared to about 37% in Belgium.  Our problem is not the availability of water resources, but we do have droughts for different reasons, often to do with water management during extreme weather events.  If there are more warm summers we will also have problems in that regard.  However, our major problem is the loss of water through our water infrastructure, with estimated losses of up to 60% in some counties.  Nationally, the proportion of water lost is probably about 40% to 50%, although I have seen some towns in which the proportion of unaccounted-for water is up to 70%.  There has not been major progress in the last decade in dealing with this, although there has been investment in water conservation and infrastructural projects.  According to replies from the Minister to parliamentary questions I have asked on this subject, approximately 10% of investment between 2002 and 2010 in water infrastructure &mdash; about &euro;130 million &mdash; went towards water conservation.  This is a small proportion of the capital investment in water infrastructure.</P>
        <P>According to the document detailing the programme of investment for the next three years, which the Minister launched recently, the Government will spend &euro;320 million on water conservation, which, as the Minister said himself, is about double what was spent in the previous eight years.  If that money is spent, it will represent progress.  However, we must consider the record of the Government.  The fixing of our existing infrastructure was not a priority over the past ten years.  This problem was flagged long ago.  A report carried out in 2005 &mdash; an evaluation by consultants of investment in water infrastructure under the national development plan &mdash; made the point, to the best of my recollection, that it would make sense to fix the existing water infrastructure before investing in new capacity.  However, that has not happened in the past ten years.  The Minister&rsquo;s document makes the same point that before we start investing in new water infrastructure, we should prioritise investment in the existing infrastructure to stop leaks in the system.  It is good that this has been identified, but there is much emphasis in the document on new capacity.  It talks about new hubs and new towns and so on.  There is a feeling that we will go back to building new houses and new towns, but we should consider the money that was spent over the past ten years.  A large amount was invested in new water infrastructure and connections for houses that were never occupied.</P>
        <P>The priority, above all other things, must be to fix the existing infrastructure.  All of the other aims, such as setting up a new water authority, are far down the line.  How feasible is the setting up of a water authority, and is it the right direction to go?  I question whether this is an appropriate priority.  I also question the prioritising of water metering.  These are costly projects and we do not know whether they are feasible in the short term or even the medium term.  However, we know that if we spend &euro;26 million, as Dublin City Council did, on fixing leaking pipes and mains in the existing infrastructure, we can save a large amount of water.  According to Dublin City Council, this measure saved 8 million to 10 million litres of water per day from going down the drain.  That is where the money should be prioritised before we do anything else.  It will provide jobs and it is the most important thing we can do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Tuffy for sharing her time with me, and compliment Fine Gael on its motion on public utilities and the effect of the recent severe weather on the provision of an adequate water supply to householders and businesses.</P>
        <P>As the leader of the Green Party, the Minister should be the first to recognise the reality of climate change.  We must recognise that what we have been reliably told by the local authorities happens only once every 50 or 100 years, is now happening here regularly.  In recent years, we have had flooding, in addition to the snow and icy conditions this Christmas and last January.  We have also seen the extreme flooding that is occurring in Australia.</P>
        <P>Ireland has now begun to get weather extremes, but this has not been recognised in terms of how to deal with them.  All we have currently is a national emergency co-ordinating committee but we should realise that this is not just an emergency situation as such events are occurring regularly.  Severe weather conditions will now be regular events in this country, as has been happening over the last couple of years.  The sooner we put in place a proper national plan to deal with such conditions the better.  We need more than a national emergency co-ordinating committee that sits around the Christmas period; it must be put in place on a long-term basis with proper policies and plans to co-ordinate the activities of local authorities.</P>
        <P>Following what happened last year, the Minister for Transport put the National Roads Authority in charge of salt.  Unfortunately, however, the NRA did not get its act together very well.  It brought salt into Cork when Donegal was snowed in for four weeks.  Salt supplies had to be driven across the entire country from Cork to Donegal and, in addition, it arrived late because of storms in the Mediterranean.  It was a horrendous situation.  Local authorities did their best to access salt supplies but could not because the NRA was trying to get its hands on everything available.  Local authorities that showed initiative could not get grit or salt because the NRA was endeavouring to control the entire supply.  That is not good enough in a situation involving multiple problems arising from severe weather conditions.</P>
        <P>It is a shame that the lessons of January 2010 were not learned.  The Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Transport and Defence attended the D&aacute;il at that time to explain what was being done, but they did not get their act together.  It is shame that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, was not available.  Indeed, no Minister was available until long after the event when things seemed to look up.  Fresh snow falls and icy conditions, however, caused matters to deteriorate.</P>
        <P>Even at the present time, we have not solved the problem by any means.  There is a huge shortage of treated water supplies for homes and businesses throughout Dublin city.  Some Dublin flat complexes do not get a regular supply, while leakages remain to be fixed throughout the country.  That is the reality we face at the present time.</P>
        <P>The problem is not a lack of water because our reservoirs have plentiful supplies.  The problem is that we do not have enough treated water but that message has not got through.  We hear about plans for a major infrastructural pipeline scheme to bring water from the River Shannon to Dublin, but we have lots of water here, although we are not in a position to treat it.  It costs approximately &euro;1 billion per annum to provided treated water, which is undoubtedly a scarce resource.  The motion refers to 43%, but on average 40% of water supplies are lost through fractured pipes.  That is the way it has been for the three and a half years the Minister has been in Government.  There has been no investment in infrastructure.</P>

He said that <Col N="91"/>contracts to the value of &euro;320 million are to commence for water conservation projects, including mains rehabilitation, which is more than double the investment in water conservation compared to the preceding seven years.

	<P>In view of the gross neglect by the Government, no money has been spent that is worth talking about.  The same amount of water is now being lost as happened long before this Government came into office.  They have done nothing to rectify the situation but the first priority is to repair leaks.  Let us ensure that all the water that comes into the system will reach homes and businesses.   Let us also ensure that water supplies in our reservoirs <Col N="92"/>can be treated before embarking on a wild goose chase to bring water from the River Shannon to Dublin.</P>
        <P>We should have a plan to deal with a national emergency of this nature when it recurs.  We do not want an <i>ad hoc</i>, unco-ordinated, missing-Minister plan, which happened in the most recent case.  We should recognise the reality that extremely severe weather conditions are occurring here regularly.  This situation must be addressed and the Minister is ultimately responsible for doing so.  I have not seen any suggestion of long-term plans and policies being co-ordinated with local authorities to deal with the immediate problem of leakages from burst water mains.  The situation is up in the air and meanwhile there are insufficient water supplies for domestic and commercial consumers.  The Minister should come up with something that is more positive and substantial than what we have heard to date.</P>

	<P>The potential closure of St. Enda&rsquo;s swimming pool and sports complex is an important issue for the southside of Limerick city and particularly for the people of South Hill.  Intensive discussions are currently under way between Limerick City VEC, the Catholic diocese, Limerick City Council and the Limerick Regeneration Agencies with a view to keeping open the sports complex, which consists of a swimming pool, gymnasium and various other amenities.  The proposed closure comes on foot of the closure of the only other community swimming pool in the area, the Roxborough facility, in 2004.  St. Enda&rsquo;s is now the only community sports facility of its type on the southside of the city.  Twenty-five people are employed there, many of them with young families and having worked at the complex for many years.  It is essential that their uncertainty is ended and their jobs are maintained.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Skills has not come forward with the capital funding, of the order of &euro;400,000 plus, that is needed to bring the facility up to health and safety standards.  It is gravely disappointing that the Government should espouse the virtues of the Limerick regeneration project while leaving it to other stakeholders to provide the necessary funding for this vital project.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, confirm that the funding of &euro;400,000 plus will be provided to facilitate the much needed renovations to ensure compliance with health and safety standards?  Will he give a further commitment that the Department will support the redevelopment of the complex?  Renovation would require some &euro;5 million and a full refurbishment approximately &euro;10 million.  That can happen only with the approval of the Department.</P>
        <P>Intensive discussions are under way among the stakeholders.  It is vital that the Department come to the table with the &euro;400,000 that is needed to facilitate the much needed capital works.  I hope the Minister of State will have good news for the people of Limerick and for the 25 staff at St. Enda&rsquo;s sports complex.</P>

	<P>This is a most urgent matter.  If it is not resolved, the swimming pool and sports complex will close this Friday.  We are talking about the loss of 25 jobs and the removal of a vital amenity for the 24 schools which use the complex, including St. Enda&rsquo;s community school on whose grounds it is situated, as well as various community groups and <Col N="93"/>swimming clubs.  It would be an absolute betrayal of the communities concerned if the facility were to close.</P>
        <P>I call on the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills to take responsibility in this matter.  The complex is owned by the Department and is in the grounds of St. Enda&rsquo;s community school.  It is directly across the road from the top of O&rsquo;Malley Park in South Hill, at the heart of southside regeneration efforts.  This is a community that has had its share of problems.  It would be a travesty to continue talk of building and developing new facilities if, at the same time, an existing facility that is widely used and is at the heart of the community were to be shut down.  It is vital that actions are taken to keep it open.  The T&aacute;naiste has ultimate responsibility in this regard because it is the Department which owns the premises.</P>
        <P>Negotiations are ongoing to seek to safeguard the facility.  I commend my colleague, Councillor Joe Leddin, vice chairman of the board of the school, in this regard.  There are signals that the regeneration board and Limerick City Council are willing to play a significant part in ensuring the complex stays open.  However, the most important player is the Department.  It must come up with the funding, which is not a significant amount in the context of the building programme and the Department&rsquo;s overall expenditure.  It would be a terrible tragedy if the sports complex were to close because it would mean there would be no facilities for people in the area.  When the nearby Roxborough pool was closed the indications were that the savings made would be used to safeguard the future operation of St. Enda&rsquo;s.  Limerick City Council is responsible in that regard.</P>
        <P>By raising this issue we hope the T&aacute;naiste will assume her responsibility by giving an indication without delay that St. Enda&rsquo;s will be supported.  We are absolutely determined that the complex will not close this week and that it will be given a solid foundation for the future, for the benefit of the communities it serves.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  I am pleased to be given the opportunity, on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, to clarify for the House the situation with regard to the St Enda&rsquo;s community school sports complex.  The school has operated a swimming pool and sports complex since the 1970s, one of five such complexes operated by community and comprehensive schools.  When the sports complexes were established alongside community and comprehensive schools, it was envisaged that they would operate on a self-financing basis.  However, it was always recognised that additional costs were associated with the operation of swimming pools.  For this reason, all five sports complexes receive an annual payment of &euro;44,000 from the Department towards the cost of swimming pool maintenance.</P>
        <P>Over a period of years, the St Enda&rsquo;s complex has failed to deliver on a commitment to become self-financing in its day-to-day operations and has built up a substantial deficit.  Current funding provided by the Department of Education and Skills, together with some funding from the Limerick Regeneration Agencies and Limerick City Council, has allowed the complex to continue to operate.  However, the board of management has recently reported that the sports complex has serious health and safety issues which, it is estimated, require immediate capital funding of &euro;455,000 to resolve.  Such an injection of capital funding will not resolve the wider issue that the ageing sports complex cannot compete with other facilities in the area and therefore has little prospect of an income stream that can meet running costs.</P>
        <P>The stark reality is that this is a 40-year-old facility.  It is estimated that a complete renovation could cost up to &euro;3.5 million, while a new build to replace the entire existing complex would cost an estimated &euro;10 million.  The priority of the Department of Education and Skills must be <Col N="94"/>to channel available funds to front-line educational services.  The Department has been in contact, and will continue this engagement, with the board of management of St Enda&rsquo;s community school, the Limerick Regeneration Agencies and Limerick City Council on the future of the sports complex.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this important matter.  The announcement by the VHI of an increase in premia of between 15% and 45% from 1 February is a major blow to many families who are already struggling to cope in this recession.  It has struck great fear into elderly people, many of whom are covered under the company&rsquo;s plan B and plan B Options schemes.  Their premia are set to rise by &euro;317 and &euro;444 euro, respectively, for a single adult.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Health and Children is not in the Chamber to address this issue.  She is never there when she is wanted.  How can elderly people be expected to afford these additional payments?  Older people have worked hard throughout their lives and have paid their VHI premia for decades so that they could enjoy a good quality of life in their latter years.  Now they face the prospect of having to cancel their insurance.</P>
        <P>Middle Ireland has been dealt a series of hammer blows by the Government, particularly by way of the austerity measures introduced in last December&rsquo;s budget.  Huge financial pressures have been heaped on middle-income families.  More than 70,000 people cancelled their private health insurance last year and these latest price hikes will drive more people into a public health system which is already in crisis.  In recent weeks an unprecedented number of patients have been left for days on trolleys in our crowded accident and emergency departments.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael proposes the introduction of a universal health insurance scheme that would end the two-tier system.  In the meantime, the drive away from health insurance will result in even longer waiting times on trolleys, more crowded accident and emergency departments and longer waiting lists.</P>
        <P>The VHI argues the hikes are necessary because it is losing &euro;850 for each of its 129,000 customers who are over 70.  Two years after the Government&rsquo;s risk equalisation scheme was shot down by the Supreme Court, the Government has failed to act.  The Minister for Health and Children claimed the introduction of levies and tax credits would obviate the necessity for price hikes but the policy has quite simply failed.  Will the Minister of State clarify the position tonight?  When will the risk equalisation legislation come before the House?  Our health spokesperson, Deputy Reilly, has called on the Minister to publish the Milliman report into the VHI&rsquo;s costs.  I support the Deputy in that regard.</P>
        <P>My constituency office has been inundated with calls from concerned constituents since the price hike was announced.  Several people have questioned the cost of hospital care and have asked whether the VHI is too quick to sign off on bills.  For example, a man told me yesterday he received a bill for three nights after having spent one night in hospital.  The VHI paid the bill without questioning it.  Other people are simply astonished and angry.  On the very day we heard the VHI chief executive announce the price hikes, he refused to state whether his salary was cut.  According to the VHI&rsquo;s annual report of 2009, his pay was approximately &euro;410,000.  I will be very interested to hear what he has to say when he appears before the Joint Committee <Col N="95"/>on Health and Children later this month.  Surely it is time the Government led by example by capping public sector salaries at &euro;200,000 per annum.</P>
        <P>Taxpayers are entitled to see the Milliman report.  After all, they paid for it.  It will show significant savings can be made and it should be published without delay.  The Minister should make contact with the VHI.  It must not be allowed to increase its charges while the report remains unpublished.  VHI customers, particularly the elderly and middle-class families, are facing weeks of sleepless nights worrying about their health care.  If the Minister does not act, it will be another major blow for families.</P>
        <P>The reality is that the buck stops with the Minister for Health and Children.  I am disappointed she is not present in the House to answer questions on this issue of real concern for members of the VHI.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Breen for raising this matter today as it provides an opportunity to outline to the House the responsibilities of the Minister for Health and Children, the current position of the private health insurance market and the Government&rsquo;s actions and plans for reform.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children has responsibility for governance matters relating to the VHI, such as board appointments, the receipt of its annual report and accounts and other matters.  VHI, while owned by the State, is a not-for-profit company operating in a competitive market.  It would be inappropriate for any Minister to interfere in matters relating to prices set by any one company which is required to compete fairly within that market.</P>
        <P>The VHI announced price changes in regard to a range of its plans on 6 January 2011, which will take effect on 1 February 2011.  The increases will amount to 15% for more than half of its customers, with higher increases up to a maximum of 45% for those on other plans.  While the Minister is conscious of the likely impact on customers in the current economic climate, a key principle of the market is the right of customers, guaranteed in law, to switch between or within insurers to get better value.  This includes switching to a different plan with their own insurer or another insurer to get better cover or to reduce premium costs.  This rule applies regardless of the age or health profile of any individual consumer.</P>
        <P>Health insurance customers can switch easily, without having to serve additional waiting times and cannot be refused by another insurer.  Provisions have been included in relevant health insurance legislation to ensure that switching is as easy and seamless as possible for customers.</P>
        <P>The Health Insurance Authority, as the regulator of the private health insurance market, can offer independent advice to consumers in regard to their rights.  The authority&rsquo;s website, <i>www.hia.ie</i>, contains a wealth of information for the benefit of consumers.  It can be contacted by telephone at 1850 929 166.</P>
        <P>It is important that the other insurers in the market, which have on many occasions indicated to the Minister their willingness to take on all customers, now take the initiative and offer plans to older persons that will attract them to move between insurers.  In this way, the market could begin to move towards a more equal sharing of older customers between insurers and we could see competition driving efficiencies in services provided.  This would also have the effect of reducing payments from the two smaller insurers to the VHI under the interim risk equalisation measures.</P>
        <P>In May 2010, a comprehensive package of measures was announced by the Government to address a number of issues in the health insurance market.  With regard to the VHI, advisers will be appointed next month to prepare for the capitalisation, authorisation and sale of the <Col N="96"/>company.  New minimum benefit regulations will be prepared on foot of the Health Insurance Authority&rsquo;s consultation on the matter, and other measures, such as the introduction of incentives for younger people to enter the market earlier, are also planned.</P>
        <P>Following a Supreme Court ruling in July 2008 which struck down the 2003 risk equalisation scheme, the Government acted quickly to introduce an interim scheme of loss compensation.  The scheme covers the period 2009 to early 2012, by means of a temporary scheme of age-related tax credits and community rating levy.  The scheme is designed to be Exchequer-neutral over the course of the three-year period and ensures that a very significant degree of support for the cost of health insurance claims is provided.  This scheme has been approved by the European Commission and is in place since 1 January 2009.  Preparations are ongoing for a permanent, robust risk equalisation scheme which will come into effect at the start of 2013.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to continuing the community-rated health insurance market and it is the Minister&rsquo;s firm conviction that the preparations currently in train will act to preserve that principle.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter, which I genuinely feel is of national importance.  If resolved, it could contribute towards the regeneration of many coastal communities.  The entire mackerel quota increase for 2011 should be allocated to the polyvalent fleet.</P>
        <P>As of 1 January, Ireland has had in excess of 6,000 tonnes of extra mackerel quota to allocate.  It is time for the Minister to make an equitable decision to allocate the entire mackerel quota increase for 2011 to the polyvalent fleet.  This would bring the polyvalent share of the overall quota to 20%.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick, on his achievements at EU level before Christmas.  The Minister has been very willing to meet industry representatives and for this I am grateful.  However, I remind the Minister of the very positive socio-economic impact of increasing the polyvalent share of the mackerel quota.</P>
        <P>The polyvalent fleet lands its catches wholly into Ireland, where the benefits to the economy from onshore value-added may be maximised.  The RSW fleet lands approximately 80% of its mackerel catch abroad, with only approximately 20% being landed in Ireland.  Switching landings to Ireland from abroad would lead to the creation of many extra jobs in the economy based on the expansion arising from the increased activity of the polyvalent fleet.  The additional mackerel landed in Ireland would result in an overall increase in output throughout the economy. The coastal communities, which are areas of high unemployment, would be the main beneficiaries.  The processing sector would add great value and there would be an increase in exports.  In simple terms, it would mean extra jobs, extra salaries and extra disposable income.</P>
        <P>The landing of catches abroad represents a leakage from the economy.  In other words, the Irish economy does not get the opportunity to add value to fish landed abroad.  It is bad enough to have the Spanish and French fleets fishing our waters and landing their catches abroad without our own fleet reciprocating.</P>
        <P>The economy would benefit enormously if the entire 10% of the extra quota were allocated to the polyvalent fleet.  As I have outlined, it would result in a significant increase in net output and create much-needed jobs in peripheral areas.  I strongly urge the Minister of State to <Col N="97"/>allocate the entire mackerel quota increase for 2011 to the polyvalent fleet so that we can begin the regeneration of our coastal communities.  I urge him to take action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Even when Ireland joined the European Economic Community in 1973, there was a feeling among fishermen and the fishing industry that, to excuse the pun, they were being sold down the river.  To a large degree, it is true that fishing has been one of the Cinderellas of industry despite it being an indigenous industry of considerable importance for coastal communities.  People sometimes forget that it makes a significant contribution to the economy in difficult times.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s 2010 quota for mackerel was 62,643 tonnes.  The quota is divided, with 87% for 23 boats.  These are known as the refrigerated sea water, RSW, fleet, which is almost exclusively based in the Killybegs-Donegal area.  The remaining 13% is given to the rest of the boats in the State, that is, the polyvalent fleet, dry hold fleet, gill net fleet, and so on.  Thanks to the excellent negotiations of the Minster of State, Deputy Connick, and his Department, Ireland has received an increase of 10% for the 2011 fishery.  I take this opportunity to congratulate him warmly on his performance as Minister of State.  He has been a revelation and the industry recognises that his talents have been of considerable benefit to it.</P>
        <P>The increase for the 2011 fishery equates to 6,000 tonnes.  Deputy Christy O&rsquo;Sullivan and I are asking the Minster of State to allocate the additional 10% or a larger proportion thereof to the polyvalent, dry hold and gill net fleets because those boats, by the nature of their size and catching capacity, land fish mostly in the State.  This has added value, in that they benefit small coastal communities throughout Ireland, not just in the Donegal-Killybegs area &mdash; I am referring to ports like Howth, Dunmore East, Baltimore, Castletownbere, Dingle and Ross a Mh&iacute;l &mdash; with additional direct jobs as well as all ancillary services associated with the loading processing and distribution of the fish.</P>
        <P>With the additional 6,000 tonnes at the Minister of State&rsquo;s disposal, he can go a long way towards expanding and promoting the mackerel industry throughout the whole of Ireland without causing any loss of quota to the larger and established industry in Donegal by allocating the additional 10% to the 14 polyvalent and hundreds of smaller boats around the coast.  Given that the 23 RSW fleet boats land a large amount of their quota outside the State, the Minister of State should try to ensure that the new additional quota at his disposal should be landed and remain in the State to create jobs in coastal rural communities where they are most needed.  At this point in our economic history, it is important that we utilise our indigenous resources for the benefit of our people and ensure that any added value arising from those resources directly or indirectly benefits our country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Christy O&rsquo;Sullivan and O&rsquo;Donoghue for raising this matter.  There is good news on the total allowable catch, TAC, front for mackerel, with an expected 10% increase in Ireland&rsquo;s quota in 2011 when fully confirmed.  This increase will result in approximately &euro;6.5 million extra in the value of landings for this stock.  It was agreed at a bilateral meeting between the EU and Norway after the failure of the four-party talks with Iceland and the Faroe Islands, which went to four rounds but did not secure agreement.  In overall value terms, landings of pelagic stocks will contribute &euro;107 million to the Irish economy and they support further added value and jobs in the processing factories in coastal states.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, it was impossible to allocate the full amount of TAC available to member states because of a technical difficulty in regard to the mathematical methodology of integrating the southern component of the mackerel stock as agreed with Norway last January.  In addition, there were technical difficulties with the mechanism to deal with the implications of the EU-Norway and Norway-EU transfers as a result of the integration.  A significant amount of work <Col N="98"/>has already been done on this with our Marine Institute heavily involved.  However, the Commission was not in a position to finalise the work in time for the Council.  The Commission will convene an expert group before the end of this month with a view to finalising the issue as soon as possible.  Following the meeting, it is hoped the Commission will be in a position to table an amendment to the TAC and quota regulation for 2011 to provide for the full quota allocations for mackerel.  I hope the amending regulation will be in place later this spring.  We can expect a final annual quota for mackerel for 2011 of approximately 68,000 tonnes.  Until the discussions at EU level are complete, we cannot be fully confident of the quota available.</P>
        <P>At national level, the available quota at this time for mackerel for Ireland based on the interim TAC is 54,861 tonnes.  The mackerel management allocation arrangements for this quota have been put in place for 2011 based on existing policy.  The internal sharing arrangements between different parts of the fleet is subject to dissatisfaction and disagreement within the Irish industry, with each group of vessels seeking increased shares.  However, it is important to understand that this is a zero sum game and any increase to one part of the fleet must involve a reduction to another part of the fleet.</P>
        <P>I would like to give a brief history of the development of the current arrangements and changes that have been introduced in recent times.  Prior to 2000, polyvalent multi-purpose vessels only caught small quantities of mackerel.  The mackerel fishery was prosecuted by RSW vessels in the pelagic segment of the fishing fleet which were subject to vessel catch limits since the mid-1980s.  There are 23 vessels in this segment of the fleet and they are large purpose-built vessels for the pelagic fisheries, mainly mackerel, herring and horse mackerel.  For all practical purposes, there was a technological restriction in place in respect of the polyvalent fleet, in that the vessels concerned were small, dry hold, traditional vessels that were incapable of catching large quantities of mackerel.  In such circumstances, the typical total national catch of those polyvalent vessels was of the order of 1,000 to 1,200 tonnes and a 1,500 tonne allocation was set aside for those out of the total national quota, which ranged from a high of 99,000 tonnes in 1994 to a low of 52,000 tonnes between 1985 and 2000.</P>
        <P>This situation changed materially from 2000 onwards as a number of polyvalent tank boats were introduced into the fleet.  These vessels had much higher catching and storage capacity and the national polyvalent catch trebled to more than 3,500 tonnes in 2000.  Following extensive consultation and discussion with the various industry players throughout 2001, revised arrangements were eventually put in place in October of that year.  This capped the total mackerel catch of polyvalent vessels at 7,000 tonnes, of which 1,500 tonnes were set aside to cover catches by vessels less than 65 ft. in length.  The balance of the available mackerel quota, some 38,500 tonnes in 2008, was divided between the 23 RSW vessels of the pelagic sector according to set formulae.</P>
        <P>In 2001 when the allocation of 7,000 tonnes for the polyvalent fleet was agreed, the Irish mackerel quota was 72,000 tonnes.  Since then, it has decreased and fluctuated at a lower level.  This decrease resulted in a low quota of 49,643 tonnes in 2008.  Despite these quota reductions the 7,000 tonnes reserved for the polyvalent sector remained unchanged until 2009 when an Irish quota of 66,070 tonnes was agreed and requests for a higher share of the quota were received from polyvalent vessel owners.  In January 2009, the Minister decided after much consultation and careful consideration of all of the available information that, for 2009 and future years, the polyvalent segment would be allocated 13% of the total mackerel quota.</P>
        <P>On the level of landings into Ireland, under the EU open market policy, there can be no question of requiring or pressuring vessels to land in Ireland.  It is always useful to have an understanding of the situation, as landings of pelagic stocks such as mackerel generate employ<Col N="99"/>ment in processing in coastal communities.  In 2009, almost all of the polyvalent vessels landed in Ireland while 60% of landings by the RSW pelagic segment vessels were in Ireland.  The situation for 2010 has seen some change, with 75% of the polyvalent landings and 64% of the RSW pelagic segment landings being in Ireland.  It is clear that both polyvalent and RSW pelagic segment vessels are capable of and do land a proportion of their quota abroad.  From an employment and economic activity perspective, I would like to see the vast majority of all landings in Ireland and I would encourage the vessel owners and the processors to work together to maximise landings into Irish factories.</P>

        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">In 2009 a review of the internal sharing arrangements for mackerel within the polyvalent fleet was undertaken.  Following wide-ranging and intensive consultations, I introduced a new policy last October after nearly 18 months of discussion and consultation.  The arrangements for the sharing of the national quota between the polyvalent and pelagic segments of the fleet involve an allocation of 87% for the RSW pelagic segment and 13% for the polyvalent segment.  As the quota for mackerel in 2011 will involve an increase over the 2010 quota, the polyvalent segment will receive a <i>pro rata</i> increase in its allocation.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Any change in the current arrangements would be justified if changes in circumstances since 2009 supported a new review of the arrangements in place.  The then Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, fully consulted industry representatives and interested parties on the issue and, as a result, was fully aware of the divergent views that prevailed within the industry at that time in respect of the management of this fishery.  The specific management arrangements for the allocation of the mackerel quota introduced in 2009 were developed by the Minister of State for the proper and effective management of the mackerel fishing opportunities and were fully cognisant of the divergent views on the issue within various segments of the fishing industry.  I do not consider that there are substantially changed circumstances since that time.  Accordingly, I do not consider that a review of these arrangements is justified.  Any such review would require a full and thorough consultation with all relevant interests in the fishing industry and due consideration of all matters raised from the various differing perspectives.  Past experience suggests that such necessary consultation processes take a significant amount of time.</P>

        <P>At this point, all available quota has been fully allocated.  It will take some months before amending regulations definitively granting the full 2010 quota are finally settled.  A critical issue for Irish fishermen is to ensure that the future sustainability of the mackerel stock is protected.  I will work at EU level to address the unacceptable and unsustainable situation whereby Iceland and the Faroe Islands have once again this year established large unilateral TACs for mackerel outside of any appropriate international framework.  If this level of excessive fishing of the stock is allowed to continue, we will face reduced quotas over the coming years and the undermining of the fishery and the economic returns for Ireland&rsquo;s fishing fleet and the processing sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address this subject.  Bord Bia issued a press release today to welcome the increase of agricultural output sales to &euro;8 billion, with meat and livestock increasing by 20% to &euro;2.44 billion, with a rise of 10% in pigmeat exports reaching &euro;317 million.</P><Col N="100"/>
        <P>Unfortunately, behind that statistic there are facts and figures that paint a different picture.  I visited pig farmers last night and met people who are affected by four factors that affect any production unit, particularly pig farming: on-farm efficiency, the price for the product, the price for inputs and the availability of credit.  There is no doubt that anyone who has survived in recent years in the pigmeat industry is as efficient as any producer anywhere in the world.  Our pig farmers produce a quality product and the consumer shows great loyalty to Irish produce but is often being duped into buying produce from another country.  Labelling is another issue that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>The price farmers receive is around 17% of the price on the shelf.  The primary producer receives 17% of the cost of a high quality product that has not increased much in cost to produce but the producer is being screwed by getting less than 20% of the supermarket price.</P>
        <P>Input costs in the pig sector in 2010 were &euro;19 million per month.  This is not relevant to grass-based animals such as cows and sheep but it is a cost that exists all year round for pig farmers.  This year, the costs will be &euro;25 million per month.  On top of that, millers cannot fund the costs, processors are not prepared to do it and the banks cannot do it.  Farmers are being told to sell pigs and to send a cheque before feed can be supplied.  Potentially people will have to leave the industry.  They must already sell animals below optimum weight, which cuts profits massively.  At present there is a threat of a 15% reduction, which will lead to the closure of one mill and one processor.</P>
        <P>The pig farmers do not want a hand-out, they want assistance in the short-term, with a contingency fund of &euro;20 million being put in place to allow for interest free credit to allow them to cover their costs.  Inevitably the market rights itself in the pig sector.  The fund can be topped up when prices recover so the contingency fund will always exist for situations like this.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to support Deputy Doyle on this issue.  I am surprised my constituency colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, is not here because he is deeply involved in County Cavan, a major site for this industry.  That is no slight to the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>I asked the Taoiseach some months ago for an opportunity to discuss the crisis in the pig industry.  Although he agreed it would happen, unfortunately the time allotted was reallocated to a debate on the Harvest 2020 report.  Interestingly, one of the proposals in that report was for a 50% increase in pig output.  Unless we retain the industry, however, this will not be possible.</P>
        <P>The pig industry is worth &euro;400 million, with &euro;300 million in exports per year, providing 7,500 jobs for farmers, millers and processors.  It cost &euro;19 million per month to feed pigs in 2010 and this has since increased to &euro;25 million per month for the same feed, creating massive cash flow problems.  As the product price to the farmer has only increased by a small amount over that 12 months, there is a deficit of between &euro;15 million and &euro;20 million in the industry.  Unless something is done to provide such capital, an industry that is so important and efficient could be lost, particularly in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
        <P>The retailers have a responsibility to stop cutting prices and return a decent price to the farmer.  So far, the Government has completely failed to control the retailers.  In the absence of such action, Enterprise Ireland must come up with short-term funding to ensure a sizeable section of the industry is not lost because of financial pressure.  Meats such as beef and lamb have increased in price and there is no excuse for Bord Bia not running a promotion for the pork industry.</P>
        <P>This is a crisis and when the dioxin crisis happened more than &euro;800 million was found to save the industry.  I suggest if the will exists, the necessary &euro;20 million can be found and the <Col N="101"/>means to distribute it is not beyond the expertise of the Department, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>This is a crisis.  A number of small farmers have already gone out of business in Cavan and Monaghan.  The <i>Farming Independent</i> yesterday reported that one of the five largest farmers in the country has had to close down.  This is not limited to one area, it is a national crisis and we must ensure the industry is maintained.  This is only short-term.  Before this, banks would lend the money but they do not have it at the moment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputies are aware, pig prices are a function of the supply and demand dynamics in the market place and the Department does not intervene in the relationship between pig producers and processors.  However, it is evident that the recent increase in cereal prices is having a significant impact on pig producers and this fact cannot be ignored.  In tandem with this are difficulties in obtaining credit from feed mills and general cash flow issues and this is putting the sector under considerable pressure.  The Minister is acutely aware of these pressures and, with many producers being constituents of his, he is reminded of the problems on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>Following a difficult year in 2009 prices began to recover early last year.  This continued in the second quarter of the year to the extent that year on year prices exceeded 2009 levels in early July 2010.  This recovery continued and, while the usual seasonal decline following the end of the barbecue season was again experienced, it was not to the same extent as in previous years.  As a result, annual prices remained above 2009 levels and are still over 8% ahead with the price stabilising in recent weeks.  Currently the Irish producer price, at &euro;130.01 per 100 kilos, stands at over 95% of the EU average.  In general, Irish price movements over recent years have mirrored those of the EU as a whole.</P>
        <P>While returns have improved in recent months and are forecast to improve in the medium term, the biggest issue for producers at the moment remains feed costs, most notably cereals and compound feed.  The volatility currently being experienced in cereal prices has come about due to a number of factors.  In recent years the shift in production towards ethanol has resulted in upward price pressure on quantities produced for animal feed and human foodstuffs.</P>
        <P>Extreme weather events during 2010 in Australia and Russia have led to restrictions in output and a reduction in stocks.  These issues, together with exchange rate fluctuations and significant increases in transport costs, although falling in recent months, have made for uncomfortable times for livestock producers, who are among the largest consumers of cereals.  Pig producers are especially affected by the increase in cereal prices since June 2009, given that cereals account for 75% of feed.  This is reducing margins to below the long-term average, a situation which may have an impact on production decisions in both the short and medium term.  Difficulties in maintaining credit facilities with suppliers and banks are exacerbating this situation.  Officials in my Department met with the IFA before Christmas to discuss these issues.  A number of proposals were discussed and my Department is following these up with various parties including Bord Bia and Teagasc.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has prepared a development strategy for the pig industry, which identifies the issues facing the sector and makes certain recommendations.  The pig industry strategy steering group, which includes representation from my Department and all sectors of the industry, has been established for the purpose of furthering those recommendations.  This group has identified and continues to prioritise and promote actions needed to ensure a viable sustainable future for the pig sector.  These recommendations were incorporated into the Food Harvest 2020 report which was published in July 2010.  This group also recently wrote to me highlighting credit as the most immediate short-term issue facing the sector.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia has put in place a number of relevant marketing and promotion initiatives.  On the Irish market, a series of promotional campaigns have commenced and focus on building aware<Col N="102"/>ness and loyalty to the Bord Bia quality mark.  These will underline the quality of Irish pigmeat and will communicate its origin.  A customer reassurance programme will continue in export markets.  This will entail a continued direct Bord Bia contact with customers, placing key information about the Irish pigmeat industry in context and demonstrating the integrity of Irish health controls; a trade communications programme designed to position the capability of the Irish pigmeat sector and the safety and quality measures in place to influence key decision-makers in the retail, food service and manufacturing sectors; and a programme to maximise international market access for Irish pigmeat products has been established.  This will involve communications activities designed to build confidence among national authorities and opinion formers in markets, based around Ireland&rsquo;s health controls.</P>
        <P>In an attempt to tackle the issue of input costs, the European Commission recently opened tenders for wheat and barley to be sold from intervention in an attempt to curb feed price increases.  These tenders were fully subscribed and there are indications that similar exercises will be undertaken in the future.</P>
        <P>The problems currently being experienced in the pig sector are not unique to Ireland.  Prices in most member states recovered during 2010 but at a lower rate than in Ireland, while the subject of input costs affects pig producers Europe-wide.  Issues affecting the pig sector have been raised at various EU fora, from management committees to the special committee on agriculture to Council of Ministers level.  A Pig Reflection day was organised under the auspices of the Belgian Presidency in early December at which a wide range of issues were discussed.  Chief among these were the downward pressure on margins caused primarily by the significant increase in input costs and the ongoing weakness in prices.  The cost and availability of animal feed, the impact of GMOs, and the level and type of assistance that should be made available to the industry were also discussed.  Many member states, including Ireland, called on the Commission to take some remedial action, specifically in the form of re-introducing export refunds.</P>
        <P>The Commission is not convinced of the necessity to take measures to address the difficulties in the pigmeat sector.  It has dismissed calls for export refunds on the basis that EU prices are close to world market price, and considers that aids to private storage will simply result in the release of stocks in the spring, as prices begin to recover.  As the Deputies know, the State&rsquo;s commitment to the banking sector through the guarantee scheme and NAMA is influenced by the need to ensure credit for viable Irish businesses.</P>
        <P>Recent figures from the Central Bank confirm that lending has picked up in the SME sector and this includes agriculture and forestry which in quarter three of 2010 accounted for &euro;4.4 billion, representing 6.5% of the total outstanding lending to SMEs, or 13.5% of the core SME total.  This is the third largest share of core SME lending.  In the first three quarters of 2010, agriculture and forestry was the recipient of more new core SME lending than any other sector, for example, 23.9% or &euro;511million.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, is meeting with the Irish Banking Federation tomorrow to impress upon it the necessity of getting its members to improve the credit flow to pig farmers, millers and the sector generally.  A particular problem has arisen as a result of some producers not being in a position to repay the normal credit extended by feed millers, while both they and the millers have indicated that they are unable to replace this with bank credit.  The Minister will raise this with the banks tomorrow and impress upon them the importance of finding viable solutions to assist pig producers at this time.  This is ultimately in everyone&rsquo;s interest, including that of the banks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been clear for some time that the banks were facing serious challenges in terms of their liquidity position.  Lingering concerns in the market regarding their capital position has led to negative market sentiment.  The Deputy may be aware from Central Bank statistics that deposits by Irish residents in December 2009 fell from &euro;310,657 billion to &euro;297, 035 billion in November 2010 and deposits by non-residents fell from &euro;228,553 billion to &euro;172,631 billion for the same period, a fall of some &euro;69.5 billion.   The Financial Programme with the European Commission/ECB/IMF does not propose any departure from existing policy, indeed its prescription is an intensification and acceleration of the restructuring process already being undertaken by the Irish banks.  A key objective is to ensure that the size of the domestic banking system is proportionate to the size of the economy and is appropriately aligned with the funding capacity of the banks overall, taking into account stable sources of deposit and wholesale funding.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank is requiring the banks to meet a Core Tier 1 capital ratio of 12%.</P>
        <P>In addition, under the ELG Scheme, deposit balances continue to be guaranteed.  Since the signing of the agreement with the European Commission/ECB/IMF in December 2010, significant work is underway by the relevant authorities to complete the Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR) and the Prudential Liquidity Assessment Plan (PLAR), these being two important components of the agreement.</P><Col N="104"/>
        <P>The completion of these projects will bring additional confidence to the Irish Banking system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 290 together.</P>
        <P>It is now over two months since the meeting to which the Deputies refer took place and there have been very substantial developments during that period. However, the purpose of Commissioner Rehn&rsquo;s visit at the start of November was to gather information and exchange views. To that end, the Commissioner not only met with myself, but also met with Opposition parties, as well as representatives from both employer and union groups.</P>
        <P>In terms of my own meeting with Commissioner Rehn, the meeting was a continuation of the very positive relationship that we have. Commissioner Rehn and I discussed the Government&rsquo;s economic growth strategy, fiscal consolidation plans and matters relating to banking and financial market developments. In particular, I briefed the Commissioner on the development of the Government&rsquo;s four-year National Recovery Plan and the manner in which the upcoming Budget 2011 would fit into that multi-annual strategy. In that regard, we were in agreement on the need for a comprehensive plan to return sustainability to the public finances. In particular, Commissioner Rehn agreed that it was essential that the budgetary strategy was front-loaded and that a &euro;6 billion adjustment was the appropriate target for Budget 2011.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, the Government subsequently published the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, which was welcomed by the European Commission.  The Plan sets out the measures that will be taken with a view to bringing the deficit back below 3 per cent of GDP by 2014. Budget 2011 represents the first step in the implementation of that programme and, taking account of the &euro;6 billion adjustment package, projects a General Government deficit of 9.4 per cent of GDP by the end of this year. In this regard, it is positive to note that the end of year figures that my Department reported on last week, showed the public finances being marginally better than had been planned for in 2010.</P>
        <P>The National Recovery Plan also identifies the areas of economic activity which will provide growth and employment in the recovery and specifies the reforms the Government will implement to accelerate growth in key sectors of the economy and these matters were also discussed when I met the Commissioner.</P>
        <P>In the context of the agreed EU/IMF programme of external assistance, the various policy measures that have been set out as requiring action draw on the suite of measures that the Government set out in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 when it was published in November 2010.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if he will revise his estimate of inflation here in 2011 in view of the higher than expected inflation in euro zone countries in 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department regularly updates its estimates for inflation as price developments occur and will next publish a revised estimate in the context of the Stability Programme Update which will be submitted to the European Commission in April of 2011.  I would like to point out that Ireland is in a unique position in the European Union in that prices are continuing to fall &mdash; down 0.8% on a Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) basis in November 2010 &mdash; while inflation across all other European Member States is positive.  </P>
        <P>My Department is forecasting an increase in consumer prices this year on foot of base effects, commodity price movements and the modest indirect tax measures being implemented as part of the budget.  However, given muted domestic demand and considerable spare capacity in the economy, price increases are likely to be fairly modest &mdash; the HICP is projected to increase by 0.7% this year.</P>
        <P>I note that preliminary estimates of eurozone inflation for December were somewhat higher than expected, with an increase of 2.2% compared to an increase of 1.9% in October and November.  However a considerable portion of this headline inflation relates to energy price increases while core inflation has remained steady at about 1%.  Of course, wholesale energy price increases impact on Ireland as they do on the rest of Europe and my Department monitors energy price developments closely and will make amendments to its forecasts as appropriate.</P>
        <P>What we should focus on, however, is the positive impact that the inflation differential between ourselves and our main trading partners is having on Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position.  As set out in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, exports will be the key driver of economic growth over this period.  Accordingly, this improvement in price competitiveness will provide crucial support to sustained economic recovery.</P>

	<P>NAMA has its own Board and has a commercial remit to manage its portfolio of acquired loans and property.  To date NAMA, has only acquired loans not properties.  It is a matter for the Board of NAMA to manage and deal with acquired properties in a commercial fashion and on a case by case basis with the intention of generating the best achievable financial return for the State.  I am informed by NAMA that through its debtor management process it has already given permission for the sale of properties to the value of &euro;2bn where NAMA had an interest of &euro;700m in these properties.  Some 90% by value of those permissions relate to property in the UK.</P>
        <P>Section 55 of the NAMA Act 2009 requires NAMA to make a quarterly report to the Minister for Finance within 3 months of the end of the quarter to which the report refers and these reports will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The quarterly report includes, among other things, information on the number of loans being foreclosed or otherwise enforced and the amount of money recovered by sale of property.  The quarterly report for the third quarter has been submitted to me and I expect to lay it before both Houses shortly.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed that the bank is increasing charges for its current account customers but can understand why they are doing so.  The Government operates an arm&rsquo;s length relationship with the banks in which the State has a shareholding and the commercial decisions on how best to operate the bank remain a matter for management and the board.  I have no role in approving or setting bank charges.  This responsibility lies with the Central Bank. Under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, banks must make a submission to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce or increase charges in respect of a service.  </P>
        <P>Where a bank has exempted customers who meet certain criteria from charges, and subsequently change the criteria, there is no requirement for any subsequent notification to, or approval by, the Central Bank provided the charges are within the permitted limits.  I would also advise the Deputy that the National Consumer Agency&rsquo;s website www.itsyourmoney.ie   provides a cost comparison table on the main current accounts provided by individual firms which includes details of how to qualify for free account maintenance and transactions.</P>
        <P>Any proposed changes to charges or qualifying criteria must be notified to customers in advance.  In the case of current accounts, the minimum notice period is two months and must be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the account.</P>
        <P>Regarding the issue of basic bank accounts, as part of the restructuring plan process currently underway with the European Commission, it has been proposed that the domestic banking sector will be required to support and promote the availability of a basic bank account.  This is <Col N="108"/>to be done in the context of the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s strategy on financial inclusion in the State.</P>
        <P>Work is underway on a review of the options available to achieve greater financial inclusion &mdash; including the introduction of basic bank accounts by end-2011. The objective of the review, which is being undertaken by the Social Finance Foundation on my behalf, is to identify recommended actions to achieve a substantial reduction in financial exclusion over a 3-5 year period.</P>
        <P>The preparation of the review is overseen by a Steering Group comprised of key stakeholders and chaired by my Department.  I expect to receive a draft report setting out the recommendations from the review sometime in the first quarter of this year.  I intend to publish this review for consultation purposes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together. </P>
        <P>On 31 December 2010 further capital of &euro;6.42 billion was provided to Anglo Irish Bank and &euro;2.7 billion to Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The consideration for the further capital was provided through a final increase in the Promissory Notes in each institution.</P>
        <P>As set out in the technical note published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 4 November last &mdash; which accompanied the publication of the information note on the economic and budgetary <Col N="109"/>outlook for the period 2011 to 2014 &mdash; the terms of the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society (INBS) Promissory Notes have now been adjusted to provide that no interest will be chargeable in calendar years 2011 and 2012.</P>
        <P>The coupon on the Anglo Irish Bank and INBS Promissory Notes is now 0% for the two years to 31 December 2012.  A higher rate of interest will be payable from the beginning of 2013 onwards, so that the cumulative amount of interest paid over the life of these Promissory Notes will remain at an average rate sufficient to allow the Promissory Notes to be recorded in the institutions&rsquo; balance sheets at face value, notwithstanding the zero rate of interest charged in 2011 and 2012.  The interest rate which will apply on the final tranche  of the Anglo Irish Bank and INBS Promissory Notes from 1 January 2013 is 11.76% and is based on the long term Government bond yield appropriate to when the amounts will be paid.  If interest was spread evenly over the life of the final tranche of the Promissory Notes, rather than having a two year 0% coupon period, the coupon would have been 8.6%.</P>
        <P>The blended coupon on all of the tranches of both the Anglo Irish Bank and INBS promissory notes together is 0% in both 2011 and 2012 increasing to 8.2% thereafter.</P>
        <P>The Promissory Note structure was designed to achieve the most efficient financing outcome for the Exchequer and to spread the repayments over an extended period of years.  The final total of Promissory Notes in issue is &euro;30.85 billion (inclusive of EBS).  Under the terms of the Notes, 10% of the amount outstanding at end 2010 will be paid each year i.e. &euro;3.085 billion per year.  The amount of interest accruing on the Anglo Irish Bank and INBS Promissory Notes will be nil in 2011 and 2012, increasing to &euro;1.8 billion in 2013. The interest charge declines annually thereafter as the balance is repaid.  As a result of the extended duration i.e. towards 20 years, the total interest is considerable and is estimated at &euro;17 billion over the life of the Promissory Notes.  Discounting these interest cash flows using a government bond yield curve from 22 December 2010 for all tranches the discounted value of the interest is &euro;9.5 billion.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, that Revenue employs a multifaceted strategy to deal with this problem.  It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and deployment of detection technologies, optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and internally to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.  Revenue enforcement officers are deployed at all key ports and airports.  Staff deployed at these locations are often augmented by additional staff from other areas when specific operations are organised. Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  </P>
        <P>Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also carry out regular <Col N="110"/>multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations and in checks at inland markets.</P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s enforcement approach in the fight against the illicit tobacco trade is under continuous review.  For example, in July of last year Revenue launched a nationwide tobacco operation, which concentrated additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at various retail points for the purpose of identifying illicit tobacco products.  This resulted in 561 seizures totalling 13.7m cigarettes and 195 kgs tobacco in the course of the two-week period of the operation.  Two subsequent 3-day operations resulted in the seizure of over 1,760,000 cigarettes and 175 kgs of tobacco.  Further such intensive operations are planned, to supplement the normal ongoing level of detection and enforcement activities.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also established a high level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level to examine the risks related to tobacco excise, and to monitor and optimise performance in relation to detection of counterfeit and contraband tobacco products. This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco.  These include improved profiling of passengers and freight to identify tobacco smugglers, the recent establishment of a tobacco hotline, co-ordinating national blitz style operations, evaluation and acquisition of scanning and other detection technologies and learning from best practice internationally.</P>
        <P>This strategy has resulted in the seizure of a total of 178.3m cigarettes with a retail value of approx. &euro;75.3m, and 3,369 kilos of tobacco with a retail value of approx &euro;1.2m, during the period January to December 2010.</P>
        <P>With regard to the penalties available for prosecution of tobacco smuggling related offences, the penalty on summary conviction for evasion of duties is  &euro;5,000, and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months.  The penalty on indictment is up to &euro;126,970 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or, where the value of the product concerned is greater than &euro;250,000, up to three times the value of the products.  These penalties are considered adequate.  Of course, as the Deputy is aware, the precise penalty imposed on conviction in each individual case is solely a matter for the Courts and I do not propose to make any comment in that regard.</P>
        <P>There were 94 convictions secured in the Courts for cigarette smuggling in 2010.  The fines imposed amounted to &euro;49,630 and, in addition, 13 custodial sentences and 2 community service orders were imposed.  The average fine for cigarette smuggling offences in 2010 was &euro;527.</P>
        <P>A further 40 convictions were secured for illegal selling of unstamped tobacco products with total fines of &euro;99,250, and 6 custodial sentences and 2 community service orders imposed.  The average fine for cigarette selling offences in 2010 is &euro;2,500.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the terms of the programme of financial support which we have agreed with our European partners and the IMF, there is a recommendation that we should introduce a fiscal rule such that any additional unplanned revenues which arise will be allocated to deficit and debt reduction.  In Budget 2010, published in December 2009, it was outlined that as part of the ongoing reform of the budgetary process, consideration would be given to the use of surplus once-off revenues which arise in future years to reduce the deficit and thereby contribute to reducing the debt burden.  In practical terms, this means that any bonus or surplus revenues generated above what was forecast should not be used to allow expenditure to increase above the level budgeted for while still recording a deficit in line with that originally projected.  Instead, they should be used to reduce the deficit and hence the debt burden.</P>
        <P>Given the large deficit that currently exists in the public finances and the sharp increase in the level of national debt in recent years which has required an ever increasing share of tax revenues to be used to service the national debt, this is a sensible course of action and one that the Government was examining in any event, as outlined in Budget 2010.  Such an approach assists in the restoration of sustainability to the public finances in as short a period as is feasible.</P>

	<P>Based on information supplied to me by the 6 covered institutions, 31 directors (including 3 public interest appointments made in December 2008) who were in place at end December 2008 remain in situ.   It has to be accepted that a complete turnover of all of the respective appointments at the covered institutions was neither practical nor desirable. Contrary to public perception, a lot of changes at director level at the covered institutions have taken place.  Of every 10 directors in place pre September 2008, 6 have departed.   What the Government has sought to do is to bring certainty to the operation of the Irish financial system by making progressive changes at board level and implementing other measures such as changes in the manner that new director appointments are now made.  I have said previously that it is not only a change of personnel that is required but a change of culture.  </P>
        <P>The public interest aspect of decisions taken at board level of these institutions has to have a much greater prominence. I would point out to the Deputy that section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 deals with the duties of directors of relevant institutions.</P>

	<P>The Public Service Agreement (Croke Park Agreement) provides a sustainable framework to manage the provision and delivery of our essential public services in a period of unprecedented pressure on public resources.  In this regard, the Exchequer Pay Bill will be approximately 8% less in 2010 over 2009 while the number of public servants has reduced by almost 12,000 since March 09, resulting in significant savings in the public service paybill.  Further savings targets for 2011 of &euro;310m, and a reduction in numbers to 301,000 as set out in the Budget Estimates, now form part of the allocation for each Department and Agency over the coming year.  The delivery of the required savings, including payroll savings, will be monitored closely, including by reference to the implementation of the Croke Park Agreement. </P>
        <P>The Implementation Body for the Agreement requested the various sectors in December last to revise their Action Plans to take account of the targets in the National Recovery Plan and the allocations made under Budget 2011.  These revised plans are due to be submitted this week.  The Implementation Body will be seeking to ensure that the plans deliver the necessary savings and efficiencies to meet the Government&rsquo;s requirements under the National Recovery Plan.  The initial assessment of the sustainable savings made under the Agreement will be made by that Body under the review which is due to take place this Spring under the terms of the Agreement.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government has devoted considerable effort, over the last two years, to ensuring the future viability of Irish banks.  Furthermore, the Deputy will also be aware that, in November 2010, the Central Bank of Ireland set new enhanced minimum capital requirements for Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, EBS and Irish Life and Permanent (ILP) at 10.5% Core Tier 1.  Additionally, the Central Bank also stipulated that the banks are required to raise sufficient capital to achieve a capital ratio of at least 12% Core Tier 1 by specified dates.  For ILP this means that they have to raise additional eligible capital of &euro;243 million by 31 May 2011.  ILP have formally confirmed that it intends to meet the additional required amount involved from its own resources.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank has also announced that it will subject the Irish banks to a stress test under its Prudential Capital Assessment Review methodology and a Prudential Liquidity Assessment Review by end March 2011.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that ILP is one of two bidders remaining in the prospective sale of EBS.  It would be wholly inappropriate and premature for me to speculate publicly on the possible outcome of this process.</P>
        <P>I have indicated previously that I wish to see a strong vibrant competitive banking system in place to meet the needs of the economy and its citizens.  I am disposed to considering, in this light, any proposals, consistent with EU State aid rules, which will achieve this objective whether that involves domestic or international participants or a combination of both.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to the money and banking statistics published by the Irish Central Bank on a monthly basis.  The figure for borrowing from the Eurosystem relating to monetary policy operations for the domestic group of credit institutions (listed at &mdash; http://www.centralbank.ie/data/site/cmbs/Credit%20Institutions%20Resident%20in%20the%20Republic%20of%20Ireland.pdf) at the end of November stood at E97.319bn.  As is the case for other Central Banks comprising part of the Eurosystem, the Central Bank of Ireland can provide other liquidity facilities to credit institutions where that is judged necessary.  The &lsquo;other assets&rsquo; figure included in the Financial Statement of the Central Bank primarily relates to this lending and at end of November the &lsquo;other assets&rsquo; figure stood at E44.674bn.  I do not believe that the comparison suggested by the Deputy is appropriate given, for example, the secured and fully collateralised nature of lending by the Eurosystem with appropriate haircuts applied under detailed rules set by the ECB. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the programme agreed with the EU/IMF provides for a recapitalisation, fundamental downsizing, restructuring and reorganisation of the banking sector.  The outcome will lead to a smaller banking system more proportionate to the size of the economy, capitalised to the highest international standards with renewed access to normal market sources of funding.  This will enable the Irish financial institutions to reduce their reliance on Eurosystem and Central Bank funding mechanisms and focus the banking system on strongly supporting the recovery of the economy.</P>

	<P>I have been advised that NAMA has now completed the transfer of loans from debtors with a nominal value of &euro;71.2 billion.  As consideration for these loans NAMA has issued &euro;30.2 billion in bonds to the five participating institutions.  NAMA issued 95% of this value in Senior Notes totalling &euro;28.65 billion with a further 5% totalling &euro;1.51 billion being issued in subordinated securities.  The senior bonds mature in March 2011 and are extendible at the option of NAMA. They are Government-guaranteed Floating Rate Notes and pay interest at a rate of 6 month Euribor or 6 month GBP Libor.  The subordinated bonds are callable perpetual fixed rate bonds which may be redeemed from March 2020 onwards.  Interest is payable annually on the subordinated bonds if NAMA is considered to be achieving its objectives.</P>
        <P>While the issuances to date cover almost all of the original loans to be acquired by NAMA a small number of loans that are subject to challenge as to their eligibility have yet to transfer.  I am advised by NAMA that further NAMA bonds totalling &euro;1.4 billion may issue in respect of these loans depending on the outcome of these challenges.</P>
        <P>In addition it is intended that individual debtor exposures of &euro;20 million or less in AIB and Bank of Ireland announced as part of the EU/IMF Programme of Support will be acquired before the end of March 2011.  It is not possible as yet to estimate the amount of bonds that <Col N="114"/>will be issued in respect of these loans.  I will be introducing proposals to amend the legislation in the near future to allow for the transfer of these loans.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the National Recovery Plan included a proposal for a site value tax which will be introduced with a fixed household charge of &euro;100 per annum in 2012, with a value-based addition being introduced in 2013.  Initial consultation on the implications of a recurrent annual tax on property has taken place with relevant stakeholders.  The Non-Principal Private Residence charge is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  However, all taxes and potential taxation measures are constantly reviewed in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.  At this stage, a decision has yet to be taken on the precise legal mechanism to be used to introduce the site value tax and whether this will be done in tax legislation such as the Finance Bill or through other legislation which may fall within the ambit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>As is customary, it is not proposed to discuss the details of the Finance Bill or of the site value tax in advance of the legislation being published.  However, the theory behind site value tax &mdash; or land value tax, as it is often called &mdash; is that tax is calculated by reference to the value of the land or site irrespective of whether there is a property on the site, or of what type of property is in place.</P>

	<P> The once-off measures announced in Budget 2011 total &euro;660 million and are comprised of asset disposals, the sale of mobile telephony licences, debt servicing savings and increased dividends. The expected yield from each of these components is set out in Table 4 on page D.17 of the Budget book.  Receipts from asset disposals will be considered during 2011 and could arise from a variety of sources.  These include property disposals, proceeds from the sale of council houses and potential purchases by the NPRF.  The Government will also consider the scope for disposals arising from the recommendations of the McCarthy Review Group on the assets and liabilities of the Commercial Semi-States.  An estimate of &euro;300 million from asset disposals has been factored into the budgetary arithmetic.</P>

        <P Just="Left">On January 5th the EFSM launched a five year bond, of which it sold &euro;5 billion.  These funds were raised at a cost of 5.51% to Ireland.  Ireland will be in receipt of this on January 12th.  A receipt equivalent to about &euro;5.8 billion is expected from the IMF on January 18th.  The cost of these funds will depend on market conditions when the funds are drawn down.  Further drawdowns from the IMF of about &euro;2.1 billion per calendar quarter are scheduled during 2011, starting in March.  Each of these drawdowns will be subject to Ireland&rsquo;s preceding quarterly review by the EU-IMF.</P>
        <P>The EFSF is likely to access the bond markets on behalf of Ireland towards the end of January and the EFSM is expected to similarly access the markets later in the first quarter.  In broad terms, the amounts drawn down from each of the three external sources are intended to be roughly equal over the course of the year.  The timing of the EFSM and EFSF receipts are subject to the market entry strategies of these bodies and discussions with the Irish authorities.  Funding from the UK is likely to commence in the third quarter of 2011 and discussions are ongoing as to the drawdown schedule.  The rate of interest is expected to be about 5.9 per cent, based on current market conditions.</P>

These include investigations by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board of the Chartered Accountants of Ireland.   The Department of Justice has informed me that two Investigation Files relating to matters in Anglo Irish Bank were submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation on 18th December, 2010 and directions are awaited.</P>

        <P>The investigation is ongoing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Investigation Team in the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation continue to conduct necessary follow-up inquiries in respect of both investigations, as well as investigations into separate complaints received regarding other alleged malpractices at Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>As recently as last week Mr. Paul Appleby, the Director of Corporate Enforcement published &lsquo;A Review of ODCE Activity in 2010&rsquo;. An extract from The Summary Review mentions the progress of the investigation into Anglo Irish Bank:</P>
        <P el="5" LI="1">&lsquo;A major preoccupation in 2010 was our continuing investigations of Anglo Irish Bank.  By year-end, we had transmitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions one file and three reports on four aspects of our investigations.  Those aspects related to:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the provision by Anglo in 2008 of a loan to one of its directors.  (The material sent to the DPP comprised a file of some 400 pages);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the non-disclosure of certain directors&rsquo; loans in Anglo&rsquo;s published financial statements over a number of years.  (The material included a 116 page report supported by about 1,200 pages of additional documents);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the provision by Anglo to a number of persons in 2008 of financial assistance for the purchase of its shares.  (The material sent to the DPP comprised a 28 page report supplemented by about 400 pages of extra documents);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the communication of possible false or misleading information in certain Anglo public statements in 2008.  (The material included a 98 page report supported by close to 1,300 pages of additional documents).</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0" el="5">Further work is ongoing, and this is expected to result in the submission of extra documentation to the DPP in early 2011.&rsquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Regarding the four Reports presented by Special Investigator, Mr. John Purcell to the Complaints Committee of the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board (CARB) of the Chartered Accountants of Ireland, certified that, in his opinion, there existed certain prima facie cases that Institute members, Mr. David Drumm, Mr. Sean FitzPatrick, Mr. William McAteer and Mr. Peter Fitzpatrick, were liable to disciplinary action under the Bye-Laws of Chartered Accountants Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Complaints Committee referred those prima facie cases to CARB&rsquo;s Disciplinary Committee by way of Formal Complaints under the provisions of Bye-Law 72.6 of the Bye-Laws of Chartered Accountants Ireland.</P>
        <P>It would not be appropriate for me to comment on those matters until the investigations have been completed except to say that I welcome the fact that the Garda&iacute; and ODCE investigations have now reached a point where the DPP can make an assessment on the matter.</P>

	<P>It has been clear for some time that our banks were facing serious challenges in terms of their liquidity position.  Lingering concerns in the market regarding their capital position has led to negative market sentiment.  In addition unfavourable, and in some cases, irresponsible media reports have contributed to this negative sentiment.   The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank of Ireland collects data from the resident offices of all credit institutions, and publishes an aggregate balance sheet for all institutions and for the domestic group.  The domestic group comprises 21 Credit Institutions (including the institutions subject to the Deposit Guarantee Scheme) and the Credit Unions.</P>
        <P>For the domestic group there was a fall in resident deposits of &euro;13.6 billion; and non-resident deposits fell by &euro;55.9 billion, totalling &euro;69.5 billion.</P>
        <P>The Financial Programme with the European Commission/ECB/IMF does not propose any departure from existing policy, indeed its prescription is an intensification and acceleration of the restructuring process already being undertaken by the Irish banks.  A key objective of the Programme is to ensure that the size of the domestic banking system is proportionate to the size of the economy and is appropriately aligned with the funding capacity of the banks overall, taking into account stable sources of deposit and wholesale funding.</P>
        <P>It is important to point out that under the ELG Scheme in place until end 2011, deposit balances in the covered institutions continue to be guaranteed.  The permanent Deposit Guarantee Scheme is in place for retail deposits up to &euro;100,000.  Since the signing of the agreement with the European Commission/ECB/IMF in December 2010, significant work is underway by the relevant authorities to complete the Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR) and the Prudential Liquidity Assessment Plan (PLAR), these being two important components of the agreement, to be completed by end March.</P>
        <P>The completion of these projects will bring additional confidence to the Irish Banking system.</P>
        <P>The Government is determined to rebuild consumer and investor confidence in our financial system.  Under the terms of the Programme agreement, and as I have already mentioned, the restoration of normal market funding of our banking system is a central objective of the Programme overall.</P>

The rate of progress in this sales process will be impacted by the demand in the market and the availability of purchasers.  Section 55 of the NAMA Act 2009 requires NAMA to make a quarterly report to the Minister for Finance within 3 months of the end of the quarter to which the report refers and these reports will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The quarterly report includes, among other things, information on the number of loans being foreclosed or otherwise enforced and the amount of money recovered by NAMA through the sale of property.  The quarterly report for the third quarter has been submitted to me and I expect to lay it before both Houses shortly.</P>

	<P>The end-year Exchequer Returns of revenues and expenditure for 2010 provide further evidence of the stabilisation in the public finances.  The overall Exchequer Balance of &euro;18.7 billion is in line with my Department&rsquo;s estimates set out in December 2009.  Tax receipts were &euro;703 million or 2.3% above target while voted expenditure of Government Departments was almost &euro;730 million or 1.5% down year-on-year, demonstrating the positive impact of decisions taken by Government.  The stabilisation of our tax revenues and the achievement of the Exchequer deficit target as set out in December 2009 are encouraging signs and indicate that the underlying General Government deficit should come in at 11.6% of GDP.  This is in line with my Department&rsquo;s Budget day forecast in December 2009 and means we will achieve our stated aim of stabilising the deficit ratio at the underlying 2009 level. </P>
        <P>The Exchequer Returns for 2010 confirm my analysis that the public finances have stabilised.  These figures, in tandem with the encouraging economic data for the third quarter of 2010, mean we enter 2011 on the road to economic recovery and that the targets set in Budget 2011 are achievable.</P>
        <P>The Government has consistently identified export-led growth as the strategy that will return this economy to growth and generate jobs.  This strategy is working thanks to the improvement of competitiveness, and the flexibility and adaptability of the Irish economy. Exports in 2010 were at an all-time high and represented growth of 6.2% on 2009. This strong performance was particularly positive in the manufacturing and agri-food sectors.</P>

	<P>On 3 June 2010 the High Court granted the Joint Administrators permission to appoint advisers on any prospective sale of Quinn Insurance Ltd (QIL).   The advisers, on behalf of the Joint Administrators, issued an information memorandum on 27 August on the sale of the company to interested parties which set out a two stage process for selecting a purchaser.  The first stage required the submission of a non-binding indicative proposal by Friday 17 September 2010.</P>
        <P>I understand that following evaluation by the advisers and the Joint Administrators of the above mentioned proposals, a limited number of prospective purchasers were shortlisted by the Administrators to participate in Phase II of the sale process.  They have conducted further due diligence including the consideration of the necessary commercial information, enabling them to make a final bid.</P>
        <P>The Joint Administrators are currently considering the final bids.  Once a preferred bidder is chosen the Administrators will enter into detailed discussions with them to seek to conclude an agreement.  I understand that the Administrators wish to conclude a sale transaction as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy should note that the Joint Administrators are working to find a solution that addresses the issue of putting the company back on a sound commercial and financial footing.  As part of that process their role is to assess bids which will protect the interests of policyholders and which will enable the company to operate as a going concern.  The retention and protection of employment is of course an important element of the Administrators&rsquo; responsibilities subject to their statutory responsibilities.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that within the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Assistance to Ireland, the Central Bank will complete the PLAR for 2011 by the end of March 2011.  The PLAR process will look at the measures to be implemented with a view to steadily deleveraging the banking system and reduce the bank&rsquo;s reliance on short term funding by the end of the programme period.  The setting of loan to deposit ratios is deferred on the initiative of the external authorities and targets will be informed by the Central Bank&rsquo;s ongoing PLAR work. </P>
        <P>The target loan-to-deposit ratios, once agreed, are designed to ensure that convergence to Basel III standards can be readily met by the relevant dates.  To this end, the PLAR will establish target funding ratios for each of the banks, identify non-core assets and set an adjustment path to these targets based on specified non public annual benchmarks.  The design and implementation of the PLAR will be agreed with the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  Compliance with the PLAR benchmarks will be monitored and enforced by the Central Bank taking account of prevailing market conditions.  The PLAR will also be updated on an annual basis.</P>

	<P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) was established in 2001 under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000.  The purpose in establishing the NPRF was to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 until at least 2055.  The legislation was amended by the Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009 and the Credit Insitutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 to allow the Minister for Finance to direct the NPRF Commission, which is responsible for the control, management and investment of the assets of the Fund, to invest in credit institutions in certain circumstances, government and government-guaranteed securities and to make payments to the Exchequer to fund capital expenditure in the years 2011 to 2013.  </P>
        <P>The Commission is required to invest the assets of the Fund, excluding investments made at the direction of the Minister for Finance, so as to secure the optimal total financial return, having regard to the purpose of the Fund and the eventual requirements on the Fund to make payments to the Exchequer, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission.  In relation to the creation of employment, the Government announced in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 that it would help identify public infrastructure investment opportunities for the NPRF and that the Commission had agreed in principle to fund the domestic water meter installation programme.  The Fund is also a participant in Innovation Fund Ireland and has made other Irish venture capital investments.  The Commission is of course required to satisfy itself that such investments are is in accordance with its investment mandate.</P>
        <P>The latest published figure for the value of NPRF in 2010 is to the end of December, when the value of the Fund was &euro;24.4 billion.</P>

These will include the cost of travelling to a destination but are more likely to be influenced by the cost structure within that destination, and the range of activities and visitor attractions on offer.  However, taking account of some of the comments made last year, I announced in the Budget a single revised rate of air travel tax of &euro;3 with effect from 1 March 2011 and will assess the impact of this to see if passenger numbers are affected.</P>

        <P>The Central Bank has set out the further capital that will be required by AIB, BOI and EBS in order for them to meet a 12% core tier 1 ratio by the end of February 2011 as agreed in the <Col N="123"/>Programme for Financial Support with the IMF, EU and the ECB.  In this regard, the position is as follows:</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In order to meet its target AIB in December 2010 received a net capital injection of &euro;3.7 billion from the National Pension Reserve Fund.  To meet its core tier 1 ratio, it will require a further &euro;6.1 billion which the State remains committed to meeting to the extent that it cannot be met through capital raising measures by the bank itself.  This is expected to be met through a combination of fresh capital from the State, the execution of a liability management exercise in relation to existing subordinated debt holders and other capital generative measures ongoing by the bank.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Central Bank has instructed Bank of Ireland to raise a further &euro;2.2 billion to reach a 12% core tier 1 ratio by the end of February 2011.  To date Bank of Ireland has raised some &euro;700 million of this capital requirement through an LME exercise and intends to seek to generate the remaining required capital through a combination of internal capital management initiatives, support from existing shareholders and other capital markets sources.  On 10 January 2011 Bank of Ireland announced the completion of the sale of Bank of Ireland Asset Management to State Street Global Advisors.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />EBS is now required to raise an additional &euro;438m Core Tier 1 capital to achieve a capital ratio of at least 12% core tier 1 by 28 February 2011.  The final amount of additional State support, if any, will not be known until the outcome of the sales process is finalised.</P>

The terms of the Promissory Note provides that, inter alia, 10% of the initial principal amount shall be paid in March each year to the holder of the Note.  In the case of Anglo, this amounts to &euro;2.528m per annum, with the first such payment falling at the end of March 2011 from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />With regard to INBS, I have injected capital amounting to &euro;5.4 billion into the society.  This comprised a &euro;100m cash injection in return for INBS Special Investment Shares and &euro;5.3 billion by way of a Promissory Note.  The terms of the INBS Promissory Note provides that, inter alia, 10% of the initial principal amount shall be paid in March each year to the holder of the Note.

This comprised a &euro;625 million cash injection in return for EBS Special Investment Shares and &euro;250 million by way of a Promissory Note.  The terms of the Promissory Note provides that, inter alia, 10% of the initial principal amount shall be paid in June each year to the holder of the Note.

        <P>The agreed joint EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support builds upon the banking measures taken to date and provides for further reform and reorganisation of the banking sector.  The objective of the Programme, in so far as it relates to banking, is to fundamentally downsize and reorganise the sector so that it is proportionate to the size of the economy.  It also envisages that the sector will be capitalised to the highest international standards and will also be in a position to return to normal market sources of funding.  The Programme provides for a range of deleveraging measures, including appropriate actions to dispose of assets, as well as the enhanced re-capitalisation of certain banks.  To this end, the Government provided further capital of &euro;3.7 billion to Allied Irish Banks, &euro;6.1 billion to Anglo Irish Bank, &euro;2.7 billion to INBS and &euro;525 million to EBS in December to ensure these institutions met their year end 2010 regulatory requirements of the Central Bank of Ireland.  This was consistent with the objective of the joint IMF-EU programme to move Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Irish Life and Permanent and EBS towards higher levels of capital and additional steps will be taken in the current year.</P><Col N="125"/>
        <P>Further restructuring and viability plans for the relevant credit institutions will be submitted to the European Commission, including plans for the resolution of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society in a manner that will fully protect their depositors, realise the maximum value from the two institutions&rsquo; non-NAMA assets over time and minimise capital losses.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed that the bank is increasing charges for its current account customers but can understand why they are doing so. The Government operates an arm&rsquo;s length relationship with the banks in which the State has a shareholding and the commercial decisions on how best to operate the bank remain a matter for management and the board.   </P>
        <P>I have no role in approving or setting bank charges.  This responsibility lies with the Central Bank. Under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, banks must make a submission to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce or increase charges in respect of a service.</P>
        <P>I would also advise the Deputy that the National Consumer Agency&rsquo;s website www.itsyourmoney.ie   provides a cost comparison table on the main current accounts provided by individual firms which includes details of how to qualify for free account maintenance and transactions.</P>
        <P>As part of the restructuring plan process currently underway with the European Commission it has been proposed that the domestic banking sector will be required to support and promote the availability of a basic bank account.  This is to be done in the context of the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s strategy on financial inclusion in the State.</P>
        <P>Work is underway on a review of the options available to achieve greater financial inclusion, including the introduction of basic bank accounts by year end 2011.  The objective of the review, which is being undertaken by the Social Finance Foundation on my behalf, is to identify recom<Col N="126"/>mended actions to achieve a substantial reduction in financial exclusion over a 3 &mdash; 5 year period.</P>
        <P>The preparation of the review is being overseen by a steering group chaired by my Department and comprising key stakeholders.  I expect to receive a draft report which sets out the recommendations from the review sometime in the first quarter of this year, and I intend to publish this for consultation purposes.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The EU Commission estimated that the average interest rate on the &euro;67.5 billion available to be drawn from the three external sources under the EU &mdash; IMF programme would be 5.82 per cent on the basis of market rates at the time of the agreement. The actual cost will depend on the prevailing market rates at the time of each drawdown. The average life of the borrowings, which will involve a combination of longer and shorter dated maturities, under each of these sources will be approximately 7.5 years.</P>
        <P>The IMF lending is denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).  The SDR comprises a basket of four currencies, Euro, Sterling, the US Dollar and Japanese Yen.  The IMF&rsquo;s SDR lending rate is based on the three month floating interest rates for the currencies in the basket.  In the presentation of the financial support programme the interest cost on the IMF&rsquo;s floating rate SDR lending was expressed by the EU as the equivalent rate if the funds were fully swapped into fixed rate Euro of 7&frac12; years maturity and was estimated to be 5.7 per cent per annum.  This expressed the interest rate in terms which could be compared with the cost of borrowing from the EU sources at the time of the agreement.</P>

	<P>The Central Bank has set out the further capital that will be required by AIB, BOI and EBS in order for them to meet a 12% core tier 1 ratio by the end of February 2011 as agreed in the Programme for Financial Support with the IMF, EU and the ECB.    </P>
        <P>In order to meet this target AIB in December 2010 received a net capital injection of EUR3.7bn from the National Pension Reserve Fund.  It will require a further &euro;6.1 billion which the State remains committed to meeting to the extent that it cannot be met through capital raising measures by the bank itself.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank has instructed Bank of Ireland to raise a further &euro;2.2 billion to reach a 12% core tier 1 ratio by the end of February 2011. To date Bank of Ireland has raised some &euro;700 million of this capital requirement through an LME exercise and intends to seek to generate the remaining required capital through a combination of internal capital management initiatives, support from existing shareholders and other capital markets sources.  On 10 January 2011 Bank of Ireland announced the completion of the sale of Bank of Ireland Asset Management to State Street Global Advisors.</P>
        <P>In December 2010 &euro;525 million of capital was injected into EBS building society in return for the issuance of special investment shares.  The Central Bank has instructed that EBS must raise an additional &euro;438 million to meet the revised target. The State remains committed to meeting the remaining capital requirement, to the extent that private capital is not forthcoming. In relation to the sales process two bids for EBS are now being considered; one from Irish Life &amp; Permanent and the other from an international consortium led by Cardinal Capital Group.  The process of final negotiations with these parties is continuing and it would not be proper for me to comment further on the detail at this stage.</P>

	<P>There are no proposals to make any changes to the structure of the NAMA SPV.  The recent acquisition of a majority shareholding in AIB does not have any implications for the ownership structure in NAMA.  While a group of clients of Allied Irish Banks Investment Managers, have invested &euro;17m in the NAMA SPV, it is important to note that the beneficial owners of the investment are pension funds or other clients of these investment companies and not the parent credit institution.  </P>
        <P>In relation to the recent Exchequer Statement reclassification of the &euro;49 million advance for share capital of the NAMA SPV, I can confirm that is purely a classification issue and has no impact on the ownership of the NAMA Master SPV.  An advance was made to NAMA from the Central Fund to allow NAMA to acquire a 49% share in the NAMA Master SPV.  The transfer from the Central Fund therefore is now correctly classified as a loan to NAMA as opposed to an investment in share capital acquired as this share capital isn&rsquo;t directly held by the Exchequer but held by NAMA.  I would stress that this has no impact on the ownership of NAMA.  This reclassification has no impact on the General Government Debt as the &euro;49m is still accounted for as non-voted capital expenditure.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Bill 2010 was published on 14 December 2010, completed all Stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas over the course of 15 and 16 December 2010 and has been signed into law by the President as the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010.  The Act provides the legislative basis for the reorganisation and restructuring of the banking system agreed in the joint EU &mdash; IMF Programme for Ireland.  It provides broad powers to the Minister for Finance (in consultation with the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland) to act on financial stability grounds to effect the restructuring actions and recapitalisation measures envisaged in the Programme.  The Act applies to banks that have received financial support from the State, domestic building societies and credit unions.     </P>
        <P>The Act is the first important step in putting in place an extensive Special Resolution Regime (SRR) that will provide for a comprehensive framework to facilitate the orderly management and resolution of distressed credit institutions.  As agreed under the Programme, draft legislation providing for the introduction of a comprehensive SRR, consistent with best international practice and the evolving EU framework, is scheduled for introduction to the Oireachtas by end-February 2011.</P>
        <P>The Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 also provides for the amendment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2008 to facilitate the State&rsquo;s own contribution to the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland over the next three years.</P><Col N="129"/>
        <P>In addition to the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act, the NAMA legislation will be amended to underpin the valuation and acquisition of land and development loans below a value threshold of &euro;20m.</P>
        <P>The Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1927 effectively requires that the Finance Act must be enacted within four months of Budget Day.   For this year&rsquo;s Budget Day of 7th December, the Finance Bill has to be signed by the President by 6th April.<b><i> </i>  </b>  The Finance Bill 2011 will be published on 20th January 2011 and is scheduled to have passed all stages by the 25th February 2011.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Act, 2010 has been passed.  Provisions announced in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 in relation to the National Minimum Wage and the reduction of public service pension costs require legislation, and to this end the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill 2010 has been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>In the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, the Government sets out proposals for a range of budget reforms to underpin the sustainability of the Irish public finances into the future, including a Budget Advisory Council to provide an independent commentary on the Government&rsquo;s budgetary planning, by means of assessing the appropriateness of the budgetary stance and the aggregate targets being adopted;  a medium term expenditure framework to ensure that public expenditure is managed within fixed, sustainable limits;  and a Fiscal Responsibility Law to put key reform measures on a statutory basis.  These commitments are also reflected in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.   The Government intends to bring forward a Fiscal Responsibility Bill in the near future.</P>
        <P>Other areas where it is at present envisaged that legislation will arise in the context of the EU-IMF Programme are detailed in the Memorandum of Understanding which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 14 December 2010.   Many of the proposals concerned are already contained in the National Recovery Plan.   These include measures related to the labour market including measures designed to reduce the risk of long-term unemployment; increases to the state pension age under the Government&rsquo;s National Pension Framework; and legislative changes to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors and to enhance competition in open markets.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the plan to reorganise the banking system in Ireland is a key part of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Assistance to Ireland.  This reorganisation has several elements, which will be bolstered by raising capital standards.  While I expect that, in a restructured system, banks will be able to raise capital in the market, I recognise that the higher standards may imply that public provision of capital could be needed in the short term for banks that are deemed to be viable.  To support this process &mdash; and to render it credible &mdash; the Central Bank is undertaking a review of the capital needs of banks, called the Prudential Capital Assessment Review 2011, or PCAR, on the basis of current asset valuations and stringent stress tests.  This review will build on the <Col N="130"/>previous PCAR announced in my Statement to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of 30 September 2010, and is due to be completed by 31 March 2011.</P>
        <P>The design and planning of the PCAR are already well under way and the terms of reference for its design and implementation have already been agreed between the Central Bank, the European Commission, IMF and ECB staff.  Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, ILP and EBS will be subject, as previously announced, to a stress test in March 2011 under the Central Bank&rsquo;s PCAR methodology.  If, as a result of the PCAR, banks are assessed to require additional capital, the Central Bank may impose this requirement on them.</P>
        <P>The PCAR, along with all the other measures being taken to stabilise the banking system, should enhance confidence in the solvency of the banking system in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the National Pension Reserve Fund will provide up to &euro;10 billion of the State&rsquo;s &euro;17.5 billion contribution to the &euro;85 billion EU-IMF programme.  Any further capital requirements, if required, arising from the PCAR will be subject to alternative sources of financing, subject to the agreement of the Irish Authorities and the International Bodies.</P>

	<P>Under the NAMA legislation, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are required to lend &euro;3bn per annum (covering the period April to April) to SMEs. In my statement on banking at the end of March 2010, I asked AIB and Bank of Ireland to produce creditable plans for the achievement of that target. The Deputy will be aware that my Department and Mr. Trethowan of the Credit Review Office receive monthly progress reports from the two banks which allow us to monitor their lending to viable businesses in all sectors of the economy and in every area of the country.  I also established the Credit Review Office to ensure that AIB and Bank of Ireland would lend to viable businesses.  Mr. Trethowan has recently reported to the Department that both AIB and Bank of Ireland remain open for business and I would strongly encourage borrowers to use the Credit Review Office if they find this is not so.</P>
        <P>Mr. Trethowan also found no evidence that banks have been indiscriminately refusing credit on formal loan applications. He also reported that no trade sector or geographical region was adversely affected by lending decisions</P>
        <P>My officials are working on an ongoing basis with their colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the Credit Review Office, Enterprise Ireland and Forf&aacute;s to address access to credit issues for viable SMEs.</P>
        <P>In relation to credit to families, I am not aware of any specific difficulties with access to personal credit from credit worthy individuals. The latest figures on mortgage lending published by the IBF/PWC for quarter 3 of 2010 show that while new mortgage lending continues to be low, it is still running at over &euro;1 billion per quarter.</P>

	<P>The savings targets for 2011 are as set out in the Budget Estimates and now form part of the allocation for each Department and Agency over the coming year.  These savings targets are based on a reduction of public service numbers to 301,000 by the end of 2011, through the continued implementation of the moratorium on recruitment, and other savings to be realised through a range of reform measures, including those set out in the Croke Park Agreement.  The contribution of the health sector voluntary early retirement (VER) scheme/voluntary redundancy scheme (VRS) to these savings was provisionally estimated at around &euro;123 million, with a corresponding reduction in the numbers employed of some 2,250 staff on a whole-time equivalents (w.t.e.) basis, based on an up-front cost ceiling of &euro;250 million and depending on the take up of the early retirement/voluntary redundancy options between management/administrative and support staff.  As is normal, each Department and Agency will be expected to take appropriate steps to remain within their 2011 Estimate allocation.  The delivery of the required savings, including payroll savings, will be monitored closely and any necessary policy adjustments would have to be considered in that overall context during the course of 2011 and later years.</P>
        <P>I understand that the latest figures on take up under the VER/VRS is approximately 2,000 on a headcount basis but my Department is still awaiting final figures on costs and savings from the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.  It would be a matter for the HSE and Department of Health and Children in the first instance to assess the implications of the actual take up of the scheme and to make proposals to my Department in the matter, if appropriate.</P>

        <Quest> the extent to which the subordinated bondholders of Irish banks in receipt of State support have been made shoulder some of the burden for their unwise investments; if he will provide a breakdown by institution of the total outstanding subordinated debts and their market values; the total subordinated liabilities paid back in full or in part since the introduction of the blanket bank guarantee in September 2008; the timescale and the mechanism for the imposition of further burden sharing on these subordinated bondholders; the amount of capital he expects to generate in this manner; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As detailed in the following tables, holders of subordinated debt in the covered institutions have experienced significant burden sharing which reduced the amount of State support that has been required by them.  As set out in the tables, several of the institutions have carried out Liability Management Exercises (LMEs) in which their subordinated debt has been subject to buy-backs at very significant discounts.  The Deputy will also be aware as part of the Joint Programme agreed with the EU and IMF at the end of November last, the Government is committed to achieving further burden sharing with holders of subordinated debt over the period of the programme.  In line with the terms of the agreement and my Statement on Banking in September 2010 this will be achieved through deeply discounted LMEs or, if necessary, and subject to the provisions of the Credit Institutions Stabilisation Act enacted late last year by legislative means.  The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the tables following:</P>

	<P>As part of the restructuring plan process currently under way with the European Commission it has been proposed that the domestic banking sector will be required to support and promote the availability of a basic bank account. This is to be done in the context of the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s strategy on financial inclusion in the State.  Work is under way on a review of the options available to achieve greater financial inclusion &mdash; including the introduction of basic bank accounts by year end 2011. The objective of the review, which is being undertaken by the Social Finance Foundation on my behalf, is to identify recommended actions to achieve a substantial reduction in financial exclusion over a 3-5 year period. </P>
        <P>The preparation of the review is being overseen by a steering group chaired by my Department and comprising key stakeholders. I expect to receive a draft report which sets out the recommendations from the review sometime in the first quarter of this year, and I intend to publish this for consultation purposes.</P>

	<P>The Programme of Financial Support for Ireland provides for financial sector reforms including further deleveraging of the banks which is to be in part achieved by transferring land and development loans from AIB and Bank of Ireland to NAMA which had been previously excluded from transfer by virtue of their being below a value threshold of &euro;20m.  The Programme requires that &ldquo;[t]he NAMA legislation will be amended to underpin the valuation and acquisition of these assets on a portfolio basis&rdquo; and that NAMA will apply different discounts to categories of loans &ldquo;based on NAMA&rsquo;s loan valuation experience up to the point of valuation.&rdquo;.  I will be introducing proposals to amend the legislation in near future to allow for the transfer of these pooled categorised eligible assets.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Central Bank that the most recent published figure for the accounting reserves of the Bank is &euro;1.5 billion.  At 31 December 2010 the total value of the National Pensions Reserve Fund was &euro;24.4 billion. This figure comprised &euro;9.5 billion in the Directed Portfolio (the value of investments in Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks held on the direction of the Minister for Finance) and &euro;14.9 billion in the Discretionary Portfolio (the balance of the Fund excluding directed investments).</P>
        <P>As announced on 28 November 2010, the assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund are to be used as part of the State&rsquo;s &euro;17.5 billion contribution to the &euro;85 billion EU-IMF programme of lending to this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s commitments to helping families in difficulty with their mortgages and personal debt under the Renewed Programme for Government and in that context the recent work completed by the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert Group (Expert Group) which was set up by me last February. The Deputy will also be aware that the Expert Group produced two Reports, an Interim Report published in July 2010 and their Final Report published in November 2010.  The Expert Group, which was chaired by Mr. Hugh Cooney, included Mr. Matthew Elderfield, Head of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority as well as other external experts and senior officials from Government Departments. All of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations are listed in Chapter 2 of the Final Report and have been noted by Government. They can be accessed at www.finance.gov.ie.  Since the publication of the Reports the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) has been revised by the Central Bank to reflect many of the recommendations of the Expert Group including key recommendations relating to the introduction by all regulated lenders of a standardised Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP). The most significant changes in the revised CCMA include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Borrowers in arrears who co-operate with the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) will not be charged penalty interest charges;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Harassment of borrowers through unsolicited communications will be outlawed;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Borrowers in financial difficulties, but not in arrears, will be allowed to come under the MARP. And</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Clarifying the existing 12 month moratorium on legal action in arrears cases.</P>
<P FLI="0">The revised CCMA was published on 6 December 2010 and came into effect on 1 January 2011. The revised CCMA can be accessed at www.centralbank.ie. Lenders are required to comply with the CCMA as a matter of law but have been given a period of six months grace ending on 30 June 2011 to put in place the requisite systems and training of staff necessary to support the implementation of the MARP. In addition the Central Bank has also written to lenders to issue directions under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which will mean that lenders cannot impose arrears charges or penalty interest on borrowers who are co-operating with the MARP.</P><Col N="136"/>
       <P>The Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations are intended to be of benefit to both lender and borrower and it is assumed that lenders will cooperate and implement the recommendations or variations of them as soon as possible. Failure to comply with the revised CCMA may result in sanctions under the Administrative Sanctions Framework.</P>
       <P>Lenders representing the majority of the market have already indicated their willingness to implement the Expert Group&rsquo;s proposals for a Deferred Interest Scheme (DIS)  or a variation of it and the remaining participants will be requested to do so. The Deputy will be aware from media reports that AIB, Bank of Ireland, EBS, and Irish Life and Permanent are reported to have signed up to the DIS. The DIS is to apply to those homeowners unable to pay full interest on their mortgages but able to pay at least 66%. While the DIS is voluntary for all lenders, those who have signed up in support of the scheme will be monitored by the Financial Regulator to ensure compliance.</P>
     <P>The Deputy may wish to note that in addition to those recommendations being implemented through amendments to the CCMA, other recommendations will require legislative support involving my Department, the Departments of Social Protection (DSP), Environment, Heritage and Local Government (DEHLG), Justice and Law Reform (DJLR).</P>
        <P>In the case of my own Department, recommendations to do with the scope and the admissibility in Court of the CCMA will be examined in the context of the preparation of the second Central Bank Bill.</P>
        <P>In order to implement those recommendations in relation to the mortgage interest supplement scheme (MIS) changes to both primary and secondary legislation will be required. The Department of Social Protection is currently developing an implementation plan that will set out a framework for the future of the scheme.</P>
        <P>New regulations and guidance are currently being developed by DEHLG in the context of the social housing reform programme to provide that housing authorities could disregard the household&rsquo;s current accommodation for the purposes of determining eligibility for social housing support. I am informed that work is ongoing on the development of a new needs assessment process which will allow an earlier trigger point for the social housing needs assessment process to take place where a case has been determined to be unsustainable in the long term, following exploration of all other options.  It has already been indicated by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to the House on several occasions that he intends to give early attention to the Final Report on <i>Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement</i> of the Law Reform Commission which was recently published. That Report contains recommendations on comprehensive reform of the system of personal insolvency law in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As I have said the Financial Regulator was a member of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and staff in my Department are in regular contact with staff in the Central Bank on matters to do with the implementation of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am considering how best to implement the commitment contained in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 to identify further ways to tackle increases in insurance costs.  I am aware of the increased pressure on insurance premiums in recent times particularly in the household insurance area. Much of this is due to the unprecedented level of claims which the insurance industry suffered in the winter of 2009/2010. The <Col N="137"/>insurance industry estimated that, between the November 2009 flooding and the big freeze at the start of 2010, they have paid out about 550 million euro worth of claims. The industry has put the level of claims in further context by indicating that the insured cost of these two weather events exceeded the total cost of all serious weather events that have occurred in the last decade. This cost was estimated at 358 million euro. A further increase in the number of claims is expected because of the recent inclement weather.</P>
        <P>Even in advance of the weather-related claims, market analysts had identified and reported on a number of important market developments that were expected to lead to upward pressure on premiums.  For example, the 2009 Standard &amp; Poors report on the non-life insurance market warned that the next few years were likely to mark a testing time for Irish non-life insurers.  In particular, the report highlighted that underwriting profitability would become much more important due, for example, to the volatility of global stock markets amongst other factors.  The report noted the importance of price discipline to ensure the long-term economics of the insurance marketplace.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy might wish to note that neither the Central Bank nor I, in my role as Minister for Finance, can prohibit or restrict an insurance company from increasing its annual premium rates. This is a commercial decision for the company in question based on an assessment of the risks involved.</P>

	<P>A comprehensive reorganisation and downsizing of the banking sector was agreed under the Programme of Financial Support for Ireland as part of the financial sector reform measures.  The State has given an undertaking to divest the stakes it has taken in the banks due to the financial crisis within the shortest timeframe possible which is compatible with financial stability and public finance considerations.  Regarding INBS, I had previously indicated in my statement of 30 September 2010 that INBS does not have a future as a stand-alone entity and will have to be sold or amalgamated with another institution.  To that end proposals are under active consideration, and will shortly be submitted to the European Commission, that will provide for the resolution and work-out of INBS in a manner that will fully protect its depositors and realise the maximum value for the taxpayer from its non-NAMA assets over time.</P>
        <P>In relation to the EBS sales process two bids are now being considered; one from Irish Life &amp; Permanent and the other from an international consortium led by Cardinal Capital Group.  The process of final negotiations with these parties is continuing and it would not be proper for me to comment further on the detail at this stage.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 138 together. </P>
        <P>In the <i>National Recovery Programme 2011-2014, </i>the Government commits to the introduction of a Budget Advisory Council to provide independent assessment of the Government&rsquo;s economic forecasts and proposed fiscal stance.  This commitment is also reflected in the programme of support agreed with the EU and IMF.</P>
        <P>The Government intends to bring forward a Fiscal Responsibility Bill in the near future which will provide for the establishment of the envisaged Budget Advisory Council and other matters.  As the role of the envisaged Budget Advisory Council is to provide independent assessment of the Government&rsquo;s economic forecasts and the fiscal stance, I have no plans to provide for a Budget Commissioner or similar office as proposed by the Deputy&rsquo;s party.</P>
        <P>I note that the proposed new budgetary timeline, including the publication of a Stability Programme Update in April of each year, should facilitate the D&aacute;il and its relevant Committees in engaging more effectively with the budget formation process.</P>

	<P>No change in the 21% standard rate of VAT was announced in the 2011 Budget.  However, as part of the National Recovery Plan, it is proposed that the standard rate of VAT will increase by 1 percentage point to 22% from 1 January 2013, with a further increase on 1 January 2014 to 23%.  The combined yield from these measures is expected to be &euro;620m in a full year and should increase inflation by 0.72%.</P>
        <P>The VAT changes are being introduced in the second half of the period covered by the Plan.  It was decided that the initial years of the Plan should focus of fiscal measures in the areas of income tax, pensions and tax expenditures. For example, some 65% of the total income tax adjustments outlined in the Plan are being made in 2011. In addition the VAT take in Ireland is already relatively high by international standards.</P>

	<P>The policy conditionality associated with the EU-IMF Programme for Ireland is set out in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies and in the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality.  These documents together with the Technical Memorandum of Understanding which are collectively referred to as the MoU have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The position in relation to quarterly reviews is summarised in the following extract from the MoU. &ldquo;The quarterly disbursement of financial assistance from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) On 28 November 2010 Eurogroup and ECOFIN Ministers issued a statement clarifying that euro-area and EU financial support will be provided on the basis of the programme which has been negotiated with the Irish authorities by the Commission and the IMF, in liaison with the ECB. Further to the Union support from the EFSM, loans from the EU and its Member States will include contributions from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and bilateral lending support from the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Denmark. The Loan Facility Agreements on these financing contributions will specify that the disbursements thereunder are subject to the compliance with the conditions of this Memorandum will be subject to quarterly reviews of conditionality for the duration of the programme. Release of the instalments will be based on observance of quantitative performance criteria, respect for EU Council Decisions and Recommendations in the context of the excessive deficit procedure, and a positive evaluation of progress made with respect to policy criteria in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and in this Memorandum of Understanding on specific economic policy conditionality (MoU), which specifies the detailed criteria that will be assessed for the successive reviews up to the end of 2013. If targets are (expected to be) missed, additional action will be taken. </P>
        <P>The authorities commit to consult with the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF on the adoption of policies that are not consistent with this Memorandum. They will also provide the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF with all information requested that is available to monitor progress during programme implementation and to track the economic and financial situation. Prior to the release of the instalments, the authorities shall provide a compliance report on the fulfilment of the conditionality.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>As the Government is committed to ensuring compliance with the policy conditionality of the MoU, the question of emergency budgets or measures is not at present envisaged.</P>

While I am aware of the Chancellor&rsquo;s views, I do not currently have any plans to meet with Chancellor Merkel in relation to the matter mentioned by the Deputy. However, I am in regular contact with my European colleagues, including the German Finance Minister Herr Sch&auml;uble, through the monthly Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings of Finance Ministers. Similarly, the Taoiseach meets Chancellor Merkel, and the other European Heads of State, at the regular Council of Minister meetings. These fora offer regular opportunities for emerging proposals and issues to be discussed both formally and informally.</P>

	<P>I have no function in the approval of banking charges. This is a matter for the Central Bank, which has statutory responsibility in this area. Under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, banks may only impose charges up to the maximum levels approved by the Central Bank.  Where a bank has exempted customers who meet certain criteria from charges, and subsequently change the criteria, there is no requirement for any subsequent notification to, or approval by, the Central Bank provided the charges are within the permitted limits. </P>
        <P>Any proposed changes to charges or qualifying criteria must be notified to customers in advance. In the case of current accounts the minimum notice period is two months and must be in accordance with terms and conditions of the account.</P>
        <P>Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, applies to credit institutions, money transmitters and bureaux de change.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 144 together.</P>
        <P>In 2010, following a public tender process, Indecon International Economic Consultants were awarded the contract to provide technical economic assistance to officials in Government Departments conducting Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs) and other technical exercises relating to the Better Regulation agenda.  The aim is to help Departments improve the quality of the quantitative assessment of legislative proposals.</P>
        <P>In the OECD Report on Better Regulation in Ireland (November 2010), the OECD recognised the need to improve the quality of quantitative analysis conducted in this context and to make greater use of this support.  An earlier independent Review of the Operation of RIA, which was published in 2008, also recommended maintaining this support for Departments.  Departments must seek the prior approval of the Department of the Taoiseach to avail of this support.  In 2010, &euro;13,929.70 was spent under this contract.</P>
        <P>Separately, in 2007, following a tender process, Indecon International Economic Consultants conducted a review of the Irish Annuities Market.  The Review was undertaken under the auspices of the Partnership Pensions Review Group comprising of representatives of Government Departments, the Pensions Board, IBEC and ICTU, and established under the terms of Towards 2016. The report of this review was published in October 2007.  The cost of this review was &euro;133,100.</P>

He wrote to party leaders in relation to this matter again in 2007 but not all the parties responded.</P>

	<P>A Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) was introduced for the Civil Service, including my Department, in 2000 and has been subject to ongoing evaluation and improvement since then.  In 2002, the system was expanded to include Upward Feedback, and in 2005 agreement was reached between management and staff unions to integrate PMDS with wider HR policies and processes from 1 January 2007.  Under this agreement, PMDS appraisals and ratings were linked directly to promotions, increments and higher scale posts.  This integrated system has been operating in my Department since then.</P>
        <P>The Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 contains a commitment &lsquo;to introduce significantly improved performance management across all Public Service areas, and following the current review, the Performance Management and Development System will be strengthened with promotion and incremental progression linked in all cases to performance and the implementation of appropriate systems to address under-performance, including, where appropriate, training or, where necessary, through disciplinary procedures&rsquo;.</P><Col N="145"/>
        <P>In the civil service, work is well under way on achieving this goal.  The 2010 evaluation of PMDS has been completed, and negotiations have begun with the unions in relation to how PMDS can be strengthened.  My Department is committed to implementing initiatives which may arise from these negotiations.</P>

	<P>My Department has proposed and the Government has approved the Skills Development and Internship Programme which is a new enterprise-led labour market activation initiative aimed at those who are at least three months unemployed. This programme aims to enable the unemployed maintain their links with the labour market while also facilitating their upskilling and reskilling, thereby improving their employability.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the maximum duration for participants on the programme will be 15 months, which will comprise of a 12 month placement with host organisations in the private or community and voluntary sectors and the potential for a further 3 months to facilitate education and training. By providing a 12 month placement coupled with a substantial education and training offering it is intended that the programme will provide a structured pathway to employment for those who are unemployed.</P>
        <P>Firms who participate in the programme will contribute &euro;150 per week per participant that they place. This will be used to finance the costs of the programme. The Government has also allocated &euro;5m in Budget 2011 towards the costs of the programme.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S will have responsibility for managing the programme. Participants on the programme who are in receipt of social welfare benefits will continue to receive an allowance equivalent to their social welfare entitlement. Participants will also receive an &lsquo;Upskilling Bonus&rsquo; of &euro;100 per week during the actual 12 month placement phase of the programme.</P>
        <P>The success of the programme will be entirely dependent on enterprises embracing the programme and offering quality placements to the unemployed. The Government have made provision for up to 5,000 places to be supported under this programme; however, this is subject to the level of interest and uptake by enterprises.</P>
        <P>Operational details of the programme are currently being prepared and it is expected that the programme will be operational towards the end of the first quarter of 2011.</P>

        <P>My Department has requested information in relation to the certificate mentioned by the Deputy and will respond directly to the Deputy when this information is to hand.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Back To Education Allowance, this allowance is a Department of Social Protection second-chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and therefore, their prospects of returning to the workforce. Eligibility for, and the payment structure of the BTEA is determined and administered by the Department of Social Protection and is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.</P>
        <P>Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) including universities, institutes of technology and private colleges are autonomous institutions.  They are also academically independent and reserve the right to determine the criteria for admission to any course run by the institution.  It is therefore a matter for individual institutions to determine whether a student meets the eligibility criteria laid down by the institution.</P>
        <P>The position is that students with appropriate FETAC Level 5/6 (NCVA Level 2/3) qualifications and modules may be admitted on a competitive basis to certain degree programmes run by third level institutions. In addition to the minimum entry requirements specific Higher Certificate and Ordinary Degree courses may have specific FETAC module or FETAC award requirements which are listed in individual institution prospectuses. In certain institutions a quota of places is reserved for applicants presenting FETAC level 5/6 awards. Such applicants are assessed separately from all other applicants.</P>
        <P>Applicants presenting FETAC Awards should contact the relevant HEI to establish how FETAC awards are assessed and to obtain information on eligibility and the admissions process for the course they wish to apply for.</P>

        <P>The organisation of school transport services is a major logistical operation which involves the planning of bus routes in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible pupils have a reasonable level of service while, at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in an efficient and cost effective manner. Safety of children travelling on the school transport services is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus &Eacute;ireann.</P><Col N="151"/>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann informed local and national media of developments regarding availability of services during the latest severe weather event and is also part of the Inter-Agency Co-ordination Committee that managed the response.</P>
        <P>Parents of eligible pupils who are affected by adverse weather conditions, as detailed by the Deputy, should liaise with the school authorities and the local Bus &Eacute;ireann office regarding school openings and the availability of school transport services. Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that tickets issued under the School Transport Scheme are not general commuter style bus tickets for use on multiple services, but instead offer a seat on a specific service to and from school.</P>

	<P>The school transport scheme, which is operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, facilitates the transportation of over 123,000 children to primary and post-primary schools each day including approximately 8,000 children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>School transport is a very significant national operation involving about 42 million journeys and over 82 million kilometres on 6,000 routes every school year. This service is delivered using a mix of BE, both school transport and road passenger vehicles, private contractor vehicles including private operator scheduled services, and Dublin Bus, Irish Rail, DART and LUAS where practical.</P>
        <P>Post Primary pupils who are eligible for school transport under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme pay &euro;300 per annum subject to a maximum family charge of &euro;650. Eligible pupils who hold valid medical cards are exempt from these charges.</P>
        <P>These payments represent a contribution towards the overall cost of school transport and do not reflect the true economic cost of providing school transport services. There is no provision, within the terms of the scheme, to consider refunding a portion of these charges in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The annual cost of maintaining my Department&rsquo;s website in 2010 was &euro;25,684.50. This figure incorporates the cost of an annual maintenance contract, a search engine licence and the Department&rsquo;s contribution to the Local Government Computer Services Board (LGCSB) for hosting the website. There  were on average 55,031 unique visitors to this website per month last year.</P>
        <P>To expedite claims and streamline the application process for the Energy Efficiency Scheme announced in May 2009 (this scheme is now closed) a new website www.energyeducation.ie was developed in partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. The cost involved in setting up and maintaining this website in 2008 was &euro;35,315.26. In 2010 the annual cost of maintaining the site was &euro;12,095.16. There were on average 1,012 unique visitors to this website per month last year. As the Deputy will be aware the European Social Funds Unit transferred from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (D/ETI) to my Department in May 2010. In 2010 &euro;1,084.25 was spent on an associated website www.esf.ie. There were on average 893 unique visitors to this website per month last year.</P><Col N="153"/>
        <P>In addition the Early Years Education Policy Unit of my Department pays annual recurring fees totalling approximately &euro;315  in order to  retain  two websites on-line. The www.cecde.ie website relates to the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education which ceased operations in 2008, while the www.siolta.ie website relates to S&iacute;olta &mdash; The National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education in Ireland.

	<P>Data are available on the numbers of academics and non-academics employed at the end of 2008 and 2009 and are given in the table below.  The latest data for December, 2010 are being collated currently and will be forwarded directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The figures show a reduction in staffing numbers across the institutions since 2008 in line with the Government&rsquo;s recruitment and promotion moratorium.  The purpose of the Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector is to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the public sector and is intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>In the area of higher education, the Government agreed that an Employment Control Framework (ECF) be developed to provide for the application of the moratorium arrangements to higher education institutions, subject to the continued oversight and review by the HEA and both my Department and the Department of Finance. The Government is anxious to work with the publicly funded higher education institutions in achieving necessary reductions in public expenditure within the sector as an essential part of overall budgetary strategy. The ECF aims to enable this while providing some flexibility around recruitment in the filling of posts. It is a matter for the individual higher education institutions to manage their staffing resources in the context of implementing the framework.</P>
        <P>The framework, covering the period up to 31 December, 2010, required the higher education institutions to achieve a minimum 6% reduction in the number of overall core staff by the end <Col N="154"/>of 2010 as compared with the numbers in place at 31 December 2008. The recently published National Recovery Plan includes provision for the application across the public service of an updated ECF, covering the period 2011 to 2014, aimed at significantly reducing the overall public sector paybill. Details of the specific application of the ECF in the education area are being finalised at present.</P>

        <P>In the event that primary teachers in a placement under the F&Aacute;S Work Placement Programme can meet the conditions associated with the operation of the primary probationary process as outlined in circular 58/2010, there will be nothing to preclude them from applying to be probated.</P>
        <P>The probationary process must be completed satisfactorily by teachers if they are to fulfil the conditions of their registration with the Teaching Council, the body with statutory responsibility for the registration of teachers in Ireland. The probationary period ends when the Teaching Council is satisfied that both the service requirement and the professional competence requirement are fully met.</P>
        <P>The Inspectorate of my Department evaluate the professional competence of teachers for the purposes of informing the Teaching Council&rsquo;s decisions regarding the registration of primary teachers and set down the criteria used in the inspection of the work of teachers. Limerick Education Centre administers the probationary process on behalf of the Inspectorate and applications for the evaluation of the professional competence aspect of the probationary process should be made to this Centre in the first instance.</P>

	<P>My Department advised the school authority in August 2010 that it was not in a position to grant aid the relocation of the school in question to another property. In reaching this decision, my Department considered the costs associated with a relocation together with the fact that a building <Col N="157"/>project is being advanced which will provide a permanent solution for the long term accommodation needs of the school.  An improved rental quotation for the property in question was recently submitted by the school authority to my Department. The proposal is being assessed and a decision will be conveyed to the school authority in due course.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that a new school building is being provided for the school in question.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department expects to commence the tender process for the appointment of a Design Team for the project in the near future. My officials will be in contact with the school authority in this regard at that point.</P>

Since February 2010, participants must confirm their entitlement to Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance with the Department of Social Protection prior to commencing a F&Aacute;S course.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S training courses are open to all unemployed persons.  However, if a participant is not entitled to Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance from the Department of Social Protection at the commencement of the course, then he/she does not receive a F&Aacute;S training allowance.</P>
        <P>There are some exceptions. For example, those whose entitlement to Jobseekers Allowance/Jobseekers Benefit ceases during their participation on a F&Aacute;S course retain their allowance until the end of the course. Also, those under 18 who continue on a course after the age of 18 (mainly early school-leavers in Community Training Centre&rsquo;s) retain their allowance without having to prove their entitlement to Jobseekers Allowance/Job Seekers Benefit.</P>

	<P>The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools.  My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

	<P>The Boards of Management of schools are responsible for the employment of school secretaries and it is a matter for each school to determine the level of secretarial and caretaking needs required for the school.  Funding to cater for these needs is made available from my Department under two separate schemes.</P>
        <P>One is the 1978/79 scheme under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and the school secretaries are paid directly through my Department&rsquo;s payroll.  The 1978/79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.</P>
        <P>The 1978/79 scheme has been superseded by a more extensive school support grant scheme towards the funding of ancillary services in schools including secretarial services. The scheme is flexible in nature giving Boards of Management and schools discretion as to the manner in which these services are provided.  In relation to the application of Circular 0070/2010 in schools, I would like to point out that the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No 2) Act 2009 (the Act) determined the criteria for reducing the pay of public servants with effect from January 2010.  However, when the Act was introduced, there was a question as to how a public servant should be determined for the purposes of this Act.  Subsequently, following receipt of legal advice, it has now been determined that all staff employed by a recognised school or VEC come within the definition of &ldquo;public servant&rdquo; solely for the purposes of the Act.</P><Col N="159"/>
        <P>In view of the time lapse involved in reaching a determination on this issue, the Minister for Finance has allowed for a temporary exemption from the application of the Act for certain categories of public servants up until 31 December 2010.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, my Department outlined that adjustments in salary should be applied with effect from 1 January 2011, to all relevant staff in the employment of recognised schools or VECs, who were not already affected by the pay reductions introduced under the Act.  One of the categories of staff affected by Circular 0070/2010 was school secretaries.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.</P>
        <P>In considering applications for teaching and SNA support for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the needs identified in the professional reports and decide whether the circumstances come within the Department&rsquo;s criteria. They then consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupil from its current level of resources.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</P>

	<P>The Department of Education and Skills assesses school accommodation needs in each area based on local demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.</P>
        <P>As I outlined in my previous reply of 16 December, from the beginning of the 2011/2012 school year, as an initial step following changes in relation to school transport arising from a Value for Money Review of School Transport, which were announced in the 2011 budget, the distance criteria will be applied to all pupils attending primary schools and the exemption under the closed school rule will cease. This means that children categorised for transport under the CSR who reside less than 3.2 kilometres (2 miles) from the school of attendance and who are availing of free transport to that school under the CSR will lose transport eligibility.</P>
        <P>All remaining children in this category, who meet requisite distance criteria, will continue to retain school transport eligibility. A sample survey undertaken as part of the Value for Money Review on transport arrangements for pupils availing of transport under the CSR showed that the majority of pupils are in fact attending their nearest open school. This survey did not <Col N="161"/>include the areas identified by the Deputy. In cases where the school of attendance is not the nearest school, these pupils will continue to retain school transport eligibility until they complete their education at that school. Transitional school transport arrangements will therefore remain in place for a reducing number of pupils over a maximum period of seven years until this group of children have all completed their primary education.</P>
        <P>From the 2012/2013 school year, full implementation of the change will mean eligibility based on the closed school rule and the central school rule will cease nationally for all new children entering primary schools.</P>
        <P>The detailed arrangements for the 2011/2012 school year in the areas identified by the Deputy can only be established when the applications for transport are made and considered.</P>

	<P>Changes in relation to school transport, arising from the Value for Money Review of School Transport, were announced in the 2011 budget. These changes include, with effect from the 2011/2012 school year, the application of the distance criteria to all pupils attending primary schools and the ceasing of the exemption under the closed school rule which as a consequence will mean that pupils residing less than 3.2 kms from the school of attendance will lose their transport eligibility, discontinuation of services under the revised minimum number of eligible pupils (10) and the pick up density of eligible pupils residing in a distinct locality required to establish a school transport service will increase from 7 to 10. With effect from the 2012/2013 school year, eligibility based on the closed school rule will cease for all new primary children entering primary schools and the catchment boundary system will cease for all new post primary children.   These changes will mean that there will be a reduction in the number of eligible pupils in 2011 as a result of the application of the distance criteria for all primary pupils and there will also be a reduction in the number of school buses arising from the changes in the minimum numbers. As is currently the position, families of eligible pupils who meet the distance eligibility criteria under the terms of the school transport scheme, but for whom there is no suitable school transport service available, will continue to be eligible to apply for the remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 109 to 112, inclusive, of 16 December 2010, her views on the fact that the new system will effectively shut down school transport services in the medium term in view of the fact that families with children currently availing of bus transport services under the closed school rule and with children who will not commence primary school until 2013, will not pay &euro;110 per annum to send their older children to school by bus when they will be transporting the younger children to school privately; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The new system the Deputy is referring to is the ceasing of the Closed School Rule (CSR) for school transport eligibility purposes for new pupils entering at primary level. </P>
        <P>I advised the Deputy in my previous reply in December that from the beginning of the 2011/2012 school year, as an initial step, the distance criteria will be applied to all pupils <Col N="162"/>attending primary schools and that the exemption under the closed school rule will cease. This means that pupils categorised for transport under the CSR who reside less than 3.2 kilometres (2 miles) from the school of attendance and who are availing of free transport to that school under the CSR will lose transport eligibility.</P>
        <P>The remaining pupils in this category, who meet the requisite distance criteria and whose numbers will be diminishing annually over a maximum period of seven years, will continue to retain school transport eligibility until they complete their education at their school of attendance.</P>
        <P>From the 2012/2013 school year, full implementation of the change will mean eligibility based on the closed school rule and the central school rule will cease for all new children entering primary schools.</P>
        <P>There is no evidence to suggest that the new system will effectively close down school transport services in the medium term. Survey work undertaken as part of the school transport value for money review showed that the majority of pupils categorised under the closed school rule are in fact attending their nearest school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This rule, which has remained fundamentally unchanged since 1968, has perpetuated a system where a cohort of pupils are deemed eligible for transport where the distance criterion of 3.2 kms is not met or the school of attendance is not their nearest. I acknowledge that some families will be affected by the fact that older siblings will be eligible for transport to the amalgamated school while siblings newly entering primary schools will be assessed for transport eligibility to their nearer open school but this practical effect would occur at whatever point in time this rule was ceased.</P>
        <P>This change means that the distance criteria will be applied equitably nationally and that consistency will be introduced in relation to planning for school places which is already based on local demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  In the case of all future primary school amalgamations, eligibility for school transport will be based on distance from and attendance at the nearest school, as determined by my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, all schools are required to have in place a Code of Behaviour and this code must be drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The NEWB guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school&rsquo;s bullying policy. </P>
        <P>Every school therefore must have in place, a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of the school&rsquo;s overall school code of behaviour. <Col N="164"/>Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.  Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school, as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established and at that level that actions should be taken to address allegations of bullying.</P>
        <P>My Department has also issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.</P>
        <P>As a further aid to post primary schools, my Department published a template that can be used by post-primary schools in developing an anti-bullying policy. The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour. However, it also takes account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes, and reference is made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, an honorary degree is an academic degree for which a university (or other degree-awarding institution) has waived the usual requirements, such as matriculation, residence, study and the passing of examinations. The degree is typically a doctorate or, less commonly, a master&rsquo;s degree, and may be awarded to someone who has no prior connection with the academic institution. Usually the degree is conferred as a way of honouring a distinguished visitor&rsquo;s contributions to a specific field, or to society in general. The university may derive benefits by association with the person in question. Some universities present honorary degrees as part of wider degree awarding ceremonies, while others may hold special ceremonies for such recipients. The exact cost of such ceremonies is not readily available as it is not identified separately by Universities.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is an independent agency with responsibility for determining the appropriate staffing levels in relation to the support of pupils with special educational needs in all mainstream and special schools. This includes determining the level of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support in schools. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. </P>
        <P>The recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. The Board is the SNA&rsquo;s employer and the terms of employment are subject to the conditions of the contract of employment. The retirement of a SNA is therefore a matter in the first instance for the Board of Management as the SNA&rsquo;s employer. The replacement of a retired SNA is also a matter for the school&rsquo;s Board of Management, subject to the continuing determination by the NCSE of the overall allocation of SNA support required to support the care needs of pupils enrolled in the school.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that a major building project is being advanced for the school in question. In this regard, my officials met with the school authority at the school in December 2010. The school&rsquo;s application for an emergency works grant was also discussed. My officials pointed out to the school authority that the scale of work proposed within the emergency works application suggested that it would be more appropriate to  progress this as part of the major building project. The school authority agreed to revisit the application with a view to identifying any emergency works that it considered needed to be carried out in advance of the major building project and to submit a revised application to the Department.  Any application received will be considered within the context of my Department&rsquo;s 2011 School Building and Modernisation Programme. </P>

	<P>The Fund for the Development of Targeted Educational Responses to Certain Children at Risk, which was also known as the Children at Risk Fund commenced in 1998. The objective of the Fund was to support the development of preventative and supportive programmes, which were targeted at children and young people who were at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion. A key focus of the initiative was the empowerment of local communities to develop innovative and flexible programmes that address identified needs of intended participants. Resources allocated under this initiative were used for the provision of a range of holistic supports to enable pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds to participate fully in education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2005 the Department launched the DEIS initiative which brought together a range of programmes and supports aimed at tackling educational disadvantage in some 878 schools throughout the country. Through DEIS an additional &euro;40 million was provided bringing the <Col N="169"/>allocation for disadvantage in schools to in excess of &euro;200 million. In the light of this additional investment, a decision was taken in Budget 2009 to discontinue the Children at Risk fund.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2009 my Department conducted an evaluation of seven remaining projects as part of a review of support for projects under the Children at Risk fund to assist in determining future funding arrangements and possible mainstreaming of appropriate projects or models of intervention. The evaluation reports were finalised and issued in 2010.</P>
        <P>The following are details of the number of projects and funding provided under the Children at Risk Fund over the last 5 years:</P>
        <P LI="1">2005 &mdash; 28 projects and a Music Initiative &mdash; &euro;1,243,955.</P>
        <P LI="1">2006 &mdash; 35 projects and the Music Initiative &mdash; &euro;1,251,041.</P>
        <P LI="1">2007 &mdash; 26 projects and 9 schools &mdash; &euro;1,269,738.</P>
        <P LI="1">2008 &mdash; 9 projects and 1 school &mdash; &euro;607,028.</P>
        <P LI="1">2009 &mdash; 8 projects &mdash; &euro;480,143.</P>
        <P LI="1">2010 &mdash; 6 projects &mdash; &euro;402,800 was issued in December 2010.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The School Completion Programme is a major component of DEIS. This programme provides support for targeted children who are at risk of early school leaving. The supports are provided through 124 local projects and include interventions on school attendance, literacy/numeracy as well as social and sporting interventions. The School Completion Programme will be comprehensively reviewed in the coming year. In the context of this review, consideration will be given to the integration of some of the remaining six projects with the School Completion Programme where appropriate.</P>

        <Quest> the reason the draft national plan to improve literacy and numeracy in schools does not contain any discussion on proposals to raise the literacy standards of children with sensory or physical disabilities; the measures she is taking to increase the literacy standards of these children; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The measures proposed in the Draft National Plan to Improve Literacy and Numeracy in Schools are intended to improve the literacy standards of all students, including those with special needs and learning difficulties. The strategy places particular emphasis on a whole school approach to promoting literacy and numeracy, setting out a range of actions relating to curriculum and assessment, school leadership, planning and review, parental engagement, and providing for comprehensive professional development of teachers.</P>
        <P>A key priority for the Government over the past decade has been to improve the provision of additional resources for all pupils with special educational needs (SEN), including those with sensory and/or physical disabilities.  The measures include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a general allocation model at primary level which ensures that all schools have have additional teaching resources in place to meet the learning support needs of students with high incidence special educational needs and learning support needs, including those experiencing difficulty with literacy and numeracy.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An ex quota provision for learning support and guidance in all post primary schools in the free education/block grant schemes.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Additional teaching supports allocated as necessary by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to support children with low incidence special educational needs, including pupils with sensory/physical disabilities. Over 5,500 pupils with sensory and/or physical disabilities were allocated additional teaching support by the NCSE in the 2009/10 school year.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />21 special schools/classes with lower pupil: teacher ratios of between 6:1 and 10:1 for pupils with Hearing Impairment or sensory or physical disabilities.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A Special Education Support Service (SESS) provides access to a range of professional development programmes for teachers of pupils with special needs, providing for in-school support, individualised teacher support, direct provision of courses and access to on-line programmes offered by the Institute of Child Education and Psychology Europe. This is supplemented by post graduate programmes for teachers available on an inservice basis in Learning Support and Special Education offered in the universities and colleges of education. These courses include a strong focus on literacy and numeracy. A visiting teacher service for visual and hearing impairment provides teaching support for children and specialist advice to schools, teachers and parents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has produced a comprehensive set of guidelines for teachers at primary and post primary level on supporting the needs of students with general learning disabilities across a range of subjects, including communications and language and mathematics. This is supplemented by professional development programmes in ICT and advice provided by the National Centre for Technology in Education on the use of <Col N="174"/>assistive technology for students with disabilities, including students who are deaf or hard of hearing, have a visual impairment or a physical disability.</P>
        <P>Schools and parents are supported by the National Council for Special Education through its network of over 80 local Special Educational Needs Organisers. Support is also provided to schools through my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service.  Schools without an assigned NEPS psychologist can avail of the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments.</P>
        <P>In 2010 my Department provided approximately &euro;1.8m to schools to purchase assistive technology and/or specialist equipment required to support pupils who have been assessed as having a special educational need, including pupils with sensory/physical disabilities.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding (&euro;1.28m in 2010) to the National Braille Production Centre (NBPC) who provide visually impaired pupils at first and second level with textbooks in Braille and audio format. There were 489 clients registered with the NBPC in 2010.</P>
        <P>I have invited submissions from interested parties on the Draft National Plan by 31 January 2011.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that my Department received the correspondence referred to by the Deputy on 7th January, 2011.  A response to the matters raised by the Union of Students in Ireland will issue shortly.</P>
        <P>The allocation for student grants in 2011 is just over &euro;385m. This is an increase of some 5% or &euro;18m over the 2010 provision.</P>
        <P>Increases in the number of students qualifying for grants, increases in proportions now qualifying for higher rates of grants as well as the introduction of the Student Contribution paid for on behalf of grant-holders each account for additional cost pressures in 2011.</P>
        <P>In order to manage these cost pressures, a number of savings measures are necessary in 2011.  While the measures involved will result in changes to the rate of grant payable, none of the measures will result in a student losing a grant or becoming ineligible for a grant.</P>

	<P>My Department has received a representation in respect of Resource Teacher for Traveller posts at the schools mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The position is that the Government has taken a decision to provide educational teaching supports to Traveller students on the same basis as other students in schools.  This means that Traveller students who require additional tuition will receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools.</P>
        <P>All schools will be advised to select students for learning support on the basis of priority of need.</P>
        <P>Resource Teacher for Traveller posts will be withdrawn, effective from September 2011.

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 to 207, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Primary School Transport scheme pupils are eligible for transport if they reside 3.2 kilometres or more from, and are attending, their nearest national school, as determined by my Department. Eligible primary pupils have up to now been transported free of charge. Pupils who avail of concessionary transport pay an annual charge of &euro;200.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the School Transport Schemes on behalf of my Department, has advised that in the current school year nearly 59,000 primary pupils are availing of school transport, including 8,000 children with special educational needs and over 3,200 pupils availing of concessionary transport.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann has also advised that 1,193 and 1,359 tickets were issued for primary school transport services in Counties Roscommon and Leitrim respectively for the 2009/10 school year.</P>
        <P>Eligible primary pupils holding medical cards and all children with special educational needs will be exempt from paying the primary charge. The latest data shows that 42% of all post primary pupils travelling hold valid medical cards and are currently exempt from paying the post primary school transport charge. Using this % as a guide in  establishing the number of eligible primary pupils liable to pay charges, it is estimated that, based on current take up, just over 27,500 pupils would be liable to pay charges in the 2011/2012 school year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 2011 estimate for school transport services is &euro;180 million compared to an allocation for 2010 of &euro;186 million. Under the four year national recovery plan &euro;4.5 million in savings will need to be secured in 2011, rising to &euro;17 million in 2014, through a combination of increases in charges and the implementation of measures identified in the value for money review of the school transport scheme. The annual revenue projection as a result of the introduction of this charge in a full year is approximately &euro;1.3 million. The revenue raised will be used to offset the overall cost of the scheme to the Exchequer.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that all children including those with special needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum with the option, in line with each child&rsquo;s ability, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. </P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is to provide for children with special educational needs to be integrated into mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated. Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school. Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports. In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios. Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.</P>
        <P>There are now in excess of 20,000 adults in our schools working solely with pupils with special needs. This includes over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) at a cost of approximately &euro;340m; over 9,000 resource and learning support teachers employed in mainstream schools, 500 teachers in special classes and 1,100 special school teachers at a cost of approximately &euro;650m.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to fund special school transport arrangements for pupils with special educational needs at a cost of approximately &euro;50m per annum. Funding is provided to schools to purchase assistive technology and/or specialist equipment at a cost of approximately &euro;1.8m. In addition, funding is provided for school buildings to be adapted where necessary.</P>
        <P>My Department has also responded to the need to provide teachers with continuing professional development in special education. This has been a key priority in recent years. The establishment of the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to provide expert support, <Col N="178"/>professional development and training opportunities in special education for school staff has been very significant. My Department provided funding of over &euro;2.4m to the SESS in 2010 for this purpose. 22,516 training places were provided in 2010 through the SESS.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was set up to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities with particular emphasis on children. The NCSE, with its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), provides a service to schools seeking additional teaching and/or care supports for enrolled students who qualify for additional supports. Working locally on the ground, the SENOs are a focal point of contact for parents and schools. The NCSE has advised my Department that additional SNA support and resource teaching hours were in place in mainstream schools in the 09/10 school year in respect of over 13,000 and 34,000 pupils respectively.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that there has been unprecedented investment in providing supports for pupils with special needs in recent years and Special Education continues to be a key Government priority. Over &euro;1 billion was spent in supporting special educational provision last year.</P>
        <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the education of children with special educational needs remains a key Government priority and children with special educational needs will continue to have access to an appropriate education in line with my Department&rsquo;s policy.</P>

In this regard, the Government is working closely with the Senator to develop a robust piece of legislation that provides a remedy to parties operating at various levels under a construction contract when payments are not forthcoming. This is a complex area.  Amendments are being drafted with the aim of having the Bill progress to Committee Stage in the Seanad in the next few weeks. </P>

	<P>NAMA has acquired eligible assets from the Participating Institutions, which for the most part, consist of loans. The property or other assets securing these loans remain in the possession of the Debtor. In cases where enforcement action is taken against a Debtor, NAMA may ultimately take ownership of property but it is expected that in the majority of these instances the property will be managed by a receiver. To date, NAMA does not own any such property and therefore the arrangement of leases between NAMA and third parties is not applicable.   I am advised by NAMA that as part of the business plan process and ongoing management of the Debtor relationship, NAMA is actively engaging with debtors to get their assets to produce income and is approving decisions relating to the underlying security including lease agreements between the Debtor and third parties where it makes commercial sense to do so. There is no reluctance on the part of NAMA to approve commercially viable arrangements. </P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that cohabitating couples are expressly recognised for the purpose of social welfare law but are not recognised for the purposes of Income Tax law. Although this may appear contradictory, the main aim of both the welfare code and the tax code is to uphold the constitutional right of married couples not to be treated less favourably than unmarried couples.   The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income. </P>
        <P>The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</P>
        <P>In the particular circumstances outlined, where a couple are cohabiting rather than married, they are treated as separate and unconnected individuals for the purpose of Income Tax.  Each <Col N="181"/>partner is a separate entity for tax purposes and, accordingly, credits, bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  However, I should point out that relevant legislative changes to take account of the provisions under the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, will be included in the forthcoming Finance Bill 2011.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Clause 5 of the Public Works contracts require main contractors and all subcontractors employed by main contractors to comply with the rates of pay and conditions of employment including pension contributions in employment agreements registered under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004.  The one exception is in regard to the registered agreement for pensions where a firm registered in another Member State and working in this country has employees temporarily posted from that other jurisdiction and who subscribe to a national pension scheme in their own country, then the firm or its employees do not have to subscribe to the Irish pension scheme.      </P>
        <P>The Public Works Contracts also requires a main contractor to provide a certificate of compliance (titled &lsquo;Rates of Pay and Conditions of Employment Certificate&rsquo;) with each interim statement submitted (normally on a monthly basis). Failure to provide this compliance certificate will result in payment not being made by the contracting authority. If a main contractor provides a certificate of compliance and it is subsequently found to be untrue or partly untrue the contracting authority has the right to deduct the money relating to the work or part of the work covered by the certificate from any sums due to the main contractor. This money can be withheld until the pay and conditions of employment issue is made right. The ultimate sanction if a main contractor continues to be non-compliant is for the main contract to be terminated.</P>
        <P>Under a Public Works Contract a contracting authority has the right, whenever it is deemed necessary, to access data and records on pay and conditions for work persons employed on the site.  In the case of capital works projects in excess of &euro;30 million and with a contract duration in excess of 18 months, contracting authorities provide in their contracts for random checks of the records of contractors and sub-contractors to assess compliance with the requirements of the Registered Employment Agreement, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The Public Works Contracts were developed by my Department working with the Government Construction Contracts Committee for use by all public contracting authorities.  Each contracting authority must ensure that contractors comply with all the requirements of the contract.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if subscribers to a company (details supplied) and other premium TV services pay VAT on these services to the Irish Exchequer or to the UK; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under the provisions of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010, and the EU VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply, the place of supply, and hence the place of taxation, of television services that are supplied to non-taxable persons by a business in the EU is where the supplier of those services has established its business.  In effect, this means that where a business based in another Member State of the EU supplies such services to customers in Ireland who are private individuals, the supplier must account for VAT due on those services in its own Member State and not in Ireland.  As the company referred to by the Deputy is based in the UK, Irish subscribers to their television services are charged UK VAT on those services.   I would add, however, that further provisions of the EU VAT Directive relating to the place of supply of television services are due to take effect by 1 January 2015.  This will provide that, as and from that date, VAT due in respect of the supply of television services by suppliers in an EU Member State to non-taxable persons in other EU Member States will be payable in the Member State of the customer.  Accordingly, from that date where the customer is a private individual based in Ireland, the supplier will be obliged to charge Irish VAT on the supply of the service.</P>

        <Quest> if he will set out the tax foregone by the Exchequer for film relief for the years 2009 and 2010; the estimated tax foregone due to film relief for 2011; if he will publish a cost benefit or similar analysis in respect of film relief; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated amount of tax foregone by the Exchequer in respect of film relief for the years 2009 and 2010 is &euro;42 million and &euro;65 million respectively. The cost figure for 2010 is provisional and may be revised.   Projections for tax receipts are based on assumed movements in macro-economic parameters and not by reference to the costs of individual tax reliefs. Accordingly, I am not in a position to provide the projected cost data requested by the Deputy for the year 2011 in relation to this relief.</P>
        <P>In relation to the second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question on cost-benefit analysis Indecon International Economic Consultants were engaged to undertake a review of Section 481 film relief in 2007. In light of the findings and recommendations of this review the relief was extended for a further four years to 2012.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Taxation also considered Film Relief and recommended that it should be continued but should be subject to regular review.  It is intended that such a review will be undertaken in advance of any adjustments or extension to the relief.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Risk Sharing Finance Facility, based on the principle of sharing credit risk between the European Community and the European Investment Bank (EIB), is an EIB lending facility intended to improve access to debt financing for private companies and public institutions promoting research, development and innovation activities. The scope of eligible activities is wide and extends from traditional &ldquo;brick and mortar&rdquo; investments to equipment and soft investments such as R&amp;D operating cost, salaries of researchers, management and support staff, utilities, consumables, acquisition or protection costs for intellectual property rights and, under certain conditions, leasing and depreciation. Projects to be financed by the EIB need to be technically, economically, financially and environmentally feasible according to the Bank&rsquo;s project evaluation criteria.   I understand that funding from the Facility, under which the EIB can provide finance to higher-risk creditworthy research development and innovation projects up to a total of &euro;10 billion, is open to small and medium-sized enterprises in the form of risk-sharing lines of credit through the EIB&rsquo;s banking <Col N="189"/>partners. I further understand that discussions have taken place between the EIB and Irish financial institutions with regard to accessing finance under the Facility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This facility is in addition to the &euro;30 billion facility for increasing lending to small and medium-sized enterprises announced by the EIB on 3 October 2008 and through which four banks operating in Ireland have access to &euro;350 million. These funds are being successfully onlent to small and medium-sized enterprises for investment and I understand that EIB will be in further discussions with Irish banks with a view to providing access to additional funds.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Court of Justice Case C-554/07, which concerns the VAT treatment of State and public bodies in Ireland, ruled against Ireland on 16 July 2009.  In compliance with the Court&rsquo;s ruling, Section 117 of the Finance Act 2010 included provision to make public bodies subject to VAT with effect from 1 July 2010.   In summary, the VAT Act 1972, which has since been consolidated into the VAT Consolidation Act 2010, was amended to provide that public bodies, including local authorities, are made subject to VAT.  More specifically, they are subject to VAT where they engage (i) in economic activities; (ii) in any activities as outlined in Annex I of the EU VAT Directive, unless the activity is carried out on such a small scale as to be negligible; and (iii) in the case of their regulatory capacity as a public authority, when their treatment as non-taxable could lead to a distortion of competition.</P>
        <P>Services that became liable to VAT on 1 July 2010 include such services as waste collection, landfill and recycling services; off-street parking; toll roads; the operation of leisure facilities; rent from certain lettings of commercial property; and the supply of staff and data. It should be noted that such services had already been subject to VAT if provided by a private operator.  VAT on the provision of community and sporting facilities by public bodies will come into effect by Ministerial order.</P>
        <P>However, other services operated by public authorities were not made subject to VAT by the Finance Act 2010 provisions, as they are otherwise exempted.  In that context, for example, the supply of water, education, health and passenger transport services were not made subject to VAT as they are otherwise exempted from VAT. Examples of the types of activities by public bodies where a charge applies which remain outside the scope of VAT, include parking fines, fees for passports, driving licences etc, development levies, casual trading licences and certificates of compliance.  These are purely regulatory functions.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I presume the Deputy is referring to the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme.    The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and VRT (up <Col N="191"/>to a certain limit) on the purchase of a car adapted for the transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, to those who meet certain disability criteria.</P>
        <P>The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get the Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions:</P>
        <P el="5">(a) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</P>
       <P el="5">(b) be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</P>
        <P el="5">(c) be without both hands or without both arms;</P>
     <P el="5">(d) be without one or both legs;</P>
     <P el="5">(e) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</P>
      <P el="5">(f) have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Senior Medical Officer (SMO) for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the SMO to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Rochestown Avenue, Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. I would point out that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset the Deputy will appreciate that owing to considerations of commercial confidentiality it would not be appropriate for me in my role as Minister for Finance to make any comment on the participation of any party in relation to the sale of Quinn Insurance Limited (QIL). Responsibility for the sales process is a matter for the Joint Administrators who were appointed by the High Court. I am also of the view that it is inappropriate to speculate as to what may happen in relation to jobs in that company before any decision is made on the sale of the company.   I understand however, that it is expected that the Joint Administrators will decide on a preferred bidder shortly with a view to entering into detailed discussions with them to seek to conclude an agreement on the sale of QIL.</P>
        <P>In assessing the bids, the Joint Administrators are required to consider how best the interests of policyholders can be protected and how the company can be returned to a sound commercial footing. The retention and protection of employment is also a very important priority subject to their other responsibilities.</P>
        <P>The final decision of the Joint Administrators is subject to the approval of the High Court. It is important to be clear that neither I nor the Government have any input or influence over the administration process, including any decision on the sale of the company.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 and 239 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert Group (Expert Group) have now completed their work having submitted an Interim Report to me on 5th July 2010 and their Final Report on 16th November 2010.  Both Reports were brought before Government.  The Expert Group&rsquo;s Reports are available at www.finance.gov.ie and a complete list of all the recommendations is included in Chapter 2 of the Final Report.</P>
        <P>Following a consultation process, the Central Bank published a revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) on 6th December 2010.  The revised CCMA closely follows the recommendations of the Expert Group and applies to the mortgage lending activities of all regulated entities, except credit unions, operating in the State, including a financial services provider authorised, registered or licensed by the Central Bank of Ireland. This applies to subsidiaries which fall into this category and  Haven Mortgages which the Deputy refers to.</P>
        <P>The revised CCMA came into effect on 1 January 2011. Lenders are required to comply with the CCMA as a matter of law however they will be allowed a six month period of grace, ending on 30 June 2011, where the Central Bank of Ireland will be cognisant of issues relating to systems development, required staff training and other difficulties. Failure to comply with the revised CCMA may result in sanctions under the Administrative Sanctions Framework.</P>
        <P>The most significant changes in the revised CCMA include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Lenders will be prohibited from moving borrowers in arrears of existing tracker mortgages;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Borrowers in arrears who co-operate with the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) will not be  charged penalty interest;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Harassment of borrowers through unsolicited communications will be outlawed;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Borrowers in financial difficulties, but not in arrears, will be allowed to come under the MARP.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Clarifying the existing 12 month moratorium on legal action in arrears cases.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Lenders representing the majority of the market have already indicated their willingness to implement the Expert Group&rsquo;s proposals for a Deferred Interest Scheme (DIS)  or a variation of it and the remaining participants will be requested to do so. The Deputy will be aware from media reports that AIB, Bank of Ireland, EBS, and Irish Life and Permanent are reported to have signed up to the DIS. The DIS is to apply to those homeowners unable to pay full interest on their mortgages but able to pay at least 66%.</P><Col N="193"/>
        <P>I understand that &lsquo;normal interest accrues on a mortgage, even it is is in arrears.  Provision 9 of the CCMA states that lenders are restricted from imposing charges and/or surcharge interest on arrears arising on a mortgage account in arrears to which the CCMA applies in respect of which a borrower is co-operating reasonably and hoestly with the lender in the MARP.</P>
        <P>Full details of the DIS are in the Final Report at pages 22 to 25, where the Deputy will note in relation to interest charges that deferred interest accumulates in a non-interest charging deferral account. While the DIS is voluntary for all lenders, those who have signed up in support of the scheme will be monitored by the Financial Regulator to ensure compliance. The Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations are intended to be of benefit to both lender and borrower and it is assumed that lenders will cooperate and implement the recommendations or variations of them as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that in addition to those recommendations being implemented through amendments to the CCMA, other recommendations relating to home owners with mortgage arrears will require legislative support involving my Department, the Departments of Social Protection (DSP), Environment, Heritage and Local Government (DEHLG).</P>
        <P>In the case of my own Department, recommendations to do with the scope and the admissibility in Court of the CCMA will be examined in the context of the preparation of the second Central Bank Bill.</P>
        <P>In order to implement those recommendations in relation to the mortgage interest supplement scheme (MIS) changes to both primary and secondary legislation will be required. The Department of Social Protection is currently developing an implementation plan that will set out a framework for the future of the scheme.</P>
        <P>New regulations and guidance are currently being developed by DEHLG in the context of the social housing reform programme to provide that housing authorities could disregard the household&rsquo;s current accommodation for the purposes of determining eligibility for social housing support. I am informed that work is ongoing on the development of a new needs assessment process which will allow an earlier trigger point for the social housing needs assessment process to take place where a case has been determined to be unsustainable in the long term, following exploration of all other options.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Section 82 TCA 1997 provides that certain pre-trading expenses of a trade or profession are allowable in calculating the trading income of that trade or profession once it commenced. The relief applies to trades or professions, whether incorporated or not, which commenced on or after 22 January 1997.  A deduction is only available for pre-trading expenditure in computing income under Cases I and II of Schedule D where it is incurred in the three years prior to commencement of the trade or profession and is  wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purposes of the trade or profession.</P>
        <P>While a deduction for pre-trading expenditure is available under section 82 TCA, the relief is conditional on the expenditure being of a type that would have been allowable in computing income under Case I or II of Schedule D had it been incurred after the commencement of the trade or profession. For the purposes of allowing the deduction, the allowable amounts are treated as having been incurred at the time the trade or profession commences. Allowable amounts are not available for set-off against income other than income from the trade or profession.</P>
        <P>Pre-trading expenses related to a trade or profession may not be taken into account in calculating a loss to be set-off against other income. Any losses resulting from pre-trading expenses may only be carried forward for use against future income of the trade or profession.</P>
        <P>Arguments can be made in favour of allowing this relief to individuals who incurred pre-trading expenses and who subsequently incorporated as a company. One argument may be that it is unreasonable to deny relief to the company in respect of such expenses in a situation where the bulk of otherwise allowable expenses were properly incurred by an individual prior to the formation of the company. On the other hand, under existing legislation the losses or expenses of a sole trader may not be transferred to a company on incorporation of the business. Moreover, difficulties could arise in devising a suitable legislative framework to enable companies to obtain relief for pre-trading expenses incurred prior to incorporation where there are a number of shareholders. If provision were to be made for this, for example, it might be necessary to put restrictions on the facility so that only expenses incurred by substantial shareholders would be allowed.</P>
        <P>Another issue to consider in this context is whether it is appropriate to allow an expense incurred by one person (e.g. an individual) to be offset against the income of another separate person, in this case a company. After all, they are separate legal persons and the implications of proceeding down this road would have to be carefully considered.</P>
        <P>I would take the view that the current legislation is not so much reflective of a situation that is anomalous but perhaps more reflective of the difficulties involved in drawing the line under what is reasonable and appropriate. I am not aware of any major difficulties being caused by the existing legislative provisions. I am, however, open to examining the detail of any particular problems in this area that may be put to me with a view to finding a possible resolution to those problems.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I announced in the Budget that the necessary arrangements are being made to ensure that bets placed on the Internet by domestic punters are subject to the same level of betting duty as applies to high street betting shops. This will serve to broaden the tax base and increase betting duty receipts.   It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to include provisions in the Finance Bill and to revise the Betting Act 1931 to provide that bookmakers taking bets from Ireland, notwithstanding what platforms are used i.e. Internet or otherwise, will pay the 1% betting duty. Betting Exchanges will also be subject to tax under the new arrangements, however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model.</P>
        <P>I am hopeful that by including the high-growth area of the betting sector the tax base from betting will be boosted significantly.</P>
        <P>In addition, this measure conveys a positive signal to international betting operations that have expressed an interest in or have already invested in Ireland. A location with an appropriate licensing regime coupled with relatively low taxes provides real investment and employment opportunities in this sector, which ultimately can potentially be beneficial to all concerned.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Stamp Duty reforms announced in the Budget have two aims: stimulation of the property market and commencing the necessary infrastructure for the commitment in the National Recovery Plan to introduce a Site Value Tax.  As a result of the changes, Stamp Duty at a rate of 1% where the property value is under &euro;1m and 2% on the excess above &euro;1m, will now be payable on all residential property transactions.     I have put in place a transitional arrangement: where a binding contract has been entered into before 8 December 2010, and the effect of this measure would increase the Stamp Duty otherwise chargeable, Stamp Duty can be calculated and charged under the old regime, so long as the instrument effecting the transfer of the property is executed before 1 July 2011.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to make the changes suggested by the Deputy.  The overall transaction costs for property transfers are now much lower than in recent years because of the decline in property values.  I am aware that there will always be winners and losers in a situation such as this, but unfortunately this will happen no matter what date is chosen to commence any new measure.  For example, if I followed the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion and allowed individuals who completed house purchases after 1 November 2010 to avail of the new residential property Stamp Duty rates announced in the Budget, an individual who completed a property transaction on or before 31 October would not benefit.  These persons might then seek a change to the date which would lead, in time, to further requests for changes to the date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2007 it had been signalled before the election that First Time Buyer relief from Stamp Duty would be extended to all first time buyers.  If this change had not been backdated to its original announcement, anyone who could have benefited from the change would not have bought property until the proposal was eventually enacted.  No indication that a change was imminent was given before the change announced in Budget 2011.</P>

	<P>Section 83A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 provides for an exemption from Stamp Duty where a parent transfers a site to a child to enable the child construct a dwelling house for use as his or her only or main residence.  The value of the site must not exceed &euro;500,000 and the size of the site must not exceed 1 acre (excluding the area of the house).   As the Deputy is aware, I announced in Budget 2011 a major reform of the charge to Stamp Duty on residential property transactions, which <Col N="198"/>applies to all instruments executed on or after 8 December 2010.  These changes have simplified the system by lowering the rates applicable and abolishing a number of exemptions and reliefs, including Site to Child relief.  The &ldquo;Site to Child&rdquo; relief from Capital Gains Tax is unaffected by the Budget changes. In the case of the transfer of a site from a parent to a child which takes place on or after 8 December 2010,<b></b>  Stamp Duty is chargeable on the value of the site transferred. The normal Stamp Duty liability arising on the transfer of a site valued at &euro;60,000, at the rate of 4%, is &euro;2,400. However, where the parties are related, as is the case here, the duty payable is restricted to 50% of the duty that would otherwise be payable. This liability is, therefore, reduced by 50% to &euro;1,200 because of the parent/child relationship.</P>

	<P>As I announced in the recent Budget, the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) will be replaced by the new Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) once the approval of the European Commission has been received. Under the new incentive, the lifetime limit that can be raised by companies will be increased from &euro;2 million to &euro;10 million, and the amount that can be raised in any twelve month period will be increased from &euro;1.5 to &euro;2.5 million. The certification requirements will also be simplified. Full details of the new incentive will be set out in the forthcoming Finance Bill.   It would be expected that video game producers would qualify for the new incentive, as indeed they would for the existing BES, which will continue to operate until the new incentive has been approved by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>In regard to extending the scope of the research and development (R&amp;D) tax credit, the scheme already applies to basic research, applied research and experimental development.

The qualifying activities must also seek to achieve scientific or technological advancement and involve the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty.</P>
        <P>Video games are essentially software development and would be a field of science and technology for the purposes of the scheme. If they satisfy the science test (an advance in a field of science and technology), which is the basis for most R&amp;D incentive schemes in other countries too, they would qualify for the relief.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 59 of 7 December 2010. Fees may be charged to retailers by acquiring banks for the use of debit or credit cards. These charges include fees for items such as terminal rental, customer services and dispute resolution services.  They are a function of and are determined by the <Col N="199"/>interchange fees set by the payment card schemes for the participating acquirers.  Interchange fees are paid by the merchant&rsquo;s acquiring bank to the cardholder&rsquo;s bank every time a payment card is used.  While interchange fee levels vary depending on the type of payment card, the purpose is to reflect the real operating costs.   I understand that certain international card schemes charge fees on the basis of a percentage of the value of the transaction rather than a per transaction fee as is the case with the Laser Card scheme (which is an Irish-based debit card scheme managed by the Irish Payment Services Organisation on behalf of those Irish banks that operate the Laser Card Scheme).</P>
        <P>As Minister for Finance, I do not have any role in the regulation of such fees as they are a commercial matter between the given card scheme, the acquiring bank and their customers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to non-interest charges imposed by retail banks for banking services, all credit institutions, money transmitters and bureaux de change are required, under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 (as amended), to notify the Central Bank if they wish to impose new charges or increase existing charges for customers.</P>
        <P>These charges are assessed by the Central Bank in accordance with the criteria laid down in the legislation as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the promotion of fair competition between holders of authorisations and credit institutions;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the commercial justification submitted in respect of the proposal;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the impact new charges or increases in existing charges will have on customers, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />passing on costs to customers.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Having considered the proposed charge(s) under the assessment criteria set out in the legislation, the proposed charges are either rejected, approved at lower levels than requested by the entity or approved in full. Approvals are issued in the form of a letter of direction and the entity is legally bound to comply with this letter of direction. The letter of direction sets out the maximum amount the regulated entity is allowed to charge.</P>

        <P FLI="0">These Central Bank estimates take account of all elements of the banks&rsquo; loan books, including the mortgage loan books.  It has taken a realistic view of the likely losses to mortgage lenders. Indeed, the loss rates that have been used in both the base and stress case scenarios are in excess of the latest official figures released by the Central Bank. Furthermore, the detailed review undertaken by the external authorities of the financial status of the Irish banks and, in particular, of the Central Bank&rsquo;s PCAR exercise was an important part of the technical discussions underpinning the negotiated package of assistance with the IMF and our European partners. As part of the agreement with the EC, IMF and EU the State has agreed to adopt deleveraging measures and to implement restructuring of the banking sector.  To this end, a Prudential Liquidity Assessment Review or &ldquo;PLAR&rdquo; will establish target funding ratios for each of the banks, identify non core assets and set an adjustment path to these targets based on specified non public annual benchmarks.</P>
        <P>The completion of the Central Bank&rsquo;s PCAR/PLAR exercise will determine the requirement for any future capital support required by the banks.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) on interest bearing deposits is returned on a twice yearly basis by financial institutions: in October of the tax year in question and the following January.  The total value of DIRT due and paid and the total number of DIRT exempt interest bearing accounts is reported to Revenue on the January returns at institutional level.  Returns for 2010 are due by 15 January 2011.  Revenue does not have complete details on interest bearing deposit accounts here and their value.   Separately, under regulations as provided for in Section 891B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, certain financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, are required to make automatic annual returns at account level electronically to Revenue.  The information under S891B is provided where the total payment of interest is greater than &euro;635 in a year, regardless of deduction of DIRT, and in all instances of a first interest payment irrespective of threshold for accounts opened on or after 1 January 2008.  These returns include DIRT exempt accounts.  Returns for 2010 are due by the end of March 2011.</P>
        <P>The total number of interest bearing deposit accounts reported under the regulations for 2009 is 1,272,899.  The total value of interest paid to these accounts for 2009 is &euro;3,203,923,841.71. Financial institutions reported 93,100 such accounts as being exempt from DIRT.  Revenue does not have data on the value of DIRT forgone in respect of such accounts.</P>
        <P>The amount of DIRT collected by the State in the most recent tax year (2010) to date is &euro;446 million approximately.  The amount of DIRT collected in 2009 was &euro;614 million approximately.</P>
        <P>The EU Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003 on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments, commonly known as the &ldquo;Taxation of Savings Directive&rdquo;, introduced a system of information sharing between tax authorities in respect of interest payments from 1 July 2005.  The purpose of the Directive is to ensure that interest payments made in one EU Member State to an individual resident for tax purposes in another Member State are taxed in accordance with the laws of the latter.</P>
        <P>Under this Directive the Revenue Commissioners provides information regarding interest payments made by Irish paying agents to individuals resident in other EU Member States.  DIRT is not paid on these accounts.  A detailed breakdown of the information reported under the Directive is not currently available.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">There is also a transitional measure in place, for circumstances where the effect of these changes is to increase the Stamp Duty payable on the transaction.  Stamp Duty can be paid under the old regime where a binding contract is in place before 8 December 2010 and the instrument is executed before 1 July 2011.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about an individual who paid a deposit for a residential property in November 2010.  If a legally binding contract to purchase the property was in place before 8 December 2010, that person can avail of the Stamp Duty rates that were in place before Budget 2011, or can opt to avail of the new rates, whichever is more beneficial. If there was no legally binding contract the new rates of Stamp Duty will apply.  It should be noted that, for a contract to be legally binding, it is not necessary for it to be set out in writing.  The individual&rsquo;s solicitor should be able to advise whether a legally binding contract was in place at that time.</P>

	<P>I am aware that the Chairman of NAMA has recently outlined a range of measures which the Agency is adopting in its drive to ensure that debtors meet their obligations. In return for NAMA&rsquo;s ongoing support, NAMA requests from Debtors significant lifestyle changes, the reversal of asset transfers and the granting to NAMA of legal charges over unencumbered assets. I am informed that three debtors have already agreed to the reversal of some &euro;130m in asset transfers as part of their business plan review with NAMA.</P>
        <P>In relation to asset transfers, in circumstances where it is obvious that the purpose of an asset transfer, whether to a spouse or otherwise, was a pre-emptive attempt to put assets beyond the reach of NAMA, NAMA has a number of statutory remedies available to it. These include the provisions of the Conveyancing Act, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 and  Section 211 of the NAMA Act which provides that NAMA may apply to a Court to declare a disposition to be void if it can show that the effect of the disposition was to impair the value of an eligible bank asset or any rights that NAMA would have acquired but for the disposition.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, where the evidence available to NAMA is that a debtor has failed, as part of a sworn statement, to disclose all his assets as part of the debtor business plan process, he will be faced with very serious consequences as it would be an offence under section 7 of the NAMA Act. NAMA has made it very clear that it will not work with debtors who fail to co-operate fully and openly with it. NAMA will also pursue through the courts debtors who fail to co-operate with it in terms of agreeing to the reversal of asset transfers or to the granting of legal charges over unencumbered assets where NAMA believes that assets were intentionally put beyond its reach.</P>

	<P>In Budget 2010, I announced the Government&rsquo;s intention to launch a 10 year National Solidarity Bond, the purpose of which is to allow citizens an opportunity to invest and provide money to the State to stimulate economic recovery and to assist in the maintenance and creation of employment. The necessary legislative basis was provided in the 2010 Finance Act and the Bond, which was launched on Tuesday 4 May 2010, has been very successful with some  &euro;350m invested by 16,200 customers during 2010.    In Budget 2011, I announced the introduction of a new, four-year, National Solidarity Bond to complement the ten-year National Solidarity Bond. The bond will pay a coupon each year and a bonus for those who hold the bond to maturity.</P>
        <P>All State savings which are managed by the National Treasury Management Agency are a direct unconditional obligation of the Irish Government and the Government is committed to repaying all State Savings without any limit.</P>
        <P>As regards Section 23 reliefs, the Government committed in the Joint Programme for Government to ending unnecessary tax reliefs.  The measures announced in the Budget for 2011 will achieve the phased abolition of the property-based &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; tax reliefs, including Section 23 relief, and will eliminate the remaining cost of such schemes to the Exchequer.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 141 of 16 December 2010, the reason he claims that the International Monetary Fund interest rate of 5.7% when Mr. Ajai Chopra of the IMF says that it is 4.1%; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>IMF lending is denominated in the Fund&rsquo;s unit of account, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). The SDR comprises a basket of four currencies, Euro, Sterling, the US Dollar and Japanese Yen. The IMF&rsquo;s lending rate is based on the three month floating interest rates for the currencies in the basket.    The IMF&rsquo;s interest rate is a floating rate that is linked to the SDR interest rate with some surcharges applied on top of that. The way this works is that the interest rate depends on the amount borrowed and for how long it is outstanding. This is the rate that applies to all member countries of the IMF and this is a formula that applies to all member countries. It is not a number that is case specific. The IMF have two different types of loan facilities. One is for low-income countries that qualify for concessional financing, and the other is the regular facility and that is what Ireland is borrowing under so that the formula for the interest rate does not change</P>
        <P>Quota subscriptions generate most of the IMF&rsquo;s financial resources. Each member country of the IMF is assigned a quota, based broadly on its relative position in the world economy. A member country&rsquo;s quota determines its maximum financial commitment to the IMF, its voting power, and has a bearing on its access to IMF financing.</P>
        <P>In relation to the clarification sought by the Deputy, under the Extended Fund Facility arrangement which applies in Ireland&rsquo;s case, the basic rate (of charge) is based as stated above on the fluctuating SDR rate currently 33 bps to which a margin is added that is fixed annually in May, currently 100 bps, and a burden sharing element currently 1 basis point.  Surcharges are added to the basic rate and, in Ireland&rsquo;s case, these amount by definition to 300 bps for credit outstanding above 300% of Quota after thirty-six months resulting in an overall cost of funds of 4.34% (for the first thirty-six months this surcharge for credit outstanding above 300% of Quota is 200 basis points).   If the relevant IMF rate is technically swapped into fixed rate Euro of 7.5 years duration, it corresponds to the average interest of 5.7% quoted at the date of the EU-IMF Agreement.   This expresses the IMF interest rate in terms which can be compared with the cost of borrowing from EU sources. Both interest rates equate to the same cost of funding.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 contains a commitment &ldquo;to introduce significantly improved performance management across all Public Service areas, and following the current review, the Performance Management and Development System will be strengthened with promotion and incremental progression linked in all cases to performance and the implementation of appropriate systems to address under-performance, including, where appropriate, training or, where necessary, through disciplinary procedures&rdquo;.   In the civil service work is well underway on achieving this goal. The 2010 Evaluation of PMDS has been completed. Negotiations with the Unions have commenced in relation to how the PMDS can be strengthened.  A meeting of the sub-committee of General Council on PMDS on which the Unions are represented took place on 2 December 2010 and further meetings are planned for early 2011.</P>
        <P>Performance management in the civil service is already linked to promotion and to incremental progression and the systems in place to address underperformance are now being assessed.</P>

	<P>Primarily the allocation of funds within the Central Bank is a matter for the Bank itself. Full details of the Bank&rsquo;s income and expenditure are set out in its 2009 Annual Report. I have been advised by the Central Bank that for the most recent audited period outturn data for 2010 has yet to be finalised.   Prior to the commencement of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 on 1 October 2010, I approved the Financial Regulators Statement of Income and Expenditure for 2010 under section 33N of the Central Bank Act, 1942. The Statement showed the Regulatory Authority which was then a constituent part of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI) would have overall operating expenses of &euro;78.079 million in 2010. The Bank proposed that &euro;41.240 million would be raised by means of levies imposed on the financial services industry with the balance of &euro;36.839 million to be met by way of subvention by the CBFSAI. </P>
        <P>Following commencement of the 2010 Act section 33N of the Central Bank Act 1942 is replaced by a new procedure whereby the role of the Minister for Finance is limited to approving regulations made by the Bank each year to impose levies on financial service providers for the purpose of funding financial regulation.</P>

        <Quest> if persons receiving social welfare <Col N="216"/>payments are exempt from the universal social charge; if persons receiving a social welfare payment from another country are exempt, for example, a person over 70 years receiving a UK state pension; if not, can they be included in the list of exemptions; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P Just="Left">The position is that payments made under the Social Welfare Acts and payments that are of a similar nature, including social welfare payments made by authorities in other countries such as a UK social security pension, are exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC).  However, where an individual has both social welfare-type payments and other income, the other income will be liable to the Universal Social Charge once it exceeds the annual entry threshold of &euro;4,004.   While there is no general exemption from the USC for individuals aged over 70 years, such individuals will pay USC, on any non-social welfare type income, at the rate of 2% on the first &euro;10,036 of income and at a rate of 4% on income above that amount. Other individuals will pay USC at the rate of 2% on the first &euro;10,036 of income, a rate of 4% on the next &euro;5,980 of income and a rate of 7% on the remainder of their income.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Public Service Agreement (Croke Park Agreement) provides a sustainable framework to manage the provision and delivery of our essential public services in a period of unprecedented pressure on public resources. In this regard, the Exchequer Pay Bill will be approximately 8% less in 2010 over 2009 while the number of public servants has reduced by almost 12,000 since March 09, resulting in significant savings in the public service paybill.    Further savings targets for 2011 of &euro;310m, and a reduction in numbers to 301,000 as set out in the Budget Estimates, now form part of the allocation for each Department and Agency over the coming year. The delivery of the required savings, including payroll savings, will be monitored closely, including by reference to the implementation of the Croke Park Agreement. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Specific measures planned for the Local Government sector are included in the Action Plan for that sector which is published on the website of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Implementation Body for the Agreement requested the various sectors, including the Local Government sector, in December last to revise their Action Plans to take account of the targets in the National Recovery Plan and the allocations made under Budget 2011. These revised plans are due to be submitted this week. The Implementation Body will be seeking to ensure that the plans deliver the necessary savings and efficiencies to meet the Government&rsquo;s requirements under the National Recovery Plan.</P>

        <Quest> if it would be possible for this Government, or an incoming Government, to renegotiate the interest rate on the funding made available from the EU as part of the recent EU-International Monetary Fund package; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst><Col N="217"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is important to understand that while there has always been the possibility under the EU-IMF Programme for this Government or any new Government to substitute alternative measures within the programme where they are as economically efficient and of equal fiscal effect and that the agreed size and speed of the budgetary adjustment is maintained, the position in relation to the interest rate charged is different.   The interest rate for funding from the IMF and the various EU funding lines were determined by a common approach for any borrower. Accordingly, any changes to these rates cannot be negotiated for Ireland in isolation and must be seen in the wider context.   We must bring realism to the debate about our financial difficulties.    I agree with recent comments in this regard by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan  to the effect that there must be &ldquo;a clearer understanding of what is possible and what is not possible to be done&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the (blended) interest rate on the loans to be provided to Ireland is at a far lower cost than would be available to Ireland in the financial markets.    It is designed to avoid overburdening the Member State concerned or acting as an impediment to economic growth while at the same time providing an incentive to return to the markets.  At present the yield on Irish government bonds is just below 9% in the secondary markets.    We will not be obliged to drawdown any of these loans if there is an opportunity to return to the markets at sustainable rates or we can access funds at lower cost elsewhere.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As stated in my response to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous question in this matter, the decision to abolish the relief was taken in the light of a recommendation to this effect by the Commission on Taxation. The Commission&rsquo;s views on this relief were quite definitive. It found that it had not had the desired impact on innovation and R&amp;D activity and, that despite various refinements to the scheme over the years, suggested that the relief was not a particularly well-targeted measure providing good value for money. The Commission also expressed the view that the relief had not resulted to any great extent in companies carrying out R&amp;D activity and that it was being used in some cases by companies &ldquo;as a tax avoidance device to remunerate employees&rdquo;.   Abolition of the patent income exemption will yield &euro;50 million to the Exchequer in a full year and this is provided for in the National Recovery Plan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government agrees with the conclusions of the Commission and believes that in the current challenging times scarce resources should be focused instead on the R&amp;D tax credit scheme. The R&amp;D credit scheme provides a more direct and effective incentive for enterprises to innovate and invest in R&amp;D activities and the scheme has been enhanced considerably in recent years to make it one of the most competitive of its kind anywhere.</P>
        <P>The Business Expansion Scheme is also available to help small and medium sized companies raise risk capital investments from private investors. As you may be aware, I announced in the recent Budget that this scheme will be replaced by an Employment Investment Incentive once the approval of the European Commission has been received. The new incentive will provide an increase in the limits that companies can raise as well as a simplified certification requirement. Full details will be included in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>

	<P>As outlined in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 (published 24 November 2010), the Government decided, in the context of present budgetary constraints, that it would be appropriate for some retired public service pensioners to make a contribution to required financial adjustments. This decision was taken having regard to the gap between the burden being borne by those currently in public service employment (where the pension related deduction (PRD) and pay reduction have impacted) and those in retirement.   The Government also took into account the general reduction in prices: CPI is now at 2007 levels, whereas public service pensioners received general round increases of 2% in June 2007, 2.5% in March 2008 and 2.5% in September 2008 &mdash; providing an increase in the real value of public service pensions. </P>
        <P>Accordingly, in Budget 2011 (on 7 December 2010) I announced that public service pensions above &euro;12,000 a year would be reduced by an average of 4%.  The reduction required legislation to be passed before the end of 2010 and, having being passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, giving effect to the measure on and from 1 January 2011, was signed into law on 22 December 2010.</P>

	<P>The National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 was published on 24 November 2010 and provides a blueprint for a return to sustainable growth in the Irish economy.    In particular, the Plan sets out the measures that will be taken to restore <Col N="220"/>order to our public finances. Adjustments of nearly &euro;15 billion have already been implemented over the past two and a half years and, as the recent end-2010 Exchequer Returns show, these measures have succeeded in stabilising the budget deficit. An additional &euro;15 billion package of measures is required to bring the deficit back below 3% of GDP by 2014. Budget 2011 represents the first step in the implementation of that programme and, taking account of the &euro;6 billion adjustment package, projects a General Government deficit of 9.4% of GDP by the end of this year. In this regard, it is positive to note that the end of year figures that my Department reported on last week, showed the public finances being marginally better than had been planned for in 2010.</P>
        <P>Reducing the budget deficit is necessary, but it will not, by itself, solve our economic difficulties. We must grow our economy by improving our competitiveness and build on our strong export performance. The National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 also identifies the areas of economic activity which will provide growth and employment in the recovery and specifies the reforms the Government will implement to accelerate growth in key sectors of the economy.</P>
        <P>A range of specific policy actions will further support the process of recovery. These can be broadly categorised as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />labour market reforms to remove barriers to employment and disincentives to work;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reforms to improve the non-labour elements of cost competitiveness;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />supportive sectoral policies to assist recovery across the enterprise base.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These policy actions will support the export recovery, which can, in turn, deliver high value employment and act to stimulate the domestically trading sectors of the economy. Given that Ireland is a small open economy, sustainable growth in the long-term must be export-led.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am considering how best to implement the commitment contained in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 to identify further ways to tackle increases in insurance costs, building on the achievements of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB).  The experience of the PIAB suggests that significant savings can be achieved compared with the prior adversarial approach and I am anxious that lessons are learned from this experience.    I am aware of the increased pressure on insurance premiums in recent times particularly in the household insurance area. Much of this is due to the unprecedented level of claims which the insurance industry suffered in the winter of 2009/2010. The insurance industry estimated that, between the November 2009 flooding and the big freeze at the start of 2010, they have paid out about 550 million euro worth of claims. The industry has put the level of claims in further context by indicating that the insured cost of these two weather events exceeded the total cost of all serious weather events that have occurred in the last decade. This cost was estimated at 358 million euro. A further increase in claims is expected as a result of the recent inclement weather.</P><Col N="221"/>
        <P>Even in advance of the weather-related claims, market analysts had identified and reported on a number of important market developments that were expected to  lead to upward pressure on premiums.  For example, the 2009 Standard &amp; Poors report on the non-life insurance market warned that the next few years were likely to mark a testing time for Irish non-life insurers.  In particular, the report highlighted that underwriting profitability would become much more important due, for example, to the volatility of global stock markets, amongst other factors.  The report noted the importance of price discipline to ensure the long-term economics of the insurance marketplace.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy might wish to note that neither the Central Bank nor I, in my role as Minister for Finance, can prohibit or restrict an insurance company from increasing its annual premium rates. This is a commercial decision for the company in question based on an assessment of the risks involved.</P>

	<P>In accordance with section 55 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008, an air travel tax is levied on air travel. Subject to some exceptions, the tax is charged at the rate of &euro;2 per passenger in the case of a flight from an airport in the State to another airport located not more than 300 kilometres from Dublin Airport and at the rate of &euro;10 per passenger in all other cases. The yield from the air travel tax in respect of the nine months it was in place in 2009 was &euro;84.4 million and the yield in 2010 was &euro;104.6 million &mdash; total &euro;189 million.    Almost all the fuel used for commercial air travel is jet kerosene, which is exempt from excise duty.  </P>
        <P>As regards VAT, the position is that the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage is exempt from VAT by virtue of paragraph 14(3) of Schedule 1 to the Value-Added Tax Act 1972.</P>
        <P>I do not accept that the air travel tax has a material impact on tourism numbers. Prospective visitors will base their choice of destination on a range of issues. These will include the cost of travelling to a destination but are more likely to be influenced by the cost structure within that destination, and the range of activities and visitor attractions on offer.</P>
        <P>However, taking account of some of the comments made last year, I announced in the Budget a single revised rate of air travel tax of &euro;3 with effect from 1 March 2011 and will assess the impact of this to see if passenger numbers are affected.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of mineral oil tax and for tackling the illicit trade in mineral oil products that they are aware of the various illegal activities that lead to a loss to the Exchequer of mineral oil tax.  The most serious risk in this regard is the large scale laundering of markers from mineral oil, [including marked ultra low sulphur gas oil (ULSGO)], <Col N="223"/>which is subject to a reduced rate of mineral oil tax on condition that it is not used in road vehicles.  Such activity is usually carried out in remote rural locations. The Deputy will appreciate that, due to its nature, it is impossible to provide a reliably accurate estimate of the extent of any illegal activity.    The Revenue Commissioners are committed to tackling mineral oil fraud. Their goal is to prevent a loss of revenue to the state and at the same time to ensure that a level playing pitch exists for the benefit of legitimate trade interests, including the road haulage industry. In this regard Revenue employs a broad range of compliance and enforcement strategies to detect illicit practices involving mineral oils. These strategies include ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, development and sharing of intelligence with agencies on both sides of the border, development of analytics and deployment of detection technologies, optimum deployment of resources to intercept illicit product and to prosecute those involved, conduct of intelligence driven operations using covert surveillance to identify oil laundry locations and also physical sampling at selected road checkpoint locations.</P>
        <P>Revenue enforcement officers are deployed at key locations along the border.  The staff are regularly augmented by additional staff from other areas when specific operations are organised.  While the physical environment and separation of law enforcement in border areas is exploited by criminals to conduct this illegal activity, the Commissioners advise me that such operations are not solely confined to those areas. This is borne out by two recent detections of oil laundries on farms in the midlands.</P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s operations are under continuous review. The Revenue Commissioners are presently reviewing the existing marker system and are exploring the introduction of new markers as well as new detection equipment.</P>
        <P>For the past two years Revenue has played an integral role as part of a cross border multi-agency Organised Crime Task Force which has been set up specifically to deal with the illicit trade in mineral oil in the border area.  Members of this group include Revenue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and various law enforcement agencies from Northern Ireland. Since its inception it has successfully targeted a number of illegal operators in the border area.  In one such cross-border operation, in April 2009, three oil laundering plants were detected in Armagh, with consequential seizures of over 100,000 litres of fuel in Monaghan. These multi-agency operations are in addition to daily enforcement activity.</P>
        <P>In 2010 Revenue enforcement staff detected four laundering plants in this jurisdiction and seized a total of 268,000 litres of laundered fuel. These cases are under active investigation and it is Revenue&rsquo;s intention to initiate criminal proceedings and prosecute individuals where sufficient evidence of involvement is established.</P>
        <P>Also in 2010 there were 1,192 detections in individual motor vehicles of the illicit use of mineral oil, resulting in the seizure of 167 vehicles. There were 222 criminal convictions for such offences resulting in Court penalties of &euro;678,150. A further number of these cases were settled by means of compromise penalties amounting to &euro;669,778.</P>
        <P>A provision was enacted in Finance (No 2) Act 2008 enabling Revenue to raise assessments on companies and individuals in respect of evaded excise duty on excisable products, including mineral oils.</P>
        <P>The penalties provided under the Finance Acts for conviction for mineral oil related offences are on summary conviction &euro;5,000, and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months and on conviction on indictment up to &euro;126,970. The latter penalty, which was enacted in the Finance Act 2010, represents a significant increase on the previous penalty of &euro;12,695.</P>

	<P>I do not accept that the air travel tax has a material impact on tourism numbers. Prospective visitors will base their choice of destination on a range of issues. These will include the cost of travelling to a destination but are more likely to be influenced by the cost structure within that destination, and the range of activities and visitor attractions on offer.   However, taking account of some of the comments made last year, I announced in the Budget a single revised rate of air travel tax of &euro;3 with effect from 1 March 2011 and will assess the impact of this to see if passenger numbers are affected. </P>

	<P>The tax exemption for patent income has been in place for over 30 years and has applied to income received by an individual or company from a qualifying patent subject, since 2008, to an annual limit of &euro;5 million. A tax exemption has also applied, subject to certain conditions, to distributions paid by companies from exempt patent income. These exemptions have been abolished with effect from 24 November 2010.   The decision to abolish the relief was taken in the light of a recommendation to this effect by the Commission on Taxation. As part of its review of all tax expenditures, the Commission on Taxation examined the relief for patent income to determine if its continued operation was justified on cost benefit grounds. The Commission found that the relief has not had the desired impact on innovation and R&amp;D activity and that, despite various refinements to the scheme over the years, it was not a particularly well-targeted measure providing good value for money. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government agrees with the conclusions of the Commission and believes that in the current challenging times scarce resources should be focused instead on the R&amp;D tax credit scheme. The R&amp;D credit scheme provides a more direct and effective incentive for enterprises to innovate and invest in R&amp;D activities and the scheme has been enhanced considerably in recent years to make it one of the most competitive of its kind anywhere.</P>
        <P>Abolition of the patent income exemption will yield &euro;50 million to the Exchequer in a full year and this is provided for in the National Recovery Plan. Alternative options for curtailing the relief were considered in the context of the Plan, such as limiting the tax free payment to a fixed amount per annum. While capping the benefit or restricting it in other ways, as suggested in the question, would provide some savings, it would still mean a significant cost to the Exchequer and would be difficult to justify on the basis that it would provide tax-efficient means for remunerating employees.</P>
        <P>It was not considered necessary to undertake a cost benefit analysis for the abolition of this exemption as it was included in the Commission on Taxation review of tax expenditures on which the Commission made a recommendation.</P>

	<P>The position is that the Universal Social Charge applies to all emoluments of an employment, including anything treated as a taxable benefit-in-kind.  The Universal Social Charge is applied to aggregate income before granting relief in respect of pension contributions.  In this regard, an individual&rsquo;s personal contributions to a personal retirement savings account (PRSA), personal pension contribution, additional voluntary contribution or a retirement annuity contribution is disregarded for the purposes of determining the Universal Social Charge that an individual must pay.</P>
        <P>In addition, an employer contribution to a personal retirement savings account (PRSA) is chargeable to Income Tax in the hands of the employee as a benefit-in-kind under section 118 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  As the Universal Social Charge treatment follows the Income Tax treatment, the employer&rsquo;s contribution to the personal retirement savings account will also be subject to the Universal Social Charge.</P>
        <P>Section 778 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, provides that an employer contribution made to an approved retirement benefit scheme or a statutory scheme is not treated as a benefit-in-kind for Income Tax purposes. Again, as the Universal Social Charge treatment follows the Income Tax treatment, any employer&rsquo;s contribution to such schemes will not be subject to Universal Social Charge.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s proposal favours tax revenue being solely based on usage of a car, through fuel consumption, rather than ownership upon which motor tax is determined.  This is often argued as the most favourable option from an environmental perspective as it embraces the &lsquo;polluter pays principle&rsquo;.  In an Irish context motor tax revenue is allocated to local authorities so this complicates the proposal somewhat.</P>
        <P>In addition, motor tax (and VRT) have been reformed in recent years in order to stimulate interest in low emission cars which in turn has led to enhanced sales of more fuel efficient vehicles.  This development has been welcomed by both motorists and the motor trade.  Consequently it would seem premature to effectively reverse this significant policy change at this early juncture. Furthermore, replacing the revenue collected from VRT and motor tax would require a significant increase in excise duty on petrol and auto-diesel.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In so far as the supply of printed matter is concerned, three different rates may apply.  The general position is that books are zero-rated, newspapers and periodicals are subject to VAT at the reduced rate (currently 13.5%) and stationery and other printed matter are liable at the standard rate (currently 21%).   The zero rate applies to printed books, including atlases, children&rsquo;s picture, drawing and colouring books and books of music.  The reduced rate applies to newspapers and periodicals, including sectoral publications (sports, fashion, etc.), holiday brochures, prospectuses, catalogues and maps.  The standard rate applies to a wide range of printed goods, including stationery, calendars, greeting cards, diaries, yearbooks and posters.</P>
        <P>All digitised publications, regardless of their rate when printed (for example, a book liable at zero rate), are treated as the supply of a service liable at the standard rate of VAT.  E-books, online newspaper subscriptions and online information services purchased via download over the Internet are also considered the supply of services liable for VAT at the standard rate.  The EU position is that digital information services are not the direct equivalent of traditional printed products, including books.  Even where the content is similar, the additional functionality (e.g. search facilities, hyperlinks, archives etc) associated with electronic content produces a fundamentally different product.</P>
        <P>I have no immediate plans to change the VAT treatment of books.  However, as stated in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to examine further rebalancing of the VAT system and zero rated VAT items within the context of wider and ongoing EU level consideration of the matter.  The VAT system is continually being reviewed at EU level and Ireland is part of that process.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 304 and 307 together. </P>
        <P>The changes to section 23-type reliefs announced in the Budget and which are contained in Financial Resolution No. 20 are broadly as follows.</P>
        <P>Firstly, for chargeable periods ending on or after 1 January 2011, section 23-type relief will be restricted to set-off against rental income only from the section 23 property itself. Up until now this set-off could be against all rental income in that year.</P>
        <P>Secondly, unused section 23-type relief previously available for carry forward beyond the 10 year &ldquo;normal life&rdquo; of the relief will be lost.</P>
        <P>Thirdly, where a person sells a section 23 property within the 10 year period at any time on or after 1 January 2011, the new owner will get no section 23 relief.</P>
        <P>Fourthly, for unused section 23 properties that are, as yet, unsold, the relevant 10 year period for these properties would normally begin once the property is sold and let under a qualifying lease.  The Budget change provided that where any of these properties have yet to commence qualifying leases as of 30 June 2011, the 10-year period will commence on that day.</P>
        <P>I also announced in the Budget that a guillotine will be introduced to terminate all unclaimed and unused capital allowances, arising after, or carried forward from 2014 as well as unused section 23 relief carried forward from 2014.  However, an impact assessment will be undertaken into the effects of the phased abolition of the property-based measures and the guillotine provision. This guillotine provision, which is intended to take effect at end-2014 is not contained in any of the Financial Resolutions passed on Budget Day and will be provided for in future legislation. The arrangements for the impact assessment, and any consultation mechanisms involved have yet to be made.</P>
        <P>Further details regarding these measures will be set out in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
        <P>My officials have received a wide range of submissions and met with a broad spectrum of stakeholders (including industry groups and professional bodies) in relation to the changes set out in the National Recovery Plan and announced in the Budget.</P>
        <P>The measures announced were subject to legal advice.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be able to input their views on the proposed changes as part of the normal Finance Bill process.  I look forward to all constructive proposals on this matter.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The National Recovery Plan contains proposals for changes to the tax and other relief arrangements for private or supplementary pension provision over the period of the Plan, including a gradual reduction to standard rate income tax (20%) relief on employee/individual contributions to pension arrangements commencing in 2012. Pension contributions are made by certain employees in both the private and public sectors. It is intended that the reduction in tax relief of 7% each year from 2012 to 2014 will be given effect by the Budget and Finance Bills for each of those years.  As announced in my 2011 Budget Statement, certain changes including the application of employee PRSI and the Universal Social Charge to employee pension contributions, take effect from 1 January 2011. The PRSI change has been legislated for in the Social Welfare Act 2010 while the provisions relating to the Universal Social Charge will be included in the 2011 Finance Bill which will be published shortly.</P>
        <P>The National Recovery Plan recognises that the various changes proposed may reduce saving for private pension provision. The Government is committed to raising &euro;700 million from the pension sector over the period of the Plan. However, it is willing to engage with the sector to examine alternatives to the changes put forward in the Plan in order to deliver this outcome and this engagement has commenced.</P>

	<P>I have been informed that information given to my Department by Bank of Ireland to the effect that no performance related bonuses were paid to staff was incorrect. It did not take account of contractual bonuses which probing by my Department revealed did in fact have a performance element. This failure by the bank led to erroneous information being placed on the D&aacute;il record on 1 December 2010.  The CEO of Bank of Ireland has written to my Department acknowledging the difficulties caused as a result of this misinformation and apologising unreservedly for it. I have been undertaking, as a matter of urgency, an intensive investigation of the additional payments made by Bank of Ireland since the introduction of the guarantee scheme and of additional payments which it may have intended making in the future. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the verification by my Department of all the relevant information supplied by the bank necessarily involves a substantial amount of time. On completion of this investigation I will make available to the Deputy, and the House, whatever additional information comes to light.</P>
        <P>As I have previously stated, I do not accept that substantial sums ought to be paid in bonuses to senior staff of banks dependent on State support. Contractual obligations have in the past restricted my ability to deal with this issue in relation to pre-agreed payments or conditions of employment, but the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 provides in Section 51 that in certain circumstances I, as Minister for Finance, may impose conditions on the provision of further State support to a Credit Institution. In particular I may impose conditions regarding the payment or non-payment of performance bonuses. I have already made clear in the AIB <Col N="229"/>case that I will impose such conditions and I can assure the Deputy that I intend to adopt a similar approach to the provision of support to Bank of Ireland.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, following an open tender process undertaken in 2009, Revenue entered into contracts with six firms of solicitors to provide legal services associated with debt collection and recovery. The contracts came into operation with effect from 1 January 2010 and will remain in force for six years.</P>
        <P>I understand that Revenue took particular care to ensure that the open tender process fully adhered to public procurement guidelines. To assist in the tender preparation process, Revenue utilised the services of Messrs. Philip Lee, Solicitors, Dublin and Messrs. Cyril O&rsquo;Neill, Legal Cost Accountants, Dublin.</P>
        <P>The six firms of solicitors, and the total amount of fees paid to each of the firms in 2010, are listed in the table below. Another firm, George V. Maloney, that completed work for Revenue in 2010 under the terms of a previous contract, is also included.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 312 and 315 together. </P>
        <P>The standardised methodology for monitoring relative competitiveness across the euro area is the Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator (HCI).  While it cannot be denied that Ireland had its competitive edge eroded relative to our European peers, as a country we are regaining this competitiveness. Since mid-2008, the Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator for Ireland, as measured by the Central Bank of Ireland, has been falling more or less constantly, indicating an improvement in our international competitiveness.  This improvement comes despite the <Col N="240"/>renewed appreciation of the euro against the dollar and sterling in the wake on quantitative easing measures in both the US and UK.</P>
        <P>Ireland, as a member of a currency union, must focus on improving competitiveness at home.  In this regard, we are seeing the benefits of our labour market flexibility: much available evidence points to recent downward pressure on wages in the economy, for example. average weekly earnings were down 1.4% in the year to Q3 2010. Furthermore, unit labour costs &mdash; wages adjusted for productivity &mdash; are forecast by the European Commission to fall in Ireland next year.  In addition, Ireland has had the biggest decline in consumer prices of the euro area which has had a considerable positive impact on our competitiveness.</P>
        <P>While the falls in domestic prices, easing wage pressures and improvements in productivity are helpful, we must not be complacent as further improvements in our competitiveness are essential to take advantage of the global recovery.  To this end, the National Recovery Plan outlined a programme of structural reforms which will help to further restore competitiveness and support economic growth.</P>

        <Quest> the degree to which he and-or his Department is in regular contact with EU institutions and the International Monetary Fund to ensure the success of this country&rsquo;s financial strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[1667/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As is normal in these circumstances, officials of my Department are in ongoing contact with their counterparts in the EU Commission, the IMF and the ECB in relation to implementation of the joint programme of financial assistance which has been agreed for Ireland.   I understand that frequent contact is also taking place between the staff of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Office and the external funding agents.   The policy conditionality associated with the EU-IMF Programme for Ireland is set out in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies and in the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality.   These documents together with the Technical Memorandum of Understanding which are collectively referred to as the MoU have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.    </P>
        <P>As regards the fiscal consolidation aspects of the agreement, as the Deputy will be aware, the release of the first instalments of financial assistance is conditional on the successful adoption of Budget 2011.   In this regard, the Social Welfare Act 2010 is in force and the Finance Bill 2011 is due to be introduced on 25th January 2011.</P>
        <P>As part of the quantitative performance criteria of the Technical Memorandum of Understanding, a target for the end-2010 Exchequer primary balance &mdash; the Exchequer balance excluding debt interest payments &mdash; of -&euro;15.3 billion was set.  Excluding debt interest payments of just under &euro;4.1 billion, the Exchequer primary balance in 2010 was -&euro;14.65 billion, meaning the target was met.  This data was relayed to the IMF, European Commission and European Central Bank on Wednesday, 5th January.     I can also confirm that the data provision obligations on my Department, the NTMA and the Central Bank are being pursued in line with Annex 1 of the Memorandum of Understanding.</P>

	<P>All buildings acquired by the Office of Public Works for the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme are utilised and are not surplus to requirements.  The Office of Public Works secured sites, which have yet to be developed, in nine locations to provide accommodation for decentralising Departments/Offices.  The development of these locations will be the subject of a Government review of the programme this year.  A six acre site in Knock, Co. Mayo, was purchased in the sum of &euro;390,000, and development at this location was negated by planning issues.  The Government decided to decentralise personnel due to locate in Knock to Charlestown, Co. Mayo instead, subject to the review of the overall programme. </P>

        <P FLI="0">These Central Bank estimates take account of all elements of the banks&rsquo; loan books, including the mortgage loan books.  It has taken a realistic view of the likely losses to mortgage lenders. Indeed, the loss rates that have been used in both the base and stress case scenarios are in excess of the latest official figures released by the Central Bank. Furthermore, the detailed review undertaken by the external authorities of the financial status of the Irish banks and, in particular, of the Central Bank&rsquo;s PCAR exercise was an important part of the technical dis<Col N="242"/>cussions underpinning the negotiated package of assistance with the IMF and our European partners. The Governor of the Central Bank recently confirmed that the external experts had found no fault with the methodology used for the PCAR stress test earlier this year. As part of the agreement with the EC, IMF and EU the State has agreed to adopt deleveraging measures and to implement restructuring of the banking sector.  To this end, a Prudential Liquidity Assessment Review or &ldquo;PLAR&rdquo; will establish target funding ratios for each of the banks, identify non core assets and set an adjustment path to these targets based on specified non public annual benchmarks.</P>
        <P>As to further funding being required, the State in the case of AIB and EBS remains committed to meeting their remaining capital requirements to the extent that they cannot be met from other sources.</P>
        <P>Bank of Ireland has raised some &euro;700m of their capital requirement through an LME exercise in December and intends to seek to generate the remaining required capital through a combination of internal capital management initiatives, support from existing shareholders and other capital markets sources. On 10 January 2011 Bank of Ireland announced the completion of the sale of Bank of Ireland Asset Management to State Street Global Advisors.</P>
        <P>A key objective of the Programme agreement is to ensure that the viable financial institutions are in a position to access the market for their funding and capital needs in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 317, 318 and 320 together. </P>
        <P>The State&rsquo;s primary consideration in its involvement in the banking system is to protect, in the public interest, the financial and economic system of the State.  Therefore,  the Government&rsquo;s actions in the banking area are designed, while minimising the cost to the taxpayer, to support the development of a reformed and reinvigorated banking system that can serve our economy in a proper manner and, within which, there is scope for all viable credit institutions operating in the Irish market to play their full part.</P>
        <P>The agreed joint EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support recognises and supports this overall objective, builds upon the banking measures taken to date and provides for further reform and reorganisation of the banking sector.  The objective of the Programme, in so far as it relates to banking, is to fundamentally downsize and reorganise the sector so that it is proportionate to the size of the economy. In that regard it envisages that the banks that will <Col N="243"/>continue to fully serve the needs of the economy will be capitalised to the highest international standards and that a specific plan for the resolution of Anglo Irish Bank and INBS will be finalised and submitted to the European Commission for approval by end January.  This will move Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Irish Life and Permanent and EBS towards holding higher levels of capital and should allow them maintain and secure more stable funding and thereby facilitate them to meet the credit needs of sustainable businesses and households.</P>

	<P>The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 established a single, integrated, Central Bank of Ireland (&ldquo;the Bank&rdquo;) to replace the dual Central Bank and Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority structure.  That Act was the first in a proposed three stage legislative programme.   The day-to-day regulation of banks and other financial service providers is primarily a matter for the Bank and in June of 2010 the Bank published &ldquo;Banking supervision: our new approach&rdquo; which sets out its vision of a more intrusive financial regulatory regime.   The Bank already has substantial powers of enforcement and extra resources in place to ensure that banks and other financial service providers conduct their business prudently and properly.  Work is continuing to prepare heads of a second Bill which is intended to equip the Bank with additional powers and functions for the regulation of all financial service providers including the banking sector.  </P>
        <P>A third Bill to consolidate the Central Bank Acts will follow.</P>

	<P>The individual case raised by the Deputy which refers to the reduction in pension is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Transport, as employer, in the first instance.   The Government decided, in the context of the serious national budgetary position, that retired public service pensioners should make a contribution to the overall required fiscal adjustment. This decision was taken having regard to the gap between the burden being borne by those currently in public service employment (where the pension related deduction (PRD) and pay reduction have impacted) and their retired counterparts.</P>
        <P>The measure concerned is legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, which was signed into law by the President on 22 December 2010.  Section 2 of that Act provides that the public service pension of a pensioner (as defined) will be reduced, subject to the first &euro;12,000 of annual pension income being exempt.  Section 2(2) specifically provides inter alia that the reduction has effect notwithstanding any provision by or under any circular or instrument or other document, or any written agreement or contractual arrangement.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Government has made clear that a critical part of its strategy to restore the public finances is to achieve sustainability in the cost of delivering public services relative to State revenues. To help achieve this goal, it will be necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and to reduce public service numbers over the coming years. This requires that the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the health service will continue to apply until the numbers have fallen to the level set out in the Employment Control Framework 2011-2014 for the health sector. The Framework gives effect to the Government policy on employment in the public sector.</P>
        <P>However, the Framework does allow for the filling of certain exempted grades including Medical Consultant, Speech &amp; Language Therapist, Occupational Therapist, Physiotherapist, Clinical Psychologist, Behavioural Therapist, Counsellor, and Social Worker. There are also grades/posts to which special provisions apply including Psychiatric Nurse and Advanced Nurse Practitioner/Clinical Nurse Specialist.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Health Service Executive can also make exceptions to the moratorium on recruitment under certain conditions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE has made significant progress in re-organising acute hospital and related services in the mid-west region since April 2009.  Ennis General Hospital, as part of the regional hospital network, now undertakes an expanded range of day case surgery and diagnostic work.  The range of services provided in Ennis will continue to be expanded, so that people can have most of their health care needs met as close as possible to where they live.</P>
        <P>In deciding on the best model for the provision of cardiology services in the region, the unanimous medical advice is to centralise acute cardiology to the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick.  This is in line with the model being developed in the region, whereby services are organised on an integrated regional basis, delivered in a range of locations and settings.  To facilitate this, a fourth cardiologist is being appointed in 2011.  This will facilitate a separate cardiology rota, giving patients access to a cardiologist and catheterisation services on a 24-hour basis for emergency cases in the region.  All cardiology services currently available in Ennis General Hospital will continue to be provided and these services will be expanded further, with the addition of cardiac failure clinics and cardiac rehabilitation services for patients who have had the acute phase of their illness managed in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme.  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than &euro;120 per calendar month towards the cost of <Col N="252"/>approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
        <P>In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</P>

        <P>The Minister for Health and Children met with a delegation from the Justice for Magdalene group last year, together with officials from HSE and from the Department. Following the meeting, the HSE undertook to make enquiries regarding the various matters which had been <Col N="255"/>raised by the group with regard to the role of the health boards. Due to the significant length of time which has elapsed, the exercise is complex and time-consuming. My Department has written again to the HSE requesting a progress report on the matters referred to and a response is awaited.</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />indicate what protocols or guidance existed over the years to guide professional practice; and</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Institute sought to make arrangements for the review to be carried out by an external team. Unfortunately, it was not possible to progress this in the way originally proposed. I understand that the Institute is now making alternative arrangements with the assistance of a university school of public health.</P>
        <P>I have been assured by the HSE that it will continue to monitor and oversee the provision of necessary support services for women.  In doing so the HSE is committed to being proactive in seeking out and offering help to women who had symphysiotomies and who may wish to avail of the services offered by the HSE.</P>

	<P>The Health Information and Quality Authority does not operate a statutory complaints process.  However, reports received from the public regarding alleged shortcomings in our health services are valuable to the Authority&rsquo;s <Col N="262"/>operations.  The Authority would be concerned that publication of information relating to such reports might jeopardise receipt of further reports.  Therefore, such reports are regarded as being given in confidence and are treated accordingly. The Authority has a policy of protecting these sources of information and not releasing details about the number or type of information provided.  In the absence of such an understanding of confidence, it is likely that the flow of information to the Authority would be limited and that people would be reluctant to raise issues or make representations on behalf of others less able to represent themselves.</P>
        <P>The Authority carried out a focused monitoring review in the hospital named against the National Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services in June 2010. The report can be found on <i>www.hiqa.ie</i>. No hygiene monitoring reviews were carried out at the hospital in 2010.</P>

        <P el="5" FLI="0">I am advised that fees paid to board members in the years 2008 to date are as follows:</P>
        <P el="5">2008 &mdash; &euro;54,000. Paid in respect of years 2007 and 2008 at the rate of &euro;9,000 per annum per person for 3 board members.</P>
        <P>2009 &mdash; &euro;24,300. Paid in respect of year 2010 at the rate of &euro;8,100 per annum per person for 3 board members.</P>

        <P el="5" FLI="0">I have requested a breakdown from CAAB of the fees and expenses paid to individual members of the Board and I will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>
        <P>The Children&rsquo;s Acts Advisory Board was established in 2007. The Board has advised the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) on best practice and co-ordination in the special residential care sector, on both a formal and informal basis.</P>
        <P>In October 2008 a decision was made by Government to subsume the functions of the Children&rsquo;s Acts Advisory Board (CAAB) into the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. This is provided for under the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2009, which recently passed Committee stage in D&aacute;il Eireann. The Bill is due to complete its passage through the Oireachtas shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Hayes Report makes detailed constructive recommendations about the operation of specific services in the hospital and all of these will be implemented. </P>
        <P>Following its publication, I met with Dr. Hayes to discuss the implications of his report.  I have also had discussions with the Chair of Tallaght Hospital and the CEO of the HSE about the report.  Their main focus is on what initiatives are needed both in the hospital and in the wider health system to provide sustained improvements in the services for patients.</P>
        <P>An additional 2 locum consultant radiologists were appointed to the hospital in January 2010 to assist in dealing with the backlog of X-rays.  The backlog has been cleared.  On 7 September 2010 the HSE issued formal approval to Tallaght Hospital to appoint two new consultant radiologists. This is in line with the recommendations of the Hayes Report.  The interviews took place in late 2010 with an expected start date for the successful candidates as soon as possible in 2011.</P>
        <P>The Hayes Report recommended that consultant radiologist staffing levels should be reviewed to ensure they are appropriate to the work load in each radiology department.  The HSE is committed to carrying out a review of consultant radiologist staffing levels in hospitals and to strengthening workforce planning across all radiology departments.  The review will be informed by the results of a survey of consultant radiologist staffing which is currently being undertaken by the Faculty of Radiology.  This report is awaited.</P><Col N="278"/>
        <P>Since 2005 there has been a 34% national increase in the numbers of consultant radiologists, from 183 to 245.  Ireland now has a ratio of 1 consultant radiologist per 17,959 population, which is similar to the UK at 1 per 18,040 per population.</P>
        <P>The HSE is fully committed to implementing the recommendations of the Hayes report in the shortest possible timeframe.  I am confident that adopting this approach will help ensure the provision of a timely and quality radiology service in Tallaght Hospital.</P>

	<P>The Government has made clear that a critical part of its strategy to restore the public finances is to achieve sustainability in the cost of delivering public services relative to State revenues. To help achieve this goal, it will be necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and to reduce public service numbers over the coming years. This requires that the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the health service will continue to apply until the numbers have fallen to the level set out in the Employment Control Framework 2011-2014 for the health sector. The Framework gives effect to the Government policy on employment in the public sector. </P>
        <P>However, the Framework does allow for the filling of certain exempted grades including Medical Consultant, Speech &amp; Language Therapist, Occupational Therapist, Physiotherapist, Clinical Psychologist, Behavioural Therapist, Counsellor, and Social Worker. There are also grades/posts to which special provisions apply including Psychiatric Nurse and Advanced Nurse Practitioner/Clinical Nurse Specialist.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Health Service Executive can also make exceptions to the moratorium on recruitment under certain conditions.</P>

	<P>I understand the Deputy is referring to a specific facility that proposes to provide short-term residential care in the HSE Southern region.  </P>
        <P>Under the Health Act 2007 statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), for the independent inspection and registration of certain categories of designated centres.  This includes residential care settings for older people.   Since 1 July 2009 all nursing homes, public and private, are registered under the Health Act 2007 (Registration of Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, as amended, by the Chief Inspector.  All nursing homes (public and private) are inspected under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, as amended, and must meet the <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.</i></P>
        <P>The Chief Inspector has the power to refuse to register, attach conditions to a registration or cancel the registration of a designated centre in the event of non-compliance with the regulations or the standards. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on an individual application for registration.</P>
        <P>I can, however, advise the Deputy that my Department recently commenced a review of the Care and Welfare Regulations.   As part of the review  submissions are welcomed from any individual, group or other body who wishes to make a contribution. Closing date for receipt of submissions is Monday, 31 January 2011 and further details are available at www.dohc.ie/consultations.  The issues raised in submissions, including issues specific to this type of residential facility, will be borne in mind when carrying out this review, which is due to be completed by mid-2011.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 445 and 446 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has been asked to reply directly to the Deputies in relation to the number of Irish-trained non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) employed in the health service and recruitment at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.</P>
        <P>As at 10 January 2010, approximately 165 of 4,638 NCHD posts were vacant.  The number of posts that are vacant reflects, primarily, an international shortage of such doctors.  While this presents challenges in particular locations, the HSE&rsquo;s Human Resources, Integrated Services <Col N="282"/>and Quality and Clinical Care Directorates are in response implementing a strategy encompassing a range of recruitment and service measures.  This strategy has been informed by recent meetings involving the HSE, the Medical Council, the Forum of Postgraduate Training Bodies and other stakeholders.  In addition, each HSE area has a contingency plan in place to ensure safe services are maintained in the context of any ongoing vacancies.</P>
        <P>Measures being progressed include restructuring existing training rotations to ensure they are appropriately aligned with reconfigured services, ensuring that hospitals with appropriate training capacity are assigned trainees and the introduction of additional Initial Specialist Training posts in Emergency Medicine and additional Initial Specialist Training posts in Surgery.</P>
        <P>With regard to increasing the proportion of Irish-trained non-consultant doctors, Government policy is to increase the number of EU undergraduate medical student places on a phased basis.  A graduate entry programme introduced in 2007 also provides for additional EU medical school places.  My colleague the Minister for Education and Skills has lead responsibility for implementing these initiatives; however, the continued expansion of medical student places will impact on the requirement for additional medical training places in the health service.  With the overall increase in the numbers of medical student places, my Department is in regular contact with the Health Service Executive regarding the number of intern training posts required by the health service.  The 2011 Employment Control Framework in the health sector provides for an additional 40 Intern places to cater for the continued expansion of medical student places and for implementing other reforms.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE has advised that on 13 November 2009 a contract notice was dispatched to the Official Journal of the European Union announcing the commencement of a procurement process for the delivery of a concessionary type model for legal services. </P>
        <P>The HSE has further advised that the contracting model is two-tiered and will at the outset involve a total of 35 law firms, all of whom have been qualified by the HSE to deliver services through four geographical panels, each panel representing a HSE Administrative Area.  The law firms on these panels (which have been called Member Firms) will be used to deliver advices and services in key legal areas such as Child Care, Environmental Health, Mental Health, Disability, etc. and these firms will be managed by a single law firm who will act as the service manager for the contract.  In addition to acting as the service manager, this law firm will also be responsible for providing the HSE with all of its corporate legal advice.</P>
        <P>The HSE has also advised that in order to give effect to the model, a three-stage procurement process was conducted. The general requirement to reduce legal costs has been the subject of agreement by the HSE with my Department and specific targets were included in the 2010 service plan.  I was informed by the Secretary General, in October 2010, that the procurement process was under way and that it was hoped that the new arrangements would come into operation from 1 January 2011.</P><Col N="283"/>
        <P>The Head of the Legal Division in my Department was also informed by her opposite number in the HSE that the tendering process was taking place.  Following a detailed and comprehensive evaluation process, the firm of Arthur Cox was selected as the Preferred Bidder to act as the service management firm for the new contracting model.  The Head of the Legal Division in my Department was informed that Arthur Cox had been chosen and that its name was going before the Board at a meeting to take place in December.  Contractual negotiations are currently ongoing with this firm with a view to a contract commencing on 1 March 2011.  To manage any risk associated with conflict of interest, a firm from outside of this jurisdiction was engaged to assist HSE in preparing contract documents.  The firm engaged to assist in this regard is the firm of McGrigors LLP, whose head office is in Edinburgh, Scotland.  Senior Counsel has also been retained on an as-required basis to advise the HSE.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 451 and 453 together.</P>
        <P>With regard to the information requested by the Deputy concerning legal services obtained by the Department between 2006 and 2010, the information set out below covers the period from January 2007 to November 2010.  I am advised that this is acceptable to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>In early 2009, the Department invited a number of solicitors to submit prices for work.  Based on the prices received, the Department made offers to the solicitors concerned, and those who accepted were included on a panel for use by the Department.  In previous years, for small drafting jobs which were below tendering limits, the Department felt that better value for money could be obtained from using those familiar with the relevant requirements.</P>
        <P>My Department has not sought legal advice in relation to tendering processes during the period outlined by the Deputy.  With regard to agencies under the remit of my Department, payment for legal services is an operational matter for the agencies themselves, and such information is not held by my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 468 to 473, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Pobal administers the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) on behalf of my Department. I understand from Pobal that the average number of passengers per month for counties Roscommon and Leitrim in 2010 were 3,543 and 3,062 respectively.  The RTP funding allocations for 2009 and 2010 for those counties were as follows: County Roscommon: 2009,  &euro;163,019; 2010, &euro;202,408. County Leitrim: 2009, &euro;231,269; 2010  &euro;307,370.</P>
        
        <P>It is understood from Pobal that preliminary allocations will be made to the RTP groups for the early part of 2011 to facilitate the maintenance of services pending the outcome of the current Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, the Report of which is nearing completion.</P>
        <P>The RTP like many other expenditure areas, is not immune from the effects of the challenging economic position facing the country. However the impact for 2011 is confined to a reduction of some 3.6% on the 2010 allocation for the Programme. I have every confidence that the RTP funded community transport groups will rise to any resulting challenges.</P>

	<P>Discussions are taking place between the Coast Guard, the HSE and the Irish Aviation Authority regarding the possibility of an &ldquo;aeromedical&rdquo; trial being undertaken in the West Clare area, whereby Coast Guard helicopters might be deployed in certain life critical circumstances to assist the national HSE ambulance service. It is hoped that the trial might commence in mid-2011. </P>
        <P>However, it is not intended that the Coast Guard will provide a normal full-time air ambulance service, known as a Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS). Under HEMS, dedicated helicopters are held on standby to deploy doctors or paramedics to treat or recover sick and injured people in response to emergency calls.</P>
        <P>The Department maintains Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopters on permanent readiness at four bases for maritime emergency response, including two on the west coast in Shannon and Sligo. These helicopters are principally employed for marine emergencies but they are occasionally used for land based rescue tasks where other rescue agencies require assistance, as recently witnessed during the spell of severe weather, and in remote areas where the distance to hospital and a long ambulance journey would be a significant threat to a patient. However, the Coast Guard could not support a normal HEMS service with its SAR helicopters as this would reduce their availability for their primary task of providing helicopter marine emergency services on our coasts and waters.</P>
        <P>This trial will be subject to a review by both the HSE and the Coast Guard to consider its effectiveness and value. It is envisaged at this time that the additional flying hours on the Shannon Coast Guard helicopter can be accommodated within this machine&rsquo;s current monthly training and operational flying allowance. If the West Clare trial is successful it is hoped to extend the service to other areas along the west coast.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Road Traffic Act 2010 provides for the introduction of mandatory breath testing of drivers by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in certain circumstances, including where a Garda attends at the scene of a collision where injury has been caused.</P>
        <P>Because of the inter-relationship between the section of the 2010 Act that introduces mandatory breath testing and other drink driving related sections of the Act, it will not be possible to commence this section until new apparatus to measure the reduced levels of blood alcohol <Col N="302"/>concentration are in place.  I understand that the new apparatus will not be available for use before September 2011.</P>
        <P>However, I intend to implement the policy of mandatory breath testing, as envisaged in the 2010 Act, without delay.  In order to bring forward the initiative, I have decided to amend existing legislation in advance of the commencement of the relevant provisions of the 2010 Act.  Accordingly, a new Bill that was published yesterday will make a requirement of drivers in certain circumstances to undertake a preliminary breath test. These circumstances will relate to drivers who, in the opinion of the Garda&iacute;, have consumed alcohol and will relate to drivers who are involved in collisions where injury is caused.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 493 and 494 together.</P>
        <P>Following the termination of Ryanair&rsquo;s contract to operate the Kerry Dublin PSO air service, my Department contacted the next highest ranking tenderer for the service and, in accordance with Paragraph 8 of the original invitation to tender for the service, asked them to consider whether they were in a position to provide the service for the remainder of the concession period, subject to the same conditions and level of compensation applying under the Ryanair contract.  The tenderer in question, having considered the matter, informed the Department that they were not in a position to accept the PSO contract on this basis.  All the current Public Service Obligation (PSO) contracts for services linking Dublin Airport with the regional airports at Derry, Donegal, Sligo, Ireland West Airport Knock, Galway and Kerry Airports commenced on 22 July 2008 and are due to expire on 21 July 2011.</P>
        <P>The Value for Money (VFM) Review of Exchequer Expenditure on the regional airports programme has been considered by Government and was published today.  Having considered the conclusions and recommendations of the Review, the Government has agreed to support the continuation of a Public Service Obligation (PSO) route between Donegal and Dublin and between Kerry and Dublin.  Arrangements are being put in place for a tender competition in respect of these two routes.  In line with the Review, the Government has also agreed to cease requiring PSO routes between Dublin and Sligo, Knock, Galway and Derry, from July 2011 recognising, inter alia, the improvements in alternative transport modes by rail and road which have taken place particularly with Government investment under Transport 21 in recent years.</P>
        <P>It must also be borne in mind that there are many demands on the Department of Transport&rsquo;s Vote and trying to maintain a level of expenditure on the Regional Airports Programme which is no longer justified or sustainable would impact negatively on other areas such as public transport provision and/or road maintenance.  I envisage that implementation of the recom<Col N="304"/>mendations of the Value for Money Review will result in the appropriate use of scarce Exchequer resources in a more focused way to secure an adequate network of regional airports serving the Irish public, both in terms of business and tourism.  Where a PSO route is being terminated from mid July 2011, the route will be open to commercial air services from that date.</P>
        <P>Overall, I believe that the combination of an improved surface transport network together with a more consolidated air service network to regional airports, along with the State Airports at Cork, Shannon and Dublin, provides the necessary transport access to underpin Ireland&rsquo;s sustainable development.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 497, 502, 514 and 572 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that there has been a significant increase in the number of outlets offering to buy gold for cash in towns and cities in the State.  The prevalence of this trade would appear to be linked to the high price that gold now commands on international markets, and the &lsquo;cash for gold&rsquo; concept would appear to be an international phenomenon.  I am aware that the trade gives rise to concerns reported in communities about crime that may be linked to the cash for gold trade.  I understand that this trade is not supervised or regulated by the Central Bank, or any other regulator in the State.</P>
        <P>The informal purchase of jewellery is not specifically regulated in criminal legislation; however the circumstances under which jewellery is being bought and/or sold may indicate the commission of certain offences, for example handling stolen property and / or possession of stolen property under sections 17 and 18 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enforce the provisions of the criminal law in respect of theft and robbery including the theft and robbery of jewellery and gold.  Should members of the public have suspicions that goods being sold or traded may be stolen, the correct action is for these suspicions to be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.</P>
        <P>To take account of concerns about the matter, my Department recently asked the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ascertain his view as to the extent, if any, that criminal offences are being committed in the procurement and receipt of gold and similar items in transactions carried out at the cash for gold locations.  In particular the Commissioner has been requested to examine whether the trade may be linked generally or in particular areas to burglary offences; whether Criminal Justice legislation, and in particular, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 is adequate in the context of cash for gold transactions; whether criminal elements involved in organised crime or otherwise may be connected with the operation and ownership of the cash for gold outlets; and whether any new legislative provision may be required to address criminality in respect of cash for gold transactions.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that my Department has now received the Commissioner&rsquo;s report in the matter.  While the Commissioner&rsquo;s report is under consideration, he has indicated that there has been an overall decrease both in the number of burglaries recorded in the years 2005 to 2010 and in the number of burglaries recorded involving jewellery/trophies and antique gold in the same period.   He is also of the view that the relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 are adequate.  I might also add that the Commissioner has indicated that a significant number of the premises in question have been visited by Garda&iacute; <Col N="306"/>and the responsibilities of the owners in respect of purchases of the relevant items under the criminal law has been brought to their attention.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that as soon as the Commissioner&rsquo;s report has been given full consideration by my Department, I will make an assessment as to what if any action, legislative or otherwise may be required.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate firearms licensing is an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Each application is judged on its own merits and the decision on whether, or not, to grant a firearm certificate rests solely with the issuing person.  The decision of the issuing person cannot be fettered in any way and I have no role in the matter.  Finally, as of now, there are no plans to review the existing firearms legislation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 503 and 504 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has established a comprehensive system for the provision of the broad range of immigration services.  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) was established in 2005 and together with the Garda National Immigration Bureau administers the immigration service on behalf of the State.  Other offices within my Department such as the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit, COSC and the Victims of Crime Unit, while not exclusively dealing with immigrants, also develop policies and strategies and work closely with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist certain immigrant sectors and individuals.</P>
        <P>In relation to the framework established for considering asylum claims, in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), two statutory independent refugee status determination bodies, namely the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, were established with effect from 20 November 2000, to examine at first instance and where appropriate, on appeal, applications for asylum in the State.</P>
        <P>Over the period in question the total funding allocation for running the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), which includes the delivery of services across the asylum, immigration, naturalisation and visa areas, has ranged from approximately &euro;10m to approximately &euro;64m with the 2010 allocation set at approximately &euro;59m.  The amounts allocated to my Department in respect of ORAC and RAT are included in the total allocation for running the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.</P>
        <P>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal.  RIA was established on 2 April 2001, with the merger of the Directorate for Asylum Support Services and the former Refugee Agency of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Over the period in question, the amount allocated to my Department for the accommodation of asylum seekers has ranged from approximately &euro;70m to approximately &euro;90m with the 2010 allocation set at approximately &euro;77m.  I should point out that RIA only took over <Col N="308"/>responsibility for asylum seeker accommodation from the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2003.</P>
        <P>The Refugee Legal Service (RLS) is responsible for the provision of confidential and independent legal services to persons applying for asylum in Ireland.  The RLS was established by the Legal Aid Board as a specialised office in February 1999.  Over the period in question, the amount allocated to my Department in respect of the RLS has ranged from approximately &euro;1.3m to approximately &euro;10m with the 2010 allocation set at approximately &euro;8m.</P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of asylum applications received in the period 2000-2010 is set out in Table 1 below.  In circumstances where non-nationals (excluding EEA Nationals) enter the State and remain for a period longer than ninety days, he/she is obliged, pursuant to the provisions of section 9 of Immigration Act, 2004, to present to a registration officer for the purpose of being placed on a register of non-nationals  who are resident in the State.  The number of non-nationals who were on the register at the end of year of the years 2000 to 2010 is set-out in Table 2 below:</P>

Of these there are a total of 164 applicants who have completed all stages of the application process for entry to the Garda College.  The remaining candidates are being processed through background screening, medical examination and physical competency tests.</P>
        <P>The National Recovery Plan 2011- 2014 provides for a reduction in the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 13,000 by the end of 2014.  This reduction, and the rate at which it is achieved through retirements, will be taken into account in determining when recruitment will re-commence.</P>

        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that sanction has been granted by the Minister for Finance to recruit an additional 80 recruit prison officers, from the existing recruitment panel, to meet the immediate needs of the prison service.  It is envisaged that the new recruits will begin training this month.  I can further advise the Deputy that to date 480 candidates have been called to interview from the 2008 recruitment panel.  Due to the moratorium, I am not in a position to advise if any further candidates will be called from this panel.</P>

	<P>The question of the payment of bonuses in the Legal Aid Board is a matter for the Board, which is statutorily independent of my Department.</P>
        <P>I am advised that as the high level scheme of performance-related awards that applied to senior civil servants and Chief Executives of non-commercial State bodies such as the Legal Aid Board has been discontinued, no bonuses have been paid by the Legal Aid Board under this scheme in 2010 nor will any be paid in 2011.  I understand, however, that ex-gratia payments were recently made to two officers in the Legal Aid Board, amounting to &euro;6,000 and &euro;3,000 respectively.  In both cases, the awards related to the explicit assignment of additional duties and workload.  In the first case, the officer concerned developed a new legal case management system that will greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Board.  Much of the work was completed in the officer&rsquo;s own time and without any outside consultancy support.  In the second case, the officer was given responsibility for driving forward new service delivery initiatives, which freed up senior management to focus on the transfer of Criminal Legal Aid cases to the Board.</P>
        <P>I am assured by the Board that the making of these awards was exceptional and that the value to the Board of the additional work undertaken by the officers concerned, is a multiple of the cost of the awards.</P>

	<P>My Department provides centralised support for 23 websites &mdash; related to the work of the department and some bodies under its remit &mdash; developed under its IT Shared Service model.  Details of visits are not recorded for all sites but figures recorded in 2010 indicate that there was an average of 38,534 unique visits per month to my Department&rsquo;s main site (www.justice.ie) and that there was an average of 47,803 unique visits per month to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).</P>
        <P>Hosting and related charges for these sites in 2010 came to &euro;13,025.  Other costs, such as staff time spent maintaining the site content which forms part of the day to day work of the Department, are not separately accounted for.</P>
        <P>Websites are an essential communications tool for any modern organisation in providing essential customer services.  As part of the Shared Service model, websites are developed and maintained based on reusable templates.  This approach has led to a reduction in the cost and effort of setting up and supporting  websites.</P>

Local Garda management is aware of the incident referred to by the Deputy, and its investigation is ongoing.  The person referred to was contacted immediately the Garda&iacute; became aware of the incident, advised of the progress of the investigation and provided with contact details should he require any further update.  Victim support information was also given to the person.  Further attempts to make direct contact with the person have been unsuccessful.  However, local Garda management is available if the person wishes to make contact.  </P>
        <P>The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain-clothes personnel, including the Community Policing and Mountain Bike Units and the District Detective and Drug Units, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.</P>

The situation is kept under review.</P>
        <P>Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences.  Community policing is a central feature and core value of Garda policing policy, and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.  One member of the local Community Policing Unit is specifically assigned to the area referred to and regularly meets local residents to help address their concerns.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting to organisations in Ireland registered with the Garda&iacute; for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>The employment vetting service provided by the Garda&iacute; has been expanded greatly in recent years as part of a phased programme to roll-out the service to an increasing number of organisations.  Within this programme the vetting service has now been extended to over 18,000 organisations.  The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over that period in the numbers of vetting applications it receives, from around 188,000 in 2007 to almost 325,000 in 2010.</P>
        <P>Given the large number and wide range of client organisations, the registration process is managed through umbrella organisations which provide single points of contact.  This ensures more effective co-ordination and improved quality control in the various sectors and a more efficient use of resources in the vetting process.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the organisation to which the Deputy refers was advised that it was not possible to extend the Garda Vetting service to them at that time.  However, the objective of the GCVU is to register all  relevant organisations and to extend the Garda Vetting service to them. The phased roll out of registration is continuing apace but I cannot say precisely when any particular organisation will be registered.</P>

	<P>The person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order, made following the consideration of her case under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). This Order was served on the person concerned by registered post dated 25 November 2010. This placed a legal obligation on her to &ldquo;present&rdquo; at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) in order that arrangements could be made for her deportation from the State. </P>
        <P>The person concerned failed to &ldquo;present&rdquo; as required and is therefore classified as a person evading deportation. As a person evading deportation, the person concerned is liable to arrest and detention for the purposes of effecting her deportation from the State. Against this background, the person concerned should, therefore, present herself to the GNIB without further delay.</P>
        <P>I should<b> </b>remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the person concerned is the sibling of an Irish born child of non-EEA parents that was born in the State prior to 1 January, 2005. The person concerned was granted permission to remain in the State in her own right on 15 February 2008 for an initial 12 month period. I am informed that this permission has been renewed and is currently valid until 11 February 2011. In light of her current circumstances, I would advise that the person concerned contact her local Immigration Officer for a further renewal of her permission.</P>
        <P>I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

	<P>Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 24th August, 2010, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  </P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) <Col N="321"/>on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>
        <P>Having due regard to the high volume of cases awaiting processing, the Deputy can be assured that the case will be processed to completion as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the person concerned was granted permission to remain in the State in 2001 under the arrangements then in place for the non-EEA parents of Irish born children. This permission was renewed on a regular basis up to 17 June 2010. However, I am informed that the Garda National Immigration Bureau refused further renewal of his permission to remain when it came to light that the person concerned was no longer living with his Irish born child. Following the receipt of correspondence from him, my Department requested documentation from the person concerned to establish his family situation in December 2010. To date the person concerned has not responded to this request and I would advise that he do so as soon as possible, given that he is currently in the State without permission.</P>

	<P>The persons referred to by the Deputy are a mother and her young child. While only the mother is named in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, it is being assumed that as both reference numbers are provided, he is seeking information on both cases.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of their respective asylum applications, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the persons concerned were notified, by separate letters dated 8th September, 2010, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.  They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against them.  In addition, they were notified of their respective entitlements to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</P>
        <P>The persons concerned submitted applications for Subsidiary Protection and, following consideration of these applications, it was determined that the persons concerned were not eligible for Subsidiary Protection.  The persons concerned were notified of these decisions by separate letters dated 6th December, 2010.</P>
        <P>The cases of the persons concerned were then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement and all representations received were considered before decisions were arrived at in their cases.  On 9th December, 2010, Deportation Orders were signed in respect of the persons concerned.  These Orders were served by registered post dated 15th December, 2010. These communications advised the persons concerned of the legal requirement that they &ldquo;present&rdquo; at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 6th January, 2011 in order to make arrangements for their deportation from the State. <Col N="323"/>Further representations were received on behalf of the persons concerned on that date. These representations will now be considered as applications under Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) to have the Deportation Orders revoked. When decisions have been taken on these applications, the persons concerned will be notified in writing of the decisions and of the consequences of the decisions. In the meantime, the persons concerned are required to adhere to any residency or reporting requirements placed on them by the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

	<P>The Deputy might wish to note that the motoring offence in question was that of drunken driving which, upon conviction at District Court level, gave rise to a financial penalty and a three year disqualification from driving. </P>
        <P>In relation to the immigration status of the person concerned, he had worked in this State for a number of years on foot of employment permits, the last of which lapsed on 24th February 2009.

        <P>Arising from the refusal of his Long Term Residency application, and given that the person concerned had no other valid basis to remain in the State, he was notified, by letter dated 18th May, 2010, of the proposal to make a Deportation Order in respect of him, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.</P>
        <P>Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and these representations will be fully considered, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before a final decision is taken.</P>

	<P>Section 36 of the Prisons Act, 2007, which was brought into operation on 1 May, 2007, makes it an offence for prisoners to have unauthorised possession of or use of mobile telecommunication devices. Under the Act it is also an offence to supply such a device to a prisoner.  The penalties for such an offence, on summary conviction, include a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. It is Irish Prison Service policy to report and hand over seizures of mobile phones to the Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>Cell and area searches for contraband such as mobile phones take place in all prisons on a daily basis.  These include random, targeted and intelligence led searches.  These searches have been particularly effective. In addition, the provision of netting over prison yards has provided an effective deterrent to individuals who might otherwise have sought to throw contraband, including phones, over the prison walls.  Indeed, local intelligence indicates that the availability of mobile phones has decreased across the prison system.  This is as a direct consequence of the security measures in place in our prisons.</P>
        <P>Details of mobile seizures are set out in the following table:</P>

        <P>In my reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s Parliamentary Question No. 147 of 15 December, 2010 I noted that the CSO had provided to the Deputy statistics in respect of 2007 and 2008 on the numbers of recorded prison offences which led to criminal proceedings and convictions; that, as explained to the Deputy by the Office, statistics in respect of 2009 and 2010 were not available; and that more detailed statistics than those provided were not available.</P>
        <P>I understand that statistics in respect of 2009 will be available in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Statistics Act 1993 provides that the Central Statistics Office has sole responsibility for and is independent in deciding the statistical methodology used by the Office and the content of statistical releases and publications issued by it.</P>

The person concerned did not &lsquo;present&rsquo; as required on that occasion and, as such, he was deemed to be evading his deportation.  This position continued to obtain until 21st May, 2009, on which date the person concerned &lsquo;presented&rsquo; at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau. </P>
        <P>On 7th May, 2010, an application to have the Deportation Order revoked, pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), was received from the legal representative of the person concerned.  This application is under consideration at present and a decision is expected shortly.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the relevant party.  In the meantime, the person concerned is required to adhere to any residency or reporting requirements placed on him by the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

	<P>Further to Parliamentary Question No. 191 of 7 December 2010, the Travel Document Unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) informs me that the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question is still the holder of temporary permission to remain in the State until 29 May 2011, which was granted to him on an exceptional basis. </P>
        <P>As previously advised, the person concerned was issued with a temporary travel document on 19 November 2009 valid for one year for the sole purpose of allowing him travel to procure his national passport.  He was informed that this temporary travel document would not be renewed as it was being issued to him on a discretionary basis.</P>
        <P>In line with usual practice the Garda National Immigration Bureau issued a Certificate of Registration valid up 18 November 2010 being the date of expiry of the temporary travel document and advised that a national passport should be obtained to allow for further registration up to the 29 May 2011.  In order to renew an existing registration a person is required under Section 9(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Immigration Act 2004 to produce a passport issued by an authority recognised by the Irish government which establishes identity and nationality unless a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances which prevents a person from doing so is provided.</P>
        <P>It is now a matter for the person concerned to contact his own national authorities in order to obtain his passport.  I am informed that the DR Congo Embassy in London is the appropriate office to contact in relation to this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2009 I announced a new policy on the management of sex offenders in prison which is aimed at bringing about changes in offenders&rsquo; lives that reduce risk of re-offending and enhance public protection.  Significant progress has been made to date in implementing this policy, with Arbour Hill being designated as the national centre for sex offenders and the introduction of a new suite of programmes for sex offenders called the Building Better Lives (BBL) programme. The new approach allows for interventions to take greater account of individual risk, needs and capacity.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances where a convicted sex offender has completed his or her sentence and is released into the community the relevant state agencies manage that person&rsquo;s release, and the level of interventions required, on the basis of the assessed risk to public safety.  Best practice indicates that different jurisdictions as well as different agencies within jurisdictions should use the same evidence based sex offender risk  assessment instruments so as to support effective communication. Therefore an all island risk assessment tool has been introduced. The combination of RM2000 and SA 2007 is the sex offender risk assessment system currently used by Probation and Police services in Northern Ireland, Scotland and in various parts of England and Wales.</P><Col N="341"/>
        <P>The Risk Matrix 2000 (RM 2000) is a static risk assessment instrument which enables criminal justice agencies working with offenders to estimate the likelihood that an offender will incur a further conviction over long term periods of 5, 10 and 15 years. It distinguishes four levels of risk: low; medium; high and very high. As such it gives a clear indication of the level of intervention the offender will require if under supervision.  The Probation Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have undertaken a programme of staff training in this instrument. The Probation Service has trained approximately 120 staff from prison and community based teams to ensure a national capacity to assess all sex offenders under the supervision of the service. This instrument is currently being applied to sex offenders under the supervision of the Probation Service and subject to Garda notification requirements.</P>
        <P>SA 2007 is a dynamic sex offender risk assessment instrument. This instrument is responsive to the current risks posed by individual sex offenders. Further, it identifies key risk factors relevant to the particular individual so that risk management strategies can be more individually targeted. It also provides a warning system for imminent relapse. The Probation Service introduced the SA07 through its High Risk Offender Management Team in 2007 and commenced a twelve month SA07 national pilot from 1 May 2010.</P>

	<P>Dedicated anti-human trafficking units have been established in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health Service Executive (HSE), the Legal Aid Board (LAB) and the Department of Justice and Law Reform (Anti-Human Trafficking Unit &mdash; AHTU).</P>
        <P>To date, a total of 495 Garda&iacute; have participated in an in-depth training course entitled &lsquo;Tackling Trafficking in Human Beings: Prevention, Protection and Prosecution&rsquo;. Members of other police forces also participated in this training. Awareness raising training on human trafficking has also been delivered to a total of 2,956 probationer Garda&iacute; during their final phase of training. Basic awareness raising human trafficking related training has been provided to 32 members of the Garda Reserve. Training on human trafficking, including identification, has also recently been provided to Senior Investigating Officers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In July 2010 a representative of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na made a presentation to the Circuit Court Judges Annual Conference. During 2010 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives from <Col N="342"/>the AHTU made presentations on human trafficking to regional seminars organised by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA).  The services of a Crime Prevention Officer is made available to potential victims of human trafficking by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assess any risk to the victim and to provide appropriate advice.</P>
        <P>Specialised training has been provided to staff of the LAB who are providing legal assistance and advice to potential and suspected victims of trafficking in human beings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A &lsquo;Train the Trainer&rsquo; course was delivered to staff of 13 Public Sector organisations likely to encounter victims of trafficking. Since the completion of this training, a total of 180 persons in four of the organisations have received training on human trafficking given by those who participated in the &lsquo;Train the Trainers&rsquo; course. Training of further staff is planned.  Information seminars have also been provided to consular staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs being posted abroad and to staff in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation responsible for the granting of work permits.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A national awareness raising campaign <i>&ldquo;The Blue Blindfold Campaign&rdquo;</i> was launched by the Garda Commissioner and I on 21 October 2008.  Since the campaign, my Department&rsquo;s Anti-Human Trafficking Unit and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been actively engaged in further raising awareness of the issues through writing articles on human trafficking in numerous publications, making presentations at conferences and third level colleges and engaging with both governmental and private sector organisations to highlight the issues.  I opened a film festival at Liberty Hall featuring films on labour exploitation targeting transition year students and trafficking for sexual exploitation targeting adults to coincide with EU Anti-Trafficking Day on 18 October 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">AHTU, in consultation with the Awareness Raising and Training Working Group, has designed, published and distributed leaflets on Labour Exploitation and Sexual Exploitation. These leaflets set out the indicators of trafficking for labour and sexual exploitation, contain sample case studies and contact details.  AHTU is also finalising a Guide to Procedures which outlines the rights and services available to potential and/or suspected victims and the contact details for organisations that will be useful to a potential and/or suspected victim and service providers.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recently participated in a nationwide human trafficking related awareness raising campaign undertaken by Ruhama with information packs and awareness raising leaflets developed by Ruhama disseminated to targeted personnel in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na likely to encounter victims of human trafficking.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland, through the Department of Foreign Affairs/Irish Aid Stability Fund, is providing &euro;100,000 in funding towards the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe project for the enhancement of anti-trafficking measures in the Ukraine.  Under the current phase of the Irish Aid &mdash; International Labour Organisation (ILO) Partnership Programme which commenced on 1 August 2008, Ireland is providing &euro;9 million over 3 years (2008-2011) to the ILO for activities across a range of countries.  A total of &euro;1.8 million or 20% of the budget has been allocated to the ILO Special Action Programme to Combat Forced Labour.</P>
        <P Just="Left">AHTU produced a Summary Statistical Report for 2009 containing information on the nature and extent of human trafficking in Ireland based on information provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Non-governmental Organisations working in the area of human trafficking.  A Summary Statistical Report for 2010 is currently being prepared.</P>
        <P>The RIA provides direct provision accommodation to potential and suspected victims of human trafficking prior to and for the duration of the 60 day Recovery and Reflection period provided for in the Administrative Immigration Arrangements for the Protection of Victims of Human Trafficking. Suspected victims who choose to assist with the investigation or pros<Col N="343"/>ecution of the trafficking offence, where applicable, may be granted a 6 month temporary residence permission and are assisted in making the transition from direct provision to mainstream social services including access to the labour market by the Asylum Seekers and New Communities Unit of the HSE.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A total of 39 cases have been referred by the GNIB to the dedicated team in the LAB providing legal assistance and advice to potential and suspected victims of human trafficking between November 2009 when the service was first provided and 1 December 2010.  Some 56 referrals have been made to the HSE dedicated team to devise and deliver individual care plans &mdash; including counselling where appropriate &mdash; in the period since the HSE started to providing services up to December 2010.  Interpretation and translation are made available by all the service providers when required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE has confirmed that all newly arriving children receive a professional Social Work Assessment and this includes an assessment of the potential of the child being a victim of trafficking.  From January 2010, all newly arriving children under 12 years were placed on arrival in a foster care placement.  The newly arrived child over 12 years was placed in one of the four registered residential intake units for up to, at most, four to six weeks, where a preliminary assessment of the child and their needs was carried out by a social worker in conjunction with qualified residential social care staff. Input from a Psychologist was available if required.  This assessment informed the most appropriate care option, and identified if the child would need additional supports/links.  All children/young people are allocated a Social Worker on arrival and an initial care plan is developed in conjunction with Social/Care staff and educational input from the Department of Education and Science.  Medical assessment takes place and referral to specialist services is made if required.  Two hostels closed in July 2010 and the remaining two closed on 31 December. By December, the 15 hostel residents were all over 18 years and moved to adult services in Dublin to facilitate the completion of the academic year ending July 2011.  Children and young people are placed in foster care placements with approved and trained foster carers. The Joint Garda/HSE Protocol is followed when children or young people are reported missing and the Garda website is utilised where appropriate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following my request to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to assess the need to establish a dedicated Missing Persons Unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including a response similar to Amber Alert, and to report their findings to me, the Inspectorate published its report in March 2009.  One of its main recommendations was that an emergency alert system for missing children, similar to the Amber Alert system in place in other countries, should be established.  In April, 2009 I gave the go ahead for the implementation of this recommendation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has commenced work on developing the most appropriate structure to give effect to the recommendation, taking account of progress at international level in the development of alert systems for missing children.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that an Assistant Commissioner has been appointed to oversee the introduction of such an alert system in this jurisdiction. The development of such a system is complex and requires a multi-agency approach.  It will provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with access to on-air broadcasters and other means of communication during the critical period immediately after a child abduction.  This will require the co-operation of a range of agencies, including Government Departments, phone service providers, electronic and print media, television and radio service providers and the public.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 586 and 587 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may know, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a system in place for the monitoring of all persons subject to the notification requirements &mdash; sex offenders&rsquo; register &mdash; of the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  Their Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit monitors and manages the notification provisions and maintains all information relating to persons who have obligations under the Act.  There is a nominated Garda Inspector in each Garda Division who has responsibility for the monitoring of persons subject to the requirements of the Act in his/her Division.</P>
        <P>In January, 2009 I published a comprehensive discussion document on the management of sex offenders.  One of the issues raised was the question of whether the name and address of sex offenders who completed their sentences should be made public. Following publication of the document my Department invited comment and held a forum to hear the views of a range of interested parties. The universal view of those who responded was that such a general approach to the publication of this type of information would be counter productive and would, in all probability, drive sex offenders underground where they could not be monitored and where they were more likely to re-offend.  There was, however, support for the view that those with a legitimate interest should receive appropriate information and, if there was a danger to the public, the Garda&iacute; should be able to make the identity of a sex offender known. Provision of information to the public in exceptional circumstances, including the provision of appropriate information to parents, is already possible on an administrative basis. Subject to Government approval, it is intended to introduce legislative provisions to put such disclosure on a statutory footing. This would have the effect of allowing the Garda&iacute; to warn individuals of a particular danger or to respond to specific requests.</P>

	<P>Valid applications for a certificate of naturalisation from the persons referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question were received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in February 2008.</P>
        <P>The applications are currently being processed in the normal way with a view to establishing whether the applicants meet the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision in due course.</P>
        <P>The average time from application to decision is 26 months.  It is not possible to provide more specific information in an individual case as processing requirements and time taken to carry out necessary checks vary from case to case. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a <Col N="345"/>way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Garda&iacute; for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives from around 188,000 in 2007 to almost 325,000 in 2010.  At present, there are approximately 55,000 applications in the course of being processed, the majority of which were received in 2010, with a small number received to date in 2011.</P>
        <P>The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates in line with periods of increased demand.  Furthermore, additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process.  However, the Garda&iacute; make every effort to reduce the time to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately 11 weeks.</P>

	<P>The CONNECT project was piloted with EU Integra Funding in the years prior to 2000 and was announced as part of the 2000 to 2006 National Development Plan.  It consisted of three strands: Work Training (including Specials Projects), Sentence Management and Capital Projects. Expenditure under the programme consisted, in the main, of staff salaries and materials for the work training area.</P>
        <P>CONNECT&rsquo;s original focus was on vocational orientation and training for prisoners, combined with job placement at the time of release.  Other needs of prisoners impacting potentially on their employability were to be addressed through the existing prison services.</P>
        <P>An internal Irish Prison Service review of CONNECT was carried out in 2002.  The result was a decision to refocus the project to concentrate exclusively on the Work Training area.  It was decided that the sentence management elements needed to be aligned more centrally within the prison system rather than residing in the work training area.  This change in focus was subsequently agreed by the Regional Monitoring Committees that monitor the National Development Plan during the mid-term review process.</P>
        <P>The refocus towards the provision of enhanced pre-vocational and vocational training involved dedicated new staffing and funding within the prison system.   The Work Training Service increased from approximately 150 staff to an authorised complement of over 250 posts and was complemented by a workshop refurbishment and equipment replacement programme.</P>
        <P>The learning from CONNECT informed the development and rollout of Integrated Sentence Management (ISM).  The core goal of ISM is a prisoner centred approach to the management of custodial sentences. ISM is to identify, deliver and measure appropriate interventions to address the identified risks and needs of prisoners.<b>  </b>  ISM is currently operating in ten prisons: Arbour Hill, Castlerea, Cork, D&oacute;chas, Midlands, Mountjoy, Portlaoise, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, the Training Unit  and Wheatfield.  Currently, over 1,000 prisoners are engaged in ISM.  It is intended to provide ISM to all newly committed prisoners with sentences of one year and upwards.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the development of the new prison campus at Thornton Hall, Kilsallaghan, County Dublin is now proceeding on a phased basis. Phase one, which is currently in progress, comprises essential preliminary works to facilitate the prison development including the construction of a dedicated access road, the installation of off-site services and the construction of the perimeter wall of the prison.  The next phase of the project involves the provision of 400 cells along with related support facilities suitable to accommodate up to 700 prisoners. Subsequent phases of the project will see the provision of the balance of the 1,000 cells providing a total of 1,400 cells when completed with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 prisoners, thus future proofing the development.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Access Road</i></P>
        <P el="0">The contract for the construction of the access road to serve the prison development was awarded to SIAC Construction Limited in July 2010 and construction work is already well underway in relation to this phase of the project. The access road and underpass are scheduled to be completed in February this year.</P>
       <P el="10"><i>Off-site Works</i></P>
        <P el="0">The contract for the installation of the off-site services to serve the prison development was awarded to PJ Hegarty and Sons recently following a tender competition. Construction work is scheduled to commence shortly and will take approximately eight months to complete.</P>
       <P el="10"><i>Perimeter Security Wall</i></P>
        <P el="0">The procurement process for the design and construction of the perimeter security wall of the prison is already in progress.  A pre-qualification competition for the design and construction of the perimeter security wall was held and five companies were short-listed to receive the tender documents. These documents issued last November and completed tenders are due to be returned by the end of this month. Construction of the perimeter wall is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2011 and will take just under a year to complete.</P>
     <P el="10"><i>Prison Buildings</i></P>
        <P el="0">As I mentioned previously in the House, my priority is to provide good quality, regime focussed prison accommodation at Thornton Hall prison campus as quickly as possible. A phased development of the prison campus is now being pursued. The next phase of the works <Col N="350"/>will see the procurement of prison accommodation blocks and related support facilities commencing later this year using traditional procurement methods.</P>
        <P>Adopting a phased approach will provide prison accommodation at Thornton Hall in 2014. It makes sense to tender for the construction of these much needed prison facilities now in an environment where construction costs have fallen significantly.</P>
       <P el="10"><i>Mountjoy Prison</i></P>
        <P el="0">In relation to the toilet facilities at Mountjoy Prison, I can inform the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service is currently engaged in a project to upgrade and recommission 36 cells in the basement of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; Wing at Mountjoy Prison.  A feature of the upgrade is that each of the 36 cells in the basement will be provided with a flushing toilet and a wash hand basin.</P>
        <P>While this project is underway, the Irish Prison Service has deemed it opportune to examine the structural, operational and economic feasibility of providing flushing toilets and wash hand basins to all of the cells in Mountjoy &ldquo;C&rdquo; Wing. In this context an invitation to tender for the provision of in-cell sanitation to the remaining cells in Mountjoy &ldquo;C&rdquo; Wing issued to the member firms of the Prison Service&rsquo;s Construction Framework Agreement on the 31st. December last.</P>

	<P>I can advise the Deputy that over 70% of prisoners are unemployed on committal and a similar percentage of these prisoners self-report as not having any particular trade or sectoral occupation.  Employment is a vital factor in reducing recidivism &mdash; international research has shown that employment on release can reduce the risk of re-offending by between a third and a half. Improved vocational skills and competencies are essential for placement post-release in employability options. The Irish Prison Service, therefore, places a strong emphasis on the provision of vocational training activities and courses for prisoners.</P>
        <P>Training activities are chosen to give as much employment as possible in prison and to give opportunities to acquire skills which will help prisoners secure employment on their release. A wide range of training workshops operate within the institutions, e.g. printing, computers, woodwork, metalwork, construction, industrial contract cleaning, craft, horticulture, braille and electronics. In addition, formal training is also provided in prison services such as catering and laundry.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service is developing enhanced partnership arrangements with both City and Guilds and the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) which will allow for centralised and coordinated management of the accreditation process and an expansion in the number of courses and activities with certification. The skills areas, where additional certified courses will be delivered in the coming years, include painting and decorating, storage and warehousing, fork-lift driving, catering, metal/welding, construction, horticulture, electronics and laundry operations.</P>
        <P>In regard to employability placement programmes, Business in the Community Ireland (BITC) is the main provider of support in this area. Since its inception in 2000, the BITC <Col N="351"/>Linkage Programme has been providing a professional guidance and placement service, in partnership with the Probation Service, to persons on probation and to prisoners and ex-prisoners. Currently, the community-based BITC Linkage Programme Training and Employment Officers (TEOs) provide an inreach clinic service to prisoners in eight of the country&rsquo;s fourteen institutions. Since 2007, a new BITC programme &mdash; the GATE Service &mdash; has been operating in the other six institutions &mdash; Mountjoy, D&oacute;chas, St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, the Training Unit, Midlands and Portlaoise Prisons. Funded by the Irish Prison Service, four GATE Service TEOs work on a full-time basis in the prisons concerned and provide a training, education and employment placement service. From the start-up of the service in the summer of 2007 to the end of 2010, 1,438 referrals have been made to the TEOs. Of those 601 remain engaged post-release, 430 of whom have been placed in training, education or employment.</P>
        <P>BITC personnel interact with all national services to maximise the opportunities for prisoners on release from prison. They also interact with any local services that similarly can support the reintegration of prisoners. At national level, the Gate and Linkage Services, the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service and F&Aacute;S have agreed a protocol to facilitate the smooth and effective referral of prisoners and ex-prisoners to F&Aacute;S courses and their successful completion of the identified programme. BITC&rsquo;s social inclusion programmes also interact with the Department of Social Protection, in particular with the Jobs Facilitators, and, where appropriate, with the Community Welfare Officers of the HSE.</P>
        <P>TEOs working with the Gate or Linkage Services and mentors working with the Mentoring Service, interact with local partnerships to access the full range of services that may be available. These include accessing training programmes, support, funding and advice about services in the county, as well as participating on committees and projects. For example TEOs have been involved with the Northside, Tallaght, Laois, Kerry and Sligo Leader Partnerships, Drugs Task Forces, Traveller Initiatives, Community Action Projects and Community Development Projects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Prison Service also worked directly with Cork, Galway and Roscommon area partnerships on the You&rsquo;re EQUAL project which ran from 2005 to the end of 2008 with a combination of ESF and participating organisation funding including the Irish Prison Service. The pilot project focused on providing integrated training, mentoring and guidance to prisoners and former prisoners from Cork and Castlerea Prisons. Over the lifetime of the project through care mentoring support was provided to over 190 prisoners. The pilot experience informed the new mentoring initiative which is co-funded through Dormant Accounts and Irish Prison Service funding which is being run by BITC and went operational in a number of prisons in 2009.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service participated in and presented at a seminar in October 2007 organised by the Network of Ex-prisoner Voluntary Agencies (NEVA) in conjunction with Pobal. The seminar was organised for staff of Area Partnerships and was aimed at building and strengthening their work with ex-prisoners and their families in the context of their social inclusion programmes. The Irish Prison Service subsequently provided profile and statistical information to partnerships on request to assist them in the development of strategies focused on this target group.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 417. With the extra resources provided by this Government, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been increasingly successful in prosecuting criminals and extra court sittings have resulted in higher committal rates.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland traditionally has had a low rate of imprisonment.  Council of Europe annual penal statistics measure imprisonment rates by prison population per 100,000 inhabitants.  The European average is about 109 prisoners per 100,000.  In 2008, the latest year for which full statistics are available, Ireland had a rate of 84.8 well below that average.  The UK for example had a figure of 152.8.  Based on that data, we were below most western European countries other than Scandinavian countries. These latest Council of Europe penal statistics show that Belgium (125%), France (131%), Italy (130%) and Spain (141%) all have more severe levels of overcrowding than Ireland.  The USA imprisonment rate is around 700 per 100,000 inhabitants. However, it is also true to say that as our prison numbers increase so too will our position on the table change and this is something that I am very conscious of.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces. Since 1997 in excess of 1,930 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system.  These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the D&oacute;chas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise, Castlerea and most recently Wheatfield prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.</P>
        <P>Construction has commenced on a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prisons complex which will provide 300 prison spaces in 2012. Also in the short term, work is due to commence on converting an administrative building on the D&oacute;chas site into a new accommodation block which will provide 70 spaces in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin. The new prison facility will provide accommodation <Col N="353"/>for 1,400 prisoners with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 in a range of security settings.</P>

	<P>In recent years, in addition to the direct work of probation officers in regard to accommodation issues, a weekly clinic service has been provided in ten prisons by the Health Service Executive (HSE) Community Welfare Service through the Homeless Person&rsquo;s Unit (HPU). Referrals to this service generally are at the pre-release stage and emergency and other accommodation options, supplementary benefits and fast tracked medical cards are arranged by the Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) who provide the information and clinic services. There were 700 prisoners assisted by the CWOs in 2008, 759 in 2009, and 939 in 2010. There is no breakdown available as to the number who were facilitated into accommodation as opposed to receiving other support services.</P>
        <P>Focus Ireland operates a pilot homeless service in Cloverhill Prison which provides a case management and pre-settlement service for remand prisoners.  The service supports participants in accessing appropriate services and accommodation on the pathway to independent living.  The project is supported by the IPS, the Probation Service and the HSE. By the end of 2008, 68 prisoners had benefited from the service since its establishment in September 2007.  A further 25 prisoners used the service in 2009. However figures for 2010 are not yet available but will be forwarded to the Deputy when they become available.</P>
        <P>Additionally, the Probation Service funds a number of community based organisations in this area.  PACE supports people through the transition from prison and an offending background into the community and to break the cycle of offending. PACE residential services provide supported accommodation on a short term basis for 22 homeless males leaving prison. There are 14 high support places and 8 transitional low support places.  PACE also provides low support long term accommodation to a further seven people from offending backgrounds. The specific number of clients PACE residential services worked with over the last three years is: 60, 64, and 58 to September 2010.  The PACE training and education programme can accommodate 40 trainees at any one time.  The specific number of clients who engaged with the programme over the last three years is: 102, 87, and 90 to September 2010.</P><Col N="354"/>
        <P>In addition to the funding of PACE the Probation Service provides financial assistance to support the effective resettlement of female offenders (T&uacute;s Nua) and high risk offenders (New Directions).</P>
        <P>The IPS secured &euro;250,000 in Dormant Accounts funding for the provision of homelessness support services to prisoners in Cork and Limerick prisons.  This service is provided by Focus Ireland and commenced in the summer of 2009.  By the end of 2010, there had been 90 referrals to the service and the two project workers engaged with 59 clients during that year.</P>
        <P>In support of the development of homeless services for prisoners/offenders both the Probation Service and Irish Prison Service are represented on the recently established Regional Homeless Consultative Fora.</P>

	<P>The Irish Prison Service places a strong emphasis on access to educational services and on the provision of work and training activities for prisoners.  Educational services are available in Mountjoy and all other prisons and are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies in the community, notably the VECs.  Provision of literacy, numeracy and general basic education is a priority and broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach.</P>
        <P>Education programmes are adapted to take account of the diversity of the prisoner population and the complex nature of prison life, including segregation requirements and high levels of prisoner turnover. Educational courses and curricula, which are based on individuals participating in one or more subject areas for an academic year and sitting terminal examinations, are only appropriate for a small number of prisoners. Junior and Leaving Certificate courses are available but increasing numbers of prisoners require a more flexible curriculum which has multiple entry and exit points that take account of prior educational attainment. FETAC accreditation is therefore widely used with assessment by portfolio compilation. All prison Education Units meet the quality assurance standards demanded by FETAC.</P>
        <P>The education programmes provided in prisons can be broadly categorised as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Basic Education, including literacy, numeracy, English as a second language and communications;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Creative Arts, notably music, sound recording and production, drama, art, craft, stone work, creative writing, film production and photography;</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that Operation Marshall was a policing operation undertaken by the Garda National Drugs Unit with support from local drug units during the period June to December 2010.</P>
        <P>The operation targeted drug dealing in the following three Garda Divisions within the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) &mdash; Dublin North-Central, Dublin South-Central and Dublin West.</P>
        <P>I am informed that approximately 100 &lsquo;street-deals&rsquo; of drugs, principally heroin and cocaine, were purchased as part of this operation. The operation has resulted in the arrests of 46 persons, with further arrests anticipated.</P>
        <P>Persons arrested for offences contrary to Section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984 as amended (possession of controlled substances for sale or supply) were detained under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996. All such persons are either currently before the Courts, awaiting law officers directions, or remain under investigation, at this time.</P>
        <P>The monetary value of drugs seized during this initiative was approximately &euro;5,000, with individual street-deals worth on average between &euro;20-&euro;80 being purchased by undercover officers.</P>
        <P>Given the nature of the operation it is not possible to determine the precise number of Garda&iacute; who were involved in this operation.</P>
        <P>Finally, I am assured by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to be fully committed to tackling the supply of drugs at all levels under the National Drugs Strategy.</P>
        <P>The Garda National Drugs Unit works together with local Garda Drugs Units to ensure a coordinated and effective approach to protecting our communities, individuals and their families from the harm and pain caused by drug misuse.</P>

My Department continually keeps under review visa arrangements with visa-required countries including China.  In this regard, the Deputy may wish to know that the Approved Destination Status initiative put in place in April 2010 with the Chinese authorities, whereby the National Tourism Administration of China approve group tourist applications, has proved beneficial.  The number of visa applications received by the Irish Visa Office in Beijing grew from 4,603 in 2009 to 5,211 in 2010, a 13% increase.</P>

        <P>The current qualifications for the appointment of Taxing Master are set out in Schedule 8 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 and require that the appointee be a solicitor of not less than 10 years standing.  It is my intention to widen the qualification requirements to encompass candidates with relevant costs and management experience. The Public Appointments Service will be in a position to match the skills required of the Taxing Master.

	<P>The Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 provides that, if the specified Minister considers that the publication of a report from a commission might prejudice any criminal proceedings that are pending or in progress, the Minister must apply to the High Court for directions concerning the publication of the report.  If, after hearing the application, the High Court considers that the publication might prejudice any criminal proceedings, it may direct that the report or a specified part of it be not published for a specific period or until the court otherwise directs.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of the report dealing with the Diocese of Cloyne from the Commission of Investigation into Child Sexual Abuse, I immediately referred the report to the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that I am in a position to consider the discharge of my responsibilities under the Act.</P>
        <P>I am anxious that the matters dealt with in the report are put into the public domain as quickly as possible.  Equally, I am concerned that nothing should be done which would harm the prospects of the perpetrators of these horrific acts of depravity against children being brought to the justice they deserve.</P>
        <P>I have requested from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the information sought by the Deputy regarding investigations.  I will be in contact with the Deputy when the information is available.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 613 to 615, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to the 2009 Annual Report of the Competition Authority which makes clear that the Law Society has either completed or progressed all of the recommendations addressed to it.  The same Annual Report notes that while the Bar Council has implemented many of the recommendations addressed to it, the recommendations to allow direct access to barristers for legal advice and to allow barristers to operate in groups have not yet been implemented.  However, the Bar Council has authorised a number of approved organisations and their members to have direct professional access (DPA) to barristers in non-contentious issues.  The scheme does not extend to court appearances, but is limited to advisory work.  The number of approved bodies has risen to almost 50 and most barristers make themselves available for DPA work.</P>
        <P>Government policy on the need for changes in relation to the legal professions is reflected in the Legal Services Ombudsman Act 2009 which provides for the establishment of a Legal Services Ombudsman and in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008 which provides for a number of other matters relating to regulation of the solicitors&rsquo; profession.  Recruitment of the Ombudsman by the Public Appointments Service commenced in November, and an appointment will be made in the near future.</P><Col N="359"/>
        <P>The commitment in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland is to establish an independent regulator for the legal profession, to implement the recommendations of the Legal Costs Working Group and outstanding Competition Authority recommendations to reduce costs.  The details of my proposals for a Legal Costs Bill are already well advanced in my Department.  The question of better regulation generally of the legal professions is being considered in the context of that Bill as well as what implications the changes might have for the Office of the Legal Services Ombudsman.  The details will be published in due course following approval of them by the Government.</P>

In a number of instances, my Department and its associated bodies, in accord<Col N="360"/>ance with normal procurement procedures, have sought and paid for legal advice and services additional to those provided for centrally by the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor.

	<P>The first named person concerned applied for asylum on 27th March, 2007.  Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, it was established that she had previously made an asylum application in Belgium and, as such, a determination was made, in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulations, that she should be transferred to Belgium for the purposes of having her asylum application examined there.  This determination was upheld following an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  A Dublin II Regulation Transfer Order was signed in respect of the first named person concerned on 17th July, 2007.  This Order was served on her, by letter dated 2nd August, 2007, which placed a legal obligation on her to &lsquo;present&rsquo; herself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on Tuesday 7th August, 2007, to make arrangements for her formal transfer to Belgium.  She failed to &lsquo;present&rsquo; on this occasion and was therefore classified as having &lsquo;evaded&rsquo; her transfer.  She became illegally resident in this State at that time. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The first named person concerned continued to evade her transfer to Belgium with the consequence that the Transfer Order ultimately expired leaving Ireland responsible for examining her asylum application.  At this point the case was referred back to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner for the purposes of having her asylum claims investigated.  The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner subsequently made a recommendation that the first named person concerned be refused a declaration of refugee status.  Arising from the refusal of her asylum claim, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the first named person concerned was informed, by letter dated 21st July, 2010, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons she should not have a Deportation Order made against her.  She was also notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first named person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the first named person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the position in the State of the first named person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed <Col N="361"/>in writing to the first named person concerned.  The second named person concerned was granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of being a family dependant of non-EEA national parents of a child born in Ireland.  This permission was granted in line with that of his parents and is due to expire 7th January, 2012.</P>
        <P>I should<b> </b>remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</P>

	<P>I can advise the Deputy that on the 10 January, 2011 there were 4,369 prisoners in custody as compared to a bed capacity of 4,430. This represents an occupancy level of 99%.  I can also inform the Deputy that 134 prisoners were granted varying periods of temporary release for Christmas 2010 under the Criminal Justice Act 1960.  This figure represented approximately 2.5% of the prisoner population.  To date only one prisoner has failed to return to custody.  The Garda&iacute; have been notified that this prisoner is now unlawfully at large, in accordance with standard procedures, and are actively seeking his return to custody.  Of the prisoners released, approximately 54%  of the prisoners were serving their sentences in our lower security institutions: the Training Unit Semi-Open Prison; Loughan House and Shelton Abbey Open Centres.</P>
        <P>The prisoners granted temporary release were nearing the end of their sentences and the overriding concern when considering the applications was the safety of the public. In addition to compassionate and humane considerations, other criteria taken into account included the nature and gravity of the offence, length of sentence served to date, prior record on temporary release, behaviour while in custody and previous criminal history.  The periods of release varied from a few hours (in some cases accompanied by another responsible person) up to 7 nights. All releases were subject to stringent conditions.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Working Holiday agreements are concluded between Ireland and other Governments on a reciprocal basis. For Irish citizens the application is administered directly with the Embassy concerned or through a sponsoring organisation.  While precise numbers are not available in relation to the number of visa applications by Irish citizens approved in all the countries listed, the following table sets out the visa allocation for 2010 and the available information on the number of visas approved in 2009 and 2010.  In the case of Australia the programme runs from 1 July to 30 June and the figures <Col N="362"/>provided reflect these periods.  The Working Holiday agreement concluded between Ireland and the United States allows those enrolled in or recently graduated from post-secondary education to apply for a visa to work and live in the United States for a period of one year.</P>
        <P>Allocations under the Working Holiday agreements for each of the countries concerned are reviewed on a regular basis. Allocations remain unchanged with the exception of Canada which increased initially from 2,500 to 4,000 in 2010 with a further 227 places reallocated to Ireland from other unused programmes giving an overall figure of 4,227.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the issue to which the Deputy refers.  The Irish citizens concerned have been in contact with our Embassy in Sofia.  The Embassy advised that they should seek independent legal advice and provided a list of English-speaking lawyers.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for me or our Embassies to become involved in individual private transactions.  A number of complaints have been made by Irish citizens who have been involved in property transactions in Bulgaria.  During my visit to Bulgaria on 7 October 2010 I raised the matter with the Foreign Minister, Mr. Nikolay Mladenov.  Since that time, EU Embassies in Bulgaria have met with Government Ministers and suggested that a single point of contact be established, at Ministerial or deputy Ministerial level, to which representations on concerns regarding property transactions could be addressed.  The Ambassador of Ireland in Sofia also wrote to Minister Mladenov on 14 December 2010, recalling my meeting with him, and requesting assistance in establishing such a contact.</P>
        <P>I understand that some progress on this matter has been made and it is hoped that a contact point will be designated in the near future.  Once the designation is made, our Embassy and other EU Embassies will request an early meeting with the point of contact to discuss the full range of problems experienced by investors in property in Bulgaria, and to explore any possibilities for follow-up action.</P>

        <Quest> if he will intervene to release the seven prisoners of Baha&rsquo;i faith from Iranian captivity; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware from my previous replies on this matter, I am very conscious of the discriminatory treatment of the Baha&rsquo;i community in Iran and of the particular case of the seven former Baha&rsquo;i community leaders (known collectively as the Yaran), who have been in detention since 2008 and were sentenced to 20 years&rsquo; imprisonment in August 2010, with this sentence subsequently being reduced to ten years.  I have personally raised the case of the seven imprisoned Baha&rsquo;i leaders, and matters relating to human rights and religious freedom generally, directly with the Iranian authorities at the highest levels, including with former Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki in June this year.  In addition, my Department frequently conveys my concerns on such matters to the Iranian Ambassador here.  Officials of my Department also meet regularly with members of the Baha&rsquo;i community in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton, issued a strong declaration on 12 August, which Ireland fully supported, expressing the EU&rsquo;s serious concern about the sentencing and calling for their immediate release.  The declaration drew attention to Iran&rsquo;s obligations to guarantee freedom of religion under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a signatory.  It also called on Iran to put an end to the persecution of the Baha&rsquo;i community.  This follows an earlier EU statement on 12 January 2010, also strongly supported by Ireland, asking that the trial respect international standards.  In the event, there was no independent observation of the proceedings and even the defendants&rsquo; lawyers, to whom the Baha&rsquo;i had very limited access during their detention, had some difficulty in obtaining entry.  There appears to be no evidence that the seven Baha&rsquo;i have done anything to incur the displeasure of the Iranian authorities other than practice their faith.</P>
        <P>The Government is extremely concerned about this sentencing and other signs of the continued and indeed worsening oppression of the Baha&rsquo;i minority, including reports of the detention of other Baha&rsquo;i community members, the denial of educational opportunities and the violation of property rights.  It would appear that the Iranian authorities are persecuting a minority for their religious beliefs and that they are actively trying to suppress that faith.  Ireland will continue to call strongly for the immediate release of the seven Baha&rsquo;i leaders and the end to the persecution of members of this faith in Iran, including through bilateral contacts, with our EU partners and at the UN.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulation of produce labelling is not the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs, but is overseen by a number of domestic Departments.  In my reply to Question number 299 on 9 November 2010, I reported to the House on the results of my Department&rsquo;s discussion of this issue with those Departments.  Taking the matter further forward within the regulatory framework would be a matter for those Ministers and Departments. However, in my reply to that Question I also stated my own view that many consumers would wish to be aware if they were being asked to purchase produce originating in illegal Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories, and I indicated how this could be done, as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;It is important to be clear that, just as in the UK, there is nothing to stop Irish retailers now, if they wish, from clearly labelling goods to distinguish settlement produce. They could do so along the same simple and obvious lines as in the DEFRA guidelines, as either <Col N="365"/>&lsquo;Produce of the West Bank (Palestinian produce)&rsquo; or &lsquo;Produce of the West Bank (Israeli settlement)&rsquo;, or any similar wording.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I have placed that Parliamentary Reply on my Department&rsquo;s website, where it may be viewed by or cited to retailers or members of the public.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The achievement of a Palestinian State on the current Occupied Territories has been an important objective of successive Irish Governments.  This state must be based on the 1967 borders, and no alteration to those borders will be recognised unless it is the subject of mutual agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.  This is also the policy of the EU.  The Government works in a number of different ways to achieve this objective:</P>
        <P>Firstly, I have been very active and engaged at EU, UN and national level to focus attention on the continuing conflict, and to support efforts to reach a comprehensive settlement of the issues.  I have made a number of visits to the area and to the wider Middle East region, to learn first hand of the difficulties and encourage the parties to take the necessary steps to achieve peace.</P>
        <P>Secondly, both through the EU and bilaterally through Irish Aid we have actively supported the capacity building efforts of the Palestinian Authority, as it works under the plan of Prime Minister Fayyad to prepare itself to exercise the responsibilities of statehood.</P>
        <P>Thirdly, we work through Irish Aid to support efforts by UNRWA and other UN agencies, and both Israeli and Palestinian NGOs, to ameliorate the severe impact of the ongoing occupation on the lives of ordinary Palestinians, pending the final ending of the occupation and the achievement of a State of Palestine.</P>

	<P>In 2008, my Department placed a number of questions in Lansdowne Market Research&rsquo;s regular omnibus survey of 1,000 adults throughout the country.  The surveys took place from 21 February 2008 to 6 March 2008 and from 2 December 2008 to 24 December 2008.  The questions explored the public&rsquo;s attitude to a number of development issues.  The amount spent was &euro;14,000.  This was part of the Department&rsquo;s awareness campaign to highlight the opening of the new Irish Aid Volunteering and Information Centre on O&rsquo;Connell Street.  In July 2008, my Department commissioned, by way of tender, substantial research in order to clarify the reasons underlying the rejection of the Lisbon Treaty in June 2008 and to provide information on public attitudes toward the European Union.  This research, based on a national opinion poll of 2,101 adults and twelve focus groups conducted with a cross section of voter types and demographic groupings, was carried out by Millward Brown IMS at a cost of &euro;138,061.  The findings are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </P>
        <P>In light of the &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; vote in the second Lisbon referendum in October 2009 &mdash; and using the 2008 research as a benchmark &mdash; my Department commissioned, by way of tender, a follow-<Col N="366"/>up survey in November 2009 in order to provide a basis for identifying the lessons learned from the two referendum campaigns.  This consisted of a national opinion poll of 1,002 adults, carried out by Millward Brown Lansdowne at a cost of &euro;30,254.  The findings are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  No opinion polling or focus group research was carried out in 2007 or 2010.</P>

Therefore the provision of mobiles phones by the bodies does not arise.

	<P>The United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 2 December 2004.  The Convention sets out rules on the immunities of states, and the property of states, from the civil jurisdiction of the courts of other states.  It does not address the jurisdiction of courts in criminal proceedings.  The Convention is based on work carried out over a number of years by the International Law Commission which laid the basis for subsequent negotiations between states at the UN General Assembly.     The Convention was opened for signature at New York on 17 January 2005.  To date just 11 states have adhered to the Convention and, according to its terms, it will not enter into force until this number has reached thirty.</P>
        <P>The Convention raises a number of complex legal issues that require careful consideration.  It is currently under examination within my Department.  While this examination has not yet concluded it already seems clear that it will be necessary to enact legislation if the State is to become a party to the Convention.  Once my Department&rsquo;s examination is complete it is then intended to consult other relevant Departments and Offices.</P>

	<P>The Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR) is intended, when it comes into force, to set up a mechanism that will make it possible for individuals or groups of individuals to submit a complaint to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in regard to alleged violations of their economic, social and cultural rights by a State Party to the Optional Protocol. It does not create any new substantive rights. </P>
        <P>Following consideration by the UN Human Rights Council, the text of the Optional Protocol was presented to the UN General Assembly, which adopted the text by consensus on 10 December 2008.</P>
        <P>The Optional Protocol opened for signature in New York in September 2009. Ireland was represented at the opening ceremony. So far thirty five (35) States have signed.  Nine of the twenty seven EU member States have signed at this point. Three states have ratified the Optional Protocol: Ecuador, Mongolia and Spain. The Optional Protocol can only come into force three months after the deposit with the UN Secretary-General of the tenth instrument of ratification or accession.</P>
        <P>Inter-departmental consultations have been ongoing since the process of negotiating the Optional Protocol began, with my Department playing a coordination role. Most recently, an inter-departmental meeting was hosted by my Department on 14 December 2010 which discussed the possibility of Ireland signing and ratifying the Optional Protocol. It is expected that further inter-departmental consultations on this matter will take place in 2011.</P>

	<P>Rockall is a small uninhabitable rock, 25 x 30 metres wide, located approximately 160 nautical miles west of the Scottish islands of St. Kilda and 230 nautical miles to the north-west of Donegal.  It marks a point at which the Rockall Bank, part of the very large Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf extending under the north-east Atlantic Ocean, protrudes 21 metres above sea level.  During the 1960s and 1970s the issue of Rockall was a source of legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom claims sovereignty over Rockall and has sought to formally annex it under its 1972 Island of Rockall Act.</P>
        <P>While Ireland has not recognised British sovereignty over Rockall, it has never sought to claim sovereignty for itself.  The consistent position of successive Irish Governments has been that Rockall and similar rocks and skerries have no significance for establishing legal claims to mineral rights in the adjacent seabed and to fishing rights in the surrounding seas.</P>
        <P>During the course of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which took place from 1973 to 1982, Ireland worked hard to achieve agreement on this principle. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was adopted at the conclusion of the Conference on 10 December 1982, provides at Article 121, paragraph 3 that:  &ldquo;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.&rdquo;  Rockall falls into precisely this category.</P>
        <P>In 1988, Ireland and the UK reached agreement on the delimitation of areas of the continental shelf between the two countries, stretching out up to 500 nautical miles from their respective coastlines.  This included the division of the Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf on which Rockall is situated, although under the terms of the Law of the Sea Convention the location of Rockall was irrelevant to the determination of the boundary.  According to that determination, Rockall is situated to the north of the boundary agreed with the UK in 1988 and lies outside the zone claimed by Ireland.</P>
        <P>As with any claim to continental shelf lying beyond 200 nautical miles from shore, the UN Convention requires that Ireland and the UK submit their claims for examination to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.  However, the claims to the Hatton-Rockall shelf agreed between Ireland and the UK are not accepted by Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands), which make their own claims.</P>
        <P>The four countries have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the overlapping claims issue, but to date have been unable to reach agreement.  The 10-year deadline for the making of submissions to the UN Commission expired for Ireland in May 2009.  The Government therefore submitted the national claim for this area at the end of March 2009.  The deadline for the Faroe Islands is 2014 (because Denmark, which is responsible for the foreign relations of the Faroe Islands, only became a party to the Convention on the Law of the Sea in 2004) and the authorities in the Faroes had kept us informed of their intention to make their submission this year.  That submission was lodged with the Commission in New York on 2 December last and is currently being studied by officials in my own Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s rules of procedure prevent consideration by the Commission of a submission relating to a disputed area without the consent of all the states concerned.  Accordingly the purpose of making submissions in accordance with the deadline, as Ireland, the UK and the Faroes have all now done, is to stop the clock on the deadline and preserve each country&rsquo;s legal position.  The question of amending Ireland&rsquo;s submission does not arise at this stage.  Instead the four states will continue to meet at regular intervals and the Government continues <Col N="369"/>to work for the creation of conditions that will permit consideration of Ireland&rsquo;s submission by the Commission as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The State&rsquo;s continental shelf has already been successfully extended beyond 200 nautical miles in the area to the west of the Porcupine Bank where, following consideration by the UN Commission, 39,000 square kilometres of additional seabed has recently been designated under the 1968 Continental Shelf Act.  Together with France, Spain and the UK, we have also made a successful submission to the Commission in relation to a large area of seabed in the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay and the four countries have recently begun discussions on the division of this area.</P>

	<P>My Department has a Legal Division, staffed by qualified legal professionals who provide legal advice on a wide range of international legal issues.  Having such &lsquo;in-house&rsquo; legal experts reduces the costs which would be incurred if the Department was to engage externally for similar services.  The majority of other instances where legal advice and services have been required by my Department in the State during the period in question have been handled either by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office or the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office, or have related to cases processed by the State Claims Agency.  As the Deputy will be aware, Government Departments do not directly pay for the legal services provided by the Office of the Attorney General and or the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office or for advice from Counsel briefed by them. </P>
        <P>Nevertheless, there are from time to time occasions where a need to engage external legal services in the State arises, where the necessary specialised expertise is not available within my Department and cannot be accessed from the AGO or the CSSO.  In the period in question this occurred on three occasions, the details of which are included in the table below.</P>

The administration of the three advisory committees are serviced directly by my Department, and no legal advice or services have been engaged relating to the operation of these bodies.</P>

        <Quest> the arrangements in place to facilitate the registration of civil partnerships as per recent legislation passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and signed into law; when the registration of civil partnership will commence in Dublin and Cork; if adequate staff have been put in place; if the relevant systems have been adapted at the relevant offices to allow for the registration of civil partnerships as per the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The provisions of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 were commenced with effect from 1 January, 2011.  This includes the provisions concerning the registration of civil partnerships.  All of the arrangements necessary to allow a couple to begin the process leading to the registration of a civil partnership are in place.  This process begins with the giving to a registrar of notification of intention to enter a civil partnership at least three months before the date of the registration of the civil partnership.</P>
        <P>To date, eighteen notifications of intention to enter a civil partnership have been given and a further 63 appointments with registrars for giving notification have been scheduled covering all registration areas including Dublin and Cork.  In order to give notification it is necessary to make an appointment with a registrar.  The registration staff who deal with notifications for marriage will also deal with notifications for civil partnership.  While applicants may experience a delay in obtaining an appointment at some offices, it is thought that this is of a temporary nature due to a combination of pent-up demand for civil partnership registration and the seasonality of higher demand for notification in respect of marriages at this time of year.  Having regard to this and the fact that appointments for giving of notification can be sought at any registrar&rsquo;s office, it is considered that, overall, existing staff resources should be sufficient to meet on-going demand.</P>
        <P>The civil registration computer system to facilitate civil partnership registration is being developed and it is anticipated that this will be deployed at registration offices later this month. Pending its deployment manual systems are being used.  The computer system will be deployed well in advance of the first civil partnership registration which is not due to take place until early April, 2011.  In the meantime manual procedures can adequately accommodate the volume of activity.  Details relating to civil partnership registration including an information booklet on the matter are available on website; www.groireland.ie</P>

I wish to advise the Deputy that there is no record of a valid redundancy claim on the Redundancy Payments System in respect of the individual in question.  It is normal practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.  Forms are returned in order for missing details and/or supporting documentation to be submitted.  Submission of correctly completed redundancy claim forms (RP50&rsquo;s) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims. </P>

	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  The current legislation for this is set out in section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, as amended.  A person who does not satisfy the habitual residence condition is not eligible for specified social welfare payments, regardless of citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor.  The purpose of this condition is to safeguard the social welfare system from abuse by restricting access for people who are not economically active and who have little or no established connection with Ireland.  It is not my intention to fundamentally change this requirement.  However, I am on an ongoing basis reviewing the condition to ensure that it operates in a user friendly and fair manner.  Any change to the legislation would have to be considered carefully to ensure it did not give rise to unintended consequences.</P>

	<P>It is understood that this question relates to the treatment of cohabiting couples in the social welfare and tax systems.  These systems have evolved over time and in response to a variety of factors, including constitutional imperatives as interpreted by the courts, changing social trends and EU Directives.  The social welfare code recognises the couple status of co-habiting couples and treats married and co-habiting couples in a similar manner.  The EEC Equality Directive 79/9 and the subsequent Supreme Court case (Hyland <i>v</i>. Minister for Social Welfare, 1989) led to the change in the treatment of non-married cohabiting couples in the social welfare code.  The court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.  The <Col N="374"/>income tax arrangements and subsequent legislation for cohabiting couples are matters for the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Finance announced a community work placement initiative for up to 5,000 persons in his Budget statements to the D&aacute;il on the 7th December 2010.  This initiative, to be known as T&uacute;s, was launched by me on the 21st December 2010.  The aims of T&uacute;s are to provide short-term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  T&uacute;s will be delivered at local level by each of the Local Development Companies and by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  </P>
        <P>Work has already begun on the roll-out of T&uacute;s in Westmeath and in the Northside Partnership area in Dublin.  To participate, potential candidates have until the 24th January to respond to a request issued by my Department and I expect the first placements to be offered to candidates in February.  Implementation will follow in other areas as other Local Development <Col N="379"/>Companies conclude arrangements with my Department.  I do not accept that there has been any delay in rolling out the programme and I will be working to ensure this is done as expeditiously as possible.</P>

	<P>The qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory) require the applicant to have entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 56 years; have at least 260 paid contribution weeks, from employment or self-employment, since entry into insurance; satisfy the yearly average condition.</P>
        <P>The person concerned satisfies the above conditions and has a total of 478 reckonable (paid and credited) PRSI contributions.  When this total is divided by 50 (the number of years from date of entry into insurance to the end of the last tax year prior to reaching age 66), this gives a yearly average of 10 contributions, and entitles him to a reduced State pension (contributory) of &euro;115.20 per week (50% of the maximum rate).  In order to qualify for a maximum rate pension, a yearly average of 48 or more would be required.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive has advised that there is no record of a claim under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme for the person in question.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s records show that a claim for disability allowance (DA) from the person concerned was disallowed in December 2009 by a Deciding Officer who deemed that his weekly means were higher than the statutory limit for DA.   The means assessed were derived from the insurable employment of the spouse of the person concerned. Under Social Welfare legislation, mortgage repayments and utility bills are not deductable when calculating means.</P>
        <P>A letter issued to the person concerned in December 2009 advising him of this decision and of his right of appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals office. The person concerned subsequently appealed this decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office who upheld the decision to refuse DA. The person concerned was notified of this decision in writing in May 2010.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that one of the persons in question was awarded rent supplement as a single person from 22 October 2010 to 31 December 2010. The temporary nature of this award reflected the fact that the amount of the rent claimed was in excess of the maximum rent limit for a single person. If the household circumstances have changed, it remains open for both persons concerned to make a new application for rent supplement.</P>

	<P>The purpose of mortgage interest supplement is to provide short term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. </P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that following a review of the claim in July 2010, the rate of mortgage interest supplement was reduced from &euro;489.60 to &euro;32 per calendar month reflecting the reduction in the interest repayments on the loan.</P>
        <P>The HSE has further advised that this amount is the full and correct amount payable based on his circumstances.</P>

	<P>In the case in question an application for Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) was received on the 20th October 2009.  This application was referred to one of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors who found that the child was not medically eligible for DCA.  A letter issued to the person concerned on the 25th November 2009 advising her of the decision to refuse DCA. She subsequently lodged an appeal against this decision.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office informed her on the 7th December 2010 that the appeal had been disallowed.</P>
        <P>The decision/appeal process for this application is now complete.  All the information available at that time was provided to the appeals officer before the appeal was considered.  However, if the person concerned has additional information which was not made available to the deciding officer and appeals officer when they made their decision, it is open to her to re-apply.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case.  The person concerned will be informed when arrangements have been made.  In order to be fair to all appellants, oral hearings are arranged in strict chronological order. There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There was an increase of a further 25% in the number of appeals received in 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals.</P><Col N="389"/>
        <P>A number of initiatives have been put in place to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />3 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A number of additional staff were assigned to the administration area of the Office,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The organisation of the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s work has been changed so as to increase productivity,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A  project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented, and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Significant enhancements have been made to the office&rsquo;s IT and phone systems.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, it was decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and the services of eight retired officers have now been secured on a part-time basis and have been operating since July 2010. I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice. The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

	<P>In 2011, self-employed workers will be liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% &mdash; the same personal rate as is paid by ordinary employees. However, employers also make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  As a result, ordinary employees can build entitlement towards the full range of social welfare benefits. Class S contributions will continue to provide cover for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s/widower&rsquo;s pension (contributory) only.  </P>
        <P>PRSI coverage is related to the risks associated with employment or self-employment, the annualised system of contributions for self-employed people and the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payment for self-employed people. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</P>
        <P>The 2005 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that the fund favours the self-employed over the employed when both employer and employee contributions are included in respect of the employed person. The analysis demonstrates that, despite the fact that they are eligible for a narrower range of benefits, self-employed persons can gain substantially more from the fund than employees.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.</P>
        <P>In terms of current supports available to self-employed persons it may be noted that, in certain cases, a self-employed person who had insurable employment in the relevant year, <Col N="391"/>currently 2008, and had paid sufficient Class A contributions may qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment, provided all the conditions of the scheme are satisfied.</P>
        <P>A self-employed person who has paid insufficient Class A contributions may instead qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is a means-tested payment and in assessing a person&rsquo;s means for the purposes of this allowance, account is taken of all income which the person may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year. In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year. In the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy and it is accepted that future earnings may be lower than those of previous years. The process also recognises the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.</P>
        <P>Self-employed people who are on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for twelve months or more will be eligible for the new T&uacute;s initiative of community work placement, which will pay the full rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance plus an extra &euro;20.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The social welfare system is based on two quite different types of entitlement &mdash; a social insurance system for people who have paid sufficient PRSI contributions and a social assistance system for people without adequate contributions who have little or no household means of their own.  </P>

        <P>Social insurance is intended both to enable people to insure themselves against adverse life events such as illness or unemployment and to provide for their state pensions and other benefits, through contributions to the social insurance fund. Social insurance benefits are not means-tested. Instead, entitlement depends on having paid the required number of PRSI contributions relevant to the particular benefit being claimed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prior to the introduction of changes provided for in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008, there was no limit on the amount of time for which illness benefit could be paid to people who had more than 260 social insurance contributions as long as they were medically certified as being unfit for work.  An OECD review entitled &ldquo;Sickness, Disability and Work: Breaking the Barriers&rdquo; noted that paying illness or sickness benefit without a time <Col N="392"/>limitation was very unusual across the OECD, and pointed to the risk that people in such circumstances will never return to the labour market.</P>
        <P>Against that background, the 2008 Act provided that entitlement to illness benefit is now limited to two years (or 624 days) duration for claims arising after the 5th January, 2009.</P>
        <P>Also provided for in this Act was the reduction in the duration of the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment. Firstly, the duration of the benefit payable to people with 260 or more paid social insurance contributions was reduced from 15 to 12 months, for (then) current claimants with less than six months duration on the scheme, as well as all new claimants. Similarly, where the claimant had less than 260 contributions the maximum duration of benefit was reduced from 12 to 9 months for people in receipt for less than three months, as well as all new claimants.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005, provides that there are two categories of persons who are compulsorily insured &mdash; employed contributors and self-employed contributors.</P>
        <P>An employed contributor is broadly defined as every person over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age (i.e. 66 years) who is in insurable employment. Insurable employment means employment in the State under any contract of service or apprenticeship, written or oral, whether expressed or implied.</P>
        <P>An earner will be an employed contributor where a contract of service exists. A contract of service is an agreement between two named parties that defines the rights and obligations of both parties, is legally binding and benefits each party. A contract may be written, oral, expressed or implied. It may be casual, temporary, part-time or of short duration and still be a contract of service. This is generally understood as a master/servant relationship where the worker is subject to direction, control and dismissal. If no such relationship exists between an employer and an employee, the latter will be insurable as a self-employed contributor.</P>
        <P>A self-employed contributor is a person over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age who has reckonable income or reckonable emoluments. A self-employed contributor liable for social insurance contributions is covered for benefits under Class S of the PRSI system.</P>
        <P>Office holders are not, by definition, bound by the arrangements of a contract of service as they are not employees. Furthermore, social insurance legislation provides that the income derived from an office-holding is not liable to a Class S social insurance contribution.</P>
        <P>However, in accordance with the solidarity principle of the Social Insurance Fund it has now been decided by Government that office holders should contribute to the social insurance system.</P>
        <P>The PRSI charge to public office holders will not generate any subsequent benefit entitlement.</P>

As part of a customer consultation framework the Department seeks participation from customers to assist in developing policies and service delivery mechanisms.   This is supported through customer panels, as well as meetings with customer representative groups and those engaged in welfare information services.  </P>
        <P>The customer panel focus group meetings are informal meetings between officers of the Department and randomly selected customers.  Presentations are given on changes to schemes and services and this is followed by an open questions and answer session, where the views and opinions of customers are sought.</P>
        <P>Customer representative group meetings are held regularly and provide a forum for engagement with stakeholders of the Department who represent a broad range of customers such as older people, unemployed, carers and disability groups etc.  The format is similar to the customer panel meetings and provides an opportunity to seek the views of these groups on how we can improve service delivery.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case. The person concerned will be informed when arrangements have been made. In order to be fair to all appellants, oral hearings are arranged in strict chronological order. There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There was an increase of a further 25% in the number of appeals received in 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives have been put in place to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows. I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice. The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

	<P>The information which formed the basis of the means assessment for fuel allowance in this case was taken from the claimant&rsquo;s income from employment for 2009. As the Department has no evidence of cessation of the claimant&rsquo;s employment, and he did not indicate cessation of his employment in his claim form, income for 2010 was taken to be the same as that for 2009. If the person concerned has ceased employment, he should provide a copy of his P45 at his earliest convenience.

	<P>The primary objective of the Department&rsquo;s information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of the wide range of schemes and services available and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur. </P>
        <P>The Department operates a network of some 130 Local and Branch Offices throughout the country.  Each Local Office has officers who are dedicated to providing information and are available to explain supports and services to people.  This locally-based service is supported by a central Information Unit which operates a LoCall information line (1890 66 22 44) which customers may call for information and guidance on their entitlements.   The Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets, including a booklet on bereavement and these are available widely in Social Welfare Offices, Citizens Information Centres and Post Offices.  Leaflets can also be requested through the Department&rsquo;s website www.welfare.ie   which contains full information on all schemes and services, including bereavement and widow&rsquo;s/widower&rsquo;s pensions.</P>
        <P>The Citizens Information Board, which comes under the aegis of the Department, is the national information agency with responsibility for supporting the provision of independent information and advice on the broad range of social services including social welfare services.  Information is provided through Citizen Information Centres and other offices throughout the country, and through the Citizens Information Phone Service (1890 777 121) which operates from 9am to 9pm Monday to Friday.  The website www.citizensinformation.ie    has a section on bereavement which includes information on social welfare entitlements.</P>
        <P>In addition, when a death is registered with the General Register Office (GRO) the Department&rsquo;s customer data is automatically updated.  For state pension transition/contributory customers, a surviving qualified adult will automatically receive the 6 weeks after death payment of the married rate along with the bereavement grant.  Each case will also be reviewed to examine the possible pension entitlement of the surviving spouse/civil partner, or as in many cases a widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension will automatically be awarded from the 7th week.</P>
        <P>When the qualified adult of a contributory pensioner dies, the pensioner receives 6 weeks after death payment of the married rate and the bereavement grant automatically.  On the death of a state pension transition/contributory recipient getting a payment at a single rate, but <Col N="397"/>whose spouse is in receipt of another social welfare payment, payment of 6 weeks payment after death and the Bereavement Grant are paid automatically.</P>
        <P>The Department has ongoing contact with the Irish Association of Funeral Directors and also deals with individual funeral directors in ensuring the details of the provisions of the Bereavement Grant scheme are made as widely available as possible.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that information is widely available to assist and enable those bereaved to access their social welfare entitlements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The social insurance system is one which delivers benefits to those who contribute, similar to any insurance-type system. A State pension is a very valuable asset and we must ensure that those who benefit from it have made a sustained and adequate contribution over the course of their working life.</P><Col N="398"/>
        <P>The Final Report of the National Pensions Board, published in 1993, recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 contributions.  The necessary legislation to effect the recommendations of the National Pensions Board was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 (now incorporated in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005)<b> </b>which provided for the implementation of the change in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002, rising to 520 from 2012.  Details of the proposed increase in the paid contributions required have been included in the Department&rsquo;s standard information material on pensions for some years.</P>
        <P>The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  In particular, the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population. There are currently six workers for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050.  Increasing State pension age is one of the ways in which we can sustain the pensions system and also maintain the value of the State Pension at 35% of average earnings. People are living longer and healthier lives with average life expectancy set to rise even further in the future, up to 89 years for women and 83 for men. People will still, therefore, be spending at least the same amount of time in retirement as they are today, even with a later State pension age.</P>
        <P>Therefore, as announced as part of the National Pensions Framework, the State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the removal of the State pension (transition), thereby standardising State pension age at 66.  This means that the last group of people to receive the State pension (transition) will be those who reach 65 years of age in 2013.  State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</P>
        <P>The details and timeframes for these changes are set out in the National Pensions Framework, which was published on 3 March 2010.  The Government&rsquo;s plan for future pension reform in Ireland encompasses all aspects of pensions, from social welfare to private occupational pensions and public sector pension reform.   The aim of the Framework is to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State.  It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and to ensure that state support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.  An implementation group chaired by my Department has been established to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the necessary reforms into operation.</P>
        <P>The person concerned will reach age 65 in May 2014 by which time State pension (transition) will have been abolished; he will, however, be entitled to apply for another social welfare payment.  Based on his current record, he will be entitled to a mixed insurance pro-rata pension (contributory) in 2015 when he reaches age 66.  The approximate rate of this pension payment (at current rates) is &euro;77.16 per week.  If he were to acquire an additional 87 full-rate paid contributions between now and the end of 2014, this would bring the total number of full-rate paid contributions to 520.  This would then entitle him to be examined for a standard State pension (contributory), as opposed to a mixed insurance pro-rata pension (contributory) which is sufficient for a 75% State pension (contributory), currently payable at the weekly rate of &euro;172.70.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 12 August 2010. It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  These papers were received back in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 27 October 2010 and the appeal has been referred to an Appeals Officer who will decide whether the case can be decided on a summary basis or whether to list it for oral hearing.

	<P>It should be noted that the system for recording travel costs does not readily distinguish travel between Dublin and Killarney.  However, in line with the relevant circulars from the Department of Finance, it is policy in my Department, that when travelling between the offices in Dublin and Killarney, officials must avail of public transport, where appropriate.  The travel policy also states that officers who use personal transportation for travel between the offices in Dublin and Killarney may only claim the price of the relevant train fare in those instances.   For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the cost of all domestic mileage and public transport in my Department, including the National Archives, for 2009 and the provisional outturn figures for 2010 area as follows: </P>

        <Quest> the operation of the emergency call service if there is an official policy which sets out the circumstances in which the fire service is to be called out to all emergency calls when medical assistance is required in view of the fact that fire service personnel are trained as emergency first aid responders. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Arrangements for the receipt of and response to emergency calls when medical assistance is required are matters in the first instance for the HSE/ Department of Health and Children. Emergency calls from the public are made through the 999/112 system, and are passed to the relevant health service provider by the 999 system operator in accordance with agreed procedures. </P><Col N="414"/>
        <P>Local authorities have a region-based service delivery model for their statutory duty under Section 10 (3) of the Fire Services Act, 1981 and 2003 for the receipt of and response to emergency calls for fire service assistance. Regional Communication Centres in Castlebar, Limerick and Dublin are operated by the three relevant local authorities, which liaise with the 999 system operator, and use a system of agreed &ldquo;pre-determined attendances&rdquo; or responses to mobilise fire service resources to certain categories of incidents/ emergency calls.</P>
        <P>On the issue of fire service personnel being trained to the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council&rsquo;s (PHECC) first responder standard, it is correct that significant numbers of personnel in fire authorities outside Dublin (where Dublin Fire Brigade provides an ambulance service for the HSE) have been so trained over the past decade. This has enabled them to provide immediate assistance to casualties whom they encounter in the course of their normal fire service response activities &mdash; such persons may routinely include victims of smoke inhalation and burns, and those injured in road traffic accidents or other incidents. The development in fire services of a strongly collaborative, casualty-focused approach in Road Traffic Accident extrication techniques has been greatly influenced by this training.  The first responder training also enables fire authorities to meet rigorous statutory obligations under safety, health &amp; welfare legislation.</P>
        <P>It is not currently policy to have fire service personnel deployed to undertake the statutory functions of other agencies, other than as noted in relation to Dublin above, and the first responder training provided is not intended to extend the fire service into an emergency service which would respond where medical assistance is required.</P>
        <P>My Department maintains routine contact with other relevant Departments, and there has been very significant collaboration with the Departments of Health and Children, Justice and Law Reform and Defence on major emergency management issues in recent years. The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management, which I established within my Department in June 2009 to develop national policy and drive consistent achievement of value-for-money fire services by local authorities, will be engaging in a series of bilateral discussions with other emergency services on issues of further collaboration where potentially beneficial arrangements in relation to emergency service provision for the public may be identified.</P>

	<P>In July of 2010 I approved river basin management plans for Ireland&rsquo;s seven river basin districts.  The plans set out the current status of our waters, the environmental objectives to be achieved and the programmes of measures to be implemented in order to achieve those objectives.  </P>
        <P>The programmes of measures outlined in the river basin management plans cover the sectors and activities which impact on the status of our waters, including municipal waste water discharges and agriculture.  Responsibility for implementing the measures rests with the local authorities, various Government Departments and Agencies, and other sectors such as agriculture and industry.   In so far as my Department is concerned, continued investment in the development of water services through the Water Services Investment Programme remains a priority.  The Programme for 2010 to 2012 is, for the first time, set out on a river basin basis and is fully aligned with the investment priorities identified in the river basin management plans. Exchequer funding for water services in 2011 amounts to &euro;435 million.  New work in 2011 will be targeted, <i>inter alia</i>  , on key projects in the programme required to implement measures identified in the river basin management plans such as the upgrading of wastewater treatment infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The local authorities play a key role in coordinating effort in pursuit of the plans&rsquo; objectives and I have provided funding of &euro;687,000 for the continued support of the river basin district offices this year.</P><Col N="416"/>
        <P>My Department has, since 2007, provided significant additional funding to the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out the extensive monitoring programmes required for implementation of the Water Framework Directive and which will be an ongoing requirement for implementation of the river basin management plans.  In 2010 this funding amounted to &euro;4 million, a decision on funding for 2011 will be made shortly.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will continue to fund the Agricultural Catchments Programme costing &euro;8 million over the four years 2008 to 2011.</P>

	<P>The developed country Parties who associated with the Copenhagen Accord (including the EU and all Member States) agreed to provide a fast-start finance package for developing countries over the three years 2010 to 2012.  As part of the EU response, Ireland committed to a contribution of up to &euro;100 million over the three-year period.</P>
        <P>In response to that commitment, a contribution of &euro;23 million has been made to the Global Climate Change Alliance established and operated by the European Commission. The contribution was the subject of a supplementary estimate debated at the Select Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 9 December 2010.  This contribution, together with climate change related funding within the Overseas Development Assistance programme, will make up a substantial part of the overall commitment.</P>

	<P>Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution.  The services of the Money Advice and Budgetary Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme. In addition, I issued comprehensive guidance last year based on the Regulators Code of Practice, to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.</P>
        <P>In addition Section 34 of Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides Local Authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers. Repossession, where it does occur, is always a last resort.</P>

	<P>Half-yearly and quarter-yearly rates of motor tax are set in law at a higher rate than the annual fee to take account of the extra workload for motor tax offices and the resultant higher administrative and printing costs.  A quarterly renewal of a motor tax disc is equivalent to processing four annual discs in that the same administrative procedures have to be followed each time.  In addition, reminders are issued on each renewal.  The additional work created by the quarterly and half-yearly disc system is thus considerable and the higher rates reflect the additional costs arising.</P>
        <P>It should be noted, however, that at present the quarterly and half-yearly charges are lower than those permissible under law.  The Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952 provides that the rate of duty for a quarterly licence must not exceed 30% of the full annual duty applicable and sets no upper limit for a half-yearly disc.  The rates of duty currently applicable to quarterly and half-yearly discs are 28.25% and 55.5% of the annual rate respectively.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The development and operation of a landfill is subject to the requirement to obtain a waste licence from the Environmental Protection Agency and planning permission from the local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The number and location of landfill sites which have a waste licence are available on the web site of the EPA at www.epa.ie.  The operational requirements of landfills are detailed in waste licences issued by the EPA in respect of individual facilities. The monitoring of compliance with the conditions of waste licences is solely a matter for the EPA, and section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996 precludes the Minister from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance, in particular circumstances, by a local authority or the EPA of a function conferred on it.</P>
        <P>It is therefore a matter for the EPA to ensure compliance with waste licences issued, and to decide on the appropriate enforcement action in relation to any non-compliance matters.  The Focus on Environmental Enforcement in Ireland   report for the years 2006-2008, which is also available on the EPA web site, summarises the Agency&rsquo;s waste enforcement actions for that period.  I am satisfied that the powers available to the Agency are sufficient for it to perform its enforcement role effectively.</P>

	<P>My Department does not hold information on the number of households on a local authority&rsquo;s waiting list.  This figure continuously fluctuates as households on the list are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support.   A statutory assessment of housing need is carried out every three years by all housing authorities.  The last assessment took place in 2008 and indicated that there were 56,249 households in need of social housing support.  This assessment also provides information on the waiting period for households seeking social housing support.  Detailed information on this assessment, including a breakdown by housing authority, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website &mdash; www.environ.ie.  </P>

        <P>Turf-cutting for domestic purposes was allowed to continue for a period of ten years following notification of the then Minister&rsquo;s intention to designate these sites.  Survey work over the last ten years has revealed that ongoing domestic turf-cutting and associated drainage on raised bog sites is continuing to damage the bogs and their protected habitats. This ten-year period has now expired for 31 raised bog Special Areas of Conservation (SAC). It will expire for the remaining 24 raised bog SACs at the end of this year and for 75 raised bog Natural Heritage Areas at the end of 2013.  Turf-cutting cannot proceed beyond the ten-year period on these sites without my explicit consent.  These restrictions will apply regardless of who owns the bogs or has turbary rights relating to them,</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 778 and 779 together.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The recent severe weather has again highlighted the need to sustain our efforts to rehabilitate older water mains, many of which were damaged during the cold spell.  Water mains rehabilitation is an integral part of local authority water conservation strategies, whereby water distribution pipelines are relined or replaced, and is a key priority under my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P><Col N="425"/>
        <P>As part of the development of the Programme, local authorities carried out assessments of needs in 2009, at my Department&rsquo;s request, to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works, including mains rehabilitation works, in their areas.  In their needs assessments, local authorities identified mains rehabilitation works with a value of some &euro;320 million which are included as contracts due to commence over the period of the Programme.  Funding is particularly targeted at areas where the level of unaccounted for water is unacceptably high.  Over time, this investment should lead to marked reductions in unaccounted for water and progress will continue to be monitored on an annual basis through the local authority service indicator process.</P>
        <P>My Department has already allocated over &euro;14 million to local authorities in December 2010 in supplementary funding to assist them in meeting the exceptional and unexpected costs associated with the recent bout of severe winter weather.  These costs included such items as road clearance, gritting, salting, overtime and the provision of water. The funding was allocated on the basis of submissions received and was paid to local authorities on 21 December.  I have committed to making further funding available to local authorities specifically for the costs incurred in addressing water services difficulties  following the thaw at the end of December.  Allocations will be made to relevant authorities following a full assessment in the coming weeks of the costs involved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 785, 789 and 792 together.  </P>
        <P>In January 2007, my predecessor as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government placed a Preservation Order on nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street under the National Monuments Acts.  The Preservation Order was made on the grounds that the buildings, which are privately owned, are a monument, the preservation of which is of national importance by reason of its historical importance as the final headquarters of the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising.  My role as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is to protect the monument, under that Order, from any danger of being destroyed, injured or removed. In that regard any works affecting the monument require my prior consent under the National Monuments Acts.</P>
        <P>I understand that the building where recent works took place to remove the upper storey on safety grounds is located at the corner of Henry Place and Moore Lane.  The building is outside the area encompassed by the Preservation Order on nos. 14 to 17 Moore St. and there was, accordingly, no requirement for Ministerial consent to be obtained for the works.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has granted planning permission for development on the site that includes the Moore St. monument.  This permission does not supersede the Preservation Order already in place and my consent will still be required for any development works that may affect the buildings covered by the Preservation Order.  I fully appreciate the historical significance of these buildings as the site of the last military actions of the 1916 Rising leaders and the appropriateness of any proposed works will be carefully examined against that historical background if a works related consent application is submitted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is currently reviewing the Retail Planning Guidelines which were originally published in 2001 and updated in 2005.  Among the principles guiding the review are the following: </P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />competition to the benefit of the consumer should be maintained and enhanced in accordance with proper planning and sustainable development;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />existing retail development-type definitions and relevant floor space limits should be assessed to determine whether they remain appropriate or whether they need to be amended;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />preferred locations for retail development should continue to be guided by considerations of sustainable land use, including access by public transport;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />in particular, new retail development should be encouraged to contribute to the vitality and vibrancy of town and village centres, to ensure that they retain retailing as a core function; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />realistic, regionally consistent and forward-looking strategies for plan-led retail development should be devised which can give clear guidance to planning authorities, developers and shop owners in formulating development or expansion proposals.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">An Issues Paper, which set out high-level and strategic issues for retail planning, was published by my Department in June 2010 to provide an opportunity for stakeholders and interested parties to assist in identifying key issues to be considered in the context of preparing and drafting revised guidelines.  Almost 200 submissions were received through this consultation process and the issues raised in these submissions are currently being examined in drafting the updated guidelines.</P>
        <P>It is intended that revised draft guidelines will be published for public consultation in the early months of 2011, thus affording stakeholders and interested parties a further opportunity to input into the policy formulation process before the statutory guidelines are finalised later this year.  In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality   between Ireland and the EU/IMF, the review is also addressing the issue of the cap on retail floor space contained in the current guidelines.</P>

	<P>Regulations and guidelines for housing authorities in relation to differential rent are currently in preparation in my Department.  Once section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which provides for rent schemes and charges, has been commenced, housing authorities will have one year in which to put in place a new differential rent scheme.  It is expected that the regulations will be in place by the end of the first quarter of this year.  While it is not the intention to implement a national standardised differential rent scheme, the regulations to be made will more clearly set out the parameters within which local rents schemes may operate.</P>

	<P>There is no provision in law for motor tax to be paid by direct debit instalments.  An instalment system would be unwieldy and potentially costly in administrative terms.  As well as the additional resource costs in monitoring payments and pursuing missed instalments, such a system could introduce an element of uncertainty in relation to the point at which liability for motor tax is discharged.  I have no plans to introduce a direct debit facility for the payment of motor tax.</P>

	<P>Each planning authority is required to include, in its statutory annual accounts, details of contributions received and information on how the contributions have been spent.  Information on the amount of development contributions on hand for each local authority at end of year 2010 is not yet available.

        <P>The total amount of development contributions on hand for each Local Authority to the end of 2008 is listed in Table 1. Table 2 lists the annual development contribution income for each local authority for 2006-2008.</P><Col N="430"/>
        <P>Under the Planning Acts, the role of the Minister is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority. The adoption of individual development contribution schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.

        <Quest> the appointments he has made to State boards and State agencies under the remit of his Department since June 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of different statutory processes are involved in appointments to State boards. In some cases statutory selection procedures must be followed or nominations must be sought from independent nominating panels before appointments are made by the Government or by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In other cases only particular public office holders may be appointed to certain boards.  In a number of situations, only some appointments to the body concerned are made by the Minister, or appointments are made with the consent of the Minister for Finance or following consultation with the Minister for Finance or Minister for Education and Skills, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>In the context of the above, the following table sets out relevant information in respect of all persons appointed by me to the state boards under the aegis of my Department since June 2007.  Some may have retired from these positions in the interim.  The boards of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Environmental Protection Agency are executive in nature and the members are full-time salaried positions.</P>
        <P>Housing and Sustainable Communities Ltd (HSC) was formed as a Private Single Member company subsidiary of the National Building Agency (NBA). It undertakes functions in relation to management of land arising as a result of the land aggregation scheme and leasing. The Board of &ldquo;Housing and Sustainable Communities Ltd&rdquo; will be paid a fee as part of their directorship of the NBA from 1 January 2011 (the board is the same for the NBA and members will be paid one fee).</P>
        <P>The NBA is due to be wound down over the period of 2011 and a decision was taken to appoint a smaller streamlined Board to oversee this process with effect from 1 January 2011. This Board is also charged with overseeing the formal establishment of the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency (HSCA).  The functions of the Fire Services Council are being undertaken by the Department since the term of office of its members expired on 30 June 2009. It is not intended to reappoint a Council.</P>

        <Quest> the number of Arts officers working in local authorities that are on contracts; the number, if any that will be up for renewal in the next four years; the effect of the recruitment moratorium on the renewal of these positions; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible, in compliance with the relevant public sector recruitment and employment law requirements.</P>
        <P>While my Department gathers data on the numbers employed in each local authority on a quarterly basis, for practical reasons, it does not routinely gather data on the numbers employed in every post within an Authority. However, a comprehensive survey of local authority staff numbers was carried out in May 2010 at which point there were 27.7 whole time equivalent staff employed as Arts Officers in the Sector. The information requested regarding individual contracts of employment is not available in my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department has a delegated sanction, from the Department of Finance, effective from August 2009, for implementation of the general moratorium on the filling of public sector posts across all local authorities. This is on condition that the overall staffing levels in the sector are reduced significantly in adherence with the Government&rsquo;s Policy on Staffing and Numbers in the Public Sector.  Under the terms of the moratorium, a local authority requires prior approval from my Department for the filling of any vacancy, as an exception to the moratorium. My Department assesses such requests on a case by case basis. Since August 2009 three requests for Arts Officer posts were received, two were approved on the basis of a fixed term contract and one was approved on a permanent basis.</P>

	<P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 259 of 14 December 2010 I intend to revert to Government shortly regarding the arrangements for those who have been affected by the requirement to cease turf cutting on protected raised bogs.  The provision of compensation will be considered in that context, within the overall financial resources available to my Department.</P>

        <Quest> if the adjusted tenant purchase scheme, which provides a 45% discount, has commenced and if a directive has been issued to local authorities; if he will indicate the duration that this scheme will remain in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment; Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>As part of Budget 2011, a new tenant purchase scheme will be introduced to allow local authority tenants to avail of a discount of up to 45% on the market <Col N="443"/>price of a house they are eligible to purchase under the scheme. Under the current scheme a maximum 30% discount is accumulated over a 10 year period at a rate of 3% for each year of the tenancy. The new scheme will allow tenants to accumulate up to a maximum of 45% discount over a 15 year period.  Applications under the new scheme will be accepted up until the end of 2011.</P>
        <P>The necessary statutory provisions are currently in preparation and I expect to make an announcement on the arrangements for the new scheme in the near future.  The current tenant purchase scheme remains in place and will, as previously announced, be replaced by a new scheme based on the incremental purchase model in 2012.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the timeline on the introduction of broadband to the Ballyporeen area of south Tipperary; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter in the first instance for private sector service providers operating in a liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Broadband services are provided by <Col N="449"/>private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite. ComReg&rsquo;s website www.callcosts.ie   provides detailed information on the various private sector telecommunications products and services available on a county by county basis, including County Tipperary.</P>
        <P>In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.  Since the completion of the roll out of the National Broadband Scheme in October 2010, there is at least one service provider offering a broadband service in all areas of Ireland.  Attention is now being focussed on isolated cases where broadband is not being delivered due to technical or line of sight reasons.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I will formally announce the launch of a Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS), shortly.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  Ballyporeen, County Tipperary, is not covered by the NBS and therefore any un-served premises in that locality will be eligible to apply under the scheme.</P>
        <P>There will be a competitive process to engage a service provider who will offer a broadband service to qualified applicants under the scheme.  While the exact details have yet to be finalised, I expect that the service offered under this scheme would at least match the service offered under the NBS and that the scheme will be fully rolled out by the end of 2012.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied therefore that between the services being provided by the commercial operators, the service now available through the NBS and the forthcoming RBS which will target individual un-served premises, Ireland will very shortly be fully served from a broadband perspective.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 806 and 807 together.</P>
        <P>The Single Electricity Market does not impose a requirement on wind generators to have power purchase agreements with suppliers. A majority of wind generators would however have entered power purchase agreements because they have voluntarily chosen to participate in the AER or REFIT schemes. Having a power purchase agreement with a supplier is a condition of those schemes.</P>
        <P>A small number of wind generators would not be participating in these schemes either because they have chosen not to do so, or have already availed of the schemes for the duration of their contracts which have now ended. Some wind generators have chosen of their own volition to leave the schemes and participate directly in the Single Electricity Market.</P><Col N="450"/>
        <P>The AER scheme is no longer open for new applications. The REFIT scheme, which guarantees a minimum price for certain classes of renewable electricity generation, is designed to underpin the business case for investors in the renewable generation sector.</P>
        <P>A key component of the scheme is the requirement for Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) between renewable energy generators and suppliers.  The PPAs create certainty for generators and incentivise suppliers to purchase renewable electricity.</P>
        <P>Payments, including the 15% balancing payment, are made to the suppliers who enter commercially negotiated Power Purchase Agreements with generators of renewable electricity.  Under a PPA, the supplier undertakes to purchase all the output from a renewable energy generator at contract prices which are fixed between the generator and the supplier at the commencement of each individual contract for 15 years, irrespective of the open market pool price.</P>
        <P>The supplier also assumes the market interaction role between the individual generator and the pool market and incurs additional costs in respect of this which are also reflected in the balancing payment.</P>
        <P>In designing the REFIT scheme, my Department concluded that in order to ensure suppliers&rsquo; critical participation in developing renewable generation capacity in the liberalised electricity market, a proportionate balancing payment mechanism was necessary.  There has been a steady increase in total capacity of renewable projects on the system since the introduction of the REFIT scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter in the first instance for private sector service providers operating in a liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.</P>
        <P>ComReg&rsquo;s website www.callcosts.ie   provides detailed information on the various private sector telecommunications products and services available on a county by county basis, including County Longford.</P>
        <P>In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.  Since the completion of the roll out of the NBS in October 2010, there is at least one service provider offering a broadband service in all areas of Ireland.  Attention is now being focussed on isolated cases where broadband is not being delivered due to technical or line of sight reasons.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I will formally announce the launch of a Rural Broadband Scheme, shortly.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  Ledwithstown, Ballymahon, County Longford, is not covered by the NBS and therefore any un-served premises in that locality will be eligible to apply under the scheme.</P>
        <P>There will be a competitive process to engage a service provider who will offer a broadband service to qualified applicants under the scheme.  While the exact details have yet to be finalised, I expect that the service offered under this scheme would at least match the service offered under the NBS and that the scheme will be fully rolled out by the end of 2012.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied therefore that between the services being provided by the commercial operators, the service now available through the NBS and the forthcoming Rural Broadband Scheme, which will target individual un-served premises, Ireland will very shortly be fully served from a broadband perspective.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with the standard arrangements for State Bodies, the criteria on which the performance of the Chief Executive is measured and any specific performance-related targets are properly determined by the board of that State Body and not by the Minister under whose Department&rsquo;s aegis that State Bodies operates. In the case of HRI, therefore, the determination of the performance-related targets on the basis of which any performance-related bonus was paid was determined by the Board. Horse Racing Ireland is subject to annual audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and at no time since its establishment has its efficiency or effectiveness been called into question.  In addition, it has outsourced its Internal Audit function, which operates in <Col N="456"/>accordance with the framework of codes of best practice as set out in the <i>Code of Practice on the Governance of State Bodies</i>   and which report directly to the company&rsquo;s Audit Committee.</P>
        <P>In response to recent allegations HRI strongly rejected the claims made and the board of HRI, having met to consider those claims found them to be <i>&ldquo;wholly inaccurate and based on a flawed understanding of the racing industry and, in particular, the restructuring which took place following the enactment of the Horse and Greyhound Act in 2001.&rdquo;</i> Indeed, the authors of the report (KPMG) on which the Irish Bookmakers Association&rsquo;s claims were based acknowledged that their analysis   <i>&ldquo;did not, nor was it required to take account of the restructuring of the horse racing industry in 2001 resulting in the transfer of certain administrative functions of the Turf Club to the newly formed HRI.&rdquo;</i></P>
        <P Just="Left">Contrary to claims that Horse Racing Ireland&rsquo;s costs are out of control, HRI make the point that their costs increased by 35 per cent between its first full year of operation in 2002 and 2009.  Over that same period, there was a 28 per cent increase in the number of race meetings.  They also make the point that, since 2008, their administrative costs have reduced by 28 per cent and the number of permanent employees in the HRI Group (including the Tote, the four racecourses it owns and Irish Thoroughbred Marketing) has been cut from 176 to 143 in the same period &mdash; a reduction of 19 per cent.  In a recent letter received from HRI, the Chairman assured me that the   <i>&ldquo;Board takes its responsibilities in relation to governance and cost control very seriously&rdquo;. </i>An independent review &ldquo;Review of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund&rdquo;, FGS Consulting, May 2009, of the Horse and Greyhound Fund was completed in 2009. It concluded that, while not all aspects of the total contribution of the sector can be definitively quantified, there is adequate direct and indirect evidence to support a strong argument that the horse racing industry is a major source of direct and indirect employment, giving rise to considerable domestic and exports earnings and is a key driver of substantial economic activity, especially in rural areas.  The funding provided to Horse Racing Ireland supports a very important industry generating very substantial economic activity and making a vital contribution to the rural economy, including farm incomes.  Furthermore, bloodstock breeding is a sustainable and environmentally sound activity.</P>
        <P>The Dukes Report &ldquo;Analysis of the economic impact of the Irish Thoroughbred Industry&rdquo; A. Dukes (2009) concluded &ldquo;  <i>The conclusion of this analysis is abundantly clear: a relatively modest amount of State funding has been very successfully leveraged by the industry to produce a strong dynamic impulsion. This compares very favourably with the returns from much higher levels of support to other areas of economic activity. Government funding must remain to ensure survival of this very successful industry and to continue its growth into the future as one of Ireland&rsquo;s most dynamic agricultural sectors&rdquo;.</i></P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the question raised by the Deputy as to the independence or otherwise of a named consultant, I have been informed that this individual was employed by a group comprised of 13 organisations including HRI, to undertake a study of Irish racing &ldquo;Financing of Irish Racing&rdquo;, C McCarthy, October 2010.  I understand that the study did not include an examination of the productivity of HRI.</P>

	<P>Applications under the 2009 and 2010 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme were received from the person named on 15 May 2009 and 20 May 2010, respectively. The Terms and Conditions governing the Scheme require, inter alia, that applicants maintain a minimum stocking density on their holding of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare declared, for at least three consecutive months, during the calendar year of application.  However, where the holding of an applicant is identified as not meeting this minimum requirement, the person in question is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports or details of a REPS or Commonage Framework Plan, which provides for a lower stocking level. The person named was notified of this condition and replied stating that he could not meet the required stocking levels due to ongoing health issues.  However, as allowance had been made in respect of this condition in respect of the 2008 application year, on an exceptional basis, it cannot be granted again. The EU rules governing the application of the principle of Force Majeure/exceptional circumstances clearly state that any such circumstances should be unforeseen; unfortunately, therefore, ongoing illness can not be deemed as meeting this definition and, accordingly, it is not appropriate to waive the minimum stocking density requirement of the Scheme in this case for the years in question.</P>

	<P>An application under 2010 Single Payment Scheme was received from the person named on 17 May 2010.  The 50% advance payment, which issued on 18 October 2010, was on the basis of the land cleared at that stage, as a number of parcels declared required digitising. </P>
        <P>Balancing payments under the scheme, which commenced 1 December, would, in normal circumstances, be confined to those whose applications are fully processed, specifically, where all digitising is finalised. However, following recent consultation with the EU Commission, agreement was reached whereby, in addition to issuing balancing payments to those farmers whose applications are fully processed and whose maps are fully digitised, payments will also issue to those farmers where some or all of their maps are still to be digitised, with the payment being calculated on the basis of the digitised land confirmed otherwise eligible.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to say that, because of this change, many farmers, including the person named, whose balancing payments would otherwise have been delayed until their digitising is complete, received an interim balancing payment on 1 December. These farmers, including the person named, will receive the final instalment of their balancing payment when their maps are re-digitised and their applications are fully clear.</P>

	<P>Under the provisions of the governing EU Regulations, payments under the Single Farm Payment may be made only in respect of eligible land and applicants under the Scheme are obliged annually to declare the land parcels available to them; details of the eligible area of the land parcels are recorded on Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), my Department&rsquo;s computer-based land parcel tracking system.  Details of the use and area claimed for each of some one million parcels on the LPIS system are registered and continually monitored by my Department. </P>
        <P>In Ireland, the vast majority of Scheme applicants have been making sufficient deductions from their claims to take account of ineligible areas, in that they reduced the area claimed.  However, in many cases as no mapping evidence supporting these deductions were provided, the ineligible features were not, therefore, recorded onto LPIS.  As LPIS underpins all the area-based payments, worth in excess of &euro;1.8 billion annually, it is crucial that it accurately reflects the true position on the ground, particularly given the audit scrutiny that this Scheme attracts not just in Ireland but also in all Member States.  To this end, the initiative I took earlier this year in urging all farmers to map out ineligible areas was crucial and, given the overwhelming response, absolutely vital.</P>
        <P>The regulatory payment date under the Scheme is 1 December; however, following my approach, agreement at was reached at EU level which allowed advance payments to begin issuing as and from 18 October, with balancing payments commencing on 1 December.  However, in addition to issuing balancing payments to those farmers whose applications were fully processed and maps fully digitised, payments also issued to those farmers where some or all of their maps still remained to be digitised, with the payment being calculated on the basis of the confirmed eligible land.  Because of this decision, which I made following consultation with the EU Commission, many farmers, whose balancing payments would otherwise have been delayed until their digitising was complete, received payment.</P>
        <P>Under the 2010 Scheme, a total of 12,821 Cork applicants submitted eligible applications and, to date, 12,583 of these have received payments, worth in excess of &euro;149.79 million.  Payments are continuing to issue twice weekly as individual cases are cleared.  While I am determined that this momentum in clearing cases will be maintained and that the maximum numbers of farmers will receive their full payments as the earliest possible date, at the same time, however, I must continue to emphasise the absolute urgency in getting the mapping system fully accurate and up-to-date to protect Irish direct payments.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 843 and 844 together.</P>
        <P>As I stated in my answer to Question No. 1676 of 29 September 2010, the only documents that the Solicitor for the land holder did not have access to were the fair rent orders/judicial tenancies.  These are very old Land Commission documents and are in long term storage as a result of the decentralisation of the Records Branch of my Department to Portlaoise.  These documents are not readily accessible without committing a large portion of the scarce staff resources to locate the documents relating to that townland.  My officials are satisfied that access to these documents would not add anything of significance to the material already supplied to the solicitor.</P>

The 50% advance payment under the Single Payment Scheme, which issued on 18 October, the interim balancing payment which issued on 1 December and the 75% advance payment under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme which issued on 21 September, were on the basis of those parcels cleared for payment at that stage, as one of the land parcels listed on the application of the person named required re-digitisation.  As this process has recently been completed, the application will be further processed with a view to issuing the final balancing payments under both Schemes shortly.</P>

The judgement by the European Court of Justice, to which you refer, related to the company&rsquo;s eligibility for payment of afforestation premium in which the Court held that Coillte was a public undertaking for the purposes of the particular EU legislation concerned.</P>

	<P>Pursuant to Section 9(1) of the Forestry Act 1988, Coillte Teoranta was incorporated on 8 December 1988 as a private company under the Companies Act 1963, that is to say, a company limited by shares.   The shares are held by the Minister for Finance and myself as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>As a Shareholder, and in view of the fact that Coillte is the State forestry company, I have no difficulty with a recommendation to review the operations of Coillte.  As the Deputy is aware, a Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities was established by the Minister for Finance last year to examine and provide advice on the proper stewardship of state assets and on opportunities for the better use of those assets.  The outcome of that review is awaited.</P>

        <P>Following an EU procurement exercise conducted by the Department of Finance, a mobile phone Framework Agreement was established to provide non-commercial public sector bodies with a streamlined procedure for the procurement of mobile voice and data services at competitive rates from a list of qualified vendors. The Framework Agreement is intended to maximise volume discounts and provide for reductions in administrative and transaction costs for providers and public sector purchasers. My Department has run a number of competitions under the Framework for its mobile voice and data services. In each case the successful vendor was the most economically advantageous tender.</P>

	<P>Under the provisions of the governing EU Regulations, payments under the Single Farm Payment may be made only in respect of eligible land and applicants under the Scheme are obliged annually to declare to my Department the land parcels available to them. Details of the eligible area of the land parcels are recorded on my Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). It is also necessary for applicants to exclude ineligible features such as scrub, roadways, etc. Therefore, the LPIS database has to be amended on an ongoing basis to reflect any permanent changes such as parcel boundary changes, addition of new parcels, etc. </P>
        <P>Accordingly my Department undertakes regular reviews of the ortho-photography available to confirm the area of parcels recorded in LPIS and claimed by applicants under the Single Payment Scheme.   The areas declared on the 2009 Single Payment Scheme application submitted by the person named were included as part of that review.</P>
        <P>I have had the matter investigated and I can confirm that the herd owner was found to have over-claimed on three parcels of land under this review.  In order to expedite a full review of this case I have arranged for an explanatory letter and a copy of the relevant maps highlighting the areas, which appear ineligible, to be issued to the applicant.</P>

	<P>The holding of the person concerned has been restricted under the TB Eradication Scheme since 1 September 2010, following which one animal was removed and valued under the On Farm Market Valuation Scheme. </P>
        <P>As outlined in the Important Information for Farmers booklet, which is issued to all herdowners at the time of restriction, the amount to be paid by the Department under the On Farm Market Valuation Scheme is the difference between the on-farm market value of the animal concerned and the price paid to the farmer by the slaughter plant.  In line with this a payment of &euro;491.74 issued to the herdowner concerned on the 29 September 2010.</P>
        <P>The TB and Brucellosis On Farm Market Valuation Scheme (OFMV) is the principal compensation measure available to farmers whose herds are affected by TB/Brucellosis.

        <P>The Hardship Grant Scheme 2010/2011 is aimed at assisting eligible owner/keepers(s) whose herds continue to be restricted during the period 1 November to 20 April subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the scheme.  An application under the Hardship Grant Scheme was received by my Department on 24 November 2010.  Payment under this scheme is made monthly in arrears.  The District Veterinary Office has now certified a payment of &euro;250.00, which the herdowner should receive over the coming days.  Continued eligibility for payment under this scheme, for the remainder of the Hardship Grant eligibility period, will be assessed on a monthly basis.</P><Col N="477"/>

        <P>This application was selected for a Ground Eligibility and Full Cross Compliance inspection.</P>
        <P>During the course of the Ground Eligibility inspection discrepancies were found with the following parcels P18217017, P18722028 and P18817040 due to inadequate deductions being made for scrub, a dwelling/curtilage and yard.  The claimed area for the Single Payment Scheme of 14.62ha was reduced to 14.57ha.  When tolerance was taken into account this area was increased to 14.69ha.</P>
        <P>During the course of the Cross Compliance inspection breaches were discovered in relation to Statutory Management Requirement 4 relating to nitrates and the requirements concerning Good Agriculture and Environmental Conditions.  Specifically it was found that there was failure to adequately control soiled water from buildings and the encroachment of scrub and briars on to parcels P18217017 and P18817040.  This resulted in an overall cross compliance penalty of 2% being applied to the 2010 Direct Payments.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s overall national strategy for the eradication of TB provides for a comprehensive range of measures, including the mandatory annual testing for all cattle in the national herd, the restriction of holdings where reactors are disclosed, risk-based testing of herds contiguous to infected herds, the early removal of reactors and a wildlife programme involving the targeted removal of badgers where they are implicated in a TB outbreak.  Where a TB herd breakdown occurs and there is evidence of badger activity, badger capturing and removal takes place in the area associated with the TB breakdowns and only under licence from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Where such badger capturing takes place, post-mortem examination and sampling is undertaken.  These samples will be used in the ongoing studies to develop tests for TB and also for other research.  </P>
        <P>The long-term objective of my Department is to develop a vaccine for badgers and considerable research has already been conducted in collaboration with UCD on the development of such a vaccine.  Research to date has demonstrated that oral vaccination of badgers in a captive environment with the BCG vaccine generates high levels of protective immunity against challenge with bovine TB.  As part of ongoing research in this context, my Department is currently conducting a project, in collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to study the territorial behaviour and range of the badger species.  To date, most of the data available in regard to territorial behaviour is based on data from the U.K. produced from a limited number of study sites and observational studies of this nocturnal species.  Recent research in Ireland indicates that there are more and more differences between badgers in the U.K. and badgers in Ireland, in terms of population structure, group size, dietary preferences and breeding patterns.  One of the groups of badgers being observed in the context of this research is in County Wicklow whereby the movement of badgers is recorded and observed using modern tracking techniques in the form of GPS tracking collars.   Samples are collected from badgers in this badger tracking project, following which the badgers are immediately released.  There is no validated test currently available to detect tuberculosis in live badgers. All such data collection and research will form part of the TB vaccine development project and vaccine delivery strategy being conducted by my Department.  The study areas were selected on the basis of a good area history of bovine TB as it is necessary to study each group for at least a full year. I want to emphasise that <Col N="479"/>normal badger survey and removal arrangements continue to be implemented in any areas, including the area concerned, where badgers are found to be implicated in a TB outbreak.</P>

	<P>This issue has recently been thoroughly assessed by my Department.  Following the difficulties being experienced by some companies seeking Export Credit Insurance in 2009, my predecessor, the T&aacute;naiste Mary Coughlan TD,  arranged that an independent forensic examination of the Export Credit Insurance market in Ireland should be carried out to establish the desirability and merits of a State-supported Export Credit Insurance Scheme.</P>
        <P>This assessment, by international consultants KPMG, who also advise the UK Government on credit insurance issues, analysed a significant level of confidential and detailed company-specific information from the credit insurers.  It was established that only a very small level of Irish exports are insured, that the existing cover is heavily concentrated on a single sector and a single market, that total withdrawals of cover (i.e. where the market decides that the risk is too great to provide any level of cover) was much more prevalent than reductions, that the introduction of a State <i>&lsquo;Top &ndash;up</i>  &lsquo; scheme, as has been sought for such reductions, would be expensive and of very limited impact, and that a negligible number of jobs would be supported by such an initiative.  Significantly, the level of premia to be paid by companies under any such scheme, would, under EU State-Aid rules, be a multiple of regular premia and therefore very expensive for business.  In addition, it was established that there were indications that this market was showing signs of recovery and that the insurance companies should therefore begin to provide better levels of cover.  Accordingly the  Government,  based on the overwhelming weight of evidence in the KPMG report, decided that a State-supported scheme of short-term export credit insurance should not be introduced.</P>
        <P>The KPMG report also recommended that my Department should consider the merits of introducing a State supported Medium-term Export Credit Insurance Scheme (where the risk period is over 2 years).  This assessment was carried out last year and it was decided that, given the very small proportion of Irish exports coming within this definition, that establishing a scheme for such exports could not be justified.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to keep the situation under review.</P>

	<P>In October 2006, the Government announced its intention to continue to restrict access to the Irish labour market for nationals of Romania following their accession to the EU <Col N="483"/>on 1 January 2007.  Accordingly, Romanian nationals continue to require a permit to take up employment in Ireland.  However, those already in the State on a valid employment permit for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer at the relevant date of 31 December 2006 would not need an employment permit.  Romanian nationals entering the workforce after 1 January 2007 require an employment permit for a 12 month period after which they have free access to the labour market.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the transitional arrangements on free movement for Romanian workers ended on 31 December 2008.  The T&aacute;naiste announced, at that time, that the Government had decided to continue to require that nationals of Romania apply for employment permits in order to participate in the Irish labour market, but that preference would be given to them over nationals of non-European Economic Area countries.</P>
        <P>The considerable challenges posed as a result of the downturn in the global economic environment, and the direct impact on our labour market, had been factors influencing the decision of the Government who felt that it would be prudent to focus on maintaining stability in the Irish labour market, and avoiding the potential imbalances caused by additional migratory inflows to the country.</P>
        <P>Ireland is one of 10 Member States to continue to apply restrictions on Romanian access to its labour market.  All Member States that continue to restrict labour market access can end these restrictions at any time during the second phase.  In principle, full free movement of workers should apply after the end of the second phase (31 December 2011).  Member States can only maintain restrictions thereafter if there is a serious disturbance (or threat thereof) to the labour market.  All restrictions for workers from Romania must be lifted by 31 December 2013 at the very latest when full free movement of workers will apply across the 27 EU Member States.</P>
        <P>I can advise the Deputy that Ireland&rsquo;s economic migration policies are kept under regular and ongoing review having regard to potential impacts and the stability of the domestic labour market.</P>
        <P>Full details of the current employment permit requirements for Romanian nationals can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website at http://www.deti.ie/labour/workpermits/ bulgariaromania.htm.</P>

	<P>During 2009, my Department commissioned EPS Consulting to measure a prioritised list of 31 Information Obligations in Company Law, Employment Law and Health &amp; Safety Law.  The total cost of the project, including the Report presented in December 2009, was &euro;58,249.</P>
        <P>To date, my Department has paid fees totalling &euro;55,880 to consultants other than EPS Consulting in relation to the administrative burden reduction target.  These costs cover fourteen projects dealing with the listing and prioritising of Information Obligations, Standard Cost Model training and advice on sectoral and technical matters arising during the overall process of measurement.</P>
        <P>I intend to bring a proposal to Government shortly regarding the detailed process of measuring the approximately 120 prioritised Information Obligations identified by participating Departments and Revenue in the administrative burden reduction project.</P>

	<P>The Enterprise Development agency figures for jobs created are compiled annually in the Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey, the most up to date of which details employment figures up until 2009.  The figures are in respect of numbers of persons employed in firms assisted by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development, together with those assisted by the County Enterprise Boards (CEB) operating in the Mid West Region, which come under the aegis of my Department.  As the information is compiled on an annualised basis, I expect the figures in respect of 2010 to become available during the first quarter of this year.  </P>
        <P>Figures for jobs created in the Mid West Region in 2008 and 2009 in respect of companies supported by the State&rsquo;s Enterprise Development agencies and the County Enterprise Boards operating in the Region are set out in Table 1 accompanying this reply.  In addition to the jobs created by CEB-eligible clients, additional jobs have been created in 2010 through utilization of European Globalisation funds administered by Limerick City Enterprise Board (22 jobs) and Limerick County Enterprise Board (70 jobs).</P>
        <P>Table 2 sets out the number of itinerary visits to the region in 2008, 2009 and 2010 sponsored by IDA Ireland and Shannon Development.  The Enterprise Ireland and CEB portfolios of indigenous client companies are, of their nature, not very mobile, and therefore no itinerary visits were arranged by these bodies during the period in question.</P>

        <P>The benefits of the exemption included providing an incentive for the commercialisation of R&amp;D, reducing the cost of undertaking R&amp;D for SMEs and removing the competitive disadvantage for SMEs associated with an inability to match the share-based remuneration options provided by many stock exchange listed multinationals.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, having regard to the costs arising for the Exchequer and other concerns about the operation of the Exemption, decided to terminate the facility as provided in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 which also includes a commitment that some of the money raised from abolishing tax expenditures will be redirected to support enterprise.</P>

	<P>I announced the first call for expressions of interest in Innovation Fund Ireland on 23 September 2010.  Enterprise Ireland and the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) will manage the Fund and investors had until 26th November 2010 to signal their interest in establishing a presence here.  Now that this deadline has passed, Enterprise Ireland and the NPRF are in the process of evaluating the 32 expressions of interest received.</P>
        <P>Innovation Fund Ireland will have up to &euro;250 million available to make commitments. This funding runs along two parallel tracks.</P>
        <P>The first comprises a &euro;125 million pool of funds provided by the Exchequer and managed by Enterprise Ireland.  Successful applicants who receive an investment from Enterprise Ireland will have to commit to investing an equivalent amount in Irish companies or companies with substantial Irish operations over the lifetime of their fund.</P>
        <P>The second is for a similar amount and designed to allow Ireland&rsquo;s National Pension Reserve Fund to make a similar level of commercial investments assuming its criteria are met.  To date the NPRF has made two investments under the banner of Innovation Fund Ireland.</P>

	<P>In respect of 2010, a total of 80 new High Potential Start-Up Companies were supported through a programme operated by Enterprise Ireland, the agency for the development of indigenous Irish companies.  Of that number, 50% were companies established outside the Dublin region, contributing to company growth across the country.  The companies were generated in sectors including Medical Devices, Software, Financial Services, Food, Cleantech and Engineering.  The investment approved to these Start-Ups was approximately &euro;18.7 million and in addition, a further 16 High Potential Start-Up companies, already established, also received follow-on investment funding, amounting to over &euro;2 million during 2010. </P>
        <P>Over the period 2008-2010, Enterprise Ireland has supported a total of 224 High Potential Start-Up companies.  The establishment of these new companies, across a wide range of know<Col N="490"/>ledge-intensive sectors, is a clear indication that entrepreneurs throughout the country have the ambition, ability and courage to take their ideas forward and create new and innovative, export-focused businesses, despite the difficult economic conditions.</P>
        <P>For 2011, additional money has been provided to increase the momentum of new company development.  Enterprise Ireland has set a target to support 85 High Potential Start-Ups in 2011 and the aim is to increase this figure to 100 per year by 2013.  Currently, the agency is working with a strong pipeline of start-up prospects and expects to be able to achieve this challenging target in the year ahead.</P>
        <P>To strengthen the development of High Potential Start-Up companies, Enterprise Ireland has developed a range of initiatives which are aimed at growing the start-up environment, including:</P>
        <P>The continued development of the Seed and Venture Capital market in Ireland &mdash; a record level of seed capital is now available with in excess of &euro;120m currently under management.</P>
        <P>The launch of the Internet and Games Competitive Start Fund to support internet and games start ups.  This competitive fund provides start ups with early stage funding to explore and determine the market fit of their business and progress to product launch.  The initial fund will be &euro;500,000 and it is envisaged that this will be expanded to include further sectors in early 2011.</P>
        <P>Focus on overseas entrepreneurs as a rich source of start-ups, which will include the introduction of development programmes and competitions relating to business plan which will attract new and serial entrepreneurs from outside Ireland, consistent with the objective to make Ireland an internationally recognised innovation hub.</P>
        <P>An ongoing collaboration is underway between Enterprise Ireland and other relevant players such as the Universities and Institutes of Technology (particularly in the context of research commercialisation and technology transfer), the Business Innovation Centres, City and County Enterprise Boards, Business Angel Networks, Incubators and Enterprise Centres, which play an important role in both the identification and development of entrepreneurial prospects which can progress to the generation of new High Potential Start-Up companies.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department operates a range of grant programmes and schemes supportive of communities across the country, including vulnerable children and families, details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.pobail.ie. Some of the schemes are administered directly by my Department, while others are administered on its behalf by various intermediary bodies and groups, where applications for funding are submitted directly to the bodies/groups in question. </P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific request for details on all funding made available to voluntary and community organisations who work with vulnerable children and families in 2009 and 2010, I do not consider it feasible to provide such information in the format requested by the Deputy due to the level of resources required and the volume of work required to collate that information.  If, however, the Deputy has a specific query with regard to a particular organisation or scheme, I would be happy to provide the relevant information.</P>
        <P>Finally, may I draw the attention of the Deputy to the funding provided by my Department to the Family Support Agency (&euro;33.5 million in 2010) to support vulnerable families and children. Details of the funding allocated and the work of the Family Support Agency can be accessed at its website at www.fsa.ie  .</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that no legal services were procured following competitive tendering by my own Department, or by the following bodies funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote Group: the Office of the Commissioner of Charitable Donations and Bequests; the Dormant Accounts Board; An Foras Teanga (comprising Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency); the Equality Authority; the Equality Tribunal; and the Family Support Agency.</P>
        <P>Details with respect to instances where legal services were procured by bodies funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote Group following a competitive tendering process between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2010 are set out in the table below. I am advised that the services of external solicitors and barristers were procured in these cases to provide essential legal advice, legal opinion or to carry out specialist legal work where the legal expertise required was not available in-house.  I am also advised that no legal advice was sought or fees paid to legal firms to assist in the preparation of tender documents as referred to by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are members of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning.  One of the ways in which the Defence Forces provide assistance in Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) is by providing assistance under the agreed multi-agency Framework for Major Emergency Management.  Representation on the Task Force ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation with the appropriate lead Department in the event of an emergency.  </P>
        <P>In all emergency situations, including the recent periods of severe weather, the full resources of the Defence Forces are made available to the Government Task Force, and its Emergency Response Coordinating Committee, for the purpose of providing assistance where it is not possible for other agencies and organisations to respond.  The Defence Forces are also members of the eight (8) Regional Working Groups set up under the Framework for the purpose of coordinating the work of the Principle Response Agencies and Defence Liaison Officers are provided to Local Authorities on an ongoing basis.  These procedures were seen to operate very effectively recently as the Defence Forces responded to all requests for assistance received from the civil authorities during the recent periods of severe weather.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 923 and 925 together.</P>
        <P>The Chief State Solicitors Office and the State Claims Agency deal with all legal matters on behalf of the Department. As such it would seldom arise that the Department procure the services of external solicitors and barristers directly.</P>
        <P>In 2007 McCann Fitzgerald solicitors were contracted, through a competitive tendering process, to provide legal drafting, research and advice services in relation to the drafting of new Rules and Procedure and Court Martial Rules following the enactment of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 2007.  A payment for this service was made in 2008 to the value of &euro;53,845 which included VAT.  No legal firm was involved in the preparation of the tender documents.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces Canteen board has procured legal advice from B.P. McCormack &amp; Son, Solicitors. The only payment made in the years listed was a payment of &euro;5,505.50 in 2008 in relation to two cases. Firstly, advice was sought concerning the amendment of regulations and, secondly, legal advice was sought in a case taken by an employee of the Board.</P>

        <P>None of the cases involved were constitutional challenges.</P>
        <P>The management and legal representation of all of the above cases was undertaken either by the State Claims Agency or the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.  The State Claims Agency manages personal injury and property damage claims against the State.  The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office currently manages cases that arise from overseas incidents, policy sensitive cases and administrative law cases such as judicial reviews.  Both the State Claims Agency and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office brief the relevant barristers.</P>
        <P>In cases where the State is considered liable or which involve an apportionment of liability as between the State and the claimant, I am informed that both the State Claims Agency and Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office approach is to settle such cases expeditiously in so far as it is possible and to do so on reasonable terms.  In cases where liability is fully disputed by the State, all necessary resources are applied to defending such claims robustly.</P>
        <P>My Department reimburses the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and State Claims Agency in respect of settled cases where the State paid plaintiffs&rsquo; legal costs as well as those cases that were lost in court.  My Department does not make payments direct to barristers or solicitors in respect of these cases.  The amounts quoted in the following table are the total for plaintiffs&rsquo; legal costs.  Some of these cases would have been initiated prior to 2008 but finalised in the period, 2008 to 2010.</P>

	<P>Resulting from the Government Decision regarding the reduction of public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, recruitment, promotions and acting-up appointments in the Permanent Defence Forces were suspended. However, in order to maintain the ongoing operational capability of the Defence Forces, a limited number of exceptions to the application of the measures to the Permanent Defence Force were sought in a submission to the Minister for Finance, in June 2009.    As announced on the 24 November 2009 the Minister for Finance approved an allocation of 50 promotions for the Permanent Defence Force. These promotions were approved to address priority operational and command requirements of the Permanent Defence Force. Military Management reviewed existing vacancies in all ranks across the organisation as a whole, so as to prioritise those to be filled from the approved promotions.  Following on from this review, a total of 13 Commissioned Officers and 35 Non-Commissioned Officer were promoted during 2010.  The residual 2 approved promotions were retained for use to fill priority posts as the need arose.</P>
        <P>Official confirmation and details relating to the Employment Control Framework (ECF) were received on 18 October 2010 from the Department of Finance. The ECF is based on a figure of 10,000 all ranks Permanent Defence Force personnel, appropriately configured across the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps to enable them meet the roles assigned by Government.</P>
        <P>Officials from the Department together with the Military Authorities are in the process of reviewing the structures and posts required to meet the operational requirements of the Permanent Defence Force in accordance with the upper limits in ranks provided for in the ECF.</P>
        <P>As the review process proceeds prioritised posts are being filled.  In this regard a total of 104 promotions within the officer rank were completed in December 2010. Further officer promotions, approximately 45, will be made as soon as the relevant administrative procedures including the holding of promotion competitions, which are currently being organised, have taken place.  The officer promotions already approved reflect both an operational and organisational requirement and are consistent with the action plan being developed under the National Pay Agreement.  Further promotions for enlisted personnel in respect of prioritised posts are currently under consideration.</P>

	<P>There has been very significant investment in equipment for the Defence Forces in recent years. In that regard, a particular focus was placed in the investment in equipment for the individual soldier. This included the acquisition of an Integrated Protection and Load Carrying System for soldiers, which included Body Armour, Helmets, Back Packs (Rucksacks) and Battle Vests.  In addition to the acquisition of standard uniform and related items, a total of &euro;1.35m was expended in 2010 on other personal kit for members of the Defence Forces. Details of which are set out in the following tabular statement, which will be circulated with the Official Report.   The personal equipment, which the individual soldier in the Defence Forces has at his/her disposal for operational use both at home and overseas is second to none and compares very favourably with the equipment in use by other countries. </P>
