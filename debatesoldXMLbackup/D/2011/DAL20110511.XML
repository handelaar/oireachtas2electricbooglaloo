	<P>When the Taoiseach downgraded yesterday&rsquo;s announcement from a jobs budget to a jobs initiative, one of the effects was that the D&aacute;il and the general public were given only a fraction of the information that normally accompanies budget measures.  For example, all preparatory paperwork from the tax strategy group would normally be published immediately online.  This allows people to see all the advice received for and against any budget measure.  In spite of the commitment in the programme for Government to increase budgetary transparency, the Government has reduced it by issuing no detailed supporting documentation.  Information has not been published or made available about the likely net impact of the measures.  There is a growing impression that this is because Ministers wish to focus on the public relations aspect of the announcement rather than the substance of the measures.</P>
        <P>With regard to the &euro;1.8 billion to be removed from personal pension funds, the Taoiseach will know that a similar move in Britain ended up having a disastrous impact.  In that case, it took ten years for documents to be released showing that warnings were ignored before the decision was taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Could you get to the question, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Under Standing Orders, I have two minutes to raise the matter about which I am going to ask a question.  I will do that now.</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P>It is not credible for the Government to claim it can remove &euro;1.8 billion from personal pension funds without any negative impact.  Will the Taoiseach commit to immediately releasing all documents and advices relating to this decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no secrecy about this initiative.  I made it perfectly clear that it was a top priority of the Government to focus on creating jobs, getting people back to work and developing our economy.  The Deputy is not interested in a Punch and Judy show and neither am I.  In his statement yesterday, the Minister for Finance set out the details of this initiative and what it could mean in terms of job creation and getting people off the live register and back into work.  I am sure the Deputy knows young people in his own constituency who had gone three quarters of the way through the process of acquiring a trade but have found themselves in limbo for the past two and a half years.  They will now be able to complete their certificates and be provided with a currency they can use at home or abroad.  There are thousands more people like this.  If we can do this on such a scale with an injection of &euro;450 million, the Deputy should think of what could have been done if we were not obliged to follow through on the promissory note signed by his Government of &euro;3 billion every year for the next ten years for Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The committees of the Oireachtas will probably be set up next week.  They will provide an opportunity, as well as that provided in the House, for full debate on these matters.  If there is any outstanding information the Deputy seeks, it will be provided to him, because there is not anything secret here.  It was the declared intention of the Government to introduce this initiative, which will stimulate confidence in our indigenous economy and give people a sense of hope that the Government can provide an environment in which jobs can be created, and that is what we did yesterday.  We have never held this up as being the answer to all our unemployment or economic problems, but it is a step in the right direction.  As the Minister, Deputy Noonan, pointed out, it is a modest proposal in view of the economic constraints we are under.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach immediately release all documents and advices relating to the decision to take &euro;1.8 billion from pension funds?  That is the question I asked.  He can argue that the &euro;1.8 billion pension levy will have no impact if he wants.  If this was a normal budget, the advices and supporting documentation would already be published online.  If the Taoiseach wants us to believe this is more than a PR initiative, I do not see why he should not let people see now the full impact of this initiative.  We do not have to wait for the committees to be set up in a couple of weeks&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has given three speeches so far about the fact that export-oriented industry will be the driver of growth and job creation, which we on this side agree with, yet there is not even one measure in the proposal to aid such companies.  Equally, none of the proposals leaked by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, were in the package announced yesterday.  Can the Taoiseach explain why yesterday&rsquo;s &euro;2 billion package contained no significant allocation for any measure under the control of the Department responsible for jobs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The initiative announced yesterday is what it says &mdash; an initiative to stimulate investment and job creation in our economy.  I make no bones about saying how this is being funded, nor did I yesterday.  As the Deputy is aware, pension funds have been the subject of massive tax concessions which have allowed them to be built up over the years.  This is not a <Col N="3"/>tax on any individual pension; it is a levy on the funds of a very modest 0.6% over four years.  It is a temporary measure designed to stimulate the indigenous economy.</P>
        <P>Everybody shares the view that our exports are strong.  That is how it should be and that is how we want it to continue.  For example, for Enterprise Ireland, whose representatives I met last week in New York, and quite a number of the companies to which it is providing grant aid under already voted moneys, this initiative is an addition to what is already happening.  The Deputy is aware of the projected levels of export growth for this country.  I see the ESRI has projected growth of 2% of this year, which is to be welcomed.  However, these are only reports.  All we can do is to continue to remove the red tape and obstacles to employment and drive forward our ambition for more and more people to get into the world of work, many of them in the export business.</P>
        <P>I am not clear what information the Deputy is looking for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The advices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has a mandate for this pension levy, because it was published as part of our programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The advice attached to it is what I am looking for.</P>

	<P>There is no reason it should not be given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The advice is political judgment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must ask the Taoiseach to conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We could sit here and whinge and complain and wring our hands in desperation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach publish the advices?  It is a very simple question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that nothing could be done about this.  We have taken a very modest measure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will he publish the advices?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to over four years inject funds into an area where we feel it is needed.  For the first time from a Government it is an expression of joined-up thinking about how to get our country moving.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I rith fheachtas an toghch&aacute;in bh&iacute; daoine ag lorg ceannaireachta.  Nuair a th&aacute;inig P&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre agus Fine Gael le ch&eacute;ile, bh&iacute; a l&aacute;n daoine d&oacute;chasach, ach n&iacute;l siad d&oacute;chasach anois.  The Taoiseach asked whether we were seeking any outstanding infor<Col N="4"/>mation.  Yes: where are the jobs?  That is information we would like to have, because that is what many citizens are asking, particularly the half a million who are unemployed.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P Just="Left">How can the Government put &euro;24 billion of public moneys into toxic banks?  In this context how can the Government put only &euro;29 million into what it now call a jobs initiative, which is probably more than it will spend on the Queen of England's visit?  The sum total would probably give away pensions for nine bankers.  If this really is a plan for jobs, where are the targets in terms of numbers and types of jobs?  What happened to the general election promises made by Fine Gael and Labour to create 100,000 jobs and 60,000 training places?  What happened to the billions of euro that was going to fund them?  Did the banks get all that money?  Did the IMF and the EU approve yesterday&rsquo;s measures?</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that before it is too late there needs to be more meaningful investment in job creation if we are to break the cycle of unemployment?  Does he not accept that the economy needs a stimulus and will he make a statement on that le do thoil?</P>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy was here yesterday and the announcement that was made by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government is a stimulus for the Irish economy.  The Deputy talked about jobs.  We are not in the business here of setting out boxes to say this will create 348, 256, 4,009 or whatever number of jobs the Deputy wants to mention.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To take the example of the initiative announced by the Minister for Education and Skills, there are 2,200 jobs in construction and the fitting out of the schools, which will start almost immediately.  The announcement was made yesterday.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>That was there already.</P>

	<P>If the Deputy were to go to those people who are going to get the contracts on those schools and say that he thinks they need a stimulus he would want his head examined.  This is about putting people back to work.</P>
        <P>This morning at 11 o&rsquo;clock the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will announce a scheme for retrofitting  which will provide 2,000 jobs starting almost immediately with money being available from 1 July.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We could do without the background music, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what happened with the previous Government which lost touch with the people who were about to lose jobs or who were unemployed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>What is happening here is a direct injection of confidence into this economy so that people can have the dignity of being able to go to a job, of being able to contribute to their community and their country and of having the satisfaction of getting paid for a day&rsquo;s work and of having been taken off the live register.  I am sure the Deputy Adam&rsquo;s supports that.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy were to go through the initiatives that were announced yesterday, in each and every area they represent a direct Government injection into sectors where there are people unemployed.  He and I have often spoken about what politics essentially is about.  It is about people, their lives and their careers.  For some people this morning, although not for everybody, there are opportunities arising from this initiative.  It is not a full budget for the year and was never intended to be but it is a clear demonstration in respect of which we got a mandate from the people to make jobs our top priority.  This is but the first step in that process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Pearse Doherty acknowledged yesterday &mdash; the Minister for Finance was not here for most of his remarks &mdash; that there are positive elements in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s proposals.  There are some modest &mdash; that is the Minister&rsquo;s description, not mine &mdash; common sense small elements to them.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach mentioned County Louth.  This initiative has more to do with bringing forward a plan for a town like Dundalk or Drogheda.  It is a plan for a town, not one for a State that has half a million citizens unemployed.  We have schools and we need improved hospitals, primary care centres and child care facilities.  We have the people to build, maintain and staff them but we do not have the money.  Why do we not have it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will not have that opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>It is because the Government is committed at every turn&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have a supplementary question, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to putting more money into bad banks and into big bankers&rsquo; pensions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That is Voodoo economics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>The crux of the problem is that Government is also at every point committed to supporting the IMF-EU plan.  The Taoiseach describes the initiative as a modest proposal, there is much to be modest about.  It reminds me very much of Jonathan Swift&rsquo;s modest proposal in that in this case the solution could be worse than the problem.</P>
        <P>I put it to the Taoiseach again, and I do it not for the sake of banter or rhetorical neighbour sabre rattling, that one cannot create jobs unless the economy is stimulated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A supplementary question, please.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="6"/>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That cannot be done unless money is put into it and that is not possible when money is being given to these toxic banks.  Will Taoiseach introduce a change of plan?  People are looking for a change of direction.  This reads of Fianna F&aacute;il&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have a supplementary question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;and the Green Party.  People want a change of direction.  Will the Taoiseach come forward with a jobs plan which is about stimulating the economy and doing the things which I think he would like to do but he cannot do under this current strategy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Jobs cannot be created unless the economy is stimulated; likewise children cannot be fed unless there is bread in the bread bin.  The situation in which the Government found itself on taking office 60 days ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is waxing lyrical.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;was that it first had to deal with the problem of the banks.  There were six dysfunctional banks and there was confusion, uncertainty and concern.  That was dealt with by clear decisions of the Government and the follow-on from that is under way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The scope available to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Government in respect of stimulating the economy is not to the extent that we would like.  I am sure that the Minister would love to have told the D&aacute;il yesterday that the Government had &euro;3 billion to allocate to the economy which would be spent on job creation.  What we had was &euro;450 million from a very modest levy on pension funds that were built up with generous tax reliefs and the adjustment of moneys within voted moneys for Departments.  This will be used to provide the stimulus to the extent that we can in these circumstances.  The Government focused on the areas where job creation is of such critical importance and a priority, namely, in tourism, construction, in terms of schools and the retrofit scheme and in the protection from complete disintegration of many the roads of the country and so on.  That will provide, as Deputy Adams knows, jobs and employment for people who are currently out of work.</P>
        <P>This is not a case of having millions of euro to spend where huge firms can come in and do most of the work by machinery.  This is labour intensive work and it is designed to create a sense of confidence and will in its own way leverage private spending as well, which is good for the economy.  It will also release some of the savings that people have put by because of the concerns and anxiety that they had.</P>
        <P>Anybody in politics would love to be able to say there was a huge amount of money to spend.  It is very easy to govern when the State is awash with a surplus of funds coming in from taxes, even though that structure in previous years was clearly built on a foundation of sand.  We are being very realistic here in sorting out the banks, creating an incentive and an initiative in investment in confidence for job creation and moving on to deal with our budget deficit.</P>
        <P>We live in the world of reality here, as does Deputy Adams, and what we are doing is within our range.  This was not over-hyped.  The expectations were never that it would remove 440,000 people off the live register but it is designed to create the first steps towards confidence and progress and people having jobs and opportunities to go to work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Shane Ross.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Do I not have the facility to respond?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="7"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No, one can ask one supplementary question for which one minute is allowed and that applies to both sides.  One minute is allowed for a supplementary and one minute for a reply.  Deputy Shane Ross to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There seems to be a broad consensus around the House that this was a modest effort at creating jobs and nobody seems to disagree with the efforts made by the Government to do so.  The problem is on the other side, on the tax on what the Minister referred to yesterday as the pensions industry.  There is a certain misnomer or misunderstanding about what he was saying.  If he was tackling the pensions industry, I would not have too much of a problem with what he is doing.</P>
        <P>The pensions industry is a goldmine, a gravy train for a large number of people who perhaps ought to be taxed.  It is divided into two sections.  What the Government has done is hit the contributors to the pensions industry and the victims of those who benefit from the industry rather than tackling those who are benefiting and milking the industry.  It is very difficult to get exact figures because it is such an opaque industry.  Rough estimates on what fund managers receive, who under-perform consistently on behalf of their members, vary between &euro;250 million and &euro;500 million per annum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  In view of the fact that a whole industry is looting pensioners and benefiting from their contributions, did the Government consider putting a cap on pension fund fees &mdash; in other words, charges for managers &mdash; and then putting a 50% tax on them?  Such a move would have produced a figure very close to the &euro;470 million figure the Government came up with for its job creation fund.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The levy imposed on pension funds and the industry is modest at 2.4% over four years.  Contributors to pension funds were also heavily subsidised over many years.  As this is a temporary levy, it is designed to be specifically directed at sectors where employment can be created.</P>
        <P>Alternatives to this levy, as raised by Deputy Shane Ross, are a matter that can be discussed at the finance committee and in the D&aacute;il when the comprehensive expenditure review is completed and preparations begin for the 2012 budget.  As I already indicated, the preparation for the 2012 budgetary process will be very different to those in the past.  Deputies will have an opportunity to give their views well in advance on proposals such as that made by Deputy Shane Ross.</P>
        <P>There may be some merit in Deputy Shane Ross&rsquo;s point about an alternative levy.  The Government, however, took its decision in this case to impose the levy in this way for a temporary period.  I have pointed out the reasons why this was done and the opportunities that will spring from it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his constructive reply.  Will he consider going further and investigating the entire pension funds industry?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Another investigation.  That is all we need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a swamp of hidden fees, upfront fees and riches for people who do not deliver to the people they are milking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Like stockbrokers.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="8"/>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is taking straight out the hands of the contributors when he could take, if not an equivalent a proportionate sum, out of the hands of those drawing large amounts of money in hidden and upfront fees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a constructive suggestion.  At yesterday&rsquo;s brief press conference I conducted with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, I mentioned that the administrative costs in the pensions industry could be reduced to the level applied in the UK.  Similar costs that apply in the UK are a fraction of what they are here.  In that sense, an equivalent amount approaching the Government&rsquo;s levy could be made available.</P>
        <P>The Deputy made a valid point about swamps being associated with some of these industries.  I will transfer the Deputy&rsquo;s request to the Minister for Finance.  It is a matter which should be examined.  The House has a duty to reflect on the current structures of the pension funds industry, to see if they can be improved and if they can be of better benefit to their contributors.  Pension contributors were well supported by tax concessions in the building up of these funds.  The Government&rsquo;s levy is on the funds.  There could be a reduction in the administrative costs associated with these funds and, consequently, the take by those in senior positions in the industry.  I will refer this matter to the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>It is proposed to take No. 6, statements on the jobs initiative 2011 (resumed).  Private Members&rsquo; Business shall be No. 3, Electoral (Amendment) (Political Donations) Bill 2011 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed), to conclude at 8.30 p.m., if not previously concluded.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The business of the House is being arranged in a stop-gap way with a large amount of time given to statements but little to legislation.  There will be statements all this week.  We started on Monday with a rather damp squib of a debate on Europe.  There are a mounting number of measures which the Government has indicated it will introduce and publish over the next two months.  Members would appreciate if we could get a schedule from the Government on the likely business to be conducted by the House over the next three months.  Will the Taoiseach agree to this reasonable request and publish a schedule of House business and legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Requests made to the Government Chief Whip on House business so far have been for statements on a range of topics, including the Irish language, the European Union and so on.  These requests have been granted by and large.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The legislative programme for this session has been published.  I made it clear to Ministers that I only wanted Bills on the A list that they could be sure they could produce on time.  The criminal justice Bill to deal with white collar crime has been cleared by the Cabinet, as has the patents Bill.  I will ask the Chief Whip to update Deputy Martin as to what other Bills will be introduced during this session.</P>
        <P>Deputy Martin will also be aware of the pressures on drafting legislation, a matter which I am examining too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the difficulties with drafting legislation but a schedule would be useful.  There is a sense of filling space in the business of the House over the past several weeks with various statements.</P>
        <P>I must add that Fianna F&aacute;il has drafted a comprehensive and sound political donations Bill.  If the Taoiseach accepted it, it could be moved to Committee Stage and by the summer recess <Col N="9"/>corporate political donations would be ended.  The Taoiseach could easily accept this Bill instead of playing politics as usual.  He seems to be rejecting the Bill on the basis that it was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and not the Government.  It is substantial and comprehensive legislation that deals with the Moriarty tribunal recommendations.  The Taoiseach should accept it, put it on Committee Stage and get on with it instead of filling up space with more statements.</P>

Later this year the Minister will bring forward legislation to abolish the HSE board and change the structure.  Obviously, the entire health system and structure have massive implications for the economy, country and people.  It is not a case of having a jolt reaction every second day.  The Minister is changing the structure of the board.  An interim board will be appointed until such time as he brings forward towards the end of the year legislation to put the new structure in place.</P>

	<P>My question relates to minor promised legislation.  At the risk of sounding like Deputy Bernard Durkan and others, I will cite an example.  Yesterday at the Cork Circuit Court the master of a vessel pleaded guilty to an offence that most of the community would deem to be a minor administrative transgression.  The master suffered a criminal record and a punishment of up to &euro;70,000 for what most would call a technical offence.  I have raised this matter before.  Legislation is promised on minor fisheries offences to be dealt with by way of administrative sanction.  Can that legislation be brought forward as a matter of urgency?  I know that no date has been promised.  However, fishing and coastal communities are crying out for the introduction of this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Before I call Deputy Gerry Adams, I remind Deputies of Standing Order 42 which applies to supplementary questions which may be put only for the further elucidation of the information requested and shall be subject to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, both as to relevance and number.  I say this because I do not wish to have to interfere with Members as they speak.  I ask Deputies to understand that at Question Time I am trying to ensure Members&rsquo; questions are reached.  Members often wait to put questions, but they are not reached because we do not deal with enough questions.  A supplementary question should be for the purpose of further elucidation of the information requested.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>D&uacute;irt an Taoiseach i rith fheachtas an olltoghch&aacute;in go mbeadh an Rialtas oscailte, le polasaithe mac&aacute;nta.  B&rsquo;shin fhocal a bh&iacute; go m&oacute;r i mb&eacute;al an Taoisigh.  I appreciate that he is trying to introduce new procedures.  In the interests of transparency, can he tell us what the appointment procedures are for political advisers?  He said their salaries were being finalised.  However, could we be given, especially at this time when there are such impositions on working citizens, some sense of the salaries and benefits being given to advisers? <Col N="17"/> Will the Taoiseach consider appointing a Minister, with no extra pay, with responsibility for developing policy and engaging with the political institutions in the Six Counties?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have responsibility for Northern Ireland matters, working with the T&aacute;naiste and the Northern Ireland section of the Department.  There is very strong co-ordination of activity and interaction with the political parties and representatives from the North.  I spoke to the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and the deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, in the last two days and we have arranged for the North-South Ministerial Council to meet in June, to which I look forward.  There will be much interaction on issues of an all-island and cross-Border nature which will be discussed at the Council.</P>
        <P>The process of appointing advisers has been well laid out.  Those who are appointed as advisers must work with whatever Minister is <i>in situ</i>.  The same is true of my own responsibility as Taoiseach.  The salaries, when finalised, will be published, as all these things are.  The cost of the advisory service to me will be approximately 20% lower than that of my predecessor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate, acknowledge and commend the work done by officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.  Other Departments under successive Governments have also had to deal with the Six Counties.  However, as someone who comes from there, with many others in the State, I find it offensive that this matter comes within the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs, as if it was a foreign place.  Much wonderful work could be done, not least on the economy but also in building harmony, good relationships and neighbourliness, if there was a dedicated Minister.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider the appointment of such a person who would top up the work being done by other Ministers.  This is one of our most important issues and there is a lot of unfinished business to be done.  I commend this approach to the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can be assured that the politics and the development of the economy on the island and our communities will have my personal attention and that of the T&aacute;naiste.  We will see to it that there is a high level of activity and interaction, as there always has been and which I supported from an Opposition point of view for many years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Questions Nos. 2 and 3 were submitted by me.  There is no issue, from my perspective, with the employment of special advisers.  It is only in this country that the notion has developed that there is something wrong with Ministers having staff who are independent of the Civil Service.  Even in the Northern Ireland Executive, Ministers have political advisers.  Equally, if we want people with ability, we need to pay them, at least in line with the officials with whom they work.  It was a pity that Opposition parties in the last D&aacute;il sought to make cheap headlines on these issues, although they knew that if they were in government, they would have to employ political advisers too.  For example, two months ago the Government website and the Government Information Service were called sinister propaganda organs whereas, today, they are fine.</P>
        <P>In terms of the policy responsibilities of the advisers, it was a very successful policy of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessors to give one adviser special responsibility for Northern Ireland, which helped to provide an essential route for groups to make contact at political level.  From my own time in the Department of Foreign Affairs, I am acutely aware of how this was effective in building bridges between different political groupings and traditions in the North and between North and South.</P>
        <P>In his reply, the Taoiseach referred to Mr. Mark Kennelly having this role, along with other duties.  Will he clarify this and perhaps be more specific in terms of whether Mr. Kennelly will <Col N="18"/>be specifically responsible in the advisory role for developing such links and advising the Taoiseach on Northern Ireland issues?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  In his capacity as chief of staff, he will be the main link person working with the Northern Ireland division in respect of Northern Ireland affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>He will have many other responsibilities as well if he is chief of staff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, he will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Would it be preferable that the Taoiseach have a specialist adviser in regard to the situation in Northern Ireland to work exclusively on the agenda of the significant work that lies ahead in embedding the peace process and in advancing the North-South agenda in terms of linkages with communities and in particular the social and economic advancement of conditions of the people of the island of Ireland?  To be frank, there is a need to have someone within the Department of the Taoiseach devoted full-time and exclusively to working on that agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past, when times were very difficult, several people were appointed, including specialists in that area, as the Deputy is aware.  The normalisation of relations is very good for the development of the economies and our intention of moving those agendas forward.  I also want to pursue the North-South Ministerial Council activities, and the body that will be under the aegis of the Ceann Comhairle and the new Speaker of the Assembly will take some of the burden in that regard.  While the person named is obviously busy, it is well within his compass to keep the Northern Ireland issue to the forefront, and I will ensure this happens.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the process was inaugurated in February 2007, general and bilateral meetings have taken place with most of the participants at both ministerial and official levels.  I hope in the near future to meet partners in the dialogue and subsequently to hold further meetings with individual dialogue partners.  The agendas for these meetings will be agreed in advance with each dialogue partner.</P>
        <P>The process of structured dialogue was envisaged from the outset as a channel of consultation and communication on matters of mutual concern, but not to displace or override the normal arrangements for the conduct of policy and administration by Departments and agencies in their responsibilities.  I am satisfied that it will develop in the years to come to be a very valuable support in dealing with issues of change in society and am confident that the opportunity to exchange perspectives and address issues of mutual concern in this way will be of great benefit to all of the participants involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to acknowledge the very good work that has been and continues to be done by churches and faith communities.  The mark of a real republic, when we get one, will be to have eradicated sectarianism and to have tolerance and full civil and religious rights.</P>
        <P>In the course of those discussions, some legacy issues still need to be resolved.  In discussions with the Catholic Church, has the Taoiseach raised or will he raise the issue of the victims of <Col N="19"/>the Magdalene laundries?  Does he acknowledge that the State and the Catholic Church &mdash; certainly, the hierarchy &mdash; owe a public apology to those women, and that a redress scheme should be established?  Will the Taoiseach raise with the Church of Ireland the issue of Bethany House, Rathgar, and also acknowledge the joint responsibility of the Church of Ireland and the State?  Will the Taoiseach tell the House whether there are plans to revisit the existing redress scheme for survivors of abuse while in State institutions or other institutions run by the religious orders?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Magdalene laundries were not State institutions.  One of the ten Magdalene laundries was used by the Department of Justice for a period from 1960 onwards for the remand of 16 to 21 year old women for short periods pending trial.  Since the foundation of the State, a condition of probation sometimes imposed by a court on women found to have committed criminal offences was that they reside in an institution such as a Magdalene laundry for a period of three years.  The Department of Justice and Equality has not received any complaints from individuals charged with criminal offences who were remanded or sent on probation orders to any of the institutions that were run by religious orders.</P>
        <P>On 9 November 2010, the Human Rights Commission published its assessment of the request by the Justice for Magdalenes group to carry out an inquiry under section 9 of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000 into the treatment of women and girls who resided in Magdalene laundries.  The commission decided not to carry out a statutory inquiry itself, as it is entitled to do under the legislation which established it, and as was requested by the Justice for Magdalenes group.  It recommended that a statutory mechanism be established to investigate the matters advanced by the Justice for Magdalenes group and, in appropriate cases, to grant redress where warranted.  Its assessment was the subject of an Adjournment debate in the House.</P>
        <P>The assessment raised issues for a range of Departments as well as for the four religious congregations which operated the Magdalene institutions.  The Department of Justice and Equality has received proposals for a reparations scheme from the Justice for Magdalenes group, which are currently being considered, and the Department of Justice and Equality, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, whose role it is to provide legal advice, has prepared a draft submission for the Government on the matter, which is being considered by the Minister at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a good initiative of previous taoisigh to establish this dialogue between the churches, other faith communities and the office of the Taoiseach.  Many of these churches and faith groups now see the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office as a protector or promoter of diversity and tolerance.  In this context, many of the churches, including minority churches, will be worried about the impact of Government announcements and decisions, particularly the impact of Government policy on their schools.  A unilateral declaration has been made that they should hand over 50% of their schools, which has not given confidence to quite a number of minority churches.  Has the Taoiseach had consultation with the churches on that issue and, if so, will he elaborate his thoughts on the matter?</P>
        <P>Has he had consultations or discussions with the churches in regard to faith formation in schools?  I do not accept that instruction in regard to holy communion and confirmation is undermining literacy standards in our schools, which I understand was suggested by the Minister for Education and Skills.  I tend to agree with the view of former Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, that this is a completely over the top analysis of the literacy issue, which arises from more profound issues and requires deeper analysis.  I want to ascertain the Taoiseach&rsquo;s views in this regard and whether he has had consultations with the churches on the issues pertaining to education.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="20"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I have not had any consultations with the churches but I expect to do so and I look forward to that series of consultations on a whole range of issues, including in respect of schools.  When the Minister, Deputy Quinn, made his comments, he made it perfectly clear that while it might be fine to be ambitious, these issues depend on a serious dialogue between the parents, the boards of management and the patrons.  The forum on patronage and pluralism in the primary sector has been established.  That forum, announced by the Minister for Education and Skills, will undertake its work in respect of the conditions served.</P>
        <P>This is a matter the House should discuss in due course.  It is important that people&rsquo;s views be expressed.  However, the forum is getting on with its work for now.  After I meet and have a series of consultations with the Catholic Church I will be happy to come back to the House and discuss the matter further.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>May I ask a supplementary?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a question for the Taoiseach to answer.  Let us be reasonable.  There are other questions to be answered.  Perhaps the Taoiseach may care to make a short comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is obviously a matter for serious discussion.  I was in a classroom recently with 31 or 32 pupils, of whom one had been born in this country.  There are obviously practical problems in dealing with the instruction of children of diverse nationalities, ethnic groups and religious beliefs.  In the first instance practical discussion must be held &mdash; that is an important conversation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I met with Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy at the meeting of the European Council on 24 - 25 March, and at the meetings of the Heads of State and Government of the eurozone and the Extraordinary European Council on 11 March.  The Europe 2020 strategy has been adopted as a successor to the Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth and aims to enable Europe to emerge stronger from the current economic crisis and to turn the European Union into a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy.  As part of the strategy each member state is required to prepare a national reform programme and submit it to the European Commission by the end of April.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s national reform programme was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on Friday, 29 April and was subsequently submitted to the European Commission.  The programme is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The national reform programme sets national targets in the five headline areas of employment, research and development, climate change, education and poverty.  The programme complements the stability programme update prepared by the Minister for Finance as part of what is known as the new European semester.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to official trips before the summer recess, the House will be aware that I travelled to New York last week to promote Ireland to US business leaders and investors.  While I was there I took the opportunity to conduct a number of media interviews.  I also addressed the American Ireland Fund dinner gala.  I expect to attend the British-Irish Council in London on 20 June, and the European Council in Brussels on 23 - 24 June.  Other arrangements have not been finalised and remain under review.</P>
        <P>We remain in close contact with our European colleagues, both in capitals and in the EU institutions, including on matters relating to the economic challenges facing Ireland and the Union.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I asked two of the questions, Nos. 5 and 7.  In his London speech, after meeting Prime Minister Cameron, the Taoiseach stated he had held discussions with Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy concerning Ireland&rsquo;s position.  I asked him about the talks he had with those Heads of State.  There is a growing awareness or sense that to a degree the Taoiseach&rsquo;s international context is being overspun in order to give the impression of more radical action.  What the Taoiseach outlined in his reply does not amount to much.  I am surprised that in his calendar, even into June, there is no sense of a substantive bilateral encounter to take place with any of the major European leaders, in spite of the diplomatic initiative the Taoiseach stated he and the T&aacute;naiste were launching.   Since the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Berlin election stunt there has not been very much&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have a question, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the point I raise is important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must adhere to standards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have three questions on the matter and am trying to ascertain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="22"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to adhere to Standing Orders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is Question Time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach outline whether there are substantive bilateral discussions in the offing with President Sarkozy or Chancellor Merkel?  I do not mean talking on the margins, or on a bus.  The Minister for Finance meets Christine Lagarde on a bus and this becomes &ldquo;talks&rdquo; or a meeting.  We all know what happens on those bus trips from a meeting to a dinner; it is not substantive bilateral discussions on fundamental and profound issues such as the banking situation or the economic situation facing the country and the European response thereto.  That is my point.  There is a great deal of spinning and hype going on but it does not amount to a whole lot from what I can see or from what I hear in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Much of this is overplayed from other quarters.  I never made any overspin of this kind.  As I stated in my reply, I met both the Chancellor and the President at that meeting.  We have not made any arrangements for bilateral discussions to follow.  As the Deputy is aware, the Ministers for Finance continue to discuss and negotiate matters relevant to the IMF-EU bailout, as per the agreed position following the decision of the Heads of Government.  The diplomatic onslaught, as the Deputy terms it, is being followed through.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gilmore, called together all the EU ambassadors in Dublin and had a serious conversation with them.  That was followed by requests from the ambassadors of non-EU countries whom he then called together.  All Irish ambassadors, IDA and enterprise and employment personnel will be called back to the country in June for a serious discussion about programmes and plans to sell the message of our country and how we will rebuild relationships and demonstrate to other countries and public representatives we are serious in our resolve to sort out our country&rsquo;s problems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The T&aacute;naiste was in London yesterday, or perhaps Monday, and is to be in Paris tomorrow.  Ministers and Ministers of State who travel abroad on official business will be required to make contact with their counterparts in a meaningful and realistic way.  Other Heads of Government are busy, just as we are.  Our priority was to launch the jobs initiative and restore a sense of confidence.</P>
        <P>I will inform the House as and when such meetings are arranged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>May I ask a supplementary question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come back to the Deputy.  I call Deputy Adams.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I ask my question perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will give me some guidance.  There are a number of questions lumped together and I want to have a sense of what happens when that is the case because these questions are widely diverse.  What time is allowed to the Deputy who tables the question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated at the outset, the point of a supplementary question is to elucidate on the reply given.  If the Deputy is not happy with the reply given to the question tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty he is entitled to seek further information.  It is difficult for the Chair when questions are grouped which do not really follow, one on the other.  That is not a matter for me in this case but for the Taoiseach.  If Deputy Adams is representing Deputy Doherty I ask him to stick to the question as tabled.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="23"/>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for that advice.  This is something the Taoiseach should consider, in the interests of trying to arrive at clarity and information.  Sometimes it is difficult when totally different questions are grouped together.</P>
        <P>The national reform programme contains no specific 2020 poverty reduction targets.  Why is there no reference to that?  It repeats the existing targets for reduction of consistent poverty contained in the national action programme for social inclusion by 2016.  The deadline is not contained in the Government plan and the Government does not appear to have met or mentioned the guideline required by the Europe 2020 strategy.  There is no reference to those experiencing relative poverty or the growing number of people throughout the island, especially in this State, who are defined as working poor.</P>
        <P>My other question relates to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s future trips.  Does he plan to visit Palestine or Israel during his term of office and, if not, will he consider doing so?  The Taoiseach may wish to note and I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs has noted the agreement between the main political movements in Palestine.  It is a welcome development and offers up the hope of a negotiated settlement once again which recognises the rights of the Palestinian people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are straying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I am dealing with the question put to the Taoiseach to name the planned official trips he will undertake between now and the summer recess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a different issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the relative success of our own peace process and the awful plight of people now in the Middle East, if the Taoiseach were to visit Palestine and Israel it would be a very good signal, especially a visit to Gaza.  I was there myself and I know Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs was there and I commended him on that.  What he did was courageous.  I was there myself and stayed overnight for some time.  Dreadful repression has been endured there.  Ireland can help in what is a gloomy international situation with many difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy can take it that the T&aacute;naiste has a particular interest in seeing that the Middle East situation, in so far as Israel and Palestine are concerned, becomes more the focus of concentration of the European Union.  When I was on the other side of the House I brought several of my Deputies out to Israel and Gaza and I found the trip a revelation in many respects.  I had a long conversation and a fruitful meeting with John Ging, who, as the Deputy is aware, was working in Gaza.  This is a political issue that deserves concentration in so far as we, as a State and a member of the European Union, are concerned.  The Deputy can take it that the T&aacute;naiste will see to it, in so far as he can, that this receives a high level of priority.  I cannot say that I have any fixed intention of visiting there in the near future although, personally, I am keen to go back and review some of the issues we discussed before.  However, I assume the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has this high on his agenda as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the question I put on the absence of poverty reduction from the Government programme or plan?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a part of the programme set out for the Union.  I mentioned the five headline areas of employment, research and development, climate change, education and poverty.  In so far as the strategy is concerned, the programme for Government sets out the fact that the Government is fully committed to the 2020 strategy and the creation of employment in smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.</P><Col N="24"/>
        <P>Poverty is an issue that is part of the programme submitted and it is something about which we are concerned.  Those living close to or below the poverty line, of whom there are many, deserve the consideration of Government and we will give them whatever priority we can afford to encourage and bring them up the ladder of life opportunity.  The Department of the Taoiseach is responsible for co-ordinating the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s national reform programme with line Departments.  Deputy Adams may be assured that, in so far as this is one of the headline areas, we will see that it is promoted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have put down Questions Nos. 5 and 7 and I wish to follow up on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s earlier reply.  The Taoiseach said that reporters or the media hyped up some of the contexts.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s office issued a press release referring to the launch of a diplomatic offensive.  This is the context in which I put down the questions.  The Taoiseach has held only one substantive bilateral meeting since then.  We have all called in the EU ambassadors.  That is regular and does not constitute anything in terms of a diplomatic initiative.  That is part of the regular briefings with EU or non-EU ambassadors with whom I regularly interactively engaged when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I put it to the Taoiseach that this is normal practice.</P>
        <P>The bringing back of our own ambassadors is a regular occurrence as well and this took place long before the Taoiseach came into office.  Does the Taoiseach agree that none of this constitutes the diplomatic initiative that the Taoiseach and his office launched?  In essence there has been an over-hyping of the contacts.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer to Question No. 7, among the official trips up to June I see no substantive bilateral meeting with European leaders on the schedule.  It is important that this should happen.  Does the Taoiseach intend to lead any trade delegations in the coming six months as part of the official trips he plans to undertake during that period?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When I went to see Chancellor Merkel in the course of the general election campaign the Deputy said it was a photo opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Which it was, that was self-evident.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We held an important bilateral discussion about the issues of Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>You are damned if you do and you are damned if you do not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not share the Deputy&rsquo;s view.  While it might be regular to call back European Union ambassadors, non-EU ambassadors and our own ambassadors, it is important to be able to say and to remind them that a new Government is in charge with a new sense of priorities, a renewed enthusiasm and decisiveness to sort out the country&rsquo;s problems.  It is important for them to get the message out because, unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, things were not the way they should have been.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, we had evidence of Ministers not turning up at meetings in Brussels, departing quickly and not doing their job in the interests of the country as one would assume.  It is important to set out clearly the changed situations in the context of the diplomatic interaction or onslaught and to express to those people that we are serious in our resolve to deal with our country&rsquo;s problems, to explain the strategy of making decisions in respect of the larger issues such as the banks, the deficit, employment and so on and to show them that things <Col N="25"/>are not the way they were and that we have every intention of moving to a point where this country goes back up the ladder to be among the top five again.  This is the reason why the T&aacute;naiste has been so vigorous in following through what may be reasonably normal meetings but with a rather different and changed agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not decided on any individual trade delegation but I have had requests in respect of a visit to China.  I understand the Deputy was there as Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important element of Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to export.  The T&aacute;naiste, in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and trade promotion, will do this.  I have no fixed dates for any trade delegations but this will come into the reckoning before long and I will provide the Deputy with an update on them as they happen.  As the Deputy is aware, one cannot simply say any trade delegation will pay a visit to China.  The Chinese will make the arrangements in respect of suitable dates for their personnel over there.  As someone who was many years ago in the Department with responsibility for trade I realise the importance of particular trade delegations and how they can open doors for Irish potential to export to foreign markets and I support that strongly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Mac Lochlainn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I put a brief supplementary?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given you a fair run.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>They were my questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach will acknowledge that it will be rather difficult for us to deliver on the goals we set ourselves in the national reform plan while, at the same time, implementing the austerity programme from the EU, the IMF and the ECB.  The T&aacute;naiste has announced the diplomatic initiative.  Does that initiative involve engaging with the Governments of Greece, Portugal and, potentially, Spain on a counter-offensive to the narrative that exists in northern Europe that the bailout is a result of the recklessness of the peripheral economies when, in reality, the recklessness of major financial institutions in the core states being allowed by the ECB and IMF to lend banking institutions in the peripheral states was the cause of the crisis?  What engagements have taken place with those Governments?</P>
        <P>Have we considered an engagement with the 186 other member states in the IMF on its failure in oversight?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a separate question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>The two are clearly linked.  We must develop and defend our national interest by countering the erroneous narrative that the recklessness of peripheral European states caused the crisis when the failure of the IMF and ECB in their regulatory responsibilities caused it.  What have we done so far?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not really for this supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is linked to the meetings.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="26"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Anything can be linked.  This is Question Time.  We are trying to get answers for Deputies.  It is not a general debate.  That is what I am trying to get across.  I do not want to cut across the Deputy but I must be fair to everyone.  There are Deputies waiting for their questions to be answered.  We cannot have a general debate on the economy in response to a simple question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, I had a meeting with Prime Minister Papandreou before the meeting in Brussels where he sought support for an interest rate reduction and the difficulties faced by his country.  I also met with then Prime Minister Socrates in respect of the difficulties in Portugal.  Obviously these countries have problems that are different from ours.  We have a strategy in place and we are on target to meet it.  It is being monitored by the troika and I am glad to note the Exchequer returns indicate our tax drive is on target.  The Government&rsquo;s focus is now to follow through with job creation, stimulate the economy, create investment, provide opportunities for further exports and grow the economy.  That is how we must do this.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Supporting enterprise and providing a favourable climate for business start-ups and growth are key elements of the Government&rsquo;s strategy for supporting enterprise and growing employment.  The jobs initiative announced yesterday contained a number of measures to assist enterprises in creating and retaining jobs.  As Head of Government, I have met a number of senior business executives from a range of sectors including manufacturing at domestic events and also during my recent international visits to London, New York and Washington.</P>
        <P>I will continue to support the development and implementation of enterprise policy in a variety of ways including through engaging with the business community at home and on international visits and meeting with potential investors where appropriate.  However, these and other aspects of enterprise policy are primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation.  As such, any questions on these issues, including future parliamentary questions, should be addressed to him.</P>
        <P>I also intend to meet with the representative groups under social partnership, including business representatives, in due course to outline the Government&rsquo;s approach to dealing with our current economic challenges and to explore how their activities can enhance economic and social progress.  These meetings have not yet been scheduled.  However, I believe that social dialogue can and should continue to take place through the different structures in place across Departments as we implement the programme for Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that but I have two questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but it is a simple question: has the Taoiseach engaged with manufacturing industry, yes or no?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle has interrupted before I even finished the sentence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand how important this is to the Deputy but he must be reasonable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be reasonable but I must give the basis to the question.  I have noted how the Government has quickly latched on to those elements that are doing very well but has the Taoiseach met the representative bodies for the manufacturing sector or with companies such as Boston Scientific, Hewlett Packard and Intel?  Has he garnered anything from them about the needs of the manufacturing sector in terms of confidence, growth and development so we can attract more inward investment?  I am not asking any other Minister; I am asking the Taoiseach what is needed to secure investment from the manufacturing sector in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>From the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response and the comments that have been made around the jobs initiative, with the Minister, Deputy Howlin, making the same points on radio this morning, I do not doubt that he is concerned about dealing with the jobs issue, as is everyone.  There is, however, a significant difference of opinion about how to do that.  Much of the emphasis in terms of who the Taoiseach is talking to and who is advising him is very much to one side of the economic perspective.  My question is about the extent to which the Taoiseach will engage with workers, civil society groups and academics who are suggesting that we are moving in precisely the wrong direction to deal with the jobs crisis.  That opens debates about the IMF programme.  Is there a willingness to engage seriously in new forums in this Chamber and externally in terms of who the Taoiseach meets and talks to, particularly those who have a different perspective on how to deal with the situation and who feel the current path is unsustainable and will not work?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Boyd Barrett seems to think he is the only person who meets workers and real people.  I do that on a regular basis and I can testify that the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation has met a range of manufacturing industry representatives.  I have met with a number of senior figures from firms throughout the country.  I have not met with industry blocs but I have asked the Department to see if we can get an appropriate time to meet with groups of chief executives to discuss that issue.</P>
      
        <P>Deputy Boyd Barrett talks about the range of opinions and asks when I will consult with workers.  The jobs initiative yesterday is specifically about the unemployed, those who were workers and who want to be workers.  The academics at the other end may well have the view that we can jolt the economy by getting rid of the budget deficit in one year.  I do not want to give the economy a lethal injection like that.  People are entitled to their views and can write reports and articles but on this side of the House we must deal with real people and their lives and make decisions that affect the country; that is what we intend to do.</P><Col N="28"/>
        <P>It is a constant process of meeting workers and real people and those who have ideas about how to improve the situation.  If the Deputy has any worthwhile proposals about job creation, I would like to hear them.  Some of the proposals I have heard in the last month, however, would certainly not help this country.</P>

    <Title>Jobs Initiative 2011: Statements (Resumed)</Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Minister without Portfolio (Deputy  Brendan Howlin)</NameTxt>
	<P>The jobs initiative announced yesterday is a clear statement that the new Government has a new approach to the economic crisis.  This jobs package demonstrates the new Government has done more in two months to promote employment and economic recovery than the previous Government did in two years.  Despite the very real fiscal constraints we have inherited, we have produced a package of measures of more than &euro;1.8 billion.  More important, we have made it clear that from now on, dealing with the jobs crisis is and will be the central component of economic strategy.</P>
        <P>Unemployment is not a matter of statistics.  The unemployed are our neighbours, our children and our friends.  They are people who want nothing more than the opportunity to work in their own country, provide for their families and just to get on building their lives.  This Government is determined to do everything it can to provide our people with those opportunities.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The task we face is difficult.  We are experiencing the consequences of a very severe recession in which GDP has fallen by 12% between 2007 and 2010.  The labour market has been subject to a profound shock.  Employment is down by 300,000 and unemployment is over 14%.  Many sectors of the economy have experienced job losses, including the construction sector which has lost more than 160,000 jobs, and the wholesale and retail sectors are down by almost 45,000.  Employment in industry is also down by approximately 50,000.  We can recover some of these employment losses if we can get credit flowing again and if we improve confidence in the economy.  We can achieve higher rates of economic growth through export-led expansion.  The key goal of this jobs initiative is to give people that confidence to believe that Ireland can and will recover and that we, all of us, can have a brighter, more prosperous future.  This will not be done overnight.  This is why the Government did not wish to talk-up yesterday&rsquo;s announcement.  There is no package of measures or set of announcements that will put all our people back to work at the stroke of a pen even though I wish this were the case.  The task is great, but so too is the determination of this Government.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative announced yesterday by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, launched a range of taxation and expenditure measures which are designed to help to get people back to work.  The expenditure measures are, in the main, funded by a reallocation of resources towards areas that are more productive and worthwhile from an economic perspective and which, above all, are labour-intensive.  The vast majority of these measures are to be funded through the prioritisation of existing resources, with additional total expenditure of &euro;40 million in 2011, funded through the levy on pension funds announced yesterday by the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>It is a fact that employment in some sectors of our economy will never again reach the inflated heights of the boom years, most notably in the construction industry.  Other sectors have also seen a decline in employment opportunities due to changes in both the global and domestic economies.  We have to meet these challenges with solutions that reflect the economy as it will be and as we want it to be, rather than how it was.  That means giving people the skills they need to take advantage of the kinds of jobs that are being created now.  This is the reason for our focus on training.  We have prioritised and revamped our labour activation policy.</P><Col N="29"/>
        <P>The Government is determined to help those who are unemployed to avail of job opportunities as they arise and as our economic circumstances improve, as improve they will.  The labour market activation measures announced yesterday will ensure that those people who are now out of work are given the opportunity to maintain and improve their skills and experience to take best advantage of future and current employment opportunities.  An additional 20,900 places will be made available for training, education and upskilling under this programme.  The sheer number of unemployed means that we must invest in the development of a more comprehensive and effective labour market activation strategy, one that strengthens the links between receiving benefits, searching for a job and participating in employment and training programmes.  We need to have these aspects joined up .  A smarter, more integrated approach to labour market activation can stimulate the pace and influence the nature of the outflow from the live register.  Such policies assist and encourage jobseekers back into work.  They should range from relatively light interventions, such as job search assistance and monitoring, to more intensive measures such as training and education intervention and work placement initiatives.  Our labour market activation policy needs to be re-invigorated to provide the full range of interventions that are now required to address the issue of unemployment.</P>
        <P>More effective, regular and deeper interaction with unemployed individuals is required.  The Department of Social Protection is putting measures in place to re-invigorate the national employment action plan, making it fit for purpose.</P>

	<P>Order, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is further developing the pathways to employment programme which will provide interaction with each unemployed individual at clear milestones. The <Col N="30"/>Department of Social Protection is doing important work which will underpin this enhanced approach to activation.  It is developing a profiling system which will allow for a ranking of jobseeker claimants according to their probability of long-term unemployment and which provides the capacity to target resources to those who both need and can benefit from such activation measures.</P>
        <P>It is essential to focus on cost-effective programmes and those programmes targeting the most disadvantaged groups and those most at risk of losing contact with the labour market.  A worrying feature of the live register profile is the number of people who have lost skilled jobs in areas such as the construction sector because there will be no demand for their skills in the foreseeable future.  We will not see high volumes of employment in the construction industry in the foreseeable future.  This is the reason some specific measures, such as additional places on the back to education initiative and other specific skills training measures, are being targeted at adults with less than leaving certificate qualifications.  It is an unfortunate outcome of the so-called economic boom that many young people, young males in particular, left school early to take up relatively unskilled employment in the construction sector.  They need specific interventions to prepare them for other work opportunities that will become available in other sectors.  If we are to support job creation, it is vital that we reduce the cost to employers of taking on new employees.  The lower rate of employer PRSI on jobs that pay up to &euro;356 per week will be halved from July this year until the end of 2013.  Employers can generate new jobs only if they have the right incentives and the cash to invest in the growth of their businesses.  As part of the jobs initiative, the Government will ensure employers are given greater access to credit and will support small and medium-sized enterprises by initiating a tendering process for the development of a temporary partial credit guarantee scheme.  We need to get money into such enterprises.  We will promote greater access to procurement opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises.  If we can open the procurement system to more Irish companies, we can do a great deal.  The Government intends to initiate a microfinance start-up fund to provide loans for small businesses.</P>
        <P>We need to support specific sectors such as tourism.  This critical sector is partially export-orientated because money that comes to Ireland from overseas is as good as money from the sale of Irish goods in other countries.  Tourism provides employment across all regions and skill levels.  Accordingly, yesterday&rsquo;s jobs initiative announcement placed a significant focus on measures that would be targeted at stimulating the tourism sector.  The second rate of VAT will be temporarily reduced to 9%, with effect from 1 July until the end of December 2013.  It will apply primarily to restaurants, catering services, hotels, holiday accommodation and various entertainment venues.  Deputy Mick Wallace will be interested to hear that when I spoke to my local radio station this morning, I learned that this measure had been warmly welcomed by the tourism sector in the county.  It will be welcomed across the country.  The air travel tax rate is to be reduced to zero on a date to be fixed by order, subject to agreement being reached with the airlines to bring more passengers to Ireland.  We have invested millions of euro in our very good tourism product because we need people to come here.  We can facilitate this by making it affordable and breaking down the barriers to access.  Later today the Minister for Justice and Equality will announce an important reform to the visa application system for entry into Ireland which will make it much easier for overseas visitors to come here.</P>
        <P>As well as providing direct employment, well targeted public infrastructural investment can stimulate economic activity and have a significant indirect job creation impact in the medium term.  In this regard, a number of changes to the capital envelope were announced yesterday.  An additional &euro;30 million will be made available for school works this year, predominantly under what used to be called the summer works programme.  Some &euro;20 million will be reallo<Col N="31"/>cated from the existing budget of the Department of Education and Skills and an additional &euro;10 million will be funded from the levy on pension schemes.  An additional &euro;60 million will be invested in regional and local roads.  Those who travelled throughout rural Ireland during the recent general election campaign will be aware of the need for extra money for county roads.  An additional &euro;15 million will be spent on local sustainable transport projects such as cycle lanes, pedestrian routes and park and ride facilities.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;30 million will be invested in the national energy retrofitting programme, with &euro;19 million being funded through the levy on pensions and &euro;11 million being sourced from the existing allocation of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It is hoped the retrofit project will not be a short-term one.  In the context of the comprehensive spending review, we will work on seeing how this important investment which is reasonably job-rich can be rolled out into the future.  A further two bundles of public private partnership schools will be commenced in areas in which additional infrastructure is required beyond 2016.  The aim of this approach is to make the impact of these measures last for as long as possible.  When taken together, these measures will generate employment-intensive economic activity throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The importance of immediate action to stimulate the labour market should not overshadow the need for structural improvements that will yield benefits in the longer term.  I recognise that innovation and education are central to our longer term future.  Therefore, I am announcing a relaxation of the numbers ceiling that applies to non-Exchequer funded posts in the higher education sector.  The numbers ceiling provided for in the last economic control framework for that sector allows for a modest increase in the number of specialist posts that can be funded by third parties, as long as the posts in question are funded on a full recovery basis, including a 20% charge on the deferred pay costs associated with future pension entitlements.  This applies regardless of whether the third party funder is an Exchequer agency or a non-Exchequer funder such as the European Union or private industry.  It represents a significant concession at a time when public sector numbers generally must be reduced, as everybody knows.  In order to facilitate the maximum possible employment creation potential of the third level sector, while encouraging institutions to seek to diversify their sources of funding, I propose to allow even greater freedom for institutions to recruit researchers and other specialist staff where this does not involve any cost for the Exchequer, including the deferred pension cost.  Accordingly, I am announcing the removal of the ceiling on the number of non-Exchequer funded specialist posts that may be created in higher education institutions, as long as they are funded on a full recovery cost basis.  It is envisaged that similar arrangements will apply to contract posts involved in research activity in non-commercial State agencies.</P>
        <P>It has been brought to my attention that the new system for costing research projects on a full cost recovery basis, including deferred pension cost, is posing difficulties for some project proposals already in the pipeline.  I refer to proposals that were well advanced when the new arrangements were introduced earlier this year and that had already been submitted and agreed or substantively agreed.  To avoid the delays or financing difficulties that would be associated with having to reopen the issue of funding for such projects, I am proposing to introduce transitional arrangements for well advanced proposals in the pipeline.  They will be permitted to continue to proceed under the old arrangements.  In other words, the requirement to include a 20% pension charge will not apply in such cases already in the pipeline.  Any requirement to fill staff vacancies that might arise during the lifetime of projects approved under the transitional arrangements, or projects already in train, will be able to be met under the old arrangements for the remaining duration of the project.</P>
        <P>The measures I have outlined will not rejuvenate the economy or the jobs market overnight.  The jobs initiative is simply the first step in ensuring we make the best use of our resources <Col N="32"/>and deliver real change for the taxpayer.  The aim of reforming the public service to deliver better results without additional resources &mdash; we do not have such resources and are not likely to have them in the immediate future &mdash; is the driving concept behind the comprehensive review of expenditure and the capital review.  In both reviews, I am determined that we will realign public expenditure and investment in order that they support an economy driven by knowledge, which focuses on exports and can support employment and higher living standards for all our people.  Both processes are under way, as Deputies are aware.  They will involve a root and branch evaluation of the expenditure of all Departments and bodies within each departmental remit.  This is at the heart of the project spelled out in the programme for Government which will last from 2011 to 2016.</P>
        <P>As a nation, we are facing some difficult years.  Savings will have to be secured in all areas of public activity and resources will have to be redirected to core priority areas.  There is no scope for wasteful expenditure, lax management or the preservation of old priorities just because they happen to be embedded in old spending lines.  For that reason, the important comprehensive spending review under way is a cornerstone of Government policy.  I have been involved in the process of meeting these objectives.  I have met Secretaries General and spoken to managers and representatives of workers.  People understand the importance of achieving all the objectives set out in the comprehensive spending plan, on both the current and capital sides.  It is not business as usual.  We will find a transformational way of getting better value and flexibility within the public service into the future.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Government delivered on its promise to bring forward an immediate jobs initiative.  The initiative is intended to restore confidence among consumers and investors.  By boosting activity where we can and ensuring extra activity is spread geographically across the country, we are seeking to encourage people to have confidence again and begin to spend more in the economy.  This is not the Government&rsquo;s last word on jobs.  It is only a beginning and there is more to do but we are starting as we mean to go on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative.  I extend best wishes to the Minister without Portfolio, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in his new job.  I know he will use to good effect the Croke Park agreement with which the Labour Party agreed and the Fine Gael Party disagreed.  The agreement provides flexibility and is the bedrock on which we can transform the public service.</P>
        <P>I have never accepted the view that public servants are generally inefficient or unwilling to work.  While I fully recognise the need for radical change to the way the public service works, anyone who believes it can operate on the same system as the private sector has clearly not worked in both sectors.  The norms and requirements in terms of information and justification of public sector decisions are completely different from requirements in the private sector.</P>
        <P>During my time as Minister for Social Protection, I observed a change in attitude.  For example, in March 2010 the previous Government announced that we intended to break up and move F&Aacute;S.  By the end of the year, we had secured a comprehensive service level agreement between the Department and F&Aacute;S in which the latter agreed, in principle, to come within the remit of the Department again.  In the same period we managed to integrate the community welfare office service into the Department of Social Protection, thus achieving an objective that had been sought for many years.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well in implementing the Croke Park agreement and ensuring we obtain from it the maximum benefits for public servants and citizens.  I also wish him well with his expenditure review.  During my time in government I went through all the Estimates in my Department, including in the years before the hard times arrived, seeking ways to refocus <Col N="33"/>expenditure.  There are two types of waste &mdash; that which can be saved and that which cannot be saved &mdash; and it is the latter which breaks one&rsquo;s heart.  The Minister will find that the figures on proposed savings which were bandied about when the Government parties were in opposition &mdash; I refer in particular to those cited by the Fine Gael Party spokesperson on health at the time &mdash; will not be easily realised.  I will watch with interest what the Minister does in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">No one could argue with some of the elements in yesterday&rsquo;s jobs initiative.  For example, the changes made on VAT and measures to stimulate tourism are positive and I am big enough to recognise that is the case.  However, when I compare the initiative with the promises made by the Government parties while in opposition I am reminded of the answer given by a person who had previously held an important position when asked if he was busy in a new post.  He stated: &ldquo;I am busy, ach ruda&iacute; beaga&rdquo;, in other words, the little things.  The jobs strategy brings to mind this reply in that it has good elements but they are all ruda&iacute; beaga and a far cry from what the Opposition told us it would be able to achieve if it got into government.  Where, for example, is the investment bank which was to be funded by &euro;2 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and a further &euro;18 billion to be plucked from the air?  To where did this &euro;20 billion investment bank and the 100,000 jobs promised by the Fine Gael Party disappear?  None of this is mentioned in the jobs initiative.  However, b&iacute;onn gach t&uacute;s lag &mdash; every beginning is weak &mdash; and I welcome the positive elements of the initiative.</P>
        <P>I propose to address a number of specific issues in the statement made by the Minister for Finance.  I am mesmerised with the Government&rsquo;s recycling of measures that were already in train.  While I knew the Green Party was keen on recycling, it now emerges that Fine Gael and the Labour Party are even more enthusiastic about it.  The Government states it will create 20,000 jobs through job activation measures and establish a new employment action programme.  As Minister for Social Protection in the previous Government, I had all these measures in train.  Before Christmas, we announced 13,000 activation places in the budget, of which 5,000 were in the T&uacute;s programme.  In reply to a parliamentary question I asked the Minister for Social Protection last night, she indicated that only 1,000 of these jobs would be in place by the end of the first half of this year.  This means 4,000 positions that we had created and which were linked to the employment action programme will not be filled.</P>
        <P>The Government also announced a national internship scheme in the private and public sectors.  I remember this scheme being announced in the previous budget.  It has not been implemented and I understand the Government may be making improvements in the area of bureaucracy, which is welcome given that I fought to keep the scheme simple.  Nevertheless, it is not a new scheme.  I changed legislation at Christmas in three areas, namely, labour, employment and social welfare law, to facilitate the scheme.  We proposed to allow employers pay employees &euro;100 per week under the scheme, a figure the Government has reduced to &euro;50.  There is, therefore, nothing new here.  It is time the Government got on with the job and created the positions the previous Government put in train before Christmas by passing laws which the current Government parties opposed at the time but have since implemented.</P>
        <P>I was actively engaged in reforming the employment action programme.  This is a simple matter of calling in for interview every person who has been unemployed for one year and offering him or her either a job or place on a scheme or a place on a training or education course.  The Government is moving at a slow pace in this regard.  As I stated, the proposed measures were ready-made because the building blocks were in place and pilot schemes were up and running.  The Minister for Social Protection also referred to this in reply to a question I asked her yesterday.  There is no question, therefore, that the schemes were in place.</P><Col N="34"/>
        <P>I propose to discuss the source of funding for the jobs initiative.  The Government&rsquo;s proposal to levy the pension funds is incredible.  As a former Minister for Social Protection with responsibility for pensions, I was cognisant of two significant concerns in this respect.  The Government was worried about the decrease in the value of pension funds and the pressure this was placing on them.  In recent years, 90% of pensions were underfunded and the previous Government was forced to give extension after extension to defined benefit schemes to try to ensure the commitments entered into could be fulfilled.  While 0.6% may appear to be a small figure, when one considers that pension funds returns are less than 2% per annum, it represents a significant amount of the money a person would gain each year on his or her pension fund.  In recent years, some pension funds have been in decline and their policyholders would have been better putting money under their mattresses.</P>
        <P>The previous Government adopted a pension strategy to encourage more people with modest means to invest in pension funds.  There was an agreed value system that, as our population ages, we should encourage people to have private pensions over and above the State pension.  The Government has undermined this approach.  I recall giving an extension of time to defined benefit plans to produce viable solutions as to how they would fund pensions in future.</P>
        <P>However, the sector that is in huge trouble now is being attacked by the Government.  No matter how one looks at it, essentially the Government is taking &euro;2 billion out of the pension funds.  While some might put a spin on this measure to the effect that it is an attack on big pension fund owners, that was done by Fianna F&aacute;il when in Government by proposing to reduce, over the four year plan, the amount of tax relief people may receive by investing in pension funds, by placing severe caps on the amount one can put into a pension fund and by imposing a heavy tax once a pension pot goes over a certain amount.  The Government is hitting those ordinary people who had been encouraged to put money into pension funds.</P>
        <P>I have heard an argument that the idea behind this proposal is that pension funds are invested abroad, which is largely true.  At Christmas, however, the previous Government brought in legislation with the intention of setting up sovereign annuities in February.  Basically, we were coming up with a win-win scenario that would have brought &euro;4 billion of pension funds into the Irish economy and Exchequer in replacement of foreign borrowing on a 35-year basis.  It would have involved twice the amount of money under discussion here and the interest rate would have been similar to that which Ireland is paying for loans at present anyway.  There would have been a double win in that Irish people&rsquo;s money would have been kept in the country and rather than buying German bonds and the Government would have been paying a high interest rate to its own people.  As they then would have spent it, the Government would have got tax back in a circle.  The former Government was creating a virtuous circle that had the potential to bring in &euro;4 billion according to the estimates I was given by the NTMA and the Department of Finance.  However, instead of helping pension funds, the Government is penalising them and instead of bringing in &euro;4 billion, it has come up with a way of bringing in &euro;2 billion, which is bizarre.</P>
        <P>Did the Government consult the Pensions Board about this issue or ask it about the health of such funds?  Did it even consult the Minister for Social Protection?  Did she not warn the Government about the perilous position in which many Irish pension funds find themselves or of the drastic measures that had to be taken by the Government, the Oireachtas and the Pensions Board to try to deal with the pension issue?  Ultimately, the Government is hitting the ordinary people who have saved money over 20 or 30 years to have a small amount of money over and above their State pension on which to live in their twilight years.</P><Col N="35"/>
        <P>While there are so many points one could make in this regard, I will now turn to the moving around of money in the Estimates.  Basically, I understand what the Government is doing as my colleagues and I did it all the time when in office.  However, we did not come into the Chamber to announce it as a budget initiative but just did it.  In other words, in the event of a project not proceeding as fast as one thought it would or of an underspend in one subhead, one moved the funds into another subhead.  For example, the Government has stated it will get &euro;20 million from the budget of the Department of Education and Skills and will put it into the summer work scheme.  I have no argument about this and it is a fantastic scheme that was established by Fianna F&aacute;il.  However, did this &euro;20 million come from specific projects that had been announced but which will not go ahead or is it available because of a slowing down in the progress of such projects whereby the money happened to come to hand?</P>
        <P>If specific projects will not now go ahead on foot of a conscious decision, rather than unforeseen delays leading to the money being surplus to the requirements of the committed projects for this year, in the interests of transparency and openness the Government should tell Members what are those projects.  The people who have been promised them should be told what projects will not go ahead.  Similarly, there is a so-called saving on road projects and money is being moved from bigger projects into maintenance.  Is this because some of the major projects, such as those involving PPPs for example, are delayed and the Government is recycling the money?  The Government would have done this anyway and there was no need for a big announcement as anyone running a Department with a bit of common sense would have done so as part of its daily management.  Alternatively, has the Government decided to pull the plug on specific projects and if so, what projects?  It is time the Government lived up to its promise to be open, transparent and clear in what it intended to do.</P>
        <P>I refer to one sector of the economy about which I used to argue with my colleagues in Government and about which some progress had been made.  Despite all the emphasis on tourism, the Government has not focused on this point but I was advised that 3,000 real jobs could be created in our economy by investing in rural recreation in all its many manifestations.  It ranges from people walking around bogs to look at bog cotton to people abseiling, mountain cycling or walking or whatever because we happen to live in a country which, given its topography, probably has one of the greatest varieties of possibilities.</P>
        <P>Another source of jobs that could be spread around the country based on natural resources is marine leisure, which is completely underdeveloped in Ireland.  I believe that a modest investment, matched by private sector investment with proper planning, could create sustainable jobs that would bring in tourists who would continue to return here because of the available facilities and who would stay here for fixed periods rather than for short weekend breaks.  Such tourism, based on quality products, is likely to be much more resilient in downturns than the other type of tourism involving people looking at the scenery and generally coming here for non-specific purposes.</P>
        <P>There are all sorts of measures one can take and the sky is the limit in this sector.  For example, one activity I had never considered but which now takes place in the west is descending into the deep river and mountain ravines.  In addition, there are all the land-based activities such as mountain climbing, hill walking and so on.  The previous Government had done quite a bit of work in resolving the issues with the farmers and there is now a completely different attitude on the ground on foot of the establishment of Comhairle na Tuaithe.  Yesterday, I met a former Member of this House, Mr. Roger Garland, who told me that nothing is happening at present regarding this sector&rsquo;s development compared with what was happening when I was Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, when we did so much work to resolve the outstanding issues in order that the land mass could be used in a positive manner to increase the employment potential and wealth generation for those living throughout the <Col N="36"/>countryside.  Moreover, much of this can be done anywhere, from urban areas such as Dublin Bay to the most rural areas in the countryside.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, mar dhuine Gaeltachta, t&aacute; iontas orm nach bhfuil aon airgead breise curtha ar f&aacute;il d&rsquo;&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.

	<P>With the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rsquo;s permission, I wish to share time with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister taking ten minutes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, please.  I have listened to the former Minister, who is leaving the Chamber.  It strikes me as bizarre that Fianna F&aacute;il appears to have wonderful ideas and superior ways of doing things than the current Government, yet had 14 years in which to do them and does not seem to have surfaced with its own ideas.  Fianna F&aacute;il speakers have not uttered a word about the disastrous policy mistakes that have brought the country to its knees.  From peak to trough, national income fell by 26% under Fianna F&aacute;il and 20% of all people in the private sector lost their jobs.  The vast majority of the 20% were young people.  As such, it <Col N="37"/>is difficult to take lectures from former Ministers about the follies of our ways when the evidence of their failed policies is there for all to see.</P>
        <P>It will take some time before we remedy the problems, but the significance of yesterday&rsquo;s announcement was that it represented a decisive change of direction.  I have been listening in the Chamber to people who are craving a large number for jobs or a massive spending stimulus almost as if we could produce a rabbit out of a hat.  Unfortunately, this notion is a legacy of the sort of thinking that got us into this hole.  Believing that we can dip into our spending somewhere and turn it into X, Y and Z jobs is not the way a modern economy works.  The sort of thinking we need is, for example, a consideration of the rate of return on our investment.</P>
        <P>This shift in opinion is what makes yesterday&rsquo;s announcement so refreshing.  It represents a decisive change of direction.  Unlike the previous Government, we are no longer discussing how to nurse along the banking failures of the past, the failed developers and the ghost estates.  Instead, we are discussing what to do about small businesses that can create something, how to give them partial loan guarantees, how to give them access to finance and how to get them on the road to creating something.  No one on the Opposition benches is willing to pick up on this decisive change.  It is not a question of closing programmes and cutting off recruitment, which we have often seen in recent years.  Rather, it is a question of trying to open up some doors.  Some of the provisions are modest, but the changes in direction are significant.  More important, the provisions have in mind enterprises that can create something for us at home.</P>
        <P>This is a short-term package.  We are not even nine weeks in government, but this initiative is a clear direction as to the new type of thinking and transformative change that will occur.  If we are to crack the problem, the Government will need to transform right across the board.  The comprehensive spending reviews and the establishment of a public service reform Department are all about showing that how we did things previously is not good enough for the future.  Transformative change will not only be required in the private sector and in its capacity to create jobs and a strong engine of economic growth from indigenous ingenuity and talent, but also in the public service, which must use ingenuity, reduce costs imposed on business and deliver good services with fewer resources.</P>
        <P>A decisive change is under way, but too much of the language in the debate to date has been the language of the past, for example, &ldquo;Count the jobs&rdquo;.  Governments do not create jobs.  Enterprises that find new markets, break into export sectors and become more competitive through their innovations create jobs, and we want to stimulate them.  Every measure chosen for this budget was designed to help with the jobs challenge.  Much of the budget is concerned with giving young talent the chance to influence the growth of jobs.  For this reason, the internship programme is important.  More than 150 companies have indicated to me their willingness to support it.  It is positive that we can get quality companies that are exporting to take on young talent.  The situation could then develop, as those people, who could be the entrepreneurs of the future, are getting relevant experience.</P>
        <P>We want to adapt people&rsquo;s skills.  Some people invested their talents in the construction sector, but it will not yield the same returns seen previously.  We must reskill those people.  A strong theme in this announcement is that we must support those who are in a position to start businesses.  We must help people to win new markets.  I am looking within my Department to determine how we can improve programmes to help Irish businesses to access new markets.  It is depressing that 90% of our exports come from foreign-owned companies.  This is a statistic we can change and it is gratifying that, according to recent figures, Irish-owned businesses are leading the charge and making significant progress.  Last year&rsquo;s export figures were the best in a decade, with Ireland regaining market share lost during that period.  We must build on and support this significant development.</P><Col N="38"/>
        <P>However, such a change has not occurred in the tourism sector.  For this reason, much of yesterday&rsquo;s announcement focused on how to make tourism a performing sector.  These tax changes &mdash; a 4.5% cut in the product price of many of our offerings to tourists and a 4.25% reduction in much of the wage bill in the sector &mdash; are significant and constitute the Government making survival easier for businesses.  The sector is labour-intensive, with a 30% to 35% labour content in its activities.  This announcement makes a difference and has the potential to create positive spin-offs.  As the Minister stated yesterday, we want the airlines to respond to the changes and the price advantages to be passed on.  It is a genuine way to make the sector more competitive so as to reverse the trend of a 25% decrease in tourist numbers.</P>
        <P>We need to be innovative in the way we exploit opportunities in new markets.  I am delighted that an idea generated by the private sector is being imported into Government thinking, namely, a finder&rsquo;s fee for people who find investors willing to invest in Ireland.  This new thinking is outside the box, so why should we not do it?  The Government will take good ideas from anywhere.  We will reform the visa system to make investment easier.  It is crazy that an investor from India, one of the world&rsquo;s most rapidly growing economies, or China can visit the UK but cannot then continue on to Ireland because he or she would need a second visa.  We are changing this situation.  Investors considering the UK can investigate Ireland on the same visa.  It is an obvious and simple measure, but one that has not been taken until now.  We must consider the simple ideas and rely on being smart instead of on large spending programmes.</P>
        <P>We can support enterprise.  One of the key themes in the announcement is that of reducing costs for employers, such as halving the cost of PRSI in respect of 600,000 workers.  We will follow this significant easing with a radical overhaul of the system for wage fixing in many sectors.  We will open access to finance, but not only by way of the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s decisive banking resolution.  We will create banks that will be well capitalised and have low loan-to-deposit ratios.  They will be in a position to lend an estimated &euro;12 billion per year.  In addition, we recognise that some businesses simply will not be on the radar.  A risk-averse banking system will not give succour to some businesses which really need funds to make progress.</P>
        <P>We can be innovative in other ways, including in public service procurement.  If even 1% more went to Irish businesses, that would represent &euro;150 million.  Other countries have blazed a trail in finding ways by which innovative small companies can get involved in public procurement.  We want to model a system that is equally responsive.</P>
        <P>Of course, this is just a start.  There are other areas in which Government decisions and investment are important, including the infrastructure bank and the NewERA project.  These are other opportunities for us to invest wisely in infrastructure that will make it easier for businesses to create jobs and we are working on them.  It is important for the Government to put down a marker stating this is a decisive change in policy.  It is not all about solving the problems of the banks and fixing the public finances.  It is also about giving people a chance to create a strong and vibrant economy.  I accept that it would be nicer if we did not have to ask pension funds to contribute, but if we do not ensure we have a strong economy, producing growth and creating jobs, we will not be able to meet our pension commitments.  The best way of meeting pension commitments in the long term is to have a vibrant economy.  That must be our priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The most positive aspect of yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for Finance to the House was his honest assessment that this was a modest proposal.  The Government is not making extravagant claims about the number of jobs that will be created under this initiative.  We are being honest and <Col N="39"/>up-front with the public.  As the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, said, the future of the economy will not be based on grandiose plans, of which we have seen far too many in the last ten years, with extravagant claims that 50,000 jobs will be created here or 80,000 jobs there.  The public do not believe this.  We must get down to the task of restructuring the economy and getting people back to work through a series of measures that can make a difference.</P>
        <P>The Opposition has known about this announcement since the programme for Government was first published and presented to the House.  I recall the Minister for Finance and others at that stage asking Opposition Members to submit ideas to the Government on how they would do things differently.  I recall deliberate opportunities given to the Opposition to provide submissions, as in the normal budgetary process, but we did not get any.  I find it astonishing that the two largest Opposition parties did not submit proposals to the Government about a jobs initiative.  Either we are serious about this or we are not.  We can pretend to play Punch and Judy politics and have all the commentary that goes with this, or we can concentrate on the job in hand.  It is unbelievable the Opposition parties did not submit proposals when they knew the Government was going to introduce an initiative in the first 100 days.  The Opposition needs to be clear about this.  It is a question of confidence.  We are trying, slowly but surely, to return to the job-rich growth that occurred in the economy, particularly from 1995 to 2002 &mdash; that golden period when we were leading the way and creating jobs across the economy, especially in small enterprises.  What happened after 2002, as we all know, was that the property boom took off and many of the jobs created in construction were unsustainable in the long term.</P>
        <P>We have had successes in the first few weeks of the Government.  As promised, we have raised the national minimum wage by agreement.  Importantly, the next tranche of loans of &euro;20 million or less that were to be given to NAMA were not transferred because of the agreement we sought.  We have obtained agreement from our international partners on this series of measures because they recognise that the future must be based on job-rich growth.  The Government is continuing to work with our EU colleagues in attempting to achieve a reduction in the interest rate on the EU portion of the loan.</P>
        <P>We recognise that the only way forward for the economy is to get the banking system working again.  The management and directors of the two pillar banks have a fundamental responsibility to get their hands dirty, to get on the floor and realise what goes on at branch level, in order that they can better understand their business.  When restructuring occurred in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s, at the height of the recession there, those who ran the banks were obliged, for the first time, to get onto the floor and learn about what was going on.  Our banks must learn about pubs and ordinary businesses.  They must go back to traditional banking methods.  This is an essential part of the restructuring process that the Government is driving.</P>
        <P>The other part of the restructuring process is something that was referred to yesterday in the House by the Minister.  A commitment was given by the banks to invest &euro;30 billion in the economy in the next three years, including &euro;20 billion in the SME sector.  This must be driven politically.  We need to find out on a month by month, quarter by quarter, sector by sector basis whether it is happening.  That is the challenge for the Government, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank: to make sure the essentials of that restructuring &mdash; getting money out, through the banks, as the best way of improving the economy &mdash; actually occur.</P>
        <P>There is an orgy of negativity and the people want to move on.  They want to get back to a path of growth.  We see growth re-emerging this year after three years.  We still have 1.8 million at work in the economy.  Although it is crucial to increase the number of jobs, we also have a plan to retain every single one of these jobs by making sure the economic environment is right.  As the Minister said, we saw exports rise by 9% last year.  We are in a good position in terms <Col N="40"/>of the balance of payments; we are paying our way in the world again.  It is through such slow, deliberate, step by step, brick by brick confidence-building measures that we can get the economy working again.  Within the banking system, there is &euro;96 billion in ordinary deposits.  There is no confidence to spend because, although the export sector is doing well, the domestic economy is lagging far behind.  The trick is to ensure confidence rises again in order that people will start spending because that money is still there.  At the heart of the announcement made by the Minister yesterday is confidence that we can create new jobs by adjusting taxes on the PRSI and VAT sides, particularly in tourism.  These are focused measures that can deliver the confidence we need.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>With regard to the pension levy, it is worth pointing out that at the last count, the amount of money invested by the taxpayer through tax forgone in pension reliefs was about &euro;3 billion, compared to about &euro;450 million in property reliefs.  Understandably, the taxpayer has provided enormous benefits for those who put their money aside, up to a marginal rate of 40%.  What the Government is looking for is a figure of 0.6%, in a context in which, on an annualised basis, the management fees for many of these funds run to more than 1.5%.  This is not a huge levy.  It is a temporary measure to ensure we will have some funds to contribute to growth in the economy.  It is well tested and will provide the funds needed to help reboot the economy.  The Minister wants to speak with representatives of the pensions industry to work out the details, but he is absolutely convinced, as we said before the general election, that this is a measure that can help to improve the economy.  It is well tested, well timed and modest.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMitchellOConnor"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the jobs initiative announced yesterday.  This is the first step in getting Ireland back to work.  It is not a grandiose press release but an honest effort to give hope and confidence to employers and the 430,000 people unemployed.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">Many Deputies spoke in this Chamber last week about the incidence of suicide and the effects of the downturn of the economy on people who are unemployed.  I am aware of a number of high profile and not so high profile people who have taken their lives because of the prospect of unemployment.  It is incumbent on a Government and on all elected representatives to give hope to our people.  We cannot have our people drowning in negativity.</P>
        <P>As an elected representative for D&uacute;n Laoghaire, I welcome the injection of cash into the tourism sector.  We in D&uacute;n Laoghaire are working to the best of our abilities to entice people to our county and the business people and the community have come together to ensure that tourists come.</P>
        <P>As a former school principal, I welcome the extra &euro;30 million for the summer works programme.  Many school buildings throughout the country are in a dire condition and that is unacceptable in 2011.  I am aware that much more work needs to be done in our schools for our children to get the best education in a modern and secure environment.  Many people contacted me during the past 24 hours to say they are delighted and happy that they will have an opportunity to upskill, retrain and undertake internships.</P>
        <P>It is very easy to sit on the fence and be critical and cynical.  I ask all Members of this House to come together and engage, and if Deputies and members of the public have good ideas to create jobs, to let the Ministers know.  It is important that we work together to get Ireland back to work again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeadarToibin"><NameTxt>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</NameTxt>
	<P>Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla rud a r&aacute;.  The Irish people are not drowning in negativity; they are drowning in debt.  That is the biggest issue facing this country. <Col N="41"/> The previous Minister of State who spoke said that no submissions were made with regard to this jobs initiative.  Our party made a submission to the Irish people, which was called our election manifesto, only nine weeks ago.  Therefore, that statement is patently untrue.</P>
        <P>I will speak first about the importance of the issue at hand.  Some 439,000 people are unemployed in this State.  These are men and women of all ages, skills, backgrounds and experiences.  These people are living with the daily reality of having had their wages plummet and of having to hunt for jobs that are not there.  The outworking of a Fianna F&aacute;il Government policy has forced hundreds of thousands of competent men and women on to the dole queues.  The curse of unemployment does not stop with those 439,000 people.  There are hundreds of thousands of children whose parents are unemployed and their collective incomes have plummeted while their expenditures such as mortgages, fuel, food and so on have remained rigid or have increased.  That is not to speak of the collapse in confidence and the depression and despair that is often brought about by unemployment.  Hundreds of thousands of others have been forced to emigrate.  Roughly the same number of people who sit the leaving certificate each year are now emigrating from this State.  That is a phenomenal figure.  The GAA generation is being gutted, with some of its brightest, most energetic, most intelligent people being forced to leave this State.  Communities are being decimated and the most energetic of our people are being deflated.</P>
        <P>The core of business in this State is closing down.  Construction companies, retailers and wholesalers are closing at a rate never seen previously.  At the end of February figures released showed that there was a 46% increase in the rate of business closures.  There were 2,900 corporate closures in 2009 and 2010 and the number of insolvencies from January to April in 2011 was 588, which is an increase on the number for the same period last year.  That figure indicates that there are 46 corporate insolvencies a week.  It is estimated by the Small Firms Association that a potential of 62,500 small businesses could close in the next year, which means 200,000 jobs are under pressure.  These jobs are under threat as a result of a contracting economy, reduced demand and rigid cost base.  The contracting economy and the reduced demand are a result of an economic shock and Fianna F&aacute;il policies, but these are being accentuated by Fine Gael-Labour policies being implemented today.</P>
        <P>Our economy is flatlining as a result of three years of deflationary policy.  The deficit in April 2011 was &euro;9.9 billion, which is in contrast to &euro;7 billion in the first four months of 2010.  Debt servicing on our national debt in that period cost &euro;1.8 billion.  The Government is at one level introducing paltry jobs initiatives but at the same level the thrust of its economic policy is gutting an extinguishing demand that is necessary for jobs.</P>
        <P>Unemployment is a devastating issue and an urgent crisis that demands a comprehensive response.  This information is not new to the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  Both parties made jobs the most important issue in the run up to the general election nine weeks ago.  They spent their election campaigns hyping the jobs initiatives in which they would get involved.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, said a few minutes ago that people would not believe extravagant claims about producing 50,000 jobs or 80,000 jobs.  Nine weeks ago the Fine Gael Party said that it would produce 100,000 jobs in government and that it would produce a &euro;9 billion stimulus.  The Labour Party spoke of a &euro;500 million jobs fund and of a strategic investment bank with funds of &euro;2 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Cynically, nine weeks later both parties have retreated fully from their election promises and have gone into reverse mode.  They are reducing the significance of this jobs initiative every day, and it is no wonder.</P>
        <P>When I looked at the figures yesterday it was clear that &euro;40 million was assigned to creating jobs.  That &euro;40 million must be contrasted with the depth of the problem, namely, the 439,000 <Col N="42"/>people unemployed and it also must be contrasted with the &euro;24 billion the Government is pouring into the banks.  On the figures in the Minister&rsquo;s document yesterday, &euro;40 million would create 400 jobs.  Four hundred jobs is the response of this Government to the 439,000 people who are unemployed.  That is equivalent to opening up two Tesco stores.  It is the equivalent of three days of young people emigrating from this State.  There are more than 400 unemployed people in any two large residential housing estates in Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Cork or any of the small towns throughout the country.  The Minister&rsquo;s response to the largest crisis this country has seen is shockingly disproportionate.  There are many good people on his side of the House who know that and who will be frustrated and disgusted at the paltry measures brought forward in this jobs initiative.</P>
        <P>It is important also to mention that there is so much more missing in this jobs initiative.  The agrifood sector is very important to the constituents of some of the Ministers on the benches opposite who come from rural constituencies yet there is nothing about agrifood in this jobs initiative.  It contains no reform of enterprise development agencies or any programme for small businesses with fewer than ten employees.  Other than the PRSI initiative, no attempt has been made to reduce costs to small businesses or rents and rates, an important issue to hundreds of retailers across the State.  A major opportunity has been missed to produce a far and wide reaching jobs initiative that could have reached into every community.</P>
        <P>Yesterday my party colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, said there is a need for a major stimulus injection into the economy, a policy considered good economic practice in any recession.  There is no doubt a stimulus package would work best in a large closed economy.  It can, however, work in a small open economy like ours if it is targeted, strategic and linked to improving economic competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness can also be improved with labour intensive infrastructural projects while investment in education can be increased to create a knowledge economy.  The previous Government spoke of a knowledge economy yet produced a property bubble and reduced the level of investment in education.  This Fine Gael-Labour Government is still reducing the moneys going into education.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has stated it will take &euro;2 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to fast-track labour intensive investment projects, such as a schools building programme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, knows of schools in his constituency that need proper refurbishment.  This policy was similar to a proposal made by the Labour Party during the general election nine weeks ago.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in would invest &euro;600 million in supports for viable businesses to maintain employee levels while providing a &euro;500 million stimulus package for families and ensure income for the retail sector.  Sinn F&eacute;in has also said it will abolish the universal social charge, another Labour Party election pledge.  Retailers have said the effect of the charge and consequent drop in income will be the closure of 400 retailers and associated jobs.</P>
        <P>Another gaping hole in the jobs initiative is the lack of enterprise agency reform.  It is possible to reform, create jobs and save money.  Will the Government consider amalgamating IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland?  Selling Ireland as a tourism product is already done by Tourism Ireland on an all-Ireland basis, yet three separate enterprise organisations are dealing with selling indigenous businesses abroad and attracting foreign direct investment.  Only one agency is needed for the State on an all-Ireland basis.  Amalgamating the existing agencies will reduce duplication in office provision and organisational infrastructure while creating more jobs as a result.</P><Col N="43"/>
        <P>While Enterprise Ireland does a good job in developing business, it is still too reactive.  It should be going into local communities, engaging with small businesses to ensure they grow and export.  It is incredible only 80 high potential start-up units open every year.  Enterprise Ireland must be given a proactive remit to generate more start-up businesses.</P>
        <P>County enterprise boards are at the coalface of small business.  The jobs initiative contains no export programme for these boards.  Many of them have massive knowledge and skill-sets but their funding was cut by the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government by 30%.  Again, this initiative makes no provision for the creation of one-stop shops or business incubation centres with the country enterprise board structure.  Neither is F&Aacute;S linked with third level institutions to create partnerships to grow small businesses in small communities.</P>
        <P>The initiative does not address cutting costs for small businesses.  Rents, rates, telecoms are still costing small businesses too much.  All Members were asked by small businesses during the election to do something about these rising costs.  The initiative, however, contains nothing to address this matter which is disappointing.  I have already asked the Minister to consider creating a progressive rate which would depend on a business&rsquo;s income and take into consideration if it is export-driven or heavily involved in research and development.</P>
        <P>Commercial rents are squeezing small businesses out of existence.  While the Government may claim it is busy and will deal with the issue in due course, it should be remembered rents are forcing businesses to close every day with jobs lost and many forced to emigrate.  In the time it took for the Government to draw up this initiative since it took office, up to 13,000 people have emigrated.  There are vested interests in the commercial rent area, including NAMA and certain property owners.  I hope Fine Gael and Labour will stand up for the interests of small businesses rather than putting NAMA and developers first and ensure exorbitant rents are not charged.  If exorbitant rents are not tackled sooner, more people will be forced on to social welfare.</P>
        <P Just="Left">No measures are contained in the initiative to tackle energy, telecoms and waste costs for small businesses.  Last week Bord G&aacute;is flagged the fact that it was inevitable for it to increase its charges by 20% before the end of the year.  How many jobs could this increase cost businesses?</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2005, net foreign earnings in the agrifood sector amounted to 32% of total earnings from primary and manufacturing industry.  In 2008, Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink exports were &euro;8.2 billion, representing approximately 10% of overall merchandise trade exports, while one in seven people is employed in the sector.  However, not one single sectoral measure has been introduced in the jobs initiative.  Considering the current upward pressures on commodities internationally and the competitive advantage Ireland has in the sector, it is shocking the sector has been ignored by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  Despite the largest crisis we have seen, massive unemployment levels and promises made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party nine weeks ago what we have received is a revenue neutral stimulus.  Anyone with a background in economics will know that revenue neutral stimulus is by definition an oxymoron.  A stimulus must not be revenue neutral.  It must be an infusion of revenue into the economy.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated that this will not be a large Keynesian stimulus package, which makes him Minister for Finance and minister for stating the obvious.  This jobs initiative is at best a rearrangement of the deck chairs.  At a time when Ireland&rsquo;s domestic economy is in urgent need of a stimulus all we get is a drop in the ocean.  Some business and unemployment organisations have given a guarded welcome to these initiatives.  There are several positive elements in the initiatives, which I welcome, including the creation of training places and work placements.  In an economy so devoid of new business, a drop in the ocean, which this is, is obviously considered welcome.</P><Col N="44"/>
        <P Just="Left">I urge the Members opposite, whom I know will be devastated with this although they will talk the talk, to push as hard as they can within their parliamentary parties for a loosening up of investment to create a major stimulus package which will bring about radical change in this State.</P>

	<P>The jobs initiative represents the first of what could be 1,000 steps taken towards bringing about a full recovery of our employment, banking and public debt crises.  Let us not pretend to be unaware of the scale of the problem, which is, to say the least, of potentially enormous and hugely challenging proportions.  Turning it into a shouting match will not solve anything.  It may well take decades to fully solve this Fianna F&aacute;il created crisis.  This jobs initiative should be judged not as a solution but as a step; not just preamble but progress.  While it is only a step, a radical and imaginative one, it is extremely important nonetheless not alone because of the jobs it will create but because it demonstrates to the people of this great country that for the first time in 14 years the Government is listening.</P>
        <P>The Government has represented the needs of our economy and people when it comes to our 12.5% rate of corporation tax.  This is non-negotiable.When I was an MEP, while the other Administration was in place, I noted that many EU countries were of the opinion that we would be weak-kneed on this issue.  Well, this Administration will not be weak on it.  It is part of a package that works given our close relationship with the US, our well educated and highly skilled work force and the fact that English is one of our spoken languages and we will protect it.  The contradictions are obvious across Europe when one parallels our rate with that of France, Bulgaria and so on.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has correctly outlined a five pillared approach to getting us out of this economic crisis.  This includes restoring our reputation, restoring the banking system, making the public service cheaper but not compromising on social justice and most important, supporting and protecting job creation.  What we have in this plan is a proper stimulus for the economy, one that is targeted and does not allow for mass leakage of the stimulus out of the economy.  We want to kick-off construction but not reinflate the asset bubble.  This is designed to get money working in the local economy of every part of the country, which is important.  It does not have a totally urban focus.  The construction workers whom this will rehire will, it is hoped, spend the money in their local communities, while improving school and road infrastructure.  There will be regional spread, which I am sure Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n will welcome.</P>
        <P>Unlike the Opposition, I do not believe in handing out funding to people who will spend their money on goods outside the state.  This is a stimulus that is community driven not invented in the imaginary tales of the Opposition who seem to think they can solve Ireland&rsquo;s problems with idealist solutions, ones which they did not have a few months ago.  This jobs initiative contributes to rather than undermines stability in the public finances.  This is crucial for confidence going forward.  This initiative is about spending existing resources with a jobs focus in mind.  We are freeing up capital that would have rested in a Government account and is now being used to get people back to work.  To be honest, it is not enough but it is a start.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us take for example the &euro;75 million coming from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is being targeted at shovel ready initiatives.  Rather than leave funding lying <Col N="45"/>around until next year we are using it now in a time of crisis.  This will produce many jobs in local areas where small contractors can get work they had not planned for.  This will have a ripple effect throughout the economy, which I am sure the Deputy welcomes.</P>
        <P>The local authorities will get work done at a really good rate given the greater value there is now in tendering for such work.  This work is badly needed.  Everyone knows our secondary and regional roads are in an awful state.  The same applies in respect of the summer works programmes in schools.  I am sure many Members have been lobbied about schools needing windows, roofs, toilets and so on.  This work is badly needed and will create safer schools for our children.  From a Department point of view funding needed to be provided as there was very little left in the coffers of the previous Administration.  Also in the transport area, &euro;15 million has been made available under smarter travel programmes across our cities and through applications through our local authorities.  Again, these are labour intensive measures that should be welcomed.  The retrofitting initiative will also be labour intensive and create a double whammy saving in the long term.  This is good use of resources as each &euro;10 million spent equates to &euro;15 million that will be spent by the private sector in return.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that many of these initiatives, if not sustainable, will be reversed.  The VAT reduction to 9% in the tourism area is part of a targeted incentive to create business.  I believe it will work.  I have a great deal of experience of the tourism industry having worked for Bord F&aacute;ilte for several years.  This initiative is very much welcomed.  We have an overflow of tourism accommodation, in particular hotel accommodation.  This was fuelled by the insane tax policies of the previous Government.  We should try to lower prices and to create demand.  If we generate people traffic, those people will spend money and contribute to low-skilled primary job creation in this sector.  It is critically important that the lowering of the VAT rate is passed on to the consumer and that they see the benefits.  In particular, we need to see the benefits coming through targeting the domestic and British markets.  This ties in to the visits by President Obama and the Queen.  The push by the Government on the tourism sector has been considerable and I know it has been welcomed by the tourism industry.</P>
        <P>On scrapping the air travel tax, I welcome this incentivising process.  The airlines will have to deliver visitors for it to work, otherwise it could be reversed.  It is a novel and welcome approach.  The message for our tourism strategy is clear.  Ireland was an expensive country to visit.  It is now cheaper to come here, stay here and have a good time. The other unique aspect of our tourism industry is that it has the potential to create jobs in rural areas.  Our strategy must be based on fair distribution of employment and this is achieved through changes in the VAT levels, the school building programme, regional road repairs and a new priority for tourism.</P>
        <P>The new flexibility in the research and development tax credit should not be under-estimated.  It is what will help companies when choosing to locate to a destination like Ireland.  As a Government, I expect that we will want to do more in this area in the future and in particular that we will target certain sectors like software, gaming, computing and so on.  The 20,900 places provided for people under the various internship, skills training courses, back to education and third level springboard programme and the specific conditioning of these places shows this Government is specifically targeting people who have lost their jobs.  In addition to these measures, I expect that this Government will pursue with great vigour applications for further assistance from the European Globalisation Fund for workers that lost their jobs in the construction, financial and retail sectors.  I understand the construction application is being actively pursued.  I hope the Government will be in a position to use such funds in a much smarter way than did the previous Government, in particular with regard to the Dell fund.</P><Col N="46"/>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the restoration of the minimum wage to &euro;8.65 from July.  This confirms the commitment given when this Government was formed.  The Exchequer benefits from the &euro;1 cut introduced by the last Government did not materialise.  It only acted as a disincentive to work.  Workers deserve this revision and it will help to rebalance people's choices.  Restoring the Irish economy will be like running a marathon.  Following yesterday&rsquo;s announcement, we are on the right road and are now out of the blocks.  More will come.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport</askee>
        <Quest>      in view of the significant contribution of the arts and cultural sectors to tourism here and the arts and cultural sectors' dependence on State funding, if he has investigated the possibility of creating a dialogue or ways of stimulating a new relationship between the arts and cultural sector and the private sector to help sustain funding.     </Quest>
        <QRef>[10946/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am acutely conscious of the value of the arts, culture and creative sectors to the tourism industry and of their overall potential as important contributors to sustainable economic recovery.  Arising from the considerable level of investment and support provided by the State through Departments and their relevant agencies to the arts and culture areas, significant social, cultural and educative benefits have been brought to communities, large and small, around the country.  As well as improving the overall fabric of our communities, such supports have acted as catalysts in driving the tourism potential and returns in every area of the country.</P>
        <P>I am committed to developing culture and heritage as key drivers for Irish tourism, contributing, as they did, an estimated &euro;2 billion to the Irish economy last year, with research showing that cultural visitors spend almost twice as much as city-break visitors.  Furthermore, overseas visitors experience high levels of satisfaction with what Ireland has to offer.  Almost four out of every five overseas visitors cite interesting history/culture as a motivation for choosing Ireland for a holiday, making it a viable area for the growth in visitor numbers and revenue.</P>
        <P>Government policy on the arts will continue to be enabled and implemented through the agencies and institutions within my Department&rsquo;s ambit, namely the Arts Council, the Irish Film Board and Culture Ireland, as well as the cultural institutions.</P>
        <P>Funding is provided by my Department and by these agencies for a number of cultural events, programmes and initiatives throughout the year, which are specifically aimed at promoting and highlighting our cultural heritage and cultural activities.</P>
        <P>The Arts Council, for instance, is heavily involved in supporting the programming element of many festivals, small and large, throughout the country.  Many of these events are also funded by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  As has been well documented, these events provide a vital and welcome opportunity to display and participate in the cultural and artistic talents of our communities and, equally importantly, provide stimulating unique attractions for our visitors to enjoy.</P><Col N="47"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">For it is these artistic and other events, whether traditional music, art exhibitions, or a poetry festival, to mention but a few, that demonstrate our Irishness, our differences, and the reason we think visitors should come here.</P>
        <P>Within my Department support is provided for Culture Night, when arts and cultural organisations throughout the country extend their opening hours to provide the public with increased free access to the various collections, workshops and other events hosted by the organisations.  Another initiative launched by my Department, the cultural technology grant scheme, aims to use a variety of the best new and existing technology methods to deliver a promotional, educational or information product to promote the Irish arts, culture and creative sectors.  Funding in excess of &euro;1 million was provided under this scheme to 25 projects to showcase the best of our Irish art, music, culture and heritage in the most exciting, innovative and dynamic ways.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reply and his commitment to the arts and culture.  That is not in question.  I note that the programme for Government commits the Government to working with stakeholders in the arts community to develop new proposals aimed at building private support for the arts in Ireland and exploring philanthropic sponsorship or endowment fund opportunities.</P>
        <P>What steps has the Minister taken to end the arts sector&rsquo;s dependence on State funding?  Will he consider engaging with the private sector on this matter?  I urge the Minister to make this a priority.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Government announced a jobs initiative, with particular focus on the tourism industry.  Arts and culture play a hugely important role in tourism.  How does the Minister think the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative will boost the arts sector and attract investment for that sector?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The jobs initiative is very important in this area.  Pay related social insurance and value added tax are major issues in paying staff at cultural and tourism attractions.  I am convinced that the changes in PRSI and VAT will encourage more people to take on staff in cultural institutions and cultural attractions throughout the country.  I can see the jobs initiative having a direct effect on the number of people employed in culture, attending cultural events and coming into the country.  </P>
        <P>If the travel tax issue is addressed this will bring more people into the country, as Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary and others have promised.  I hope these people will support our cultural institutions and attractions throughout the country.</P>
        <P>What was proposed yesterday is positive with regard to cultural attractions and the arts.  The arts should benefit from the initiative.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport</askee>
        <Quest>      his plans to address the situation in which  the Light House Cinema, Dublin 8, has been closed due to large increases in rent from the landlord.     </Quest>
        <QRef>[10842/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The background of the State&rsquo;s involvement with the Light House Cinema goes back to February 2006, when the then Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism approved a capital grant of &euro;1 million towards the development of the Light House Cinema in Smithfield, Dublin.  Construction began on the project in March 2007 and it was officially opened in May 2008.  The grant was provided for the fit-out costs of the project rather than the construction costs.  Further State funding of &euro;750,000 was provided for the project from the Cultural Cinema Consortium, which comprises the Irish Film Board and the Arts Council.  </P><Col N="48"/>
        <P>The State&rsquo;s investment in the Light House Cinema is protected through a legally registered charge on the property.  This charge allows that in the event of the Light House Cinema ceasing to operate from the premises in Smithfield in the first five years of its operation, the Minister can choose either the repayment of the State grants or agree to allow another arthouse cinema or cultural cinema to occupy the building for the remainder of the lease so that the premises remains in use as an arthouse/cultural cinema centre.</P>
        <P>The Cultural Cinema Consortium has further liens on the premises.  As the cinema was opened in 2008, this five year agreement has a further two years to run.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 15 April 2011, the High Court placed the Light House Cinema into involuntary liquidation and appointed a liquidator.  On 27 April Mr. Neil Hughes of Hughes Blake was appointed receiver and manager by Bord Scann&aacute;n na hEireann/the Irish Film Board and the Arts Council with the agreement of my Department.  Following appropriate examination and analysis of the emerging situation, my Department will be advised by the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General on the best approach to take in conjunction with Bord Scann&aacute;n na hEireann/the Irish Film Board and the Arts Council.</P>
        <P>I understand that the receiver will seek expressions of interest in taking over the management and running of the Light House Cinema by placing advertisements in the national media.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that such a fine facility is currently closed, but I hope that a new tenant can be found to continue to operate the premises as an arthouse and cultural cinema centre.  I am constrained in saying much more at this juncture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Light House Cinema added much to the cultural landscape of Dublin, providing an opportunity for small independent local and international film makers to air their works and cinema goers an opportunity to sample the wares of alternative productions.  Closure of the cinema in April of this year marked a milestone in yet another false dawn for the people of Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city.  Would the Minister agree that the story of the Light House Cinema is interwoven with the story of upward only rent reviews and the debacle that is NAMA?</P>
        <P>The Light House Cinema was established, viable and sustainable, reporting its best box office receipts in the months leading up to its forced closure.  Would the Minister agree that a lease signed in 2007 for an annual rent of &euro;100,000 should not be doubled to &euro;200,000 by 2010, in the middle of the worst recession in the history of the State?     The legislation allowing upward only rent increases for commercial leases is absurd.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The agreement made with the operator and owner was that in year one, from May 2008, the rent was set at nil; in year two, from May 2009, it was set at &euro;100,000; in year three, from May 2010, it was set at &euro;200,000; in year four, from May 2011, it was set at &euro;400,000; and in year five, from May 2012, it was set at &euro;500,000.  The owner entered into an agreement with the operator expecting this return but the operator was not in a position to provide the rent that had been agreed &mdash; that is the problem.  The owner, in turn, appointed <Col N="49"/>a liquidator, and the Department, with the Arts Council and the other interested bodies, appointed a receiver to protect the taxpayers&rsquo; huge investment in this project.</P>
        <P>At this stage, the receiver is seeking expressions of interest.  There are some interested parties and the receiver is following up to ascertain whether this interest is real and to acquire an operator.  It is in all our interests to ensure that this fine state-of-the-art facility continues to be in use and to serve the people, not only of Smithfield and surrounding areas but the people of Dublin and visitors to the country.  I agree with the Deputy that the doors should be opened again in this fine facility which exists due to a large investment by the taxpayer.</P>

        <Quest>      in view of the statement in the programme for Government to develop a cultural plan for future commemorative events such as the centenary of the Easter Rising of 1916, if he will ensure that part of that plan will be protecting and preserving intact the historical site from the General Post Office to Moore Street, as requested by the Save 16 Moore Street Committee, extending national monument status to the entire Moore Street terrace, listing other buildings occupied by volunteers in their retreat from the GPO in order that the area will be a fitting historic and cultural quarter; and if he will commit to ensuring adequate funding for this and that the work will be under the direct supervision of the Director of the National Museum.     </Quest>
        <QRef>[10944/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the arrangements for national commemorative programmes are co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Reflecting the strong interest of the Government, the Taoiseach wrote on 3 May seeking nominations from party leaders with a view to re-establishment of the all-party Oireachtas consultation group on centenary commemorations.  As Minister responsible for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht, I will chair the consultation group, which will offer a forum to consider the duration, scope and scale of an appropriate commemorative programme to cover the centenary anniversaries of a momentous period of our national history.</P>
        <P>The national commemorative arrangements will reflect official consideration and consultation on an inclusive basis in the Oireachtas.  I would also welcome proposals from voluntary bodies, community groups and the Irish people at home and abroad.  I envisage a multi-annual programme extending in the first phase to 2016.</P>
        <P>In regard to Moore Street, the position is that, in January 2007, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government placed a preservation order on Nos. 14 to 17 under the National Monuments Acts.  The order was made on the grounds that No. 16 Moore Street is a monument, the preservation of which is of national importance by reason of its historical significance as the site of the final council of war and final headquarters of the Provisional Government, which included five of the Proclamation signatories &mdash; Pearse, Connolly, Plunkett, Clarke and McDermott.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the preservation order is to ensure the preservation of No. 16 Moore Street in the context of wider redevelopment proposals centred on the former Carlton Cinema site. <Col N="50"/> To achieve this objective, the order also covers Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and includes the yards to the rear of Nos. 15 and 16 Moore Street, extending to Nos. 8 and 9 Moore Lane.  The effect of the order is that works affecting these properties, including any excavation or ground disturbance within, around or in proximity to them, will require the prior written consent of the Minister.  While the National Museum of Ireland does not have a role in supervision of such works, the Minister is statutorily obliged to consult the director of the Museum as part of the consent process.</P>
        <P>The proposed development of the Carlton Cinema site, in accordance with the permission granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, envisages the retention of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and, subject to ministerial consent under the National Monuments Acts, No. 16 Moore Street becoming a commemorative centre.  Detailed proposals in this regard will need to be submitted to my Department for consideration and any works to be carried out will require my consent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are positives and negatives in the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  I am from East Wall and I went to school in King&rsquo;s Inn Street, which is in the heart of the Moore Street area.  As someone who loved history, I loved taking that walk every morning and knowing I was walking on the same streets that the men and women from the garrison in the GPO walked.  We have lost enough of the buildings that were associated with the Rising.</P>
        <P>I note in a previous reply the Minister referred to the number of cultural visitors to Ireland.  Does he not think making that whole area, which is a battlefield site, a historic quarter of Dublin would be a good idea, given the way people visiting Prague, Budapest and elsewhere visit similar areas?  I ask the Minister to include the whole area, including O&rsquo;Rahilly Parade where the O&rsquo;Rahilly made his last stand and the laneways the men and women walked down.  All the houses on Moore Street should also be protected, not just three houses.  When the men and women surrendered, they moved down to the end of the street, so the whole area is reeking of history, which previous Governments have completely ignored to facilitate the development of the Carlton Cinema.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I pointed out to the Deputy, the decision was made on this issue by a previous Minister and by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  However, in the context of the 1916 commemoration and the consultative committee I am setting up, this will obviously be discussed.  I have been contacted by a number of interested groups, which I hope to meet in the next few months.  If anything can be done to answer the questions raised by the Deputy, I will do it.  The committee on the 1916 commemoration will be very inclusive and will include those from all sides of the House and will seek views from interested bodies outside the House.  Obviously, this will be a very important consideration given the various points outlined by the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Minister include the Save 16 Moore Street Committee in that?  On a related point, while the Minister is very busy, on Tuesday, 24 May, we are having a tour of the battlefield with the relatives.  It would be great if the Minister could join us and I know some Members of the Technical Group who would be delighted to have him along for that tour, which will really show off the places associated with the Rising.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport</askee>
        <Quest>      his future pro<Col N="51"/>posals in relation to section 481 &mdash; film relief; and if he will make a statement on the matter.     </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film making in Ireland, in respect of the indigenous sector and inward productions, is a matter for the Irish Film Board.  This agency is funded through my Department and is independent in its day-to-day operations.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s operational role in supporting the film sector relates to the administration of elements of section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Under that provision, tax relief is allowed for investments in qualifying films, which involves the administration of certain elements of the scheme regarding satisfying cultural criteria.  The types of film eligible for certification are feature film, television drama, creative documentary and animation.  This scheme is kept under regular review in conjunction with the Irish Film Board and any enhancement necessary to retain or regain competitiveness is addressed and brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance, as appropriate.  The scheme has now been extended to the end of 2015.</P>
        <P>It is important to underline that the audiovisual sector makes a strong contribution in employment and economic terms.  The Irish audiovisual sector was valued at &euro;557.3 million in 2008, equivalent to 0.3% of GDP, and employs almost 7,000 people in about 570 companies.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that the benefits of film and television production in Ireland include not only job creation in the industry itself but also huge positive spin-off effects for promoting Ireland as a tourist destination and as an industrial location for all aspects of creative endeavour.  Currently, I am finalising a five-year strategy for the sector and I propose to bring that strategy to Government in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and welcome his commitment to retaining section 481 until 2015.  Would he consider extending this tax relief to computer and video games and other forms of content creation?  This is an enormous global industry with great potential and benefit for job creation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will certainly consider it and will suggest it to the Minister for Finance.  I will publish a report shortly on the creative industry and although it will not deal directly with this issue it will obviously bring much attention to the entire sector.  Section 481 has been very successful and has been replicated throughout the world.  When we won major blockbusters to this country such as &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo;, the UK Government asked why the film companies located to Ireland.  &ldquo;Saving Private Ryan&rdquo; was a great success and this continues with &ldquo;The Tudors&rdquo;, &ldquo;Camelot&rdquo; and others such as &ldquo;The Vikings&rdquo; which will be made here shortly.  We have done very well with section 481.  Successive Governments have used this section very successfully and have adapted it to suit the competition.  When other countries caught up with us we went ahead again by making the country an attractive location.</P>
        <P>If relief were extended would it take away this effect and be too much of a loss to the Exchequer?  That should be considered.  However, the gaming industry is very topical and much mentioned.  I will consider the issue and make a presentation to the Minister.  If the Deputy has any ideas I would welcome them.  The provision has been very successful.  We lead the world in the number of films made in Ireland.  This is something we have done well as a country and it should be recognised.</P>

Exhibition as part of Tailinn, Estonia&rsquo;s programme as European City of Culture, if he will publish a policy in relation to young persons and the arts in the next 12 months in the context of reduced funding and resources; and if so, his plans to consult with the sector in relation to this policy.     </Quest>
        <QRef>[10943/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this opportunity to congratulate this group of ten secondary school students from Kilkenny on winning this Most Promising Young Artists award.  This project, curated I understand by County Sligo based arts practice, the Kids&rsquo; Own publishing partnership, emerged a winner from 13 other European entries, as part of the Tallinn Capital of Culture programme in Estonia.  This award represents the culmination of a series of initiatives, as well as imagination and commitment on the parts not only of the students but also of a number of agencies, artists and administrators in the youth and arts sectors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I describe this as a culmination, as I understand the project originated from an artist-in-residence programme undertaken by the arts office in Kilkenny County Council.  The artist engaged by the arts office undertook to work with this group of interested young people over a period of weeks, resulting in the production of this fine short-stop animation project.  This outcome would have been satisfactory in itself, in that it allowed this set of students the opportunity to explore and develop their talents and produce a tangible result.  However, as so often occurs within the arts sector, the project took on another life with its inclusion as part of the Irish entry to the Estonian Capital of Culture programme whereby the Kilkenny students became part of the 56-member party of young Irish people which formed the Irish exposition entry.  Again I pay tribute to all those involved.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.</P>
        <P>The Arts Council has developed and continues to implement its strategy and policies in relation to the engagement of and contribution by young people in the arts sector.  The wider context for Arts Council support of young people, children and education in 2011-13 is set out in its strategic overview document, Developing the Arts in Ireland 2011-2013, produced last year.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>The Arts Council outlined its work in that document, setting out the key strategic principles that will inform its funding and other decisions, including in the area of young people and the arts over the next few years.  This principle includes the provision of high quality arts experiences for young people, both in and out of school, as being an abiding concern of the Arts Council.  The council is acutely aware of the high proportion of young people in our population and their developmental significance carries weight in its funding decisions and in its partnerships in the fields of arts-in-education, youth arts, and professional arts provision for young audiences.  During 2011-13, the council will endeavour to make the arts more present in the lives of nearly 1 million young people, having regard to the available resources.</P>
        <P>I am also anxious that the potential of the arts be recognised and nurtured in the formation of character, in the raising of self-esteem and in the enormous benefits to be derived for young people, now and into the future.  In this regard, I will explore with the council, other interested agencies and my Government colleagues, ways of maximising the potential of the arts and other related areas to the benefit of our young people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a lighter note, I wish our young hopefuls, Jedward, every success in the Eurovision Song Contest in Dusseldorf this weekend.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister intend to have a consultation or to publish a policy document in the next 12 months in this regard?  It is very important.  Some Members heard speakers today discussing depression.  In addition, opportunities may arise in regard to the Minister&rsquo;s two schemes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy McGrath who obviously has an interest in this area.  The Arts Council has a number of schemes and initiatives which I shall mention in brief, namely, the children&rsquo;s laureate or laureate na n-&oacute;g, the artists in schools schemes which is administered by the Arts Council and local authorities, the writers in schools schemes, administered by Poetry Ireland, the artists in work residencies scheme, administered with the National Youth Council of Ireland, the youth arts development award, with the National Youth Council of Ireland and the artists in the community scheme.  There are a number of schemes directed at young people but we must do more.  I have had discussions with the Minister for Education and Skills about promoting the arts in both primary and secondary schools.  I am glad there are young people in the Visitors Gallery.  If there is one thing young people can engage with it is the arts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is also a major concern about the syllabus for the leaving certificate.  The reason not many young people take up art for the examination is that the syllabus is entirely outdated, having been in place since 1971.  That must be examined with the aim of encouraging young people to take up art as a subject for the leaving certificate.</P>
        <P>These are the two issues: the arts as a subject in schools young people would be encouraged to take and participation in the arts by young people for their enjoyment in schools but not as a subject.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 36 together.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains the following commitment: &ldquo;We will seek to capture some public good from NAMA by identifying buildings that have no commercial potential <Col N="54"/>and which might be suitable as local facilities for art and culture&rdquo;.  My Department recently wrote to NAMA requesting a meeting to discuss this commitment.  Accordingly, until that meeting takes place and I can get some idea of the thinking within NAMA on this proposal, it is not possible to give a definitive answer on specific buildings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the work the Minister has done in this regard by contacting NAMA.  It is a very worthwhile venture.  The Minister touched on this issue in his previous answer when he spoke of providing facilities for young people and trying to involve the younger generation in the arts and in the creation of art and culture.  I welcome that he has made progress on this.  When he has more information on this I ask him to let the House know the outcome of such contact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>When I was on the benches opposite, where Deputy Troy is now, I mentioned a few signature buildings in this city that might be suitable for this purpose so I hope to pursue what I spoke about now that I am in my present position.  If the taxpayer were to see buildings that had been in NAMA being used for cultural purposes, by young people in particular, that would be a very welcome development.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>Throughout the State local groups, including amateur dramatic and music groups, rehearse and prepare in dilapidated and inadequate facilities while brand new buildings lie idle.  What criteria are being used to identify local groups which require new facilities?  When does the Minister expect to get back the information?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Basically, we hope to have discussions with NAMA as soon as possible and we have written to it requesting it.  I contacted NAMA directly in two cases in which buildings related to the arts were involved which are housing arts projects at present.  NAMA seemed to be sympathetic.  It was appointed by the House to get a return for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>However, one must consider social capital as well.  There should be a social and cultural return and this may be equally as important as getting a good financial return.  People should consider where NAMA buildings are located and whether they are available throughout the country so that communities can focus and put in place arrangements to try to acquire these for community purposes.  It could lead to many possibilities.  I thank the Deputy for the direction of her question.  When I am speaking to the NAMA people I will bring this to their attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with much of what the Minister has said about NAMA.  Being involved in the industry myself, I am convinced most of the stuff with which NAMA is liable to flood the market will be sold at a good deal less than its real value.  In the case of as much of the property as possible, whether for sports, cultural or residential purposes, the more that remains in State hands, the better for the country.  Does the Minister agree that in many cases not only will there be arts and cultural benefits, but there will be a better return for the taxpayer as well given that much of what will be sold off will be bought by foreign investors at a knock-down price?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>One must balance the financial return with the cultural and social capital that could materialise as a country if we acquired these buildings.  This balance must be struck.  I agree with the Deputy that we should keep an open mind on acquiring some of these buildings.  However, we should acquire them for the right reason because any benefit to the country may be in the future rather than the present.  We should weigh up the best use for them and determine who are the people to acquire these buildings where there is a local <Col N="55"/>community demand.  I realise the Deputy is a good community worker, he understands the relevance of acquiring a building that is in place and ready-made for a community and he understands the social capital that could be gained from this.  In my discussions with NAMA I will emphasise this consideration and that it is not simply a matter of getting a monetary benefit.  Other benefits might arise which could be of major use for the future of society, our communities and especially our young people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>Some community groups will have a particular interest in a NAMA building.  Has the Minister put in place a process for how these can make an application to take ownership of such a building?  If so, will the Minister advise the House of this process?  Is there potential to get an economic return for NAMA with buildings in the case of aspiring artists who are finding it difficult to get venues or buildings in which to produce art?  Is there another avenue we could explore to facilitate aspiring artists by allowing them into some buildings at a nominal rent for a small period to help them to get established?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate for the Deputy to ask the question because I have been asking the same question myself recently.  This is the next mechanism NAMA should put in place.  It has acquired property and has gone through all the legal and logistical challenges up to now.  Next, the conditions and procedures to encourage the type of project that could attract community involvement should be put in place.  I am aware from my inquires to NAMA that it has not done this to date.</P>
        <P>However, I am aware of several initiatives involving people who are interested in getting together as a community to do expressly what the Deputy is suggesting.  I hope they can put together a package for community groups and that there will be a facility available to allow community groups to organise and get the resources together to acquire some of these properties, wherever they are in the country.  Since the taxpayer owns them, there should be a public list of properties available from NAMA.  This would be helpful and then people could decide what is appropriate for community involvement.  That is the next stage.  NAMA should consider the possibility of community involvement as well as waiting for investors to come in, as Deputy Wallace noted, to buy up the properties.  NAMA should consider the community aspect as well.</P>

	<P>The ring fort of Grian&aacute;n of Aileach is a national monument in State ownership.  The site is managed on a day-to-day basis by the Office of Public Works.  My Department provides funding under the built heritage capital programme to the OPW to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic properties and national monuments in State care.  It should be noted that there has been a significant reduction in the budgetary allocation to this programme in recent years.  My Department has been engaged with the OPW with regard to this site and has co-operated in the production of a heritage guide to the Grian&aacute;n, published in 2010.  This guide summarises the results of the conservation works undertaken between 2004 and 2007 and gives an outline of the historical and archaeological significance of the site.</P><Col N="56"/>
        <P>Following a meeting on 30 September 2010 between officials from the OPW, my Department and key stakeholders, it was agreed that the heritage guide would be made available through local tourist outlets, that signage at the site would be improved and that there would be ongoing co-operation with stakeholders through the county council&rsquo;s heritage officer to explore possibilities for highlighting the site&rsquo;s importance.

My colleague, Deputy Padraig Mac Lochlainn, extends an invitation to the Minister to visit the site.  Will the Minister accept Deputy Padraig Mac Lochlainn&rsquo;s invitation?  Will the Minister commit to investing in improved amenities at the site?</P>

	<P>I assure the Deputy when I go to Donegal I will visit the site.  As a former history teacher, I have referred to the site in the past.  I thank the Deputy for reminding me and ensuring that I recall the importance of the site.  However, this is a site where something has happened and where the OPW is doing something.  A guide and proper literature are now available and it is more of a positive story than that of other sites throughout the country.  I am keen to visit the site when I go to Donegal which, hopefully, will be before July.  I thank the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I was interested to listen to the response of the Minister on the cut in funding in recent years and what the OPW is doing now.  Given the announcements to try to boost tourism, it is vital that as much work as possible is done in conjunction with every Department to try to enhance and promote these areas.  There are many areas throughout the country of great culture and heritage.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that in this country we do transition and translation well, but we do not do transmission.  We have spent a lot of money to develop cultural facilities, but often people do not know about them.  Transmission is vitally important.  With modern technology, including Facebook, iPhone apps and other means of communication, we can tell people about our attractions in an inexpensive way.  Proper websites are important, with other means of communication about which the young people in the Visitors Gallery would be able to tell us.  Modern technology must be used much more; it is inexpensive, but it can be used to tell people about our archaeological sites, monuments and attractions.</P>

        <Quest>      the date on which he will commence a review of the opening times of our cultural institutions; and the date on which this review will be published.     </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>While my Department provides funding for the national cultural institutions, the board of each institution is responsible for all operational matters relating to the institution, including opening hours.  I do not have a statutory function in day-to-day operational matters.  All of the institutions will be required to carry out a formal review of their opening hours in accordance with the commitment given in the programme for Government.  I am aware that opening hours are a matter which is routinely kept under review by all of the institutions and the fact that they are now operating in a much changed financial situation and with reduced Exchequer resources will potentially impinge on the outcome of all such reviews.  My Department will continue to actively promote and encourage additional public access to the collections held by our national cultural institutions within current budgetary constraints, pending the outcome of the reviews.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given our economic circumstances and improved access to Ireland by air and sea, we must create a cultural hub.  To do so, we must ensure our national cultural institutions are user-friendly.  When will the reviews be completed and the recommendations implemented?  Does the Minister agree the review of opening hours could include an audit and a user satisfaction survey to determine appropriate opening hours?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>When I saw this question, I asked what the opening hours were.  Our national institutions are open for considerable periods, although the opening hours could be improved.  The National Gallery of Ireland is open from 9.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., Monday to Saturday, and from noon to 5.30 p.m. on Sunday.  The Irish Museum of Modern Art is open from 10 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., Tuesday to Saturday, and from noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday.  The National Museum is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday to Saturday, and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday.  The Chester Beatty Library is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.  The Crawford Art Gallery is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday and closed on Sunday.</P>
        <P>I looked for the figures for costs, such as for the IMMA.  If it had to open for an extra hour each evening, it would cost &euro;250,000 per year.  There is a cost involved, but there are many tourists and visitors and people who wish to conduct research or visit the institutions at night who must be considered.  The Government made a commitment in respect of the reviews taking <Col N="58"/>place and we hope to show outcomes, whereby opening hours will be extended, especially during peak season.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 42, 43 and 101 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has responsibility for the arts, heritage, the Irish language and the islands which I am confident will play a key role in the the country&rsquo;s economic recovery.  Since taking office, I have met and engaged with a wide range of stakeholders across the various sectors within the remit of my Department and I know these sectors can and will continue to contribute to achieving Government objectives to support the protection and creation of jobs.  While the arts, culture and creative sectors are important for the social, cultural and educative benefits they bring to communities around the country, they also constitute a significant sector of the economy, in terms of contributions to GNP and employment.  As such, they can make an important contribution to sustainable economic recovery.  Over 3.5 million people visited our national cultural institutions and other cultural organisations supported by my Department last year.  The priority in 2011 is to ensure that what the national cultural institutions offer to the public continue to draw large numbers of visitors, both domestically and from abroad.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding towards cultural initiatives aimed at enhancing the cultural tourism product and the provision of employment in the cultural tourism sector.  This year Dublin Contemporary 2011 will be an internationally recognised and acclaimed contemporary art exhibition and event in Dublin and provide a highlight for cultural tourism in Ireland on a global scale.  My Department continues to support the provision of genealogical research into family histories and encourage roots tourism.  This is an area with huge growth potential.</P>
        <P>Film, television and digital content production sits at the heart of the creative knowledge economy and represents an important investment proposition for Ireland.  The Irish audiovisual industry can be a positive force for change and be part of a national solution to drive economic growth by providing high quality local employment; increasing inward investment; promoting &ldquo;brand Ireland&rdquo; and our &ldquo;cultural ambassadors&rdquo; who represent Ireland abroad; contributing to cultural tourism initiatives; and improving our export capacity culturally and financially.</P>
        <P>As Minister with responsibility for heritage, Ireland&rsquo;s rich heritage can play a central role in national economic recovery.  During my term of office I will promote the role which Ireland&rsquo;s <Col N="59"/>heritage has to play in making Ireland an attractive destination for sustainable tourism and inward investment, both in terms of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department which operates Ireland&rsquo;s national parks and nature reserves and of our unique built heritage which distinguishes us and makes Ireland an attractive tourist location for both visitors and Irish people.  While resources are limited, I will look to work creatively across the Government and with partner bodies such as the Heritage Council, the Irish Heritage Trust and other heritage interests in delivering high quality heritage protection and promotion.</P>
        <P>The Deputies will be aware that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the State agency responsible for promoting the economic, social and cultural development of the Gaeltacht with the overall objective of ensuring Irish remains the main language of the region, also comes within the remit of my Department.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta encourages investment in the Gaeltacht through a range of incentives for new enterprises and support and assistance for existing businesses.  I will be seeking to support it, within available resources, to continue its strategy of attracting new enterprises and investments and protecting existing employment in its client companies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened attentively to the Minister&rsquo;s reply which reinforced the need to look to the private sector for future funding for cultural events.  He stated he has already engaged with philanthropists in this regard.  The Minister spoke eloquently about that fine cathedral in Cork.  I remind him we have fine heritage buildings right throughout the country and in particular in Westmeath we have such buildings awaiting grant assistance from his Department.  Can he give any indication of when those grants will be announced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Deputy could be more specific in his contribution.  I presume the Deputy refers to a number of heritage grants administered by the Department which will be announced shortly.  I am visiting the Heritage Council tomorrow and I will bring to its attention his frustration with the non-announcement of these grants.  I hope when they are announced the Deputy will be pleased that some of the projects to which he refers will receive grants.</P>
        <P>St. Fin Barre&rsquo;s cathedral in Cork should be of particular interest to all of us, in particular to Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch and Deputy Sandra McLellan who represent Cork city and county respectively.  It is of national importance and vital that the cathedral is properly preserved.  We must ensure it is not damaged further by rain.  Those grants will be announced shortly.</P>

	<P>How will the Minister&rsquo;s Department facilitate and support the full implementation of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s cultural tourism strategy?  Is there scope in the strategy for co-operation with the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two agencies, Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, dealing with tourism on the island of Ireland.  The section of my Department dealing with tourism is located in Killarney, County Kerry.  It is imperative that these bodies work in close co-operation with each other.  Before Christmas I produced a policy document on tourism and I received feedback from the tourism industry which suggested a disconnection between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  I suggested in my policy document that the two agencies should work from the same building.  Tourism Ireland is a 32-county body which promotes the island of Ireland and which was established as a result of the Good Friday Agreement while F&aacute;ilte Ireland promotes indigenous tourism.  I agree with Deputy McLellan on the importance of agencies working in close co-operation to promote our considerable number and quality of attractions to a broader market both at home and abroad, in particular from our main markets such as the UK, USA, Germany and other European countries.</P><Col N="60"/>
        <P>The forthcoming visits of President Obama and the Queen of England will be very important showcase events for this country.  It is hoped our cultural facilities will be highlighted and be on view around the world during these visits.  It will be a great opportunity to sell our country and its cultural attractions.</P>

	<P>The Irish Heritage Trust was established to acquire for public access major heritage properties where the State does not wish to acquire them directly and where there is an imminent risk to their heritage value.  It was established in 2006 and is designated as a charity under the Companies Acts.</P>
        <P>Current funding has been provided from the Vote of my Department towards the operational activities of the trust.  A total of &euro;360,000 was allocated in 2006; &euro;500,000 in 2007; &euro;520,000 in 2008; &euro;484,000 in 2009; &euro;436,000 in 2010; &euro;375,000 in 2011.  In addition, capital funding of &euro;5 million was allocated in 2007 towards the conservation and presentation of Fota House in County Cork.  This property was acquired by the Irish Heritage Trust that year.  The financial resources available to the trust have declined, in line with the significant reduction in funding to the built heritage in recent years.  These resources will continue to be constrained.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 38, 44 and 45, together.</P>
        <P>Culture Night 2011 will take place on Friday, 23 September 2011.  On culture night, arts and cultural organisations and venues, including the national cultural institutions, extend their opening hours until late in the evening to allow for increased free access to the various collections, workshops and other events.  Culture night has grown from a relatively small scale cultural <Col N="61"/>event staged in Dublin in 2006 to the significant national cultural event it now is, with over 500 cultural venues across 20 locations throughout the country participating in Culture Night 2010.</P>
        <P>Temple Bar Cultural Trust co-ordinates the Dublin culture night event in association with the Council of National Cultural Institutions, Temple Bar cultural quarter, Dublin City Council, art and cultural institutions and other agencies.  My Department has provided funding to the trust for the event since 2006 and in 2008 requested the trust to consider an expansion of the culture night model to cities and towns outside of Dublin.  The success of this matched-funding initiative in 2008 led to my Department agreeing to fund further expansions in 2009 and 2010.  Last year&rsquo;s event was the most extensive culture night to date, with the participation of locations from Cork to Donegal and Galway to Wexford, including Gaeltacht regions for the first time.</P>
        <P>Plans for the 2011 event are well under way and my Department recently invited applications for participation in regional Culture Night 2011.  We hope to further develop the 2011 event as a unique offering of memorable experiences involving local arts, culture, heritage and the community which hopefully would stimulate repeat visits to cultural attractions.</P>
        <P>Discussions are ongoing as to the most appropriate way to build on the success and popularity of culture night and these discussions include the feasibility of making culture night a twice yearly event as proposed in the programme for Government.  The Deputy will appreciate that these discussions must have regard to the resources available to my Department and to the many competing demands on these resources.  The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festival is currently the primary cultural festival during the spring and there may be scope for the development of an audience-focused cultural initiative as part of these festivities.  My Department and its agencies also support a much expanded music day, now held in early April each year.  My Department is in ongoing exploratory discussions with Temple Bar Cultural Trust in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the current economic climate it is essential to maximise the potential for cultural tourism.  The programme for Government has committed to extending culture night to two nights a year.  What criteria are used to identify locations for culture night?  Would the Minister consider including Youghal on the list of locations for Culture Night 2011?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the Deputy should ask the people of Youghal to make a submission to the Department or the trust.  It is important that a submission be made.  I will give some figures for Culture Night 2010 to demonstrate the spread of funding across the country.  A sum of &euro;10,000 was given to the organisers of Culture Night in Carlow, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Limerick, Mayo, Oughterard, Roscommon, Sligo, Waterford, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow.  There has been a very good spread across the country.  It is increasing in popularity.  I encourage more communities to get involved and participate in Culture Night, which makes a major impact.  It will take place this year on Friday, 23 September.  I suggest we should do something here in the D&aacute;il to celebrate and recognise Culture Night.  Before last Christmas, I was one of many Deputies from all parties who were involved in the organisation of a successful charity art exhibition that raised a substantial amount of money for Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin.  I suggest we might try to organise an event in the D&aacute;il to mark this year&rsquo;s Culture Night.</P>
        <P>I assure Deputy McLellan that the guidelines and criteria are quite flexible.  An emphasis has been placed on participation to encourage communities to get involved in Culture Night.  Funding is available to those who present good proposals.  As the broadest definition of &ldquo;culture&rdquo; is used on Culture Night, it can involve Irish traditional music, song and dance, etc.  Obviously it has to be culturally driven.  If there is a good spread and a good mix of applications, most of them will be successful.  I advise the Deputy to ensure an application is made on behalf <Col N="62"/>of Youghal to the Department or Temple Bar Cultural Trust as soon as possible.  I can give her the contact details if she wishes.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Great.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister can forward those details to me as well.  I am aware of many groups that are interested in Culture Night.  Many of them participated in previous Culture Night events and met their expenses from their own resources.  They did not get any funding from the State.  What level of funding is available for this year&rsquo;s Culture Night, which will take place on 23 September?</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke in his reply about the possibility of &ldquo;making Culture Night a twice yearly event&rdquo;, as proposed in the programme for Government.  It will depend on the availability of funding, as the Minister said.  I was a little worried to hear him indicate that St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day could be adopted as a second cultural day, as opposed to an actual Culture Night.  I would not see that as the ideal situation.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, which is all about being Irish, is our national patron&rsquo;s day and a public holiday and has been for a long time.  We do not need to identify it as a cultural day.  I would be inclined to say we should have a second specific Culture Night that is designated for promoting cultural awareness and driving economic activity in the culture and arts sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The total regional funding for this year&rsquo;s Culture Night, which was allocated before I took office, is &euro;150,000.  It is quite small.  The idea is to make small sums of money available to many communities.  One can do a great deal with a small amount of money.  An allocation of &euro;1,000 could be used to get musicians together in a single location, for example.  I find that a small amount of money can leverage an awful lot of value in the arts.  People are happy to get a small amount of money to cover their expenses, such as hiring venues and compensating those who have to travel.  The moneys that have been provided to date have been well spent and well funded.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a second Culture Night.  That is being examined.  I think it might be a good idea to link it to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  There is major and widespread interest in cultural events throughout the country at that time of the year.  The quality and diversity of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parades has improved considerably by comparison with previous times.  As politicians, we attend parades and view them from platforms.  A great effort is made in parts of the country that are keen to represent their own unique culture.  This year, I attended parades in Tralee, Listowel, Abbeyfeale and Abbeydorney.  To give a local example, the parade in Abbeydorney, which is an agricultural parish, had a focus on the land.  There was a great display of vintage tractors, ploughs and everything associated with the land.  Such events reveal aspects of Irish culture and heritage that might not be demonstrated during the rest of the year.  Therefore, I suggest it might not be a bad idea to connect any second Culture Night event with St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  I take the point made by Deputy Troy.</P>
        <P>Culture Night is well established.  It represents good value for money.  We leverage a great deal of activity from it.  As long as I am in this Ministry, I will promote the notion that there should be more widespread participation in it and that it should be of greater national benefit to all communities.  Culture Night should not be confined to those communities that are aware of it and have capitalised on the grants scheme to date.  The small fund that is available should be more widely distributed.</P>

        <Quest>      the number <Col N="63"/>of institutions that fall within his remit; the number of these institutions that have defibrillators; the number of these defibrillators which are operational; the number of staff in each of these institutions trained to use a defibrillator; the names and location of any of these institutions that are without a defibrillator; the names and location of any of these institutions that are without staff that can operate a defibrillator.     </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the eight national cultural institutions that come within the remit of my Department.  I am advised that each of them, with the exception of the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, the National Archives in Dublin and the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork, has defibrillators in place and that all of the defibrillators are operational.  It should be noted that the three institutions that do not have defibrillators have staff that are trained in the use of defibrillators and are examining their options with regard to the purchase of such devices.  I will give the specific details sought by the Deputy.  The National Museum of Ireland has four defibrillators and 22 staff are trained to operate them.  The National Library of Ireland has four defibrillators and ten trained staff.  The National Gallery of Ireland has three defibrillators and 51 trained staff.  The National Concert Hall has one defibrillator and eight trained staff.  The Irish Museum of Modern Art has two defibrillators and 12 trained staff.  While the Chester Beatty Library has no defibrillator at present, six staff are trained to operate such equipment.  In the case of the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork, which also has no defibrillator at present, seven staff are trained to operate such equipment.  Three members of the staff of the National Archives are trained to operate defibrillators.  I hope it may be possible to ensure defibrillators are provided at these institutions at an early date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is anecdotal evidence that some private leisure centres which cater for all age groups do not have defibrillators or do not have adequate trained personnel to operate defibrillators.  I remind the Minister of the importance of defibrillators being available in public places and workplaces.  Will he commit to promoting the installation of defibrillators, and the training of personnel in their use, across all bodies covered by his Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question has brought attention to the fact I am responsible for three institutions that do not have defibrillators.  Obviously, they will be asked to provide such equipment.  I agree with the Deputy on the question of the broader availability of defibrillators.  I know people whose lives were saved because of the presence of defibrillators.  It is important that people know how to use them where they are provided.  It is important that continuous training and refresher courses on the use of the defibrillators are provided as improper use can cause harm.  Such equipment is required at locations where large numbers of people congregate, including sporting and cultural events.  A significant number of staff in the various national institutions have been trained in the use of defibrillators and trained staff are available in the three cultural institutions which do not have defibrillators.  I hope this equipment will be provided as a result of Deputy McLellan raising the matter. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Minister expect the equipment will be provided?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue has now been highlighted in the House.  Defibrillators are inexpensive but important equipment.  The National Gallery of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland each have four defibrillators and the National Museum of Ireland has three of them.  There is no reason, therefore, that the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork should not have such equipment, especially given its significant throughput of people.  A large number of people were present when I visited the gallery recently and the current exhibition is attracting a large <Col N="64"/>number of visitors.  It is important, therefore, that the Crawford Art Gallery would have a defibrillator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the 1990s, the national cultural Institutions, which are charged with enhancing and expanding the national collections of cultural artefacts, had been experiencing increasing difficulties in acquiring privately owned artefacts and collections of heritage importance due to the high prices that such items were obtaining at sales and public auctions.  To help surmount these difficulties, the Heritage Fund was established so that the relevant national cultural institutions could acquire heritage objects which are outstanding examples of their type and pre-eminent in their class. </P>
        <P>The Heritage Fund Act 2001 established the Heritage Fund with an overall limit of funding of &euro;12.697 million over a five year period. Funding was granted as follows: &euro;3,809,214 in the financial year 2001; &euro;2,539,476 in each of the financial years 2002, 2003 and 2004; and &euro;1,269,738 in the financial year 2005.  The five eligible institutions that may benefit from the Heritage Fund are the National Archives, the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland, the National Museum of Ireland and the Irish Museum of Modern Art.</P>
        <P>The Heritage Fund remains in place and currently contains &euro;215,539.90 in funding.  The amount in the fund is below the amount laid down in the legislation for an individual acquisition and, as the existing legislation does not allow for replenishment of the fund, new primary legislation is necessary before any further acquisition can be made.  A scheme of a new Bill for this legislation has been drafted in my Department.  However, any progress on this will be dependent on availability of funding from the Exchequer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>While Sinn F&eacute;in supports the principle of having a heritage fund to secure assets of national importance, is the fund fit for purpose in its current form?  How many staff are employed with specific responsibility for administering the fund?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As matters stand, if an important artefact of national importance were to come on the market, the Heritage Fund could not intervene and purchase the object on behalf of the State.  We must review the position in this regard.  The State has made major acquisitions through the Heritage Fund.  In 2002, the National Library of Ireland used the fund to acquire the first tranche of the Joyce papers, the value of which at the time was more than &euro;6.2 million.  The total value of acquisitions, which included further tranches of the Joyce papers in 2003 and 2004, was approximately &euro;12 million.  If the Heritage Fund had not been available, the State would not have acquired these important papers.  If finance is not available to purchase important collections that become available in future, they could be lost to the State forever as it may subsequently become impossible to acquire them.</P>
        <P>I advocated the establishment of a heritage fund and supported the fund when it was introduced.  It is an important instrument through which the State can acquire important memorabilia, papers and artefacts which are scattered throughout the world and may come up for auction.  Sufficient funding should be available in the fund to ensure the State is in a position to step in and acquire items that could be valuable to the country so that their benefits are not lost to a private collection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>On Thursday, 24 February, my canvass team was tired, worn out and tense, the weather was not ideal and there were only hours to go before election day.  One of my sons, who was out of a job at the time, was on the team when a very angry lady constituent in Goatstown opened the hall door of her house.  The following day, which was election day, she wrote me an e-mail, which I propose to read to the House.  It stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Dear Mr Mathews,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">This is both a message of good luck for today, and also an apology.  Last night, a young polite friendly man knocked on my door canvassing for you. [It was my son].  It was five minutes after I had learned that my second (and last) child is about to move abroad to find work, and I was totally heartbroken.  Her brother left eighteen months ago.  I just wish it had been a Fianna F&aacute;il candidate (or Sinn F&eacute;in) who had knocked on the door at that moment.  They would have been more deserving of my comments.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I have read your manifesto; I will be giving you one of my top votes, and I wish you, and our poor country, the very best.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">If by any chance you happen to know who the unfortunate young man was, would you please pass him my apologies, and give him my best wishes. Also congratulate him on managing to get your leaflet into my hands despite my anger, and because of him you will get my vote.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The reason I read this out is although we are only 45 working days into this new Government it is important, good, helpful and the right move to have a jobs initiative.  Many Members opposite have noted there are good points in this jobs initiative, which is the case.  However, only last week, Members discussed another document, namely, the programme review of the <Col N="66"/>EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland, wherein our Minister for Finance and Governor of the Central Bank were forced to give those who tighten the laces on our straitjacket an update report on what we are trying to do to balance our budgets and to fix the country.</P>
        <P>I will not take Members through the individual headings in this initiative because there has been much discussion of them and Members already are familiar with the VAT reduction rate to 9% for tourism in respect of hotels and restaurants, as well as hairdressers and so on.  These are positive measures that show the Government is trying to think creatively and is trying, within the straitjacket, to get some movement towards ways of rethinking things out and of re-engineering jobs and work through traineeships and all the rest.  However, what this really tells all Members is that a great lump of lead is weighing down the economy and is suffocating it and one must drill through and find out what it is.  More accurately, although we know what it is, some people try to argue that Ireland can continue to bear this load and knapsack because it is manageable.  While the sentiment in that regard is okay, the measurement is all wrong.  This is the reason that when Morgan Kelly of UCD wrote his opinion article in last Saturday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, he returned to the measurement problem and got it right.  The onus is on all 166 Members to get across the message of the measurement to those who need to hear it because the approach to the answer which one can anticipate is becoming more clear and Members must be courageous and must highlight that area of answer.</P>
        <P>It is possible for everyone to admit that the losses as a result of a massive credit and fixed asset price bubble following a &euro;200 billion surge of lending over four years will result in losses of &euro;100 billion and such a scale of losses now is beginning to be recognised.  However, this message has reached those who have come with the bailout or assistance package from the European Union, the ECB and the IMF in a foggy way.  They have been listening to a confused and bewildered story for the past two years and it is time for Members to sharpen the focus by getting to them the first page of a three-page message.  Three A4 pages are needed to tell the story and to give an update report both to ourselves and to the people within the European Economic Community.  Incidentally, I like the old nomenclature because it has the emphasis on the word &ldquo;community&rdquo;.  The first A4 page must show the losses, their location and how they arose.  That is easy and as I have just noted, they will be approximately &euro;100 billion.  We are on our way to getting there and the stress test report was published on 31 March.  Fair dues to the Minister for Finance who took the expensive reports commissioned approximately three months before the change of Government from BlackRock Solutions, Barclays Capital and the Boston Consulting Group.  That was tweaked and edited, indicating a capital requirement of &euro;70 billion.  However, I suggest that &euro;100 billion is a meaningful figure because only &euro;50 billion of losses had been recognised up to the end of September 2010.  That constitutes 50% of the story and may be the reason the ECB and the people in Europe decided to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the initial approaches that there might be loans write-downs of amounts due from our banks to the ECB or to senior bondholders.  However, were we to update them on the true extent of losses, it would concentrate the mind.</P>
        <P>The second A4 page should explain that at present, funding in the banks comprises approximately &euro;170 billion of loans advanced by the ECB and the Central Bank of Ireland to our banks, while there still remain unredeemed senior and other bondholders of approximately &euro;50 billion.  Everyone knows, and people like Morgan Kelly and others remind us, that this is too great a load of debt.  In particular, if a bailout package of &euro;85 billion, or &euro;55 billion net, that was signed up to at the end of November 2010 is too big a load for a small economy to work its way through, one must then examine what can be done about it.  If, as is the case, &euro;70 billion of the loans advanced by the European Central Bank into our banks within that &euro;170 billion <Col N="67"/>derive from loans made to redeem senior bondholders in full up to the end of last year, then they really are loans advanced to fund losses.  However, the people of Ireland were not involved in creating those losses.  This is another story, analysis or explanation to be told to Ireland&rsquo;s counterparts and one must ensure they understand it.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I suggest the third A4 page should have a solution, namely, there should be debt write-down in the order of perhaps &euro;75 billion, of which &euro;50 billion would be presented to the ECB and &euro;25 billion to the remaining senior bondholders in the banks.  This would represent a 50% write-down of senior bondholders from &euro;50 billion to &euro;25 billion.  It would suggest a write-down of &euro;50 billion or one third on the loans advanced by the ECB to banks which, when one mixes them together, stand at approximately &euro;170 billion.  Members should consider the scale of such a write-down in the context of the affairs of the European Central Bank and of Europe in general.  The European Union has a gross domestic product, GDP, of approximately &euro;9 trillion and Ireland&rsquo;s gross domestic product is approximately &euro;150 billion.  A write-down of debt owed by our banks to the ECB of &euro;50 billion comprises one third of our GDP.  As our GDP represents approximately 1.5% of the GDP of the European Union, then one third of that constitutes 0.5% of the total.  Were such a report to be given to the European authorities clearly, in full detail and explanation and showing the provenance of the figures, they probably would begin to understand it, particularly were one to tell them that 0.5% of the European Union&rsquo;s GDP is the write-down requirement necessary against the loans due to the ECB.</P>

        <P>Too often Members on this side of the House are accused of being negative about everything.  I like to believe we honestly say what we feel.  If what we tell the coalition is sometimes negative, that is unfortunate.  I agree that the jobs initiative contains some good provisions.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, was honest when he stated it was a modest measure and a start.  It is a small monetary investment in the economy, a principle in which I believe.  The philosophy of John Maynard Keynes took the world out of recession in the 1930s and is preferable to Milton Friedman&rsquo;s, of which we have seen too much in the past 30 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It would be great if we had more money to invest in this fashion.  For example, we are to repair 800 km of roadway.  The Minister without portfolio, Deputy Brendan Howlin, mentioned how bad the roads seemed to be during the election campaign in County Wexford, an issue about which I also know.  The roads are atrocious, but I did not promise anyone that I would fix them.  As Deputies can imagine, 800 km is not much.  In County Wexford alone there are 3,200 km of non-national roads.  While fixing 800 km nationwide is a start, I hope there will be more of this work.  Likewise, the money to be spent on school infrastructure is welcome, not only for the kids in leaky prefabs but also for a small section of the construction industry which is labour intensive.  I know from experience that construction workers are inclined to spend money.  They will stimulate the economy if we can find them enough work.</P>
        <P>The VAT and PRSI measures will be welcomed by the hotel and restaurant industries, in particular.  I have the good fortune to run five wine bars-restaurants and these measures will make a sizable difference to us in managing our businesses.  Our industry has been struggling with difficulties.  I employ more than 50 people and these measures will help me to stop shedding jobs.  Whether they will create more is difficult to say.  More people must spend money in our restaurants, but they cannot do so because they have none.  If the banks start lending again, it will be a significant step in the right direction.  Since September 2008 we have believed we can throw money at the banks and that they will eventually start lending with it, but the Government must play an active role in ensuring they are open for business.  This would make a significant difference.  I am surprised and disappointed, therefore, that the strategic investment bank has not been mentioned in the jobs initiative.  Perhaps the Government is bringing it on stream, as something of that nature would be of considerable help.</P>
        <P>The most disappointing element of the programme is the picking on pension schemes to come up with money.  It does not grow on trees and must come from somewhere, but it is unfortunate that many of the people who made sacrifices during the years to save for pensions are to be treated unfairly.  As Deputy Shane Ross stated yesterday, it is as if we are robbing them for their savings.  It is not right.  The Government might ask where we would get the money from if we did not take it from such schemes.  As Deputy John Halligan pointed out yesterday, foreign companies operating in Ireland are making annual profits of &euro;32 billion.  While we do not want to frighten them away, since we appreciate how much work they provide and how important they are to the country, large global companies must make a fair contribution to our society, given how well they are doing out of it.  It would be terrible to see Ireland go to the wall in order that these companies could keep their large profits.  It would be great if the Government sought money from that source.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The jobs initiative announced yesterday must be a considerable source of disappointment to the Members on the other side of the House given what was promised a few short weeks ago.  During the election campaign they were talking up the five point plan under which 100,000 jobs were to be created.  The Taoiseach told people to read his lips and that the Government would create 100,000 jobs without ever explaining how.  We had a jobs budget in the programme for Government that quickly became a jobs initiative after our <Col N="69"/>so-called partners in the troika had got hold of it and told the Government, &ldquo;No way.&rdquo;  Most of the jobs initiative could have been announced in a couple of press releases from the relevant Departments.  There was no need to take up a week of the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s time to hear statements on the minor adjustments contained in the plan.  In the announcement the Minister made much of the return to growth, but he failed to mention the projected growth figure of 0.5% for this year.  He played up the figures for next year and beyond.  I hope these will come to pass, but, given how far out the figures for this year have been, it remains to be seen what will happen.</P>
        <P>The plan has some positive elements.  The reduction in the rate of VAT for tourism-related industries will be of benefit.  I hope it will lead to greater spending as a result of increased tourist numbers.  It is difficult to see how the reduction in the rate of VAT applying to vending machines will make any contribution.  It will contribute to reductions in the cost of junk food in our schools, all of which seem to have vending machines, and increased spending by our young people.</P>
        <P>The removal of the travel tax is also welcome, as it made no sense in the first instance.  Unfortunately, airlines such as Ryanair will probably find ways to levy the tax in extra hidden charges that will increase their profitability.</P>
        <P>As outlined in the House, rather than tax the pension funds of hard pressed private sector workers, a tax on the massive fees charged by and the hidden charges of pension companies would be fairer and possibly raise as much revenue.  It remains to be seen if the Taoiseach will seriously take this suggestion on board and tax companies rather than savers.  It will grate with the people who are constantly being told about the pensions time bomb and encouraged to contribute more and more to their pension funds to have the State levy these funds even at a rate as low as 2.5% for the lifetime of the tax.</P>
        <P>The plan includes measures to allow the universities to hire researchers who will not be covered by the embargo.  It is doubtful if there is any direct commercialisation of research that will contribute significantly to our economic recovery.  In the United States the income from intellectual property only accounts for 4% of the universities&rsquo; income.  Encouraging universities to provide research and support for SMEs which could contribute to, for example, the food industry would be a more worthwhile development.  The food industry has real growth potential, including export-led growth.  This could also be the case in the SME sector.  It is interesting that in Estonia and Slovenia more than 23% and 21% of SMEs, respectively, are exporters, while in Ireland only 11% of such enterprises export, with just 4.2% of revenue coming from these exports.  If we want export-led growth, we should be targeting the creation of export-led SMEs and the food sector is where growth can be achieved.  In the United Kingdom more than 30% of jobs are in the SME sector, yet our focus has been almost exclusively on foreign direct investment to grow exports.  A real jobs initiative would focus on changing that while still encouraging foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>There are revenue-neutral stimulus plans that could have been included in this plan if the Government were so inclined.  I raised the issue of business plans for fishery harbour centres in this House a few weeks ago, particularly with regard to my own town of Killybegs, where the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has large blocks of land lying idle.  Without any cost to the Government, these tracts of land could be utilised for investment purposes and contribute to job creation in unemployment black spots.</P>
        <P>There is no mention in the plan of the upward only rent reviews that are crippling small businesses and closing many of them down.  The State as a landlord also operates upward-only reviews.  Changing this policy would have real benefits for businesses and ensure they can survive and grow.  It would also mean this plan would have a real impact.</P><Col N="70"/>
        <P>Another area in which real jobs could be created is in the development of an indigenous wood-for-fuel industry.  We already produce enough wood to heat the entire country, in fact we produce five times more wood than is necessary for this.  Utilising our forests to develop an indigenous industry and incentivising homes and buildings to change over to wood for heat would in the long run offset over &euro;2 billion in imports of home heating oil.  The existing delivery systems could be changed over and adapted to the new fuel.  This would create large numbers of jobs in rural areas harvesting wood.  Instead of being sold off, Coillte&rsquo;s forests could be used to support this new industry.  This could also eventually stimulate the development of an indigenous industry in the provision of home heating equipment.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative that the Government has outlined is a modest plan.  It should provide some benefit in the tourism sector.  The internship programme should give much-needed experience to educated graduates that will help them on the road to a career but strong measures must be in place to ensure that employers do not use it as a cheap form of labour and that it does not displace real jobs.  It is a modest plan and apart from the tourism changes it is really much ado about nothing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I said on my first day here that if I saw good things being done by the Government I would welcome them.  I welcome the reduction in the air travel tax, which will cost &euro;210 million.  I also welcome the reduction in PRSI, which over the lifetime of the plan will cost &euro;405 million, and the introduction of training places.  However, having listened to Deputy Adams earlier, I must concur with him in his view that it seems more like a plan for a medium-sized town than for a country.  Considering the number of unemployed people in the Shannon-side region, where I come from, it is clear that the number of training places would not be enough even for them.  However, the Minister said it was a modest proposal, so that is fair enough.</P>
        <P>There is one part of the initiative with which I seriously disagree, namely the plans for spending the &euro;880 million that will be obtained from pension funds over the term of the programme.  It is proposed to reduce VAT from 13.5% to 9%.  If we had the money to do this, it would be of benefit.  However, with the amount of money we are talking about &mdash; &euro;880 million &mdash; there are so many better things that could have been done.  I do not want to sound parochial, talking only about my constituency, but it is the area I understand best.  If we were to break down that &euro;880 million on a per-head-of-population basis, it would mean that over the term of the jobs initiative, we could provide &euro;17.6 million to my constituency to help develop projects.  How would this money be distributed?  It could be handed out through the development companies.  There was great hurrah a couple of years ago when the Leader companies joined together and formed the Roscommon Integrated Development Company, and &euro;12.8 million was available over a three-year period.  We could double that amount.</P>
        <P>What would we spend it on?  In areas such as the one I come from, we could increase employment by developing products that we currently use but that are produced outside the area.  With this money, we could develop six micro-breweries in my constituency with no problem.  We could set up markets in every town with a population of 1,000 or more.  What benefit would that have?  I did a study in advance of the general election in which I discovered that in 2010, people in my constituency spent &euro;13.5 million on draught beer and stout and &euro;9 million on fruit and vegetables.  Of course we could never produce all that locally but if we produced 50% of it locally it would introduce an extra &euro;14 million into our economy.</P>
        <P>Benefits to tourism have been mentioned.  We could also benefit tourism by developing a product.  In my constituency, we have easy access to Sligo, Galway and Knock airports, and there are two train lines.  We have eight golf courses.  We have the longest border with the <Col N="71"/>mightiest river in Great Britain and Ireland, and we could develop a serious tourism product based on this.  We could have used that money to put advertisements in Stansted Airport.  We could have used it to develop facilities such as Castlerea swimming pool, which would have cost only &euro;0.5 million, would have employed ten people for the year and would attract more tourists to the area.  Unfortunately, the Government has made a decision that instead of doing that, it will reduce the price of a can of Coca-Cola by about 10 cent and entrance into a cinema by 50 cent &mdash; which would be great if we had enough money to do so.  However, this pool of money should have been used to develop products and services in my area and areas all over the country, which would have been of benefit to us.</P>
        <P>While it might sound parochial for me to talk about tourism just in my area, there are many other areas that have similar needs.  When we talk about tourism, we nearly always talk about Galway, Kerry, Dublin and all the clich&eacute;d places.  These are great places to visit but there are also wonderful places such as the area I come from where we could create jobs out of a tourism industry.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that there was no mention of rates in this initiative.  I have a proposal for reducing rates.  We could get rid of 75% of the glorified ribbon-cutters otherwise known as county councillors from around the country and strip out the level of director of services from every council in the country.  I can easily prove that rates could be reduced in my area by25%, making it more viable for people to go into business.  However, I have not seen anything like this.</P>
        <P>The initiative is a modest proposal because of a shortage of money but it could have been a wonderful proposal.  Instead of reducing the price of a can of Coca-Cola, we could have had, in three years&rsquo; time, six new micro-breweries in County Roscommon and a market in every decent-sized town in the area, with our farmers selling their produce directly to people.  A farmer who earned money from this could then have a door hung or a house painted, giving money to more people, who would then spend it on cabbage and potatoes to eat, and the money would go around.  Unfortunately, the Government has gone for something very simple which has not been thought out.  Is there any chance that the Government would leave the price of a can of Coca-Cola or a cinema ticket the same in my constituency and give us the &euro;17.6 million instead?  We will drive job creation in our area.  That is how to do it.</P>

	<P>No matter which economist one believes &mdash; we have quite a number to choose from &mdash; the bottom line is that we are in a dire situation, and there is a real fear that we are facing bankruptcy.  I wonder whether we have time to continue with adversarial politics in this country.  There was an interesting exchange this morning in the House in which somebody on this side &mdash; Deputy Ross &mdash; made a suggestion that the Taoiseach, on that side, was prepared to consider.  It is not the prerogative of the Government but of this House to come up with a jobs initiative.  If we had taken that approach, inviting people from all sides of the House to make suggestions, we might have come up with a more comprehensive plan, although this is not to deny the good that is in this initiative.</P>
        <P>Seanfhocal, &ldquo;T&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre&rdquo;.  A strong foundation is needed.  Is the Government laying out mechanisms for high-quality economic activity over the long term, which will bring stability to Irish society, or is it a short-term, volatile fix subject to the vagaries of greedy global markets and the quick-buck gombeen men, both foreign and domestic?</P><Col N="72"/>
        <P Just="Left">One positive aspect is the summer works programme for schools.  The money will be provided to those projects that are ready to start immediately.  T&aacute; Gaelscoil Bharra, i gCabrach, r&eacute;idh chun tos&uacute; leis an obair.  T&aacute; siad ag fanacht ar scoil nua le fada an l&aacute; anois, agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh siad sa sc&eacute;im seo.  I hope the plans for two further bundles of the public private partnership schools programme will be based on real need and not influenced by voting considerations, as has happened in the past.  I also hope that the internship scheme will offer a high quality experience and that the people involved will learn significantly and make a contribution.  It should not be just another type of slave labour.</P>
        <P>Our corporation tax rate appears set in stone as our salvation but I repeat that we cannot be a tax haven for multinationals avoiding paying their just taxes in their own countries.  As to exactly how much of this 12.5% tax is collected, there are disquieting reports of companies paying as little as 2%.  Of that 12.5% tax collected, how much will be invested in jobs-focused growth?</P>
        <P>Job retention is also important.  I appeal for community-based projects working with people with addiction issues, with youth, with Travellers and with unaccompanied young minors.  They provide a very valuable service at very little cost.  To cut those kinds of jobs would prove very problematic in the long run.</P>
        <P>Many of us attended the See Change meeting this morning.  We saw people there who coped with adversity, isolation and mental illness and they had such a positive message for all of us.  There is a positive message for all of us, namely, that we have to grasp the nettle and look forward.</P>

	<P>The devastating economic legacy inherited by this Government demands that we fundamentally re-examine what we do and look for new approaches.  Our economic difficulties may be daunting but they also present us with an opportunity to question existing practices, how we do business and the role of Departments.</P>
        <P>For too long Government has made piecemeal decisions and policy has developed on a fragmented departmental basis.  The traditional economic Ministries have usually exclusively addressed economic issues and other Ministries have concentrated on their discrete areas of responsibility.  Neither the Department of Justice and Equality nor the Department of Defence would, in the past, have been perceived as having something substantial to contribute to economic growth or job creation in the private sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In so far as the Department of Justice and Equality has impacted on the economy, it has been essentially in a regulatory sense, for example, in the context of prescribing the rules applicable to publicans and off-licences or relating to the legal profession or to insolvency.  Yet decisions made in these areas impact not just on public order issues or on curtailing unacceptable practices within the legal profession or in protecting creditors, they also impact on how business operates, on the capacity of business to create and sustain jobs and on the wider domestic economy.  There are a broad range of initiatives that can be taken in the justice <Col N="73"/>area not only to modernise and reform our laws and increase competition in a manner that ensures we properly address the issues and dilemmas of this 21st century but to ensure that our laws do not act as a barrier to growth and recovery and contribute to job creation.</P>
        <P>It is not only a question of law reform.  There is much that can be done in how we administer our existing laws and improve administrative practices that can contribute to economic development, reduce the costs of Government and generate confidence in our future.  Reforming inefficient bureaucratic practices no longer fit for purpose has much to contribute and I will return to this theme on another day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the area of innovation, research and development, business start-ups and job creation, in addition to playing their important traditional roles, the Department of Defence and our Defence Forces have much to contribute.  I visited the Naval Service at Haulbowline in Cork on Monday of this week and the National Maritime College of Ireland and I am hugely impressed with the links between the Navy, the college and innovative small companies developing products in collaboration with the Naval Service, to the benefit of the service, that have the potential to create substantial employment in the future and contribute to our export growth.  There is a great deal more that can be done in this area by companies collaborating with our defence establishment to the benefit of our Defence Forces, as a contribution to economic growth and to the overall benefit of this country, as part of the defence organisations transformation agenda.  This is an area I intend, as Minister of two great Departments served by talented public servants, to vigorously pursue.</P>
        <P>I now turn to the specific initiative I have announced today with regard to the area of visas which are the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It has been my view for some time that we need to ensure that our visa regulatory framework does not act as a barrier to expanding our tourism industry and as a disincentive to potential visitors to this State.  In the context of the dramatic contraction that has occurred in the number of tourist visitors to Ireland, it is vital to ensure that this State is an easily accessible and attractive holiday and business destination and that the tens of thousands who visit the United Kingdom as our immediate neighbour have an incentive to spend some time with us on this island.  While the UK and American markets have been a central focal point for our tourism industry, I have for some time believed that much more can be done to attract tourists to this State from growing and emerging markets and to make visits here a good deal easier.</P>
        <P>In this context, I am very happy to announce the details of a very significant initiative in the area of visa liberalisation.  The programme will be on a pilot basis but it is capable of being extended if all goes well.  As things stand, a person coming to the UK for a short-term visit who needs a visa from the UK authorities makes an application and pays the necessary fees to obtain the visa required.  However, if that person wants to include Ireland on his or her itinerary, he or she requires a separate visa and has to repeat the same form filling and procedure with the Irish authorities and await the decision on his or her visa application.  He or she also has to pay the Irish visa fee.  It is not difficult to see how this can be a disincentive to those who might want to consider a trip to Ireland as an add-on extra to the United Kingdom.  Given the large number of tourists annually visiting the UK and, in particular, those who will visit for the 2012 Olympics, Ireland risks losing out on a substantial tourism spin off.  We also have people from visa required countries who come to the UK to do business and who currently might, for the same bureaucratic reasons, be dissuaded from flying to Ireland for additional business meetings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The nature of the new arrangement is as follows.  Nationals of 14 countries, who ordinarily need a visa to enter the State, at a cost of &euro;60, who obtain a visa to enter the UK for a short-term visit up to 180 days and want to travel from there to Ireland will not require an additional <Col N="74"/>visa for Ireland.  The countries to whom the scheme applies are as follows: Belarus, Montenegro, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Turkey, the Ukraine, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, India, the People&rsquo;s Republic of China and Uzbekistan.  The list will be kept under review in the light of experience and other countries may be added to it over the course of the programme.  This is a major change in public policy &mdash; it is the first time that Ireland has contemplated such a scheme and, as such, it is proposed that it be pilot-tested from July of this year, that is, 1 July to October 2012.</P>
        <P>From the perspective of potential visitors, it will save them the inconvenience of applying for visas and all the associated, but necessary, form filling and document submission.  In addition, there are significant cost savings, for example, if a family of four from, for example, India want to travel to Ireland as part of a trip to London, the cost of visas to them currently would come to the sum of &euro;240.  This will be zero-rated from 1 July.  Last year approximately 30,000 people were issued visas from the participating countries to come here.  These visitors helped to provide and maintain jobs in our economy.  This new measure provides the potential for substantial growth in our visitor numbers and a much needed boost for our tourism industry.</P>
        <P>This is not a simple stroke of a pen measure.  Immigration is a complex issue and proposals for change demand careful thought.  Immigration abuse is a major issue with potential to expose the Exchequer to very substantial losses if we get things wrong.  However, my officials have looked at the potential risks and are satisfied that the way the scheme is set out addresses any concerns there might be in this area.  Of particular importance is that the persons concerned have already entered the United Kingdom legally on foot of a valid visa and have passed through immigration control there.</P>
        <P>The common travel area between Ireland and the UK is a cornerstone of the close relationship between our two countries.  It has survived many threats over the years and remains alive and well.  It has been a major influence in economic development, commerce and tourism and is indispensable to tens of thousands of people on this island as they go about their daily lives.  Today&rsquo;s announcement will serve to further underscore that close relationship and our common interest in protecting, nurturing and enhancing it.  What makes the common travel area possible is the close co-operation between our two countries in immigration and security matters and in protecting our collective borders.  The measures I introduce will enhance the potential of the common travel area to deliver economic benefits to this State.</P>
        <P>I will not go so far as to suggest that these measures will transform our tourism industry but they have the potential, if properly followed through, to significantly increase our tourist visitor numbers.  The vast majority of our tourists currently come from the UK, the rest of the EU and the United States and they do not need visas.  What these measures will do is allow the industry to pursue with confidence new opportunities in emerging markets for add-on tourism from people going to the UK.  The pilot period for the new scheme will include the London Olympics.  Together with the availability of cheap online flights and ferries, it should open up the possibility of attracting a significant number of new visitors to this State at low cost to them.  It will also help tourism on an all-Ireland basis so that key market visa required travellers in Northern Ireland can now come South as part of their trip.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new arrangements announced today are a challenge and an opportunity to all airlines and shipping companies that provide services between Ireland and the UK to target for new business in the 14 countries named and I look forward to their responding to this new opportunity to create new customer markets.</P>
        <P>In addition, special arrangements will be put in place to facilitate visits by nationals of the listed countries who are long-term residents in the UK and for visitors on cruise liners.  In the <Col N="75"/>case of the latter, the Department has very recently agreed a set of procedures with representatives of cruise liners which will facilitate the easy embarkation of passengers at ports.  It was indicated that more than 80 cruise liners &mdash; some with more than 2,000 passengers &mdash; are likely to call at Irish ports this season.</P>
        <P>While the need for immigration control is undiminished I am committed to the Department of Justice and Equality taking on an increasingly proactive role in using our immigration system as a tool to assist economic development.  We will do so in a sensible way in consultation with colleagues and will use the accumulated expertise in immigration matters to inform policy changes.  Any changes we make will be very carefully considered.</P>
        <P>I do not see these reform measures as the end of a process but rather as a significant new beginning and an important milestone in the contribution of the Department of Justice and Equality to the roadmap to recovery.  There are more things we want to do in this area.  For example, we have to look at how we can configure our immigration system so that it does more to encourage entrepreneurship and investment.  My Department is drawing up proposals in this area at present and will work through these with the relevant stakeholders shortly.</P>
        <P>We are also working on revamping our immigration categories to provide a more diversified set of permissions that can be better tailored to cater for different migration scenarios.  We will continue to reform the student immigration system, working in tandem with the Department of Education and Skills and the State agencies involved in the promotion of Ireland as a high quality destination for international students.</P>
        <P>The message I want to send today, as the Minister responsible for immigration, is the same as that from other parts of Government, namely that &ldquo;Ireland is very much open for business&rdquo;.  I am happy that my Department, in the context of the Department of Justice and Equality, is able to make a significant contribution to that overall strategy and it will continue to do so into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, for introducing this visa waiver policy.  In the short time he has been in office, he has shown courage and the conviction to see it will work.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has also put his weight behind the programme.</P>
        <P>In this new and different global era, we must think outside the box and do things differently.  Traditionally, we in County Donegal always felt there was a weighted exodus of tourists from America to the south to counties Kerry and Clare.  At the time, Donegal, as a Border county, had to deal with the perception of conflict which did not instil confidence among tourists.  However, Border areas have relied on Northern Ireland tourists.  In the past several weeks, we have recorded in Donegal a sharp increase in Northern Ireland tourist numbers again, even as far north as the Inishowen Peninsula.</P>
        <P>Efforts in promoting Donegal tourism are made by F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s county office, Tourism Ireland, the Donegal Local Development Company and the county enterprise board.  Their aim is to think locally but act globally.  For example, a Donegal live event will be held in Dublin on 22 May to highlight and advertise Donegal&rsquo;s full tourism potential.  In the past, a similar event was held in Glasgow and, in August, one will be held in America with Derry tourism agencies to entice tourists from there.</P>
        <P>To change how we market this country&rsquo;s tourism industry, we must work on initiatives such as those announced today.  In 2008, I was given the responsibility by my party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, to head up a Border counties forum to examine policy creation.  The forum examined the bilateral arrangements for visa waivers between North and South and Britain <Col N="76"/>and the Republic of Ireland.  I am delighted that as an Opposition Member then I could formulate and take this policy to Government.</P>
        <P>Members across on the Opposition benches should see Parliament as a conduit for policy.  Policy, they should remember, does not fall from the sky.  Many in the media think policy should be created only in Dublin and politicians should spend their time in the House scrutinising legislation, Monday to Friday.  That is not how politics or policy formulation works.  Policy comes from the people on the ground.  The only way we can frame it is if we listen attentively to what the people suggest.  The visa waiver policy announced today by the Minister for Justice and Equality came from suggestions from tourism industry representatives.  They noticed declining numbers in American and UK visitors and sought new markets.  By listening, politicians can formulate plans that are good for the country and instil confidence.</P>
        <P>I notice a wry smile on Deputy Timmy Dooley&rsquo;s face opposite.  We in Donegal are not looking to take any tourists from Clare.  I congratulate both Ministers for running with this visa waiver programme.  I also thank the Labour Party for ensuring the policy was included in the joint programme for Government and did not fall between the gaps.  The policy is a good example of how Government and Parliament should work.  When the new committees are established, I look forward to driving similarly constructive and co-operative agendas that can be worked on by both sides of the House.</P>
        <P>This visa waiver programme is an example of a new way of thinking about tourism.  We must begin inviting tourists from Bangalore, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Uzbekistan as we have invited those from America.</P>

	<P>Every Member wishes the jobs initiative announced yesterday by the Minister for Finance well and hopes it will put a serious dent in the live register figure of almost 440,000 people.  We are all acutely aware of the upheaval and devastation that unemployment brings to a family.  It did not take the general election to bring it home to us but, while canvassing, we all met thousands directly affected by the blight of unemployment.  It is up to Members of this House to come up with initiatives and measures that are implementable and which ultimately will be successful.  In that regard, it is important we give careful scrutiny to the jobs initiative.  Were those of us on the Opposition side to come into the House and simply compliment the Government on its great initiative and wish it success, we would be doing a disservice to the Government and the people we represent.  It is our function to give it critical appraisal, a function we intend to fulfil.</P>
        <P>I will deal later with the thrust of the proposal, namely, the reduction in VAT and PRSI.  First, I would like to touch on the activation measures announced yesterday by the Minister in regard to the provision of approximately 21,000 additional places in training, education and internships.  While in the context of a live register figure of 440,000 this might appear insignificant, these places are, however, in addition to in excess of 100,000 training and education places already in place.  It is important we target the resources going into training and education to areas of need in the economy and areas wherein there are skill shortages.  While there may not be a lack of training and education places, there is in certain sectors a lack of relevant places in terms of training which is directly linked to employment opportunities.  There is no point in <Col N="77"/>the Department of Social Protection insisting that a person on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance take part in a F&Aacute;S course if that course yields no prospect of his or her securing a job at the end of it.  The planned reform of the social welfare provisions in terms of linking them to employment supports and initiatives will have to be at the core of this.  We all want to see these initiatives as a stepping stone to employment.  There is already in place a work placement programme, administered by F&Aacute;S, which provides a nine month placement to many people in sectors of the economy that are relevant to their background, skills and qualifications.</P>
        <P>It is hoped the additional 21,000 places, though modest, will provide greater variety and additional opportunities for people wishing to avail of those services.  Also, the Government should set out clearly how this initiative is to be funded.  The extra &euro;41 million going into the activation measures will be funded by way of the levy on the pension funds.  However, &euro;33 million of the &euro;74 million allocated to this area will be reallocated from existing resources.  In the interests of transparency the Government should set out from where that &euro;33 million will come.  Similarly, on the capital side an extra &euro;29 million is being allocated, which again is modest.  Some &euro;106 million of the &euro;135 million which is proposed for capital expenditure projects is a reallocation of existing resources.  This money is being taken from one area and put into capital expenditure.  Again, we need to be told from where the &euro;106 million will come. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated yesterday that every &euro;1 million spent on capital expenditure should yield between eight and 12 jobs.  If we are only spending an additional &euro;29 million on capital expenditure then the employment yield on an incremental basis will be only 200 to 300 jobs, which is quite limited.</P>
        <P>The main thrust of the proposal is the stimulus which is being targeted at the tourism related sector, including an &euro;880 million VAT reduction and an employers&rsquo; PRSI reduction of almost &euro;500 million.  We all hope this works.  It is a risk because it is difficult to predict what the outcome will be.  I assume the Government&rsquo;s expectation is that it will lead to additional buoyancy in the economy, greater economic activity and will allow service providers in the tourism sector to reduce their costs, thus enabling us as a country to attract more tourists to Ireland, an objective we all share.</P>
        <P>I believe the Government missed an opportunity in not extending the VAT reduction to other areas of the economy.  For example, construction services will remain subject to VAT at 13.5%.  At a time when the black economy is thriving, the Government had an opportunity to reduce VAT on construction related activities which would have given people an incentive to keep such transactions within the taxable system, but it missed that opportunity.  The same applies in respect of agricultural services which remain subject to VAT at 13.5%.  In addition, waste disposal costs, which are a significant cost for many businesses, will remain subject to VAT at 13.5%, even though the explanatory notes issued by the Department of Finance make clear they could have been reduced to the 9% rate and that some of the other goods and services subject to VAT at the rate of 13.5%, while they could not have been reduced to 9%, could have been reduced to 12%, including VAT on gas and electricity bills.  Many people would have welcomed benefiting from a reduction in VAT on their bills.  However, the Government has chosen not to go down that road.  I understand the rationale that limited resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government made choices and has targeted a particular sector.  I am setting out alternatives that could equally have been chosen.  The Government could, for example, have given a boost to building services by cutting VAT in that area.  I am sure that would have resulted in more transactions in the black economy coming within the <Col N="78"/>system.  However, that is not the choice that was made.  I am merely outlining that as an option the Government had.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative does not refer to the NewERA policy pioneered by the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  That policy was flagged prior to the election and for many months leading up to it as the initiative that would lead to the creation of 100,000 jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is on the way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a jobs budget-initiative that was well flagged by Government, yet this document did not warrant a mention, which surprised me.  Surely something that is in the pipeline and will deliver employment warrants a mention.  However, the Minister for Finance chose not to mention it.  The NewERA policy was the cornerstone of the Fine Gael economic and jobs strategy and it disappeared from the speech made yesterday by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, which surprised me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>

	<P>Give us a little time.</P>

	<P>I will take it further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Howlin, in a radio interview this morning in response to an earlier interview I gave, referred to his belief that I did not realise there was such a thing as DIRT tax.  The difference, of course, is that DIRT tax is applied to interest earned on savings.  It is not a tax on capital, people&rsquo;s savings.  To my knowledge, this is the first time a Government has crossed the line and has directly seized part of the savings people have put away to provide for them in later life.  Some 2.4% of the pension value will be taken, which is one forthieth of the value of the fund.  Therefore, a person who has invested in his or her pension fund for 40 years will, with the stroke of a pen, have seized by the Government one full year of their pension contributions when one strips out inflation and the performance of the fund and so on.  I could make many further points but I know Deputy Dooley is most anxious to make a constructive contribution on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to discuss this important initiative brought forward by Government.  Like other speakers, as a constructive parliamentarian newly in Opposition I believe it behoves us all to try to be constructive in terms of working through the initiatives and ideas that come forward.  As my former colleague in the Seanad, Deputy Joe McHugh, said earlier, we should not try to exclude ideas or viewpoints put forward by those on the Opposition benches.  I hope that was the case with the previous Government, although that may not have been the case to the full satisfaction of all concerned.  However, there is a requirement for us, not just to come forward with ideas, which we will, but to offer our opinions, based on what has transpired or what the Government has put forward.</P><Col N="79"/>
        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s initiative is too little, given the hype that preceded it.  The hype came primarily from the positions taken by the parties now in government in the run-in to the general election.  Deputy Michael McGrath has talked about the great efforts made to promote the potential of the NewERA document and the funds that would be attracted from within the Irish economy and from outside, through the issuance of bonds.  That has not been possible and has not formed part of the latest initiative.   A Minister of State has been appointed and I hope that is not a wasted exercise.  We may hear of the NewERA again in the not too distant future.  There was some potential in the document for getting a more focused and broad spectrum approach to the development of our infrastructure.  I hope that will raise its head at a later stage.  I have no doubt Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd will work to bring that about.  At one stage there was a projection of &euro;18 billion. It then became &euro;7 billion and we are now back to &euro;0.5 billion.  However, that is history.</P>
        <P>There was talk of a bank for national recovery.  That was not part of the programme for Government.  The strategic investment bank proposal, from Deputy Sherlock&rsquo;s party, was forced into the programme for Government but we heard little about that yesterday either.  In the minds of some Labour candidates it was a panacea for the resolution of the banking crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertDowds"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Dowds</NameTxt>
	<P>We were not that naive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding their abhorrence of the notion of continued capitalisation of banks, the presentation of the strategic investment bank in the programme for Government seems to have satisfied their concerns about bailing out the banks and not burning bondholders.  However, that is for another discussion.  We all know the importance of getting our banks functioning.  One of the key things the Minister for Finance stressed yesterday was the continued necessity to fix the banks.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Government on its continued approach to fixing the banks, along the lines set out by the previous Government.  The fundamentals of where the economy is now and where it was before the election have not changed, other than that the former Opposition parties are now in power and must face reality.  Perhaps that may have tempered, to some extent, what the Government could have done yesterday.</P>
        <P>I suppose it would be asking too much for the Government parties to progress their agenda of openness and transparency, which the Taoiseach regularly tells us about, and tell the public they hoodwinked them a little in the run-in to the election, that the promises they made are no longer achievable, that they knew this at the time and that they are sorry and will proceed with resolving matters in line with the fundamentals that were facing them.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not going to get that.  We are going to get a continuance of the three card trick.  They have now turned jobs into the three card trick.  They presented them prior to the election, dangled them around and waved them under different agendas but, like the punter at the races, when the money is put down the queen disappears. The jobs have disappeared, sadly, on this occasion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the queen is coming.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="80"/>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael has missed Deputy Mathews&rsquo;s initiative on banking.  Perhaps they will take it up at some point in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not be impatient.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>By any standards, this is a modest initiative aimed at stimulating the economy.</P>
        <P>I hope it works.  The focus on the tourism sector is a good idea.  For some time I have believed the tourism industry is one of the great unsung heroes of foreign investment.  We spent much time in the past talking about foreign direct investment and various initiatives in that area.  Tourism has epitomised this.  We need a greater level of effort in that regard.</P>
        <P>However, I am not sure the VAT reduction, which does target the tourism sector, will work in the way the Government wants.  For example, if two people go for an early bird dinner costing &euro;50, the amount they will save through the reduction in VAT will not buy a cup of tea, let alone a cup for each of them.  It is very meagre.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fairly crude assessment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is how people will measure it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>How many &euro;2 would one have to save to buy an extra dinner?  That is how it will be measured, by money in people&rsquo;s pockets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>And how many dinners does the Deputy have in the year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I eat most days, thank you.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Clearly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow Deputy Dooley to speak uninterrupted.  He has only three minutes and 50 seconds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>Plus VAT.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>This may, ultimately, become a subsidy for the entertainment sector.  Sadly, many of these operators are under pressure and they have told us about that.  I am concerned that the reduction will not be passed on to the consumer.  Even if it is, it will not make an appreciable or measurable difference to their capacity to spend more.  At best, the reduction is a gimmick.</P>
        <P>There were ways of targeting measures more effectively to attract people into the State.  That has been done, to some extent, by the elimination of the &euro;3 travel tax, which I was never in favour of.  In the last budget, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, moved a considerable way by reducing the tax from &euro;10 to &euro;3.  Last December, a scheme was put forward, with the compliance of the Dublin Airport Authority, to encourage traffic growth at the three DAA airports.  I am not sure if it is still in place.  It would have given a rebate of all airport charges to airlines that increased their activity above 2010 levels.  I am not sure if that scheme is still in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be quite unworkable.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="81"/>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if the Minister for Transport, Deputy Varadkar, intends to retain it or if the new measure will be added to it.  It was a considerable incentive to increase traffic, based on 2009 levels.  Perhaps we will get further clarity on that.</P>
        <P>With regard to capital expenditure measures, the Government talks about shovel-ready projects.  This gives movement to the retrofit programme, although I understand the grants for various initiatives have been reduced by up to 20%.  I would not be opposed to this if we can spread it wider over a greater number of people.  We all know of constituents who have a backlog of applications and we would like to see those progressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The &euro;30 million of the schools building programme includes &euro;20 million that had already been voted through the House and was earmarked for various projects.  The piece missing from yesterday&rsquo;s announcement are the projects that will not go ahead as a result of the reprioritisation of this &euro;20 million.  Are there new-build schools, or other programmes, that will not happen as a result of this?  It would be nice to know, in keeping with the policy of openness and transparency.  The Taoiseach said today he would be honest and upright.  He said he would tell us everything and be clear and that would be the great difference.  He now has an opportunity to live up to that and tell us where the &euro;20 million will come from and what will not happen as a result.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should put down a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The same should happen with regard to the &euro;75 million set aside for the transport Vote and the &euro;60 million for local roads.   Where will that come from?  There is not new money.  Of the more than &euro;135 million that has been earmarked, some &euro;106 is coming from existing programmes and projects.  We would like a list of the projects that will be shelved as a result of this reprioritisation.  Some of them were earmarked to retain and create jobs.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The initiative and the Government&rsquo;s focus on creating and retaining jobs are welcome.  I will not deal with plan to take money from the pension plan.  Others have spoken about that.  The bulk of the investment taken from the pension plan will be used to retain jobs rather than create new ones.  The Government has not been specific about what it hopes to create.  That is, perhaps, wise.  However, the Government will be measured by unemployment numbers.  When the next set of numbers are published in six, eight or ten months time, if there is not an increase in employment numbers it will be a commentary on this initiative.  At that stage it will be seen to be a success or a failure.  I am prepared to wait to see that before we cast judgment on it.  That is how this initiative will be viewed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the House I will share my time with Deputy Sean Sherlock.</P>
        <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak in this debate and to try to answer some of the questions asked by the previous speakers.  The last comment Deputy Dooley made is a fair one.  In time, we will be judged on whether this jobs initiative, or stimulus package, has been successful.  We will be judged on tourism numbers, because we are targeting that sector, and some of the other specific target areas.</P>
      
        <P>Being in Government is about making choices.  This is one of several initiatives that are about reinforcing the message that this Government&rsquo;s priority is job creation and putting structures around our economy that can allow jobs to be created within the private sector.  The evidence to date would suggest that, from the very outset, the Government&rsquo;s priorities on job creation were clear.  We have made clear decisions around banking, although they are more costly than we are happy with.  Nonetheless, around the structures of banking, we have made clear decisions that should have been taken two and a half years ago but were not.</P><Col N="82"/>
        <P>I disagree with Deputy Dooley that we are continuing Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s banking strategy.  I noted Deputy Wallace and others were smiling when that was said because even Opposition parties apart from Fianna F&aacute;il would not suggest that.</P>
        <P>We have taken some clear decisions.  Whereas Deputy McDonald and others are not happy about the approach towards burden sharing, there is no doubt the Government is restructuring the banking system in Ireland in a way that is responsible and makes sense.</P>
        <P>NewERA is still Government policy.  Elements of NewERA are in the programme for Government and a Minister has specific responsibility for implementing that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>He is redundant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not possible to put the structures in place to make NewERA a reality at this early stage because much of it, as Deputy Michael McGrath and Deputy Timmy Dooley know, involves restructuring, for example, the delivery system for water across the country, the way in which we carry electricity across the country and the way in which we roll out broadband.  Despite this, elements of NewERA are already beginning, for example, in regard to broadband for rural Ireland.  The McCarthy report deals with a whole series of recommendations, some of which are consistent with the NewERA policy.  We will see this being rolled out over time.</P>
        <P>This is not all the Government has to offer on job creation, far from it.  It is what it was possible to introduce at this early stage in a jobs initiative that is affordable and cost neutral, whereby we have committed to raising funds so we can reallocate those funds to create stimulus and jobs.  That is all it is.  No one in the Government has been hyping up the jobs initiative.  We have been saying for weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Not since they got elected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  That is what we are being judged on.  We are the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about before that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What we said before&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>They knew this for a long time.  They got elected on the back of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What we said before in regard to NewERA in particular is still the ambition of the Government to implement.  Nobody ever said NewERA would be implemented within the first three months of Government.  I certainly did not say that and I was the chief architect of it.  Let us wait to see what happens in this regard.</P>
        <P>I want to focus on the choices available to us.  They are choices in terms of how we spend a modest amount of money to get the maximum bang for our buck.  We have targeted tourism, for which I am unapologetic.  When I was in opposition as spokesperson for transport for the last six months before the general election, I was utterly frustrated by Irish aviation policy.  Over the past three years we have seen a 30% drop in passenger numbers going through our three main airports and a 40% increase in passenger charges &mdash; that is the Fianna F&aacute;il record.  This is why airports such as Shannon, Cork and Dublin airports are under such pressure at present while we try to pay for a &euro;600 million new terminal &mdash; it was arguably more expensive than that but that was its stated cost.  What we are trying to do is to reshape the tourism industry and make it cheaper to come to and holiday in Ireland.  That is a good initiative which <Col N="83"/>makes sense.  One of the easy ways of getting stimulus into an economy is to bring people here to spend money.  This can be done, for example, with cruise ships coming into Cork harbour, of which there will be 58 this year with an average of 3,000 passengers per ship.  It is also about building passenger numbers in a proactive way through Dublin, Cork, Shannon and other airports.</P>
        <P>This is what the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is focused on when he talks about getting rid of the travel tax.  Can anyone imagine putting a tax in place to charge people for the privilege of coming to Ireland to do business or to holiday here when we are trying to bring people here to get stimulus&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept the drop in numbers had more to do with the fact that Irish people were not travelling?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that is an element of it, and it is a fair point.  However, if one speaks to airlines, Tourism Ireland and hotel operators, they all want the ability to offer cheaper breaks in Ireland and they want people to be able to travel through airports as cost effectively as possible.  That is essentially what this is about, no more, no less.</P>
        <P>The initiative the DAA introduced in December did not make sense.  It sought to measure the overall passenger numbers coming through Irish airports and once the number went above a ceiling, contributed to by all of the airlines, the DAA would reduce passenger charges for everybody coming through the airport.  In other words, if Ryanair expanded its numbers, everybody would piggy-back on that.  That is not a way of targeting different airlines to incentivise them to build their numbers, which is what we are now trying to do.  I expect the Minister to be successful in that.</P>
        <P>With regard to the transport sector and the reallocation of funds for the roads programme, at long last we have seen County Cork getting some priority as it receives nearly double the amount allocated to the next best county.  This makes a change as it has been at the bottom of the list for years in the allocation of funds per kilometre of road.</P>
        <P>With regard to energy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the parish pump was gone under this new Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not get excited.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is about labour intensive work that needs to be done anyway.  What we are doing is front-loading it to try to get some stimulus into places such as County Cork and elsewhere &mdash; Cork and Donegal are the two counties that seem to benefit the most.</P>
        <P>With regard to energy, one of the good measures introduced by the last Government under the former Minister, Mr. Eamon Ryan, was a retrofit programme.  While I was critical of some aspects of it, the principle is a good one.  I expect that retrofit programmes in the future will be based on a &ldquo;pay as you save&rdquo; approach so capital injections from the State will not be needed.  This is a stimulus initiative that will work and build on the good work that has been done in the past in regard to encouraging people to upgrade their buildings and homes, which is also very labour intensive work.  There are many people with the skillsets to do that work who are currently on social welfare.</P>
        <P>In my area of responsibility, the food sector is another example of a jobs initiative that will be rolled out over time.  We are operating to a blueprint called Food Harvest 2020, which is a set of exciting targets put in place by the previous Government.  However, the challenging element is how we put in place a road map to achieve the targets.  What we intend to do in the food sector in Ireland, which is a growth sector and had &euro;8 billion of exports last year, is to <Col N="84"/>ensure that the figure for exports is &euro;12 billion by 2020.  There are plans to increase the volume of food production in Ireland by one third by 2020 and we intend to add value to that food product by approximately 40% by 2020.  For counties such as Waterford, Wexford and Cork, this will probably involve doubling milk production so we can meet a national target of increasing milk production in volume terms by 50%.</P>
        <P>There has been much media coverage in Ireland this week concerning food production, rural life and where rural Ireland is heading in future.  I suggest that one of the main drivers for the economy in the next five years will come from rural Ireland, in particular from the 400 food companies that are supported by Bord Bia and are building exports to the tune of approximately &euro;400 million this year.  Even in recession this is an exciting story to tell about certain sections of the Irish economy, whether about the potential growth of aquaculture, fish processing in towns such as Killybegs, which I will visit in the coming weeks, or the traditional strong food areas in which Ireland is the best in the world at exploiting the potential in beef, dairy, lamb, and so on.</P>
        <P>This Government will introduce a rolling agenda of job creation and economic stimulus of which this is but one instalment.  It is being paid for by a very small levy on pension funds which have been very generously supported by tax breaks by previous Governments.  Now we are recouping some of that money in order to reallocate it in a way that can inject stimulus at an early stage in the lifetime of this Government.  We will follow that by a series of constructive and positive measures that will keep the momentum going.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the jobs initiative.  It was not designed to be a panacea and I do not believe a panacea can be achieved in such a short space of time.  What it seeks to do, however, is to provide an overarching framework which will underpin the economic recovery.  Within that framework there is a set of criteria so existing jobs can be maintained, the cost of doing business can be reduced, people can be helped back to work and there can be an attempt to restore confidence in the economy.  In that way people can begin the recovery which is so vital to our national interest and to the interests of those people who are looking at this House and asking what we are trying to do to fulfil our mandate to them.</P>
        <P>At this juncture members of the Opposition may posit the notion that the initiative does not necessarily fulfil all the obligations set out in the Labour Party or Fine Gael manifestos.  However, a programme for Government was agreed and mandated by this House.  In the normal day to day life of a parliament we score points off one another &mdash; this is vital and we have all done it.  The situation is that we will not get the 400,000 people we want to see back in work back at work within eight or nine weeks.  It is simply not possible.  What we can do, however, is to try to instil some confidence and some pride in the fact that governance in this country is based on the idea that we will serve the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Is that so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to the best of our ability.  We are trying within the very meagre resources we have &mdash; which were squandered &mdash; to try to fulfil a programme that sets down these very parameters.</P>
        <P>I fulfilled the research and innovation brief and am greatly encouraged that the research and development tax credit will bring about a benefit in ensuring we can try to fulfil that agenda.  It is vital to our national interest.  I acknowledge that the parameters set down in the agenda <Col N="85"/>for research and development are as a result of work by successive Governments in the past, including the previous one.  Through the State agencies they identified the vital part research and innovation fulfils in supporting jobs.  The single message that emerges is that if we do not support the research and innovation agenda now, over a longer period it will be very difficult to be able to maintain existing jobs acquired through foreign direct investment.  If parent companies see that we are not continuing our investment in such research this may send a signal that this agenda is being sidelined.  It is vital that through initiatives such as the one announced yesterday we send a signal to the world that we will continue to ensure we can maintain the number of jobs we have, as well maintaining the quality link between research and foreign direct investment related jobs and thereby continue to attract further jobs.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak specifically about the area of research and development.  The positive evidence for economic recovery is clear.  This year, for the first time in three years, we can look forward to positive growth which we fully expect to accelerate as we move into 2012 and beyond.  This is by contrast with the years between 2007 and 2010 when the volume of goods and services produced in Ireland fell by 12%.  On foot of recent gains in competitiveness and improving external demand the exporting sectors of the economy are once again performing very well generally.  Last year exports increased by 9.5% in real terms, the strongest rate of growth for more than a decade.  Looking to the future, export growth is projected at around 6.75% in 2011 and 5.75% in 2012.</P>
        <P>Our focus now, and for the foreseeable future, is on the maintenance and growth of sustainable jobs.  I am glad to say the auguries are good on this front.  The number of foreign investment projects in Ireland rose by 15% in 2010.  These came about because of the proactivity of State agencies such as IDA Ireland which was responsible for the creation of approximately 11,000 jobs, more than double the figure of 5,000 for 2009.  That transcends two mandates, two Governments.  I acknowledge, as one must, this came about as part of a previous Government&rsquo;s mandate.  Moreover, these are quality projects.  In the area of attractiveness for research and development projects, Ireland is positioned in fifth place, behind Finland, Taiwan, Israel and Puerto Rico.  The joint Forf&aacute;s and CSO 2009-2010 business expenditure survey on research and development, BERD, was published on 29 April and it, too, tells a positive story.  The BERD results indicate that in spite of expectations research and development expenditure in indigenous Irish businesses remained strong during 2009 and estimates indicate continued growth in research and development spend in 2010.</P>
        <P>During a recession one might expect to see companies make cuts in areas such as innovation and research and development spend but the BERD figures show that Irish businesses continue to invest in this area, mainly due to recognition of the importance of bringing new and innovative goods and services to the market in order to remain competitive and to grow exports.  This is very positive as this sustained research and development investment is what will underpin future economic growth, jobs and exports.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish I had more time but am glad to have what I have.  Today I attended an event where Johnson &amp; Johnson, a company with a significant presence in this country, had its global management structure meet at Carton House.  That company sustains more than 2,000 jobs in this country.  Arising from that, Science Foundation Ireland hosted an event which showed how innovative Ireland is.  There was a showcase, with more than 30 companies and research functions coming together.  There is one clear message that comes across when one talks to people from Johnson &amp; Johnson and other companies of that nature.  We must send a signal to them that we want to push out the boundaries on framework programme 7, which sees a target of some &euro;600 million being achieved.  We must show that we can <Col N="86"/>look forward, via the European Commissioner, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan Quinn, and an enhanced relationship with the European Commission, to continuing, in framework 8, to push the boundaries further.  We must signal to companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson our commitment to the research and development component and show we are committed to the spend in hitting certain targets that will see us grow jobs in the area.  Investments made in recent years are already beginning to pay off.</P>
        <P>The initiative launched yesterday is a signalling exercise to companies that have invested in this country.  It states we are still very serious about ensuring we can retain them and the right kind of conditions so the companies and researchers we fund will be able to sustain this economy in the long run.  During the 1970s we depended on agriculture in terms of inputs from a European Union perspective, while during the 1980s and 1990s it was infrastructure.  The next big tranche in sustaining jobs will be on the research, scientific, technological and innovation side.  We must continue with this agenda.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  </P>
        <P>For the purposes of clarity it is only fair that I clarify a point.  Deputy Sean Sherlock has stated the Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government was mandated by the House.  It is more correct to say the Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government was mandated by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>May I clarify the point?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the irony&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>Was it not put to a vote and passed by a majority of the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Not to split hairs, but it is a Fine Gael-Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>With all due respect, that is what the Deputy is doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>With all due respect, I am not.  For all the Minister of State&rsquo;s talk about innovation which is, naturally, welcome, this jobs initiative represents more of the same.  It is most unambitious.  There are 104,684 people jobless in Dublin alone and almost 500,000 throughout the State and the Government trumpets plans to spend paltry sums of money in response.  Nero fiddles while Rome burns.  As the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Simon Coveney, stated, politics and government are about choices.  The Government has made a choice.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party have found up to &euro;24 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money for Anglo Irish Bank, but they have refused to invest even a fraction of this sum in a meaningful job creation and stimulus package.  We all acknowledge a stimulus is necessary to deliver jobs in the domestic economy, improve public service provision and protect those in need.</P>
        <P>By the Government&rsquo;s own admission &mdash; it is almost a boast at this stage &mdash; this initiative is a modest proposal.  The logic seems to be that this is a first instalment and that it is all we can afford at present.  I question this logic.  If the Government is insistent, as it is, on sinking the State&rsquo;s resources into toxic banking institutions; pursuing the IMF-EU bailout package, as it is euphemistically called; and sucking billions of euro out of the domestic and real economy, how can it imagine for one second that in 12 or 18 months time it will be any more flath&uacute;lach or flush with money?  Perhaps the real tragedy is that when the Government places job creation centre stage each time it comes to discuss job creation and providing a stimulus we continue to have the b&eacute;al bocht.  It will be the b&eacute;al bocht because the Government has made other <Col N="87"/>choices.  Rather than provide a substantial stimulus, it chooses to invest more money in banks.  Meaningful stimulus measures would not only put money back into the real economy, they would deliver a real social dividend in the longer term.</P>
        <P>Yesterday the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, painted a picture of export-led recovery.  He informed us this was in line with expectations.  He knows full well that growth in the export sector has proved to be largely jobless.  The truth is there will be no recovery, whatever about growth, without job creation.  This means there is a need for a considered, intensive focus on the domestic economy, as well as substantial strategic investment.  This initiative falls pitifully short of what in required.  Also, it falls short in terms of the measures required to protect and create jobs in the private sector.  Moreover, it ignores entirely the role of the State in tackling unemployment and boosting growth.</P>
        <P>Although they are limited, I welcome the capital expenditure measures.  Accelerating capital projects that are shovel-ready and labour intensive would create employment and deliver a social dividend.  Unlike the Government, we sought an intensive focus on investment in this area, to which I have referred.  We seek an investment of &euro;1 billion of additional capital in infrastructural projects, &euro;600 million in job creation and retention measures and &euro;400 million in State child care services and the pre-education sector.  Furthermore, we would target an additional &euro;500 million towards families, making tax credits refundable and putting money back into people&rsquo;s pockets and, therefore, the real economy.  These would be real, substantial cash investments.  The money is available, but the choice has been made to dedicate the moneys elsewhere, not to provide a stimulus.</P>
        <P>It is notable that the Government has resisted at all costs setting job creation targets.  I heard one contributor suggest these would amount to nothing more than extravagant claims.  Targets must be set since we need to set goals and benchmark achievements if we are serious about creating and retaining jobs.</P>
        <P>The failure of Fine Gael and the Labour Party to include commercial semi-State bodies and local authorities in the labour activation measures is a missed opportunity.  The number of unfinished apprenticeships represents one of the serious fall-outs for younger people following the collapse of the construction sector.  However, the Government displays a limited world view and fails to recognise or harness the potential of the public sector or the commercial semi-State sector to address the problem.  There is no reason these sectors cannot facilitate young apprentices to finish their training.</P>
        <P>Last year the local government efficiency review group reported that staffing levels in local government had been reduced by 5,000 in the period between mid-2008 and early 2010.  This represents a cut of 13% in the overall number of local government staff and staffing numbers have fallen again during the past 12 months.</P>
        <P>Yesterday the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, promised a modest proposal to boost employment, with a focus on minor capital works, away from new build projects.  However, no employment targets were set.  Let us remember that not long ago Fine Gael promised voters a &euro;7 billion investment in the State&rsquo;s water services, telecommunications infrastructure and energy industry.  These investments have bitten the dust post the general election.  No additional water infrastructural projects are included in the Government&rsquo;s proposals.  It is satisfied, however, to impose a flat water tax of &euro;175 on every household, but it will not invest additional resources in the State&rsquo;s water supply infrastructure and in the process create employment.  The efficient supply of water to homes and industry is the responsibility of local authorities.  Funding for maintaining and improving the water supply infrastructure comes from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The relevant Ministers, Deputies Michael Noonan and Phil Hogan, are aware that Ireland lags behind its European counterparts <Col N="88"/>in terms of its water systems.  Despite this, there is to be no increase in the allocation of moneys to be spent on the water services investment programme which is already limited in its scope and will tackle only a mere 3% of the national water infrastructure network.  The net result of the Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour Party local government strategies is near nil investment, inadequate infrastructure and increased unemployment.</P>
        <P>Some 2,000 public sector jobs have been cut in the first quarter of this year and a further 28,000 jobs are to go.  That is some target.  There is nothing like it mirrored in job creation.  The Government could have ensured the employment of apprentices in public projects.  It could make the employment of apprentices a condition in the awarding of public contracts to contractors to build public infrastructure.  It could and should have done these things.  However, it would require an actual investment in critical public infrastructure, something it is intent on shying away from.  The Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan&rsquo;s promise of 1,000 specific skills long-term training places to be delivered by F&Aacute;S will stick in the craw of the unemployed in my constituency, a constituency which fought hard against F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s decisions to close two training centres, one in Jervis Street and the other in Cabra, one year and 18 months ago, respectively.</P>
        <P>The approach to this initiative, as far as it relates to the public and semi-State sectors, is not so much labour intensive as Fine Gael intensive.  The party&rsquo;s commitment to &mdash; for some it is almost an obsession &mdash; small government will drive down growth, deepen the recession and increase inequality.  The Labour Party must step up to the plate and shout &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  The people cannot be asked to continually carry the can for bad banks and reckless lending practices by big financial institutions.  The Government has a role to play in the creation and retention of jobs; we cannot afford to shy away from that fact.  This Government has, however, shied away from it.  That is a serious error and a missed opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I sincerely wish the Government had produced a substantial plan.  We all have wishes in this matter and I do not doubt the sincerity of many of those on the Government benches on this.</P>
        <P>It is very important that we remember that we must return to our respective constituencies from this place of engagement.  Our constituents are asking us to give them hope and to point to a viable way forward.  It is so sad so many of our respective constituents, those in each of our areas of representation, are currently unemployed and many others have been forced to leave our shores in recent years.</P>
        <P>This jobs initiative, so called, is not going to create that hope.  It does not spell out a viable way forward.  I wish the Government had come forward with a plan we could bring to struggling small and medium-sized businesses to say here are the measures to help them survive and thrive, to access the credit they so essentially need in so many cases today and to start to rebuild and look forward to the future with confidence.</P>
        <P>Instead, I have to say this plan is very disappointing and I do not believe for a moment that view is confined to the Opposition benches.  After all the promises of a real jobs strategy from both Fine Gael and Labour in the general election, a view put forward by their candidates and canvassers so strongly because the people articulating it believed it themselves, if this is a plan for jobs, they and we must ask where the targets are in the plan.  Where are the targets in terms of numbers and the types of jobs that will be created as a result?  Fine Gael and Labour promised during the election a plan to create 100,000 jobs and 60,000 training places.  Those commitments have now disappeared because they are certainly not in this initial effort.</P>
        <P>The billions that will be required to stimulate growth in our economy have also disappeared, something we have referred to here <i>ad nauseam</i>, those billions that have disappeared into the <Col N="89"/>banking black hole courtesy, clearly, of the disastrous banking policy of the last Government and, sadly, continued by this coalition Government.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge this evening that there are some positive proposals in this jobs initiative but they are, with respect, much too thin and much too weak.  They are very weak; this is a very poor effort when we remember there are almost 500,000 people unemployed in this State.  Let us not forget, as some all too readily do, the many more tens of thousands, particularly of our young people, who have already left our shores and who on their return might very well find themselves in the next number of years being treated as non-persons in their own country courtesy of the crazy and maddening habitual residency clause regulations.  I have no doubt that colleague Deputies on the Government benches are at least as familiar with all of that as I am in terms of their constituents&rsquo; needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government plans to spend &euro;135 million on capital projects but &euro;106 million of this is from existing allocations.  That is only an additional &euro;29 million in terms of this set of proposals.  It is our strong belief that the Government should invest &euro;2 billion this year directly from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, while there is still a crumb in it, into a real job retention and creation plan.  This is something we have proposed and that others have articulated.</P>
        <P>The Government has a duty to give real hope to the unemployed and real substance to any jobs initiative it would bring forward.  We need schools, improved hospitals, primary care centres and child care facilities.  We have tens of thousands of unemployed people who have the skills to build these essential resources and infrastructural needs, to maintain them and to staff them.  Government, however, continues to pour the billions required to develop all of these essential needs into zombie banks.</P>
        <P>At best, I believe the jobs plan will be jobs neutral.  I have to say that with great sadness because it strikes me that it has the potential to cost jobs because an incentive has been presented to drive down already low wages and the risk clearly will be that it will leave people with less money to spend.  The threatened attack on long-standing wage agreements must be resisted.  There are many people in Fine Gael who do not hold that view but the Labour Party representatives would be strong advocates and I appeal to them, first and foremost.  How can they possibly let this happen?  This is another imposition on us from the IMF-EU deal.  It will primarily affect low paid workers in areas such as retail, construction, catering, hotels and the tourism industry.</P>
        <P>I call on the Government to resist the demands of certain employers to drive down the wages of these workers.  This will not create jobs, make no mistake, it will cost jobs and compound the poverty that is already so much in evidence across this country.  It will reduce or eliminate the expendable income of tens of thousands of workers and thus further depress the economy and the local and regional economies we come from.</P>
        <P>In my own constituency, there are just short of 14,000 people on the live register in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  In the very week the Government has announced this jobs plan, the services available for those people are being placed under threat.  I ask the Government to hear me on this because it is not the first time that something that has visited my constituency became a template for other locations around the country.  Last Friday, staff in the Monaghan F&Aacute;S office were told by regional managers under the direction of F&Aacute;S head office that there is potential &mdash; as they described it &mdash; for temporary redeployment of all staff from the Monaghan office to other centres across the region, in Cavan, Drogheda, Dundalk and Navan.  This proposed redeployment is for the summer months at the same time as school-leavers are seeking assistance in finding work or further training, when summer jobs become available and people generally require assistance in accessing them.  This is not the formula to deal with annual leave needs or any other cost-cutting requirements which F&Aacute;S must address.  The F&Aacute;S <Col N="90"/>staff in Monaghan have given a commitment to flexible working and co-ordination of leave over the summer months in order to keep the office open.  I urge F&Aacute;S head office to take up that offer from the staff which is very generous and responsible.  Monaghan Town Council met last evening in emergency session on the issue.  It has requested a meeting with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, on this matter.  I urge her to accommodate that meeting and I hope she will take note of my appeal.  I hope the Government parties will revisit their proposals in this jobs initiative and come forward with a set of proposals which really will allow us to go back to where we come from with a message of hope.  Surely this is what every one of us must want to deliver.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Denis Naughten.</P>
        <P>I have listened to this debate and I note that all sides are in agreement on many issues.  We all want to effect significant progress for our people considering the new economic reality of more than 450,000 people unemployed while at the same time continuing to work within the EU-IMF assistance package.  We have to find ways to stem the human tragedy of more than 1,000 young people emigrating every week to Canada, Australia, England and the United States.  The lifeblood of our nation is leaving our shores.  Under our former Government our finest export was our young, bright-eyed and highly educated workforce.  We cannot allow the brain drain of the 1980s which crippled our economy for more than a decade, to recur in this decade.</P>
        <P>This Government is meeting the challenges head-on.  In the first few weeks of office we have presented a constructive, positive plan within the confines of the EU-IMF and within the constraints with which the Fianna F&aacute;il Government left the country and the banking system.  We have to deal with the resultant economic collapse in a way which affects the EU-IMF deal as little as possible.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government is a plan to create employment through the NewERA authority.  Significant areas for future recovery are clearly identified for future recovery.  Now is the time to invest in those areas in order to have the skills and jobs in place to meet the future and to make the much-needed changes.  The NewERA plan will streamline and restructure the semi-State companies.  There will be significant additional investments over and above current plans over the next four years in next generation infrastructure in the areas of energy, broadband, forestry and water.  These investments and the accompanying semi-state restructuring process will be financed and proactively managed by a new economic and recovery authority which will absorb the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  This is my responsibility as Minister of State and it is my current work.</P>
        <P>I note a constructive engagement from all sides of the House in this debate, across all political parties and none.  We are all trying to do the very best for our country, putting our best foot forward and dealing with these issues constructively.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a question of how to create jobs.  The Government&rsquo;s national development plan has identified four significant areas to be dealt with by the NewERA authority.  We need to address the significant deficits in the water infrastructure, some of which are due to climate change and resultant lower rainfall in certain parts of the country.  The 34 existing local authorities need to be organised in a better way as they individually manage each of the water investment programmes.  I hope to have a final consultancy report on the creation of Irish Water &mdash; Uisce &Eacute;ireann, by next October and to have legislation in place by early next year.  This will change how water infrastructure is managed and will lead to the creation of many new jobs in that area.</P><Col N="91"/>
        <P>The next generation telecoms network is a significant area in which we must play a leading role.  Unfortunately, under the previous Government, Ireland had fallen behind in this regard.  We have also learned many lessons from the unfortunate case of Eircom and what happened when it was sold off in its totality.  The State will co-invest with the private sector and the commercial semi-State sector to provide next generation broadband to every home and business in the State.  This will be achieved by delivering fibre-optic to the home or to the kerb in the case of 90% of homes and businesses with the remaining 10% provided with high speed mobile or satellite broadband.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte and I will be meeting with the chief executives of Irish telecoms companies with a view to finding out their plans for future telecoms infrastructure.</P>
        <P>If Government, semi-State and private companies involved in telecoms or water provision all work together to put forward plans in this most difficult and desperate of times, then the best progress can be achieved.  My hope is that we can provide 100 megabytes per second to most homes in the country which is what is provided in many other states with the same pattern of dispersed population as Ireland.  The structures must be put in place but we must acknowledge that the State cannot invest in telecoms unless there is a clear market failure.  However, the NewERA authority will enable us to identify areas where jobs can be created.</P>
        <P>The 21st century smart grid is critical to improving energy transmission.  Beginning with the handing over of ESB&rsquo;s transmission assets to Eirgrid, a new smart grid company will be created with ultimate full ownership and responsibility for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas networks.  Bio-energy and forestry is the fourth area in which the NewERA company will be involved.  The development of Ireland&rsquo;s forestry and bio-energies need to be developed.  NewERA will merge Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte to create a new State company which will become a global leader in the commercialisation of next generation bio-energy technologies.</P>
        <P>The plans and discussions are in place with the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Finance.  Many individual professional groups are also involved in this effort to effect a real change in how jobs are created.       I refer to a report, Future Skills Needs of Enterprise within the Green Economy in Ireland, which was published some time ago.  It clearly identifies a roadmap for young people in our education system.  It suggests what courses they should do, and on what areas the academic institutions should concentrate, so that they have the skills the economy needs if it is to move forward.</P>
        <P>I take the point made by some Deputies to the effect that under the last Administration, approximately 7,000 apprentices were unable to complete their apprenticeships and now have no employment.  If our young people and educators were to examine this society&rsquo;s future skills needs &mdash; I refer to areas like renewable energy, energy efficiency, water and waste water, waste management, consultancy services, smart technology, electrical engineering, marine and tidal studies, foreign languages, green chemistry, smart grids and wind turbines &mdash; they would appreciate that the educational attainment of our young people could be improved significantly.  Thousands of jobs could be created in renewable energy.</P>
        <P>We need to organise ourselves so that we can work with all the interest groups, particularly the semi-State companies.  We need to step forward together under the umbrella of the NewERA entity or company.  That will provide the leadership and reorganisation needed.  It will direct the educational future of our young people.  If the State sells certain semi-State assets at an appropriate and reasonable time as suggested in the programme for Government &mdash; it should not be a fire sale &mdash; it could acquire up to &euro;2 billion to invest in the creation of the jobs I have mentioned.  We must put in place the climate required to create thousands of necessary <Col N="92"/>jobs.  I hope we can all step forward together in that regard.  I hope to report to the D&aacute;il as soon as possible on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak during this debate.  I welcome the announcement made by the Minister for Finance yesterday.  It is a long time since this House spoke positively about jobs.  That we are doing so now should be welcomed.  Deputies on the Opposition and Government benches need to place a far greater focus on jobs as we go forward.  The Opposition claims that the Government is not dedicating enough funds to the programme, while at the same time criticising the source of the funds being allocated to the programme.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance made it clear yesterday that the Government was taking its first steps to start creating jobs.  We accept that much more can be done that does not involve new funding but requires a change in the approach that has been taken up to now.  In far too many cases, we have had a jobs barricade because bureaucracy and red tape are stalling job creation and retention.  The Minister for Justice and Equality addressed one of those areas today when he spoke about the visa waiver scheme.  That is just one example.  I could mention numerous examples of barriers to employment that have been created in the Department of Social Protection and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>Many jobs in small businesses are going to the wall as a result of a lack of prompt payments.  The current average delay for payment is 74 days, which is having a direct impact on the cash flow and credit of small businesses.  A small business in my constituency is on its knees because a State-appointed contractor is using every possible loophole to avoid paying its subcontractors.  The business in question is owed &euro;300,000, whereas its liabilities are just &euro;50,000, but it is under serious financial threat because it cannot get the money it needs.  Some of the moneys in question are owed by the Revenue Commissioners.  Delays of up to six months can be experienced when one tries to get a refund from the Revenue Commissioners.  In another case, one arm of Revenue is demanding &euro;1,150 from a business even though another arm of Revenue owes &euro;7,000 to the same business.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problems to which I refer do not just relate to the Revenue Commissioners.  Serious blockages are also being encountered with NAMA.  I am aware of businesses in my constituency that are waiting to expand or be established, but are left in limbo because no clear decisions are being made by NAMA.  They are in economic purgatory because NAMA is not telling them &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  At the same time, properties in many urban areas are getting dilapidated and are becoming a blight on their communities.  Equally, the creation of jobs and the completion of developments are being delayed.  In cases where a clear proposal or offer is on the table and employment is being directly affected, surely it makes sense for NAMA to be decisive and to sell the property, dispose of it in some other way or do something else with it.</P>
        <P>While I am speaking about employment and development, I say that something needs to be done to deal with alien objectors to developments.  I refer to people who submit objections to developments even though they have no association with the community in question.  I have no difficulty with those who object to developments that would have a direct or indirect effect on them.  Such people have a legitimate right to object to such development.  I am aware of many cases in which people from the far end of the country, who have no connection to the area in question, lodged vexatious objections purely to delay a project.  In some cases, they did so because they did not want a competitor&rsquo;s operation to get up and running.  Something needs to be done about that kind of obstruction of developments that would have a clear jobs benefit for the local community.</P><Col N="93"/>
        <P>The Garda vetting office was raised on the Order of Business this morning.  I cannot understand the logic that requires a separate Garda clearance to work in a  job similar to one for which a person already got Garda clearance.  Every time one applies for a job, one has to submit a new application for clearance.  Similar difficulties are being encountered by sporting organisations.  If one is dealing with separate senior and minor boards within a single club, or separate hurling and football sections of the same club, one has to submit two separate applications to the Garda vetting unit to get clearance.  Surely something can be done to streamline that process.  If one is cleared to work with young people, one should be allowed to proceed from there.</P>

	<P>There is no doubt that our future is uncertain.  We know for sure that if we are to climb out of this economic hole, we have to get people back to work.  Over several years, we have spoken at length in this Chamber about how this country&rsquo;s fiscal and banking challenges might be resolved.  That debate was rekindled at the weekend when Professor Morgan Kelly delivered his bleak analysis.  Regardless of the steps we take to try to find a solution &mdash; such as debt restructuring, debt reprofiling or debt-for-equity swaps &mdash; it is absolutely certain that if we are to return to anything like the living standards of the past, we will do so by growing our economy.  That means putting people back to work, producing real goods and services and putting money into people&rsquo;s pockets.</P>
        <P>I regret that we have had to tax people&rsquo;s savings to fund this package.  I do not like it, just as I did not like the increase to 27% in the rate of deposit interest retention tax at the last budget.  I dislike many taxes.  The only reason to stomach this measure is that it will make some contribution to sustaining and maintaining the State pension for older people.  If we do not put people back to work, we will not be able to pay the existing State pension into the future.  It is a question of establishing priorities.  I have to accept this measure, even though it is unwelcome.  I ask the Minister to clarify what it means for people and to state how long it will last.  That is important.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome the package of measures announced.  It will make a real difference, if not a big one, in generating employment and particularly in employment retention.  As it is modest, it will not come anywhere near to getting each of the 500,000 unemployed back to work.  It does not purport to do so.  Any Government that cannot borrow and has a limited ability to cut services and raise taxes is constrained when it attempts to stimulate the economy.  I do not accept the argument that because this initiative is revenue-neutral, it will not stimulate the economy.  The manner in which one taxes and spends will either stimulate the economy or cut down on economic activity.  There are things we can do, however.</P>
        <P>The real value of this package is that it will raise confidence.  It is a good news story because it presents Ireland &mdash; however beleaguered it may be &mdash; as a country that is trying to do something to solve its problems.</P>
      
        <P>Yesterday morning, I visited a multinational company which last year located its European shared services in my constituency.  This is a good news story, especially as the company continues to recruit.  However, it also warned that bad news stories emanating from Ireland keep our financial difficulties at the forefront of people&rsquo;s minds back in its US headquarters.  While we cannot deny our difficulties, we must show ourselves willing to tackle them.  The package on jobs before the House reflects such a willingness.</P>
        <P>We must do much more than is provided for in this initiative, which is the first in a series of packages.  We have an opportunity to make certain changes which, if implemented previously, may have enabled us to avoid the current crisis because they would have countered the reduction in competitiveness and reduced our dependence on the property sector.  While change is not easy to accept, the crisis offers an opportunity to effect changes that will create an <Col N="94"/>environment for future growth.  At times such as these, even the most vested of interests, including Members of the Oireachtas, must realise and accept that things cannot go on as they were and nothing is as it was.  I refer specifically to the monopolies, closed shops and restrictive practices in the private sector, including the medical and legal professions, and public sector, including Dublin Bus.</P>
        <P>During the recent general election campaign, employers and potential employers repeatedly raised a number of concerns.  One recurring theme was that developments in the area of alternative energy were inhibiting employment.  A worrying number of entrepreneurs expressed utter frustration with the regime in place for new entrants to this sector.  While some of their complaints related to planning, all of them stated that those trying to enter the alternative energy business faced barrier after barrier.  Complaints were articulated by such a variety of players as to make it imperative on the Government to identify and remove barriers to entering alternative energy, particularly given that those who first invested in the sector in this country have, in utter frustration, taken their money, expertise and investment elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I am aware that a report has been done on registered employment and joint labour committee agreements.  This issue was raised with me repeatedly during the election campaign.  Reforms in this area must be radical as these agreements are no longer appropriate and act as a disincentive to employment and business.  Last weekend, one entrepreneur who charges &euro;2 for a cup of coffee informed me that he is paying &euro;20 per hour for a staff member to wash dishes.  At more than twice the minimum wage, pay rates such as this make discussion of the minimum wage almost irrelevant.</P>
        <P>The social welfare trap, which was relevant in the 1980s, is relevant once more.  A system which encourages people to work for only three days per week is nonsensical and must be reformed.  Employers who are willing to provide work are frustrated because they cannot find people who will work for more than three days per week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputy John McGuinness.</P>
        <P>We all welcome initiatives which focus on jobs, the number one issue facing this country.  However, many issues need to be clarified when the Minister for Finance comes before the House tomorrow.  Given that seven or eight Departments are affected by the jobs initiative, it is a matter of concern that only the Minister for Finance will speak tomorrow.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s commitment to introduce a temporary credit guarantee scheme.  The former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, had substantially progressed this initiative before leaving office.  I am concerned that the document, as published, does not make a financial allocation for the scheme in this year.  I am even more concerned that the Taoiseach did not know anything about the initiative or its funding when I questioned him on it this morning.</P>
        <P>The initiative announced by the Minister makes a clear commitment that the scheme will be up and running in the autumn.  Will it be restricted to export companies or, as is typical of such schemes, companies employing more than ten or 30 staff?  Alternatively, will it be a focused scheme which gives smaller businesses a chance?  Small businesses are struggling, particularly in the retail sector which is bearing the brunt of the economic crisis.  We need answers to these questions.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that a tendering process would commence almost immediately.  Who will be involved in this process?  Will he seek opinions from the committees of the House, if they are ever established, or the interest groups directly affected by the scheme?  Such consultation would ensure the scheme is focused and designed to be effective and relevant to those involved <Col N="95"/>in business.  I hope the Minister will clarify this matter tomorrow and I intend to table parliamentary questions on the issue.</P>
        <P>Lowering of the VAT rate in the interests of tourism is welcome given that tourism is a key product, albeit one which we tend to take for granted.  Those of us who live here may not realise how much the Irish countryside is appreciated.  Having examined the detail of the measure to lower the VAT rate on the Revenue website this afternoon, it is clear the reduction is taking place in a farcical manner, to use a diplomatic word.  Surely a tourism initiative should affect every aspect of a tourist&rsquo;s experience.  While the VAT rate has been lowered for a meal in a restaurant, it has not been lowered for any drinks served with a meal, except where it is purchased from a vending machine en route to the restaurant.  A cup of coffee will cost 4 cents less as a result of the decrease in VAT but, as Deputy Mitchell noted, there is still no white smoke with regard to the archaic system of joint labour committees.  The Government has not given a commitment to reduce the 13.5% VAT rate for car hire companies or tour guides, which have been specifically excluded from the scope of the reduction.</P>
        <P>Tourists will arrive in airports which will have lower landing fees.  I am not convinced that airlines which charge &euro;40 to print out a boarding pass will pass on small discounts in landing fees to passengers.  Tourists had better walk around the country because the cost of car hire or tour guides will not have fallen.  Furthermore, they had better buy their drinks in advance if they are eating out.  Surely a proper examination of this issue would have shown that in an island nation which most tourists access by air the majority of tourists need car hire.  Rates for car hire are generally higher here than in other European destinations.</P>
        <P>Aside from tourism interests, it is unfair that the Government has decided to exclude fuel from the reduction in the VAT rate, particularly as fuel prices are going through the roof.  We all know from our constituency offices the difficulties people are experiencing with fuel poverty.  The Government has missed an opportunity to address this issue.  I ask the Minister to rectify the matter before the finance Bill is published.</P>
        <P>I endorse the comments of Deputy Mitchell on joint labour committees, JLCs, and employment regulation orders, EROs.  The Government has given a commitment to increase the minimum wage and introduce VAT reductions in certain areas of the economy by 1 July.  Will the Minister clarify whether any of the recommendations of the report on JLCs and EROs, which should be published, will be implemented by 1 July?  If the report is to have an impact on prices and the competitiveness of the retail and tourism sectors, we will have to address premium pay rates, particularly Sunday premiums, which are out of sync with those in place in the Six Counties and other countries with tourism markets.  If wage rates and prices are to be changed by 1 July, is it dangerous to assume that changes in premiums and so forth will also be introduced on 1 July?  For this to occur, the report must be published as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I have heard the usual chorus argue that the review of the joint labour committees and employment regulation orders is an attack on workers.  The review was designed specifically to allow Members of the previous D&aacute;il to make a contribution.  I specifically inserted this term of reference to allow the usual chorus to place its cards on the table and offer solutions.  I am not sure it has done so but I have no doubt we will hear it issue the usual rallying cries.</P>
        <P>In the coming months, as we consider further jobs initiatives and commence preparations for the 2012 budget, which must focus on job creation, the big issue facing business is the level of local authority rates and charges.</P>
      
        <P>Nationwide, shops, retail and tourism operations and snooker clubs are being hammered by rates, which in some cases were established at the height of the so-called Celtic tiger or by <Col N="96"/>valuations that have been in place for nearly 100 years.  Moreover, those who pay rates do not receive anything for the rates they pay as they are obliged to pay separate charges for water and for refuse and if they are located within Dublin&rsquo;s business improvement district.  The Government should spend time between now and December in identifying this issue and coming up with a fairer way because together with credit, this is the number one issue being faced by businesses.  The issues that constrain job creation are businesses&rsquo; inability to get credit and the pressure under which they operate from unchanged fixed charges.</P>
        <P>Many of the programmes announced in this jobs initiative are pre-existing programmes that have been rebranded or refreshed or have had budgets reallocated.  While I heard some Ministers assert that this was the first time we have had joined-up thinking or the first time this or that has been attempted, that is not the way.  Ministers will be aware that for the greater part, these are existing initiatives that have been rebranded, repackaged or re-financed.  During the election, Fine Gael in particular with its five-point plan created expectations by stating it would great things with regard t job creation.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s criticism is of the creation of this expectation in the knowledge of Ireland&rsquo;s financial position and the Government now faces the reality of delivering on that expectation.  Over the course of this initiative and as the Government prepares a finance Bill, it should take on board the thoughts being expressed in the House.  As I stated last Thursday in the debate on the EU-IMF programme, this exposes the need for the committee structure to be in place.  This document should be debated hammer and tongs within a committee structure in which people have a chance to feed in suggestions or ideas.  Two months have elapsed since the establishment of this House and yet there still is no sign of the committees.  Apparently they will be established next week but it is a bit like Christmas in that next week is every week when the Taoiseach is asked about the committee structure.</P>
        <P>There is much to be welcomed in this initiative.  It is to be welcomed that the Oireachtas is focusing on unemployment.  However, there are anomalies in the system the Government has two weeks to address before introducing its finance Bill.  I refer to the anomalies regarding the VAT rate as it reflects on the tourism product and in particular, given the great pressure being experienced on fuel prices at present, there is a chance to do something substantial that would affect people&rsquo;s daily lives and the Government should take this chance.</P></Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Government well in the course of its term in office and encourage it along the route it has taken in recent days in respect of the jobs initiative.  Anything positive that comes from the Government, such as this initiative, should be supported on all sides.  While Fianna F&aacute;il has described the measures as modest proposals, one can only expect modest proposals in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s current economic position.  Bearing this in mind, I welcome all the proposals.  The initiative sends a clear signal to those who create employment that the Government at least has acknowledged that there are serious difficulties for businesses in respect of job creation.  Moreover, it sends a signal to the 14% of the workforce who are unemployed at present that at last, someone is listening to them.  From this perspective, I support what the Government is about.</P>
        <P>My concern relates to the 0.6% levy and how the initiative is being funded.  The retrospective legislation is something that is new to me and it is interesting to see it being applied in this case.  I note that in all other cases, when Members sought to catch the big fish such as the bankers and others, it was explained to them that they could not apply legislation in a retrospective manner.  Consequently, this is something new and I look forward to it being applied to those cronies in Irish society who are well-off, well-placed and are being well paid.  I look forward to it being applied to claw back at least some of the moneys being made by major <Col N="97"/>organisations, including State agencies.  It would have been better had the scheme been funded by the Government&rsquo;s imposition of a form of levy on those State agencies that are making money.  I refer to those entities that can afford to pay their top management colossal sums of money, such as, for example, &euro;740,000 in the case of the ESB and others.</P>
        <P>One issue I have in respect of government in general is that while this is a positive step to a degree, it is a little bit of window dressing that does not tackle the real issues that must be confronted.  Another example in this regard is the Government&rsquo;s decision to reduce salaries.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, led by example by reducing his own salary to &euro;200,000 per year and by then extending reductions to the other Ministers.  However, although the real people who needed to be caught by such a decision were the Secretaries General of Departments and other chief executive officers of State agencies, the reductions could not be applied to them.  I wonder why?  This decision should be applied right across the board.  If it is good enough for the Taoiseach and Ministers to take a salary cut, a way should be found to ensure that those who are well paid should in turn make a contribution with regard to the correct decisions and courses upon which the State now is embarked.</P>
        <P>While these were the big decisions, what is the big decision in this regard?  Behind this decision lies the other side of the balance sheet.  How much more pressure can be put on companies to pay taxes to support a system which the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has described as being not fit for purpose?  When I suggested it was not fit for purpose in 2008, Deputy Stagg was aghast that I would have said that about the public sector.  However, all focus is now on middle and senior management in the public sector, their pay, their outturn and on value for money.  Reform of the public sector is essential to the delivery of efficient schemes nationwide and to ensure that taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent wisely and well.  Many issues that were addressed by colleagues when in government and by the present Government when in opposition should now be taken on board.</P>
        <P>For example, what would be wrong with the Ministers for Finance and Environment, Community and Local Government introducing a new scheme of rates?  I refer to a system of rates that would be fair to the business sector.  It would ask those on the outskirts of cities, who may not make as much as those on the main street, to pay lesser rates.  Why should one&rsquo;s valuation be increased when one applies for planning permission?  Why should one be penalised by the State through the payment of additional rates simply because one has been a good and prudent business operator who is able to expand?  Why can valuations struck in better times during the Celtic tiger period not be adjusted downwards to ensure less is paid by those businesses that are struggling at present?  Why can retrospective legislation not be applied to upward-only rent reviews, as it has been in the context of pensions?  Some of the recipients of those rents probably are financial institutions that operate pension funds and which we support.  There must be a level playing field for everyone.  I do not believe this to be the case.  Similarly, local charges for pubs and hotels of &euro;3 per cubic metre for water in and water out is costing them a fortune.</P>
        <P>Moreover, I do not believe the money being collected is being spent wisely or that value for money is being achieved.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, knows this and the Minister of State, Deputy Perry  knows it only too well because he is in business.  I am on the Government&rsquo;s side in this regard and I encourage it to take up the challenge.  It has a huge mandate and should do this for the country.  It should do it for the businesses that struggle day in and day out and will not be affected by the positive message or the initiative the Government has taken under the jobs initiative under discussion.  The Government must reach beyond what it is doing at present.  It must do things differently and must be brave in so doing and it will have support from this side of the House.</P><Col N="98"/>
        <P>Similarly, money was given to the banks on the basis of what they told the Government.  Only now, we discover that what they said was not true at the time.  How much is yet to be told about personal debt in the banks?  How many more billions of euro in bad debts are we to be told about?  The answer is, many more.  Some 33 companies go into liquidation every week.  Families with small businesses and their employees are suffering the hardship and indignity of going through that process, not to mention the other companies that are going bust because the banks will not give them money.  Recently, a businessman told me he wanted a review of his loan to determine whether he could spread it out over a longer period.  He was paying interest of &euro;7,000 per year.  He came out of the bank with a reviewed position of &euro;15,000 in interest per year.  It is outrageous that the banks are not telling us the truth.</P>
        <P>IMF deal or no, the Government might not be right to follow the Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  Perhaps it should stand back and review its position.  If the policy was wrong back then, as described by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, it is wrong now.  While we are and have been reasonable Europeans, Ireland is becoming the EU&rsquo;s whipping boy.  This is not good enough.  We are being bullied into taking all sorts of measures.  When Greece put it up to the EU and stated it would leave the eurozone, there was panic.  We were not even told about the meeting, which was held behind closed doors.  We should do the same as Greece, which will now get a better deal.  We should get a better deal.  I do not mind saying this, as our last deal was not a good one in hindsight and the banks did not and are not giving us the information necessary to make a complete and final appraisal of the situation.  The Government is up against it.</P>
        <P>When on this side of the House, many Government Members stated that F&Aacute;S was not fit for purpose.  I agreed with them then and continue to do so.  Why not devolve the workings of F&Aacute;S to the county enterprise boards, CEBs, and ask them to reskill those in need?  It would create a connection between the employer, the entrepreneur and the person looking to be skilled or searching for a job.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, is responsible for the enterprise boards.  The Government is going to dump them into the local authorities.  Councils can no longer collect refuse because that service was privatised and someone made money on it and they will hand housing issues over to someone else to make money on it because they cannot handle that situation either, yet we are to give them the CEBs.  I hope the Minister of State will stand up for the boards and ensure they are retained in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, which itself requires a great deal of work.  I also hope there will be a good connection between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland because Irish companies, including family businesses, are our future.  They created 800,000 jobs in the indigenous sector.  They will lift us out of this recession and I encourage the Government to support them.  I believe in them and am passionate about the fact they have skills, innovation and courage.  The Government must ensure they get the money from the banks they need to trade, to fund their businesses and to create and sustain jobs.  This is what the situation will be about.  I hope the Government gives the banks hell in the coming period to ensure money is made available to those in the business sector who need it.</P>
        <P>I conclude by wishing the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, well.  I listened to him carefully while he was in opposition and admire some of the positions he has taken and the policies he has begun to roll out since being in government.  I do not agree with him on everything, but he is moving in the right direction.  I have confidence in the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, given his good business background and his connection with those at SME level who require this support.  I appeal to the Government to address their concerns, to make the big decisions and to be courageous.  It will then be able to put in place the right policies, which will be supported on this side of the House.</P>

	<P>Before attending the Chamber, I watched the Greek strikes and riots, which are occurring as we speak, on the &ldquo;Six One&rdquo; news.  Given what I have seen on television, I am not convinced the Greeks have received a better deal.  I would be interested in seeing what happens.  If a country wants to be a guinea pig and default or exit the eurozone, I would rather it be someone else&rsquo;s country and not mine.  Let us see how it works out, as I am unsure that it will be as rosy a picture as Deputy McGuinness suggested.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to speak on the jobs initiative.  Yesterday was a good day for the new Government and a very good day for the people.  For the first time in three years, a Minister for Finance stood up and had good news to impart.  There has been a strong focus on tourism, which falls under my responsibility, through the reduction to 9% in the VAT rate on tourism-related services, such as hotels, accommodation, restaurants, catering and the sports and leisure sector.  There has been a reduction in employers&rsquo; PRSI in respect of people working in low pay sectors, many of which are connected with tourism.  There will also be a radical reform of the joint labour committee, JLC, system later this year.  Approximately 200 tourism internships will be organised through F&aacute;ilte Ireland, a number I hope will be increased if the programme works well.  An offer has been made to the airlines concerning the abolition of the travel tax, a revised growth scheme at the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, to reduce airport charges for additional passengers this year and a marketing campaign funded jointly by the DAA and Tourism Ireland to promote certain routes.  We await the airlines&rsquo; response with interest.</P>
        <P>On the transport side, approximately &euro;60 million has been transferred to road maintenance from other projects that did not proceed this year.  This is to be spent on improving roads that were badly damaged by the winter weather.  Some &euro;14 million will be spent, mainly in the cities, on improving public transport, for example, cycle ways, bus lanes, bus stops and other low cost measures.  I welcome the &euro;1 million to be spent on renovating approximately 20 train stations around the country through low cost measures.</P>
        <P>I do not want to spend too much of my time discussing the jobs initiative, which has been debated all day and will be debated during the coming days.  Instead, I will address a number of points that have been raised during this debate.  Regarding the 0.6% levy on pension funds, it is worth stating, if it has not been stated already, that the money in these pension funds was invested tax free and, in most cases, enjoyed a 40% tax subsidy.  The levy represents a small clawback of that 40% tax expenditure paid to people who invested in private pension funds.  It is also worth pointing out that the capital gains made by private pension funds are tax free and remain so.  When one removes money from a private pension fund, the lump sum element is also tax free.  It is worth reminding the House that this proposal was contained in the Fine Gael election manifesto.  We made it clear that we intended to fund the PRSI and VAT reductions in this way.  Indeed, the proposal was used against us in a number of debates during the election campaign.  With these facts in mind, we have a mandate to introduce the levy and intend to do so.</P>
        <P>It is worth extending some words to the pension industry, which applies large charges to people&rsquo;s pension funds.  It is typical for a pension fund to take 2% of contributions annually in addition to a 0.5% charge on the value of the total fund.  These charges are much higher than in other countries.  If the pension industry is so concerned about this levy &mdash; I have seen many among it shedding crocodile tears today &mdash; it should bring its charges into line with those in <Col N="100"/>the UK and elsewhere, in which case the levy would have no impact whatsoever on the consumer.  Given the way in which it is structured, it will have no appreciable impact in any case.</P>
        <P>Regarding personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, it is also worth pointing out that the maximum charge a pension fund can impose every year is 1% &mdash; many of them do &mdash; and they can charge up to 5% of the initial contribution.  I agree with the comment of Deputy Ross this morning that we should consider those issues and perhaps impose lower maximums on how much they can take out of people&rsquo;s pension funds every year, which they have been doing consistently since pensions were invented.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dea said earlier that a line had been crossed and that the next thing the Government will do is to impose a levy on bank deposits.  However, a line has not been crossed.  Money that is put on deposit in a bank is already taxed.  Before a person puts money in the bank, he or she has paid income tax and PRSI on it.  That is not the case for money put into a pension fund, which is put in tax-free, with a 40% tax subsidy, 0.6% of which is now being clawed back.  It is also the case that money on deposit is subject to deposit interest retention tax.  People already pay tax on the profit they make on their bank deposits; that is not the case for pension funds.  No line has been crossed here.  The only thing that is being done is that a small proportion of the tax-free bonus allowed to people who invest in pension funds is now being recouped to invest in job creation through the jobs initiative.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative is modest, but it represents a real stimulus to the economy.  It is as much as we can afford in the current circumstances.  A package of something close to &euro;500 million &mdash; the figure used by my colleagues in the Labour Party in their proposal for a jobs fund &mdash; will provide a stimulus to the economy and generate a higher level of growth and employment than would have occurred otherwise.</P>
        <P>I would like to address another issue that has come up in this debate and in articles written in newspapers in recent days.  A number of Deputies have alluded to the macro picture.  They have pointed out quite rightly that this jobs initiative is modest and that it is only a first step.  That is what those of us on this side of the House have said.  They have also pointed out, on the opposite side of the House, that this does not solve our budget deficit, which is true, and that it does not solve the problems in the banking sector, which it certainly does not.  We must accept that this is a first step, although an important one, in restoring employment to our economy.</P>
        <P>There is a bigger picture, which is being discussed today in other chambers.  I was interested to read at the weekend an article written by Professor Morgan Kelly about the situation we face.  It is important to listen to what Professor Kelly has to say because he called it right; he was one of the contrarians to whom people would not listen in the past, but they should listen to him now.  That does not mean that what he says now must be true, because what he said in the past was true; that is not how it works.  His essential contention was that the burden of our public debt added to the burden of our banking debt will be too much for this State to service.  It is important that people get the figures right.  Our current national debt is in the region of &euro;100 billion, and &euro;6 billion of that is because of banking.  Most of our national debt is public debt &mdash; money borrowed to pay salaries and social welfare payments and build public buildings.  Even when one takes a bigger figure including promissory notes &mdash; our general Government debt, GGD &mdash; only &euro;60 billion of the &euro;160 billion is banking debt.  That is debt we should not have, I agree, but it is important to understand the context.  While people may argue that it is the banking debt that will tip us over, anywhere between half and two thirds of our total debt is public debt &mdash; debt borrowed by Irish Governments to spend on Irish people.</P><Col N="101"/>
        <P>There is one area in which I think Morgan Kelly is very honest, and I challenge the Members on the left and the Independent Members on the right to be as honest as him on this matter.  He has stated that in order to act unilaterally, Ireland must balance its budget and do so immediately.  We cannot act unilaterally when we are dependent on the EU and the IMF to pay nurses, teachers, pensioners and people who are dependent on welfare payments.  His contention is that we can only act unilaterally, in the way that some people on the far left and far right in this House demand, after we have balanced our national budget, which would require an &euro;18 billion adjustment in one year.  This would mean trebling the universal social charge and implementing cuts of 40% in pay and welfare.  This is the Morgan Kelly prescription, plan B to current Government policy.  I challenge Members on the left and right who sit on the Opposition benches to be honest in saying whether they support the view of Morgan Kelly &mdash; that in order to act unilaterally and dump the Irish banking system on the ECB, the first thing we must do is to balance our books &mdash; and to state whether that is what they are really advocating.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Job creation is central to our economic recovery, and the programme for Government has job creation at its core.  That is why the Government set the jobs initiative as a key high-priority deliverable within our first hundred days in office.</P>
        <P>Small businesses are the backbone of our economy.  We currently have some 250,000 such small businesses, employing approximately 700,000 workers.  By appointing a Minister with specific responsibility for small business, the Government is clearly signalling to the business community and to the public at large that small businesses are and will continue to be central to economic recovery.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s roll is to ensure that we have the right policies in place to support and enlarge our enterprise base to facilitate job creation and retention.  It is only by creating the right environment for businesses to expand that we will see the creation of new jobs.  We must champion the cause of businesses, particularly small businesses, which can create good jobs in sustainable activities.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative is part of a strategy by Government to kick-start economic activity.  The intention of the measures announced yesterday by my colleague Deputy Michael Noonan, the Minister for Finance, is to target our limited resources at key sectors of the economy that can assist in getting people back to work, provide opportunities for those who have lost their jobs to acquire new skills, and build the confidence that will encourage consumers to spend.  In particular, the jobs initiative focuses our limited resources on measures that offer the greatest potential for expansion and employment creation in the domestic economy.  It focuses on labour-intensive areas that will generate jobs quickly, which is important.</P>
        <P>One of the key issues that affects the ability of viable small business to create jobs is access to credit.  This is a challenge the Government is determined to address.  The recently announced plan to restructure and recapitalise the banking system is the principal response to this challenge.  These plans are designed to secure an adequate flow of credit into the economy to support economic recovery, even as the banking system is down-sized.</P>
        <P>The banking system must provide substantial new lending into the economy.  The business plans submitted by the pillar banks provide for more than &euro;30 billion of new lending over the next three years across their core business areas.  Up to &euro;20 billion of this figure will go to small and medium-sized businesses which, as I mentioned earlier, are the backbone of our economic recovery.  The financial authorities will rigorously monitor the banks&rsquo; activities to ensure that credit is available for borrowers who meet reasonable credit standard requirements.  This will be reviewed by Mr. John Trethowan of the Credit Review Office.</P><Col N="102"/>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, there remains an issue, predating the recent banking crisis, whereby new companies or expanding companies trying to develop new products or markets struggle to secure finance.  This can be due to a lack of familiarity or understanding of the new industry or product concerned or the potential of new markets.  This market failure in the provision of credit to viable businesses became particularly acute in Ireland during the property bubble, during which time Irish banks lost the capacity to assess credit risk in companies that were unable to offer property-related collateral.  That is why my Department will work with the Department of Finance over the coming weeks to flesh out the lending targets of the two pillar banks, agreed as part of the bank restructuring plans, and develop a package of additional targeted initiatives designed to address specific market failures in the provision of credit for viable businesses.  These measures will be subject to EU state aid approval where necessary.</P>
        <P>As part of this package of initiatives, and in accordance with the commitment given in the programme for Government, we will also initiate a tendering process for the development of a temporary partial credit guarantee scheme.  The design of this scheme will draw on international experience to support new lending that would not otherwise have been extended by the banks.  In this way, the scheme will complement, rather than be a substitute for, existing lending activities by the main financial institutions.  It will be designed to encourage banks to lend to new or expanding commercially viable SMEs so that they can enlarge their companies, develop new products and expand into new markets.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment will be for an initial period of one year.  Specific performance criteria will be set down that will allow for review and revision of the scheme at the end of that initial period before committing to a roll-over of the scheme for subsequent years.  There will be a modest, and known, level of exposure to the taxpayer when the scheme is launched, but I expect it will have a significant positive knock-on benefit for the economy in terms of job creation, welfare savings and returns to the Exchequer by way of tax revenue generated.  With my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, we will work with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to develop this proposal further.  The details of the scheme will be announced in June with a view to having a targeted scheme in place by the autumn.</P>
        <P>The proposed partial credit guarantee scheme has the potential to support 25,000 jobs directly and indirectly; contribute an estimated &euro;300 million to the Exchequer from increased tax and PRSI receipts and decreased social welfare costs; and to have a positive impact on exports, contributing to further jobs in the medium-term.</P>
        <P>The microfinance start-up fund is an important initiative.  The Government also recognises the importance of supporting business start-ups if we are to encourage entrepreneurship and create more jobs.  We acknowledge the difficulties which can be experienced by micro-enterprises, in getting access to finance at such an early stage of business development, which is critical.  Therefore, the Government is committed to developing a suitable micro-finance fund for micro-enterprises, drawing on funding from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and other sources.  Arrangements for the establishment and operation of such a fund will be developed in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, with a view to formalising proposals in the context of budget 2012.  This commitment on a micro-finance fund is the Government&rsquo;s contribution to filling this gap in the area of financing enterprise.</P>
        <P>Another important initiative is ensuring that there is 15-day prompt payment across the public sector to improve the cash flow of businesses, particularly small businesses.  The Government will require the HSE and the local authorities, excluding commercial semi-State bodies, to pay suppliers within 15 days.  Ensuring payment is made within 15 days is an important measure.</P><Col N="103"/>
        <P>With regard to SME procurement, public procurement in Ireland is worth approximately &euro;15 billion per annum.  It is a critical area for small companies and it will also foster greater SME engagement.  The Government will build on existing initiatives to promote greater access to procurement opportunities for small companies.  It is important that there is greater access to procurement opportunities for SMEs within EU public procurement and such greater access can generate increased businesses.  As well as being an important source of income, winning public sector contracts can have a very positive impact when companies are seeking to win contracts abroad.</P>
        <P>The Government has undertaken, in the jobs initiative, to build on existing initiatives to promote greater access to procurement opportunities for the SME sector.  Enterprise Ireland will assist its client companies to build capability in responding to tenders, will also foster greater SME engagement in developing innovative products and services to meet the needs of public bodies and will explore similar schemes along the lines of the small business innovation research fund.  Enterprise Ireland will be very much involved in this respect.</P>
        <P>The State provides a range of supports to help enterprises run their businesses better, reduce costs and help job creation.  Take-up of some of these schemes by business has been less than optimal.  For example, Revenue&rsquo;s job assist scheme, which allows employers generous tax deductions if they employ a person who has been unemployed for 12 months or more, has been taken up by only a few hundred people, even though in excess of 153,000 people have been unemployed for 12 months.  In the past 18 months, neither the employer&rsquo;s PRSI incentive scheme, nor the F&Aacute;S work placement programme reached their targets.  The Government believes that a higher rate of take-up can be secured on these schemes and on the new initiatives being published today.  The Government will work with business representatives to encourage better take-up of these schemes.</P>
        <P>The Government will also redouble its efforts to promote other supports to businesses, such as those provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  The employers&rsquo; PRSI reduction is very much welcomed and will encourage job creation.  Reducing business costs and burdens is important.  The Government is committed to keeping all costs which impact on business as low as possible.  This will require a joined-up effort across all Departments, and I will work to ensure this.</P>
        <P>Small businesses are the backbone of the economy.  As Minister of State with responsibility for small businesses, I will ensure that the concerns of small businesses continue to be to the fore in Government initiatives that harness the growth and job creation potential of this critical sector.  This jobs initiative represents the first steps of this new Government on the road to improving the economy&rsquo;s international competitiveness and promoting job creation.</P>
        <P>I recognise the contribution of small companies to the economy and their potential for job creation and job retention.  This jobs initiative is a first step.  The reduction in VAT for the hotel sector, the removal of the travel tax and so on will encourage confidence.  The role banks will play in creating credit in the economy and the&euro;20 million that has been ring-fenced for small companies will encourage the entrepreneurial spirit in the country and create jobs.  If only 100,000 of the 270,000 small companies were to employ one extra person, great progress would be made.  The announcement of the jobs initiative yesterday will encourage the potential to create jobs.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Noonan and the Government on a very worthy document that will connect with the Irish people, employers and small companies and will result in the potential for this economy to expand in the not too distant future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment to his position of responsibility and wish him well.  I know from my interaction with him in the previous D&aacute;il that he has a great understanding of business, especially small businesses in terms of what makes them tick and makes small business people get involved, develop an entrepreneurial spirit and the courage to develop businesses and take on people.  I agree with his final point of the progress that would be made if 100,000 of those small businesses were to take on one or two persons, which they are capable of doing if they were allowed to do so.  However, they are allowed to do so because they have had their hands have been tied behind their backs with regulation, lack of finance and barriers in many areas prior to and during the Celtic tiger.  Their initiative, progress and foresight in many cases has been diminished, dampened and extinguished by their treatment by many agencies.  I am not knocking any particular agency but officialdom grew too unwieldy and there was too much form-filling and red tape.</P>
        <P>I encourage the Government in this respect and welcome most of its proposals in the jobs initiative.  It has acknowledged the problems facing small businesses.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, had a good input into framing this initiative.  I hope it will continue and the Government has said that it will be the first of many.  We all know what the parties now in government promised prior to the general election, but the trend is that such promises seem to be made by parties in opposition and in government and that is a pity.  Deputy Martin said that he did not want politics to be a Punch and Judy show, but that is still going on and members of the public are sick of it.  They want real activity, the problems tackled, the red tape cut out and to be allowed to work.</P>
        <P>The Government was too soft in many areas, as in the case of higher earners in the public service.  The salaries of Secretaries Generals and CEOs of State companies are simply not fair.  The Taoiseach and the Ministers took a cut in salary and such reform must extend across the senior public service management.</P>
        <P>The issue of rates must be tackled, as it has become a joke.  Many of the rates reviews occurred during the Celtic tiger years.  A small businessman in my town of Cahir who has paid rates this year suffered a 50% increase in his rates at a time when business is on the floor, so to speak.  One has to appeal such a rates increase to the Valuation Office, the people who set the rates in the first instance.  One has to pay a fee of &euro;300 or &euro;350 for the pleasure of having one&rsquo;s property rating revalued.  Those people then call out and see the building, which will be in the same condition but they do not examine the books and take account of the fact that one&rsquo;s business has diminished and that the rates accruing must be decreased rather than increased.</P>
        <P>Local authority charges also crept up in the good times.  I was a member of a local authority who voted for those charges in terms of the community aspect benefit of them.  We were on a roll at the time and we secured some good community initiatives and supports from such charges but they now have to be re-evaluated because people cannot pay them.  Water rates are charged to cover the supply of water into a premises and waste water out of the premises but people cannot afford to pay them.  They are unfair because the only people being charged for water rates are publicans, restaurant proprietors and so on.   I welcome the cuts in VAT, PRSI and initiatives for lower wages which will help publicans and restaurant owners who were on their knees begging for them.</P>
        <P>Many family businesses are being liquidated and suffering scurrilous treatment from their banks &mdash; this from the banks that lied all time.  The deal from Europe and the IMF was so bad probably because the facts had to be dragged out of the banks.  The other new business in town is liquidation.  Legislation should be introduced post-haste to deal with liquidators.  Many of them charge what they like and often they terrorise business people.  We must examine alterna<Col N="105"/>tives to liquidation for viable businesses such as examinership or other supports.  I am concerned the Construction Contracts Bill seems to have fallen off the Order Paper.  Many small construction and associated businesses, with five to ten employees, get nothing if a larger business which owes them money is liquidated.  The barristers and liquidators involved in the wind-up have phenomenal and obscene charges.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, check out this racket?</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I agree with Deputy Shane Ross on the pension levy and that the vast sums earned by pension fund managers should be examined.  I am glad the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, have acknowledged they will examine them.  Many pension funds, built up with hard-earned contributions, often perform poorly.  Why not impose the levy on pension fund managers?  We need to encourage people to set money aside for their pensions as up to 1 million people have no private pension provision.  Private pensions are generally under-funded while the State pension comes to less than &euro;12,000 per annum and most will have to wait until they reach 67 years for it.  The proposed pension fund levy may create further problems down the line as it may demotivate people from making meaningful pension provisions.  Pensions are no more than deferred taxation as one pays income tax on withdrawals.  In 2005 the Combat Poverty Agency produced a report on the future of pensions, pointing out that by 2036 the number of people over 80 years in the State will rise to 320,000.  We must bear this in mind when addressing this area.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to the 50-day payment by State agencies.  I often worked for local authorities and it was difficult when there were delays in getting paid and it was unfair.  If an invoice is correct, it should be paid on the due date.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s enthusiasm to deal with the public procurement process.  Sadly, with the previous Government, we heard stories of public contracts going abroad because they were not split up to allow Irish companies go under the bar.  If other EU countries do it, why can we not?  The public service must wake up to deal meaningfully with this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the jobs initiative.  Any proposal to lift ourselves out of our current economic dilemma is positive.  While I appreciate that the Government must operate within the strict parameters of the EU-IMF bailout agreement, this jobs initiative appears to be a conservative plan.  We need a more radical plan with more innovation and inventiveness if we are to make a dent in our huge unemployment figures.</P>
        <P>I was disappointed the initiative did not mention the thousands of partially completed houses in ghost estates.  Local authorities, in co-operation with NAMA, should strive to make these houses available to address the growing waiting lists for social housing.  It would also provide an immediate boost for the construction industry and thousands of skilled tradespeople who have few opportunities for work.</P>
        <P>Recently, I received correspondence from a Killorglin-based construction company which employs 26 staff on reductions to home insulation grants.  For example, it is proposed the attic insulation grant will be reduced from &euro;250 to &euro;200, cavity wall insulation grants from &euro;400 to &euro;320, BER certificate grants from &euro;100 to &euro;80 and dry-lining insulation grants from &euro;2,000 to &euro;1,800.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland claims these reductions are because market prices have become more competitive.  The owner of the Killorglin construction company informed me this is incorrect as all insulation materials and other costs incurred, such as fuel, have gone up 20% to 40% in the past several months.  He will be forced to lay off five workers this week and by the middle of the summer he expects to be employing only ten <Col N="106"/>people.  Will the Government intervene and rescind the authority&rsquo;s decision to reduce the grants?</P>
        <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s action in reducing tourism VAT and the commitment to eliminate the travel tax, subject to an increase in passenger numbers which I believe is achievable.  Tourism marketing resources will be made available to Tourism Ireland to assist the three State airports in promoting visitor traffic through co-operative marketing with the airline companies.  Will this be extended to include viable regional airports such as Kerry Airport and Donegal Airport as this could also assist tourism promotion in these counties?</P>
        <P>I welcome the reduction in PRSI and the scheme for 5,000 internships.  They could be extended to 30,000 to provide practical low-cost job training for the State.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Taoiseach will give some deliberation to the matters about pension funds raised by Deputy Shane Ross earlier this morning.  Many owners of small businesses prudently put aside money over the years into pension funds to provide a nest-egg for themselves and their families in their retirement.  It is wrong to victimise these people through a pension levy.  Many of them will only have something like &euro;12,000 a year from their investment.  To demand that they pay &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 in an annual tax on this is somewhat severe.</P>
     
        <P>As Deputy Shane Ross said earlier, we should go after the bigger pension pots.  There is one example of a chief executive officer in one of our financial institutions with a &euro;28 million pension pot.  I cannot see why we cannot go after them in a more substantial way while a ceiling is put on the amount to which this new levy will apply.</P>

	<P>When Fianna F&aacute;il is sponsoring a Bill such as this it is safe to conclude that its love affair with the construction sector is well and truly over.  It is interesting that this comes at a time when the construction industry is in ruins and when Fianna F&aacute;il would struggle to get donations from that sector.  Those paying the heaviest price within the construction sector are construction workers, carpenters, electricians, plumbers and brick layers, many of whom have had to emigrate or, as it might more appropriately be described, go into exile.  Other out of work construction workers are struggling to pay mortgages on homes provided by the very sector in which they worked.  The companies they worked for were for decades some of the biggest funders of the right wing political parties.</P>
        <P>While I am in favour of planning and building all sorts of things I believe we should never go back to a developer-led approach.  As someone who believes in strategic planning, I watched the orgy of rezoning requests, the assumption of a positive relationship between the developers and speculators and the major political parties, in particular Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  I always believed that the money created a culture, opened the door and delivered the result they desired.  There is a direct relationship between what occurred in relation to the property bubble and political donations.  There may have been infamous cases of people getting payments <Col N="107"/>directly, as evidenced by the tribunals, but the money primarily bought a culture, one for which we will pay heavily well into the future.</P>
        <P>As someone who has contested many elections since 1988 without the benefit of big corporate donations I know what it is like to contest an election on a shoe-string.  Too often I believed elections were essentially bought, which is perhaps the reason we have limited political choice.  I agree that the relationship between big business and politics must be broken.  It does not have any place in a healthy democracy.  I favour the ending of all significant private donations to politicians and political parties, a register of lobbyists and the vouching of all public moneys paid to politicians and political parties.  Although I am cynical in terms of the source of this legislation I do not believe it should be postponed for a day longer than is necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin stated in his speech last night that political donations had created a perception that big business can buy influence by financially supporting the election funds of parties or candidates and that it was having a damaging impression, which is putting it mildly.  He might perhaps have said that private capital tends to be concentrated in few hands, the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organised political society.  The members of the legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who for all practical purposes separate the electorate from the Legislature.  It is probably a no-brainer that we should put an end to all political donations.  The practise is certainly unlikely ever to serve the people well.</P>
        <P>If we allow big business to influence elections, thus deciding who gets into power the chances of those elected members acting in the best interests of ordinary people at all times is probably pretty slim.  It is not unfair to say that for the past 20 years Government has ruled more in the interests of big business than in the interests of ordinary people.  There is probably not much point in referring to the massive irony of Fianna F&aacute;il proposing this legislation.  Perhaps, however, we should give them the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps they are a little like Paul on the road to Damascus.  Perhaps they will be different now.</P>

	<P>I am probably naive.  Time will tell.  There is no doubt but that something must change if the people are to garner a better opinion of what happens in this House.  The legislation recommends that donations over &euro;1,000 be declared.  I believe that all donations over &euro;100 should be declared.  The public is entitled to know the identity of anyone who wishes to give &euro;100 or more to a politician.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  There is no doubt but that the interface between business and politics in this country has been toxic.  That link must be broken.  It has created a situation whereby politics and politicians have been brought into disrepute.  Politics is now one of the least, if not the least, trusted professions.  We have had a string of planning irregularities and tribunals arising from the relationship between business and politics in this country.  There is no doubt that link needs to be broken.  We need to clean up politics and to have a level playing pitch in the political arena, in particular in respect of elections and the funding of politicians and political parties in elections.</P>
        <P>We should not permit any political donations, corporate or otherwise and the State should fund political parties.  This is the only way we can be sure there is a level playing field and that donations of whatever nature or amount are, irrespective of whatever law might be in place, <Col N="108"/>not made available to political parties or politicians.  State funding is absolutely necessary if we are to clean up politics and ensure trust in the future.  Also, there should be reduced spending limits for elections and expenditure and expenses should be examined, assessed and audited not alone on the basis of the 15 or 20 days of an election campaign but for at least 12 months prior to an election.  There is no doubt but that period of time is now being used by politicians and political parties to spend significant amounts of money in the run up to elections.  Money buys elections.  State funding of politicians and political parties is absolutely essential if we are to have a level playing field and an honest and trustworthy political and electoral system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a problem which I do not believe is easily soluble but I welcome the fact it has reached the House so early in the session.  If we are honest money buys votes.  All the surveys on this suggest that money does buy votes.  The question that arises is whether money buys politicians as well.  The Irish experience in recent times indicates that money also buys politicians.  How to avoid that is difficult.  I speak as one who is not conflicted by this having received approximately &euro;9,000 or &euro;10,000 in subscriptions in the last election.  I can put my hand on my heart and say those who gave me &euro;9,000 or &euro;10,000 do not have an undue influence on me or a greater influence than those who did not give me money.  They have access.  If someone gives one &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000, it is difficult not to take their telephone calls or listen to what they say.  It is difficult not to take the telephone calls of everyone in this business.</P>
        <P>Money gains people access to far more important politicians than myself.  Therefore, it is a realistic problem.  This is especially so in the case of big business if businesses are in a position to give large corporate donations that will give them lobbying power that is disproportionate to that of the ordinary person.</P>
        <P>The logical conclusion of money being so powerful within the political system is that the State should fund everyone on some sort of level playing pitch, as Deputy Healy said.  I am not sure that would work either.  What would happen in the allocation by the State of that money?  The political party in power would distribute it in a way that is favourable to itself.  The system of distribution would favour the party that was in power when the system was introduced.  What would happen to individual or independent politicians who would be at a disadvantage?  What would happen to those outside the political system who want to begin a new political party or indulge in something that is utterly new?  Would they be completely unfunded and where would their cash come from?</P>
        <P>This is not a problem that is easy to resolve.  We should establish, however, that there should be a level playing field and that large sums of money should be barred from the political system because they give disproportionate influence to the donors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcNamara"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McNamara</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the House, I will share time with Deputies Jerry Buttimer, Dara Murphy, Liam Twomey and Michael McCarthy.</P>
        <P>I oppose the Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Notwithstanding having introduced the Bill, there is not a single Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy in the House to debate its merits.  That speaks volumes for Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s commitment to amending legislation on elections or corporate donations.  The absence of a single Green Party Deputy in the D&aacute;il also speaks volumes for Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s stated commitment to banning corporate donations or amending the legislation on corporate donations in the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Willie Penrose, pointed out when speaking on the Bill, three separate positions have been adopted by Fianna F&aacute;il on this issue since the beginning of the year.  One position was taken when in Government, another during the general election, and the position <Col N="109"/>has been modified in the Bill which Fianna F&aacute;il does not see fit to come and debate with the Government and the Deputies who support it.</P>
        <P>While each change of policy has been an advance on the previous position, and we welcome that, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has also adopted a number of different positions on the very important issue of the creation of an independent electoral commission.  That was a recommendation of the mission of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, to Ireland in 2007, as the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, would be aware and might care to debate with us if he were in the House.  The chairmanship of the OSCE is of some import.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs will assume that chairmanship in 2012.  In advance of that, it is essential that an independent election commission be created.  In the report on its mission to Ireland, dated 24 May 2007, the OSCE stated that the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, had publicly made such a recommendation.  The task force on active citizenship sponsored by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, also made this recommendation in its report, released in April 2007.  In the OSCE report of 25 February 2011, however, the best that could be said was that the creation of an independent electoral commission, consolidating responsibilities for the conduct of elections, voter registration and campaign financing into one body, had been on the work plan of the previous Government but was not addressed before its collapse.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il now purports to address this issue.  I say, however, and would say to Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies if there were a single one present in the D&aacute;il, that it is too little too late.  The Government has a much more ambitious programme for the reform of political funding arrangements which is already in the process of being implemented.  The Government&rsquo;s open Government legislation will also establish an electoral commission to subsume the functions of existing bodies and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The Bill, which Fianna F&aacute;il Members do not see fit to come to the House to debate, has some good and welcome proposals.  In many respects, however, it is too limited and narrowly focused.  It contains a number of flaws that would make its intended provisions unworkable.  While the placing of restrictions on corporate donations from companies, trade unions, societies and building societies is provided for, a number of other corporate structures have not been included, as the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, pointed out.  No provision is made for donations by partnerships, unincorporated bodies, trusts, sole traders or non-governmental organisations.  The Bill, as it stands, would allow a number of corporate-type bodies to continue to give political donations while restricting others.  In its present form, the Bill would not work in practice as it does not address all donors who are not individuals.</P>
        <P>The provisions in the Bill represent a change from what was proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il at the general election, with greater reductions now being advocated.   Perhaps, the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies do not agree with the said reductions as they are not here to support their own Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am alarmed by Deputy Ross saying he would weigh up whether a person had donated to his campaign fund before taking the person&rsquo;s telephone call.  It is the job of politicians to treat all their constituents equally and to be fair and balanced to all.  While money does influence voters, I do not believe for a second that it buys them.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Fianna F&aacute;il metanoia on political reform.  It is imperative that they join the rest of us and become fellow travellers on the road to political reform.  It is lamentable that there is no Member of Fianna F&aacute;il in the House for this important Bill.  If it is to be the centre-piece of Deputy Martin&rsquo;s renewal of the party, he should be present in the House.</P>
        <P>There should be a ban on political donations and State funding of political parties.  Politics should be open and transparent.  We should end cronyism and the old pals&rsquo; act and move forward collectively with a new sense of what it means to be a politician and an active citizen.</P><Col N="110"/>
        <P>I regret that Deputy Ross is no longer in the Chamber to hear me say that the role of the media, in their coverage of politics, should also be looked at.  Some media institutions&rsquo; attempts to portray politics leave much to be desired.  The coverage of yesterday&rsquo;s jobs initiative by certain publications left a sour taste in my mouth.  We need to look at the issue of balance in media reporting.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to speak on the Bill.  It is important we have an honest debate on it.  The influence of money must end in Irish politics and the culture of cronyism must cease.  The circumstances that are the genesis of this Bill, which were examined by the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, must never be seen again.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mick Wallace remarked that not all of us in politics were influenced by business and money.  Many of us who served on local authorities looked to developers when we believed development proposals were wrong or ill conceived.  I agree the Bill is necessary.  However, as Deputy Michael McNamara said, while its broad thrust is necessary, in a narrative and prescriptive sense, it is narrow and needs to be expanded upon.  There are business people who can have a positive influence on politics and the development and evolution of policy.  We should not throw out everything relating to those involved in business.  I heard Deputy Mick Wallace&rsquo;s fine contribution on the jobs initiative earlier when he spoke as a business person.  We must allow people involved in business to have a participative role in politics while not having undue influence.  A ban on political donations is the correct way to proceed.  It is a pity this was not recognised earlier by politicians on all sides of the House.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the commitment given by the Taoiseach today that the Government would bring forward a comprehensive Bill.  It is important that we rebuild trust and the relationship between practising politicians and the general public.  During the last general election, there was a great deal of cynicism and disillusionment, mainly to do with events in the Galway tent and the associated friends of Fianna F&aacute;il which have left a very bad legacy.  No Member should be here to promote himself or herself.  He or she should be here to work for and serve the people who sent us.  All people are equal, whether millionaires or struggling to pay their mortgages while unemployed, and should have equal access.  Influence should be on the basis of what is best for the community and in the interests of creating a sustainable community encompassing our homes, townlands and cities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  In the first instance, it is amusing and distressing to note that it is only now, after 14 years of inactivity while in government, that Fianna F&aacute;il is introducing this Bill.  While Deputy Michael McNamara laments the fact that no Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy is present, it is also important to note that our colleagues in opposition and in government spent many long weeks before the general election trying to reduce the number of Deputies; therefore, it is a mixed blessing.  Nonetheless, it is negligent of Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies not to be present to support their own Bill.</P>
        <P>Yesterday Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin described the Bill as a new departure in how politics were conducted in Ireland.  He suggested it was historic in transforming how politics were conducted and would make politics more transparent.  He said it would break the link between business and politics, stating, &ldquo;This Bill will begin the process of restoring confidence in politics after a long and damaging run of controversies.&rdquo;  He further stated this new-found ambition of political reform had &ldquo;as yet&rdquo; gone undelivered.  The reason it has gone undelivered is simply, like so much else we have seen in the last decade and a half, Fianna F&aacute;il and its coalition partners did not deliver or attempt to deliver reform.  In fact, it is clear that much of the detail enclosed in the Bill can be seen in the election manifestos of Fine Gael and the Labour Party and, most importantly, the recently published and agreed programme for Government.  Significantly, not <Col N="111"/>only does the Bill plagiarise sections of the programme for Government, it also has some flaws which make this amendment too narrowly focused and unworkable.  The Bill omits key areas of reform.  It is like Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s long and damaging time in office &mdash; half-baked, cynical, hypocritical and self-serving.  Yesterday Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin requested that this debate be free of point-scoring.  I can see why, when Fianna F&aacute;il has left the goals unattended and neglected for so long.  This is its Bill, after all, and we are entitled to score points and goals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must, nonetheless, be constructive.  As Members will be aware, the Government has made provision in the current D&aacute;il term for the publication of its own amendment to the political funding Bill and it is expected that draft legislation will be ready in a number of weeks.  It is at this point of the debate helpful to reiterate the following commitments made in the programme for Government.  Spending limits will be introduced for all elections; political donation limits to parties will be reduced to &euro;2,500; donations to candidates will be reduced to &euro;1,000 and legal and constitutional provisions will be introduced to ban corporate donations to political parties.  It is further intended that an electoral commission will subsume the functions of other bodies and some functions of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Importantly, after a very short time in government, many long overdue reforms have either been announced or already taken place.  The Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, announced the following Government decisions last week.  A constituency commission will be established after the publication of the 2011 preliminary census results to facilitate the promised reduction in the number of Deputies.  The Presidential election spending limit will be reduced from &euro;1.3 million to &euro;750,000, while the figure for expenses which candidates can be reimbursed will be reduced from &euro;260,000 to &euro;200,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all remember the outrageous attempt made by the last Government to prevent the people from having proper representation in this House by delaying the holding of by-elections.  The Government has decided to block this cynical obstacle to democracy by ensuring by-elections will take place within six months of a vacancy occurring.  It is also preparing separate legislation to give effect to other changes and reforms.</P>
        <P>The suggestion made by the Opposition of tardiness in the Government&rsquo;s approach to reform is contradicted in several obvious respects, including the removal of the automatic entitlement to State cars and drivers for Ministers, the cutting of the pay of the Taoiseach, Ministers and Ministers of State, and the removal of severance pay for Ministers.  In addition to the measures included in the programme for Government, the recent Moriarty tribunal report outlines some further areas for consideration by the Government in 12 specific recommendations, consideration of which should and will form part of the Government&rsquo;s package of reforms.  Given its weaknesses and narrow focus, I urge all Members not to support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Deputy Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is much hypocrisy in politics but that of Fianna F&aacute;il in bringing forward this Private Members&rsquo; Bill is unbelievable.  Restoring decency and faith in public life and the public system will not be done by legislation; therefore, significant further changes beyond the scope of this Bill will be needed.  We must change the whole ethos of public life, both as public representatives and within the public service, where bad practices have crept in and been almost institutionalised in the era of Fianna F&aacute;il dominance of political power.  The crass arrogance of pious Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is difficult to stomach for the people.  When they have to listen to him lecture them about corruption and payments to politicians, they must ask themselves what they are hearing.  For Fianna F&aacute;il to try to take credit for acting on the issue of political donations is almost beyond belief and it sickens people to watch this Bill being brought forward.  Fianna F&aacute;il should be wearing sackcloth and considering disbanding as a political party, not lecturing the people or trying to pretend it has had a pious change of heart about what has happened in public life in recent years.</P><Col N="112"/>
        <P>It is difficult to run for election and be elected.  I do not know if political donations hold great sway in the way people like to believe.  I have won elections having received little or no funding and I have lost elections having received a reasonable amount of funding.  I have also seen people run very good election campaigns with very little funding.  People are sensible about this.  However, given all the corruption in recent years, what they want to see is accountability and transparency in how we go about our business.  They want to see an end to the days when somebody like Ray Burke could be appointed as a Minister when a cloud was hanging over his head &mdash; a person subsequently jailed for tax fraud.  They want to see an end to a time when a person like Liam Lawlor, a former Member of this House, was made chairman of the ethics committee of the House.  Members at that time knew Liam Lawlor had a cloud over his reputation but they appeared to cock their noses at what people felt or might feel about ethics in public office.  They want to see an end to a time when a former elected Taoiseach, the leader of this country, tried to pass off the fact that he earned his money by putting bets on horses.  That is the era we must get rid of in Irish public life.  We must bring in more honesty and transparency, and a sense of decency about being involved in public life.</P>
        <P>I do not claim we will all be perfect and squeaky clean.  It does not work like that.  There will be things I do believe to be reasonably okay; there will be things my colleague in County Wexford, Deputy Wallace, will do that he will believe to be reasonably okay but which I believe are wrong.  That is just the way life is.  What we need most of all are accountability to the people, proper transparency about how we go about our business and get elected, and to be honest and decent in how we do our job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate being given the opportunity to speak on the issue and am glad to see an issue this important being subjected to robust and constructive debate in the Chamber.  I hope the contributions made during the course of this dialogue will go some way towards fine tuning the details concerned so we can enact the best possible legislation to deal with the whole issue of political donations.</P>
        <P>In line with previous speakers I must sound a note of irony that Fianna F&aacute;il has introduced this Private Members&rsquo; Bill so soon into the life of the new Government given it had ample time and opportunity over the 14 years it was in power, not only to publish the Bill but to enact and implement it.  Furthermore, the party effectively buried the Bill in the latter months of its tenure in Government in spite of repeated declarations by its colleagues in Government, the Green Party, that it was a top priority of its legislative programme.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s sudden and renewed interest in the entire area now that its members have entered the Opposition benches strikes me, as I assume it does most reasonable minded commentators, as an act of enormous cynicism and political posturing.  It contravenes the party&rsquo;s recent declaration that it was engaging in a new style of constructive politics, bereft of point scoring and one-upmanship.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il Bill is not only overdue, it is also vastly underconsidered.  It has aspects that are worthy of mention as well as a whole host of absentee points that merit, at very least, declarations.</P>
        <P>The link in this country between business and politics is an issue of substantive concern to ordinary people.  Unfortunately, in most countries, financial support from business to politicians is perceived by the public to have only one purpose, namely, the securing of commercial advantage.  We have seen how the money-driven model of politics that exists in America can infect the public perception of politics, with business and corporate interests seen to be taking precedence over societal interests.  In Ireland, this perceived link between political donations and public policy is particularly pronounced because people&rsquo;s views have been further coloured by controversies such as those revealed in the Moriarty, Flood and Mahon tribunals, in spite of <Col N="113"/>the good work they did.  They catalogued high profile figures from business and political worlds who were found to have been trousering donations in exchange for various deals, contracts and such like.  These lurid scandals rocked the State to its core and have done untold damage to the body politic and to Irish politics in general.  That situation does not reflect well on any of us in this House.  The real victim is the body politic.  Politics is a fine and noble profession.  The vast majority of people in this House &mdash; some 1,100 throughout the years &mdash; have been hardworking, decent, honourable people.  Only a handful corrupted the system for their own ends.</P>
        <P>Buying influence and access to senior members of Government and civil servants is a practice that belongs firmly in the past, along with the Galway tent and the Charvet shirts, all those words that have become synonymous in recent years with dirty politics.  Sometimes the cross over between the corporate and the political is unavoidable but we must try to temper the level of intersection between both areas.  To this effect my party intends to publish, enact and implement legislation during our time in Government which will shield against the influence of commercial interests in politics, prevent the imperative that created the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals and sever, once and for all, the link with that ugly past in political culture in this country.</P>
        <P>As a new Government, tasked with an overwhelming mandate from the people to whom we promised to be open and honest, we need to lead from the front and show people that politicians and civil servants cannot be contaminated by business interests.  We cannot afford to brush this aside as successive previous Governments have done.  The people&rsquo;s faith in us to reform political system is paramount and we cannot afford to forget that.  Already, in the eight or nine weeks this Government has been in office, it has led by example and I hope it will continue as it started in that regard.</P>
        <P>We cannot afford to pass this legislation lightly and that is why I intend to address some of the elements of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s proposals.  There is a fundamental need to reform the funding of politics in this country but this Bill simply does not go far enough.  It is limited in focus and some of its elements are unworkable.  To be specific, it contains a provision to restrict corporate donations from companies, trade unions, societies and building societies but there are no restrictions for donations by partnerships, unincorporated bodies, trusts, sole traders and non-governmental organisations.  At very least that is inequitable.  There must be more consistency in the way Fianna F&aacute;il approaches corporate donations and the issue in general.  The party has flip-flopped consistently on the issue in recent months, adopting no fewer than three different positions since the beginning of this year &mdash; one in Government, one during the general election and another now in Opposition as it advocates greater reductions.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes that the Standards in Public Office Commission should audit the accounts of political parties every year.  However, this ignores mechanisms already in place between SIPO and parties whereby parties are required to submit audited financial statements in respect of State funding received under Electoral Acts and through the party leader&rsquo;s allowance.  The provision in this Bill would undoubtedly lead to a convoluted situation whereby parties would submit audited statements to SIPO while SIPO would be required to carry out a further audit on those same parties.  An issue to be considered for the future is duplication.  We cannot afford to pass legislation that will add to the confusion and unnecessary costs associated with duplication.  Furthermore, Fianna F&aacute;il proposes that candidates who have been unsuccessful in elections should publish their donation statements within 25 days of polling.  Successful candidates would have until 31 March of the following year to declare donations.  However, the measure proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il does not appear to provide any demonstrable improvement on current arrangements.</P><Col N="114"/>
        <P>An aspect of the Bill I welcome is the proposed extension of the supervision powers of the Standards in Public Office Commission to include independent expenditure in referenda.  This is a worthy inclusion in the Bill because specific problems have arisen in the past with regard to the regulation of spending and sources of income of groups campaigning at referenda, for example, the likes of Libertas.</P>
        <P>However, the overall objective of this Government, namely, to make the political system more open and transparent for the voter, would not be achieved by this Bill as it currently stands.  The fundamental point is that Fianna F&aacute;il has a record of failure in reforming the area of political funding and therefore this latest gesture is a see-through and cynical exercise, particularly given the party&rsquo;s links with big business in the past which were well documented, not least by tribunals.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has a strong record in transparency and our party ideology is underpinned by principles of fairness and equality.  That is why we fully support the reform of the political funding structures.  That is just one component of our broader campaign to reform the Irish political system.  When last in government we enacted both the Standards in Public Office Act and the Freedom of Information Act.  In addition, we have championed for the protection of lower-paid workers, the unemployed and the marginalised.  Such people have come to expect better from the political system.</P>
        <P>There is a saying in west Cork which holds that there is none so pure as the reformed.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle can finish the sentence himself.  The Damascene-type conversion of what I was going to call the major Opposition party &mdash; perhaps that is an issue to be defined by the Technical Group &mdash; is welcome.  I hope its conversion to reforming political funding structures will be carried forward in the years ahead.  It is good that we are debating this issue in the House.  I welcome the U-turn in Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s policy on political donations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies John Browne and Barry Cowen.  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate but I will not respond to the last quotation from Deputy McCarthy.  It is important to consider the strengths of Irish political life since the foundation of the State and the contribution that many fine parliamentarians and members of local authorities and town councils have made not only to the betterment of their own area and the individuals who sent them to these various elected bodies, but to the country as a whole.</P>
        <P>Certain Members opposite have pointed the finger at figures in our party.  We could continue point scoring and holding that their party did this and our party did that.  However, a vast number of people, almost 1,100 in total, have gone through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These people have made significant contributions at a significant personal cost not only to their financial situation, but in terms of their families.  The commitment they have given to be in public life and to serve their country has been remarkable.</P>
        <P>That said, the Bill is before the House and, rightly or wrongly, we must clear up the image of politics.  Politics has been downgraded and a source of scandal within the Irish mindset in recent years.  The Bill was brought forward and promised during the general election campaign.  I commend the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for bringing forward this legislation so early.  It is important to set the tone in this regard.  We acknowledge that mistakes were made in the past when there was a close association between very sizable donations and political parties and Governments.</P>
        <P>A great many people elected to the House have never received a donation good, bad or indifferent.  Such people have always worked from their own resources and have a sense of pride that they have funded campaigns from their own resources.  There are parts of constitu<Col N="115"/>encies throughout the country the socioeconomic make-up of which means that they do not have the capacity to make political donations even at a small level.</P>
        <P>There is an argument about democracy and how it should be funded.  The argument on the other side considers the payment of elected representatives.  In recent years, the debate has been about whether Members of the D&aacute;il, Seanad and local authorities were overpaid.  We have been working constantly on the question of whether if one pays a person a decent wage to come to the D&aacute;il, should such a person be able to fund some of his or her election campaigns.  There is also the question of funding parties through the leaders&rsquo; allowances.</P>
        <P>I welcome the initiatives contained in the Bill and it is important to bring them forward.  We are disappointed at the response to the Bill, which has been given careful consideration on our side of the House.  We received expert legal advice on various aspects of it.  Some Members have cited some flaws in it but there is an amendment process on Committee Stage and these issues can be debated and people can bring forward effective amendments if there are issues or sections within the Bill which need to be strengthened.</P>
        <P>It is important to move away from old ideas and the old system in which sizeable corporate donations funded the political system.  Points were made with regard to the United States of America, where the first question is how much money a particular candidate can raise when he or she is embarking on an election campaign and then the money follows the candidate.  This should never be the case in the Irish Republic.  We must aim to ensure there is proper representation here of all sectors and socioeconomic groups.  Regardless of who a person is, if one is of an age sufficient to vote, if one has a case to make or a point to put across, if one has campaigned well and one is genuinely serious about being elected, then it should be possible to become elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas or to local bodies.  This is what a true republic needs and wants.</P>
        <P>We have seen people from across the spectrum elected to this D&aacute;il and it is an important acknowledgement of democracy in any republic that we have had this opportunity.  Democracy cannot be and should never be only for the elite, the wealthy or any specific section of society that benefits from funding.  The Bill provides the legislation to move away from the ability of the wealthy or well-heeled people or members of society to influence an election or several elections.</P>
        <P>There are several points to note in the Bill.  There have been several references to companies, societies, trade union movements and so forth and the donations these groups have made.  I would have gone further than the proposed limit of &euro;100.  I would prefer if it were completely abandoned because it has no future in our society, especially in the coming years as we get out of the recession and given the difficulties experienced by many families throughout the country.  There should be no such thing as donations.  Parties should have members and a structure like any organisation be it sporting, community and so on.  If a person wishes to have an effect in an organisation he or she joins that organisation and moves through it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which is solid.  The Members opposite have used the word &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo;.  However, this is a serious and genuine effort by Fianna F&aacute;il.  If the Members opposite are so concerned about our hypocrisy they should support the Bill tonight when it comes to a vote and if they wish to tease out any issues on Committee Stage, then that is what the Houses of the Oireachtas, the D&aacute;il Chamber and committees are for.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il acknowledged the need for this legislation during the general election campaign and we committed to introducing this Bill.  I am pleased that I and my colleagues can endorse and support the Bill.  I urge all other parties, including those in <Col N="116"/>government, to join forces considering the universal willingness to dismantle and cease the corporate donations system.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach reneged on such a commitment before but I hope he will not renege on it again.  I hope the Taoiseach and his Government will see fit to support the Bill.  I have no wish to rehearse the matter and many speakers in our party and in other parties have referred to the abuses of the funding mechanisms which have been in place over the years.   As Deputy Moynihan stated, we bring the Bill to the House with the best intentions, goodwill and good faith.  Fianna F&aacute;il made this honourable commitment to the public and has now produced this elaborate and all-encompassing Bill, which contains many of the key Moriarty tribunal recommendations.  In the course of this debate, some of the Government speakers said how committed they are to the implementation of those recommendations; this Bill offers the opportunity to prove that commitment.</P>
        <P>The most significant part of the Bill introduces restrictions on corporate donations from companies, trade unions and societies, as Deputy Moynihan said.  To get back to the present Government and where it stands in this regard, it promised legislation to ban corporate donations.  It stated that it would not support this Bill but is that a surprise?  The coalition also promised to abolish the Seanad within a year and that is not to be the case.  The coalition promised political reform by reducing the number of TDs by 20 but based on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government&rsquo;s remarks last week, that plan has gone out the window.  In March Fine Gael said it would reduce the number of Ministers of State to 12; that went out the window.  Fine Gael promised to abolish 145 quangos; that has gone out the window &mdash; it has created 36 new quangos.  The red line issues prior to the election, the dismantling the IMF-EU deal and not putting another cent into the banks, are out the window as well.  The one thing it did not promise was that it would take savings from pensioners, which it did yesterday and committed to do for the next four years.</P>
        <P>Despite the clever optics and spin and the prolonged honeymoon from the media, this coalition is failing on all the famous red line issues it identified prior to the election.  That was during the time of the politics of fear.  We remember the carry on, the name calling, with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, accusing certain people of economic treason.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, said the country was banjaxed.  Now, however, the Government is adhering to the very same banking policy it ridiculed then, buying into the necessary austerity.  The new spin in the past week or two is that it has been constrained by a straitjacket.  Thank God it has a straitjacket around it because those are the sorts of policies it must pursue.</P>
        <P>The only input that has shown any sense of individualism from the Government was yesterday&rsquo;s jobs initiative, despite the fact that it did not meet the target set before the election of 100,000 jobs with a &euro;7 billion investment.  Much that was in the plan is welcome, especially for the hotel and leisure industries, which needed a leg up; I acknowledge that and pay tribute to it.  Many other parts of the plan are the usual rehash and repackaging, whether it is roads or schools or other work that would take place anyway.  They were packaged well and sold to give an impression.  We are back to the sort of spin that was deplored.  The Government could save itself from having to climb down again by supporting this Bill.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred last night to the policy of Sinn F&eacute;in TDs, who donate part of their salary to their party.  Is this legal?  Is it a political donation?  Is it taxed?  I do not know but I ask Sinn F&eacute;in, in this House or outside, to come out and makes a statement on the matter and make a commitment with the same vigour many of its speakers showed when they attacked us for the perceived hypocrisy &mdash; in Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s opinion &mdash; of us bringing forward a Bill of this nature.</P><Col N="117"/>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask for wholehearted support for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il promised this legislation before the last general election and during the general election.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin made the commitment after the election that he would introduce this Bill.  I have been a long time in the House and I have heard a great deal of talk about political donations down the years and the reform of this House but nothing ever happened; there was a great deal of hot air.</P>
        <P>Tribunals have cost a fortune, making millionaires of legal eagles.  The media-fuelled perception of the public representatives is that they were all on the take.  Every politician, TD, Senator or councillor, was getting bagfuls of money for favours granted.  We heard all the talk about the tents in Galway and Punchestown and the Fine Gael golf classics in the K Club.  All of these were highlighted for many years.  Like in every organisation, there will always be some rotten apples in the barrel, but 99% of politicians are decent, honourable people who are there to serve the people and do their best for the community.  That is what communities want, they want their politicians to be available to help them and to support them.  As Deputy Michael Moynihan said, there were plenty of politicians elected at the general election from all shades of the community because the people who voted for them wanted someone who reflects their views and ideals.</P>
        <P>I fought the recent general election and received some contributions, which were acknowledged and receipts were issued.  They will be sent to the relevant authorities whenever necessary, and I am sure other politicians did the same.  That is not to say we were on the take or being bought off.  Democracy is an important system and it is important we continue to have a democratic process here.  Political parties and individuals who want to represent this country in a democratic fashion should be able to receive contributions provided they are meeting the regulations and acting in a transparent manner.</P>
        <P>We hear much talk about reform of the political system.  Fine Gael spoke of reducing the number of TDs by 20, although the number suggested has since fallen to 16.  By the next general election there will probably be no reduction in TDs because the commission set up to look at the issue will recommend the retention of the <i>status quo</i>.</P>
        <P>This House needs a fundamental change, an issue I have raised on several occasions in my political career.  In many ways, it is irrelevant to what is happening in the community.  I am amused most mornings when people raise matters of urgent national importance with the Ceann Comhairle.  They read out a statement and the Ceann Comhairle says that having considered the matter seriously, it is deemed not to be urgent, even though the House could be going down the river.  No matter what the issue raised in the D&aacute;il, it is very seldom the Ceann Comhairle will say a matter is urgent and can be debated.  That is where we must look at reform.</P>
        <P>I fought the election in Wexford, as did Deputy Wallace.  I will not speak for Deputy Wallace, who had lovely, shiny pink posters that people must have bought into, because he got 13,500 votes.  I was out-postered four to one and I had a fair number of posters.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I was out-vanned, so to speak, four to one and I was out-manoeuvred in every way possible by the other major political parties, yet I stayed within the financial limits for a five seat constituency.  This is an area which is wide open to abuse.  A candidate could say his or her posters had been erected prior to the calling of the election, even though that is illegal.  He or she could say that the flyers were bought before the election.  The issue of expenditure at a general election needs to be re-examined.  Expenses can be counted properly.  I have great faith in the political system, however, and in the public representatives of this country, the majority of whom are not in it to make money or to line their pockets but to represent the people who elected them to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P><Col N="118"/>
        <P>This Private Members&rsquo; Bill deserves careful consideration.  It implements key recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal relating to political funding.  It proposes to cut donation limits, introduce an effective ban on corporate donations and provide for an annual audit of all income paid to political parties from public or private sources.  The Bill effectively ends corporate donations and dramatically increases the level of transparency in political funding and expenditure.  I doubt if the Government will follow through on its commitment but this Bill will afford the opportunity to consider a number of other issues relating to the second report of the Moriarty tribunal.  Deputies on all sides of the House, including newly elected Deputies, have had an opportunity to contribute.  I noted some excellent contributions, including views on how political funding should be dealt with.  I do not think any one party has a monopoly on knowing how to deal with the issue of political donations, but this Bill goes some of the way in dealing with the issue in an open and transparent way.</P>
        <P>The public want politicians and political parties to be open about how they are funded.  This has not been done in the past.  Some political parties have not been open about the amount of funding they receive during a given year, the identity of the donors or how it is spent.  This Bill gives parties an opportunity to state exactly where they stand on political donations.  Contributions to political parties from individuals should still remain, however, because otherwise the taxpayer will be required to fund the democratic system fully and I do not think taxpayers would wish us to introduce such a measure.  All political parties will have to admit they will depend on individual contributions if they are to survive.  I hope the Government will support this Bill, although from my experience on both sides of the House, I know this will not happen as the Government will regard its own legislation as better than a Bill introduced by any party in Opposition.  The Attorney General will always find some flaws, real or imagined, to stop such legislation.  This Bill is worthy of consideration and support and, more important, it has opened up the debate on political donations.  I ask all sides of the House to support the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>In concluding the contributions from the Government side, I restate the view that this Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; Bill includes some very worthwhile proposals.  Some of the measures in it are included in the programme for Government and they will be implemented.  However, the Bill is too narrow in scope and it lacks ambition.  It contains a number of technical flaws that make it unworkable.  The Government will not support the Bill but will publish draft legislation in the coming weeks which will reform political funding in a more comprehensive and joined-up manner.</P>
        <P>It is striking to hear in the contributions to the debate the relative unanimity among Members on all sides that the regulation of political donations needs to be significantly changed.  Most Deputies have referred to the Moriarty tribunal recommendations while many speakers, including Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin of Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien of Sinn F&eacute;in, have drawn upon recommendations made by independent bodies, including the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Council of Europe group of states against corruption, known as GRECO, and Transparency International.  It is clear from the extensive and detailed range of recommendations made by these independent bodies and by others that there is no shortage of analysis on the shortcomings in Ireland&rsquo;s arrangements for the funding of politics.  The one aspect that has been lacking up to now has been a willingness to act.</P>
        <P>This failure to act is one reason I am baffled by the apparent urgency the party opposite now attaches to this issue.  In a generous interpretation it could be regarded as the zeal of the convert.  There was ample opportunity in the past to implement the necessary reform measures <Col N="119"/>but this was not taken.  The programme for Government published by the previous Administration in the summer of 2007, committed to addressing the issue of corporate donations to political parties.  If Fianna F&aacute;il had acted then, this could be a different debate now and the mood of widespread public cynicism and mistrust which, unfortunately, accompanies this issue might not be as bad.  Having come through a recent general election campaign, we are all aware of what is now expected of us.  We need a system of political funding that inspires public confidence and which needs to be more transparent.  Thankfully, we now have a Government which will act on those wishes and views of the public.</P>
        <P>In responding to this debate on behalf of the Government, I also note concerns raised by some speakers, especially Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, regarding spending by organisations during referendum campaigns.  The Government agrees that change is needed in the regulation of spending and donations at referenda.  The provision in the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill, however, amounting to a relatively minor amendment in the definition of what constitutes a third party at a referendum, would appear to be wholly insufficient to achieve anything of substance.</P>
        <P>I also note the contributions of Deputy Niall Collins, Deputy Thomas Pringle and others who have spoken.  While the Government does not support the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill, this side of the House looks forward to the continued input of Members in the implementation of the programme for Government.  We are confident in our ability to bring about change, but we also know that we do not have a monopoly on wisdom or good ideas.  However, the Government intends to overhaul radically how Irish politics and government work.  The electoral (amendment) Bill is being drafted for implementation during the current D&aacute;il session.  As the Government legislation programme states, this Bill will amend the terms of reference of a constituency commission in a way that will provide for a report on D&aacute;il constituencies to be made on the basis of a reduced number of Deputies in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Bill will also reduce the spending limits for presidential elections and legislate for every D&aacute;il by-election to be held within six months of the vacancy arising.  Separately, the electoral (amendment) (political funding) Bill 2011, which is to be published during the current D&aacute;il session, will amend the Electoral Acts and implement the political funding commitments set out in the programme for Government.  The electoral commission Bill, which will be enacted during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il, is also on the Government legislative programme.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il legislation that is before the House is a relevant input into the national debate on the role of politics and on how politics should be supported and funded.  However, the Bill lacks conviction, is weak on detail and, in some respects, cannot be seen as credible.  It appears to address some of the recommendations in the report of the Moriarty tribunal, albeit in a relatively piecemeal way and with a paucity of joined-up thinking.  Provisions similar to those contained in the programme for Government have been included in the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill.  I refer particularly to those reducing donation limits and the threshold for their declaration.  The provisions dealing with third party involvement in referendum campaigns are relatively limited and, in their present form, are unlikely to have a significant positive effect.</P>
        <P>The principal measure in the Bill &mdash; that restricting corporate donations &mdash; does not appear to have been fully thought through.  The loopholes in it would allow a number of corporate-type bodies to continue to make political donations.  The Government has a different way of doing things.  We believe our way is far more comprehensive and considered.  We are offering a joined-up approach to reform.  We aim to address how our political institutions work.  In many cases, they do not work to their full potential.  We will reform political funding, election spending and electoral administration.  Our legislation will match the expectations of the Irish people for action with legislation and policy measures that will work.  Accordingly, on behalf of the Government, I oppose this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="120"/>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>Although I am a new Deputy, I have followed the work of the D&aacute;il closely over a number of years.  One of the biggest problems when debating legislation is the tendency of many Deputies to fail to engage with the detailed contents of the Bill before the House.  Even though no benefit can be gained from being partisan because the media ignores 95% of all debates, too many Members seek to prioritise partisan attacks ahead of more constructive exchanges.  A significant extension in the amount of time for which the House sits has been proposed, but it is clear that additional time will not deliver an improvement if the approach to debate is not changed.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge those Deputies who took the time to look closely at the comprehensive proposals in this Bill.  I remind those who preferred to make cheap points that the next election is probably over four years away.  If we cannot be constructive in these early weeks of the new D&aacute;il, it does not bode well for the rest of the term.  In light of the contents of the Moriarty report and the histories of many of the parties represented in this D&aacute;il, the lack of self-reflection in most of the contributions was striking.  We are all politicians.  We represent different local and party interests.  Robust exchanges are part and parcel of what we do.  The dismissal of a proposal simply because it comes from an opponent is the type of politics that was supposed to have ended when the people cast their votes on 25 February last.</P>
        <P>This constructive Bill deals comprehensively with the core issue of how political funding is handled.  It operates within the boundaries of what is constitutionally possible at this time.  In effect, it bans corporate donations.  A fuller ban will be possible if the constitutional amendment we published yesterday is enacted.  The legislation is based on the principle that elections should be decided and funded directly by those entitled to vote and no one else.  It goes much further by introducing greater transparency to all aspects of our political work.  It responds in detail to the key recommendations of the Moriarty report.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the two tribunals that were established to investigate these matters.  One of them was ongoing until a couple of months ago and the other has been ongoing since 1997.  I am particularly concerned about the cost of the two tribunals.  The basis and rationale for their establishment was the fact that the making of donations within our political system had not been properly regulated over the years.  The last 14 years of investigations, which resulted from the lack of regulation of our political system, did great damage to the political fabric of this country.  In addition, they exposed the damage that was done to Irish politics over many years by a minority of people.  The Moriarty tribunal cost more than &euro;100 million and the Mahon tribunal is set to cost more than &euro;250 million.  Therefore, more than &euro;350 million has been spent on two tribunals that have investigated what went on in politics as a consequence of the failure to address certain issues and ensure this type of legislation was in place before now.</P>
        <P>Politics has been funded by the State for a number of years now.  State funding was first made available at around the time of the establishment of the Moriarty tribunal.  The most recent figures for State funding of political parties show that some &euro;5.5 million was provided to political parties under the Electoral Acts.  The figures in question, which relate to 2009, have been provided by the Standards in Public Office Commission.  A further &euro;8 million was provided for the funding of politics through the party leaders&rsquo; allowances.  Therefore, a total of &euro;13.5 million was made available by the State in 2009 to fund party politics.  The failure of the State in previous years to get involved in and take a serious attitude to the funding of politics led to the establishment of two tribunals that are to cost us &euro;350 million.  That money would have funded the political system for many of the years in which the damaging activities that the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals were established to investigate took place.</P>
        <P>The Bill before the House is absolutely key and important.  It is not possible to introduce an outright ban on corporate donations until the referendum on the matter later this year.  This <Col N="121"/>legislation proposes to bring greater transparency to the way in which corporate donations are made.  It will make it significantly more difficult for donations to be made.  I will sum up some of its key proposals.  All corporate donations of more than &euro;100 will have to be declared within 14 days, authorised by a general meeting and registered with the Standards in Public Offices Commission.  Any donation by a company or trade union that exceeds &euro;100 will be difficult to make and will have to be extremely transparent.  The company or trade union will have to apply to the commission to be registered as a &ldquo;donating company&rdquo; or &ldquo;donating trade union&rdquo;.  It will have to give the commission full details of the organisation, membership and shareholding of the company or trade union.  It will be required to have secured support for the donation through a vote of its members or a general meeting.  If a donation is subsequently made &mdash; obviously, a donation to a political party could not exceed &euro;2,500 &mdash; the Bill will require that any donation of more than &euro;100 be published in the accounts of the company or trade union.</P>
        <P>The company or trade union will be required to publish in its accounts details of any Government contracts worth more than &euro;1,000 into which it entered, or intended to enter, at the time of the making of the donation.  This builds on another important recommendation in the second report of the Moriarty tribunal, which is that donors should be obliged to identify any relevant financial, commercial or other interests if their donations exceed a certain threshold.  This includes an obligation to identify any Government contracts or any involvement in procurement processes.  This requirement is not limited to the company but includes its directors, shadow directors or significant shareholders.  Failure to comply with these requirements will be a criminal offence, punishable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 12 months or a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000.</P>
        <P>Another key change in the Bill is the reduction in the maximum allowable individual donation to political parties and third parties from &euro;6,348 to &euro;2,500, with the level at which these must be publicly declared to fall from &euro;5,078 to &euro;1,000.  It also reduces the maximum allowable donation to a candidate from &euro;2,539 to &euro;1,000 in any one year, with the level at which these must be publicly declared reduced from &euro;634 to &euro;500.  While a donation above &euro;1,000 for political parties and a donation above &euro;500 for an individual candidate must be declared, any donation above &euro;100 from a company, trade union, society or building society must also be declared.</P>
        <P>The Bill also introduces an amendment to section 23A of the Electoral Act 1997.  The amendment is based upon one of the recommendations in the Moriarty report on political funding which identified a problem where one donor makes a series of donations, all of which are under the declarable threshold.  The amendment provides that where a donor makes a donation in the same year to two or more persons of the same party, these would be treated as one donation to a political party or third party.  As a result, the amendment ensures that not more than &euro;2,500 per annum could be donated by one donor.</P>
        <P>Another key recommendation of the second Moriarty report regarding political funding was that political donations should be disclosed in a reasonable timeframe following an election.  For this reason, the Bill requires the publication of donation statements within 25 days of polling.  Currently, the timeframe is 58 days for unsuccessful candidates and 31 March of the following year for successful candidates.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides that the Standards in Public Office Commission will audit the accounts of political parties each year, with the income and expenditure account, balance sheet and donations statement to be published.</P>
        <P>The contribution made by the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, last night on behalf of the Government was surprising.  At times it sounded as if it had been written by two separate people.  On the one hand, the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was generous and constructive in <Col N="122"/>recognising the quality of the Bill and the collective interest in seeing its objectives realised.  He also outlined in detail the major programme of reform in this area which was enacted in the past 14 years.  I thank the Minister of State for his statement that this legislation has meant that many of the core abuses pointed to in tribunal reports could no longer take place.  For example, the tour of the country made by staff of ESAT who personally visited constituency fund-raisers for Cabinet Ministers in 1995 could not have been kept secret if the current law had been in operation.  In addition, the issues concerning the Telenor donation which ended up in an offshore account could not have arisen under the legislation introduced by the previous Government.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, the Minister of State was sent in to the Chamber to perform the role of justifying the fact that the massed ranks on the Government benches will be sent in tonight to vote down the Bill and delay the achievement of its objectives.  To do this, he cited a list of minor issues to which he attached inflated importance.  His point concerning other types of corporate entities which should be covered could be addressed by a Committee Stage amendment, as could other points he made regarding definitions.  Some of the most important parts of the existing electoral Acts are short and simple sections and it is not true that definitional issues cannot be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach was wrong today and yesterday in claiming that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party had indicated that the Bill was flawed when we introduced it.  We did nothing of the sort.  We indicated that we expected it to be amended in committee.  This is the first time an entirely new Bill, as opposed to legislation published in the previous D&aacute;il, has been dealt with by the 31st D&aacute;il.  Perhaps Deputies have forgotten that nearly all legislation can be amended extensively in committee.  One of the Standing Orders requires Ministers to point to areas on which they anticipate amendments will be introduced.  To argue against the Bill on the basis that it cannot be enacted exactly in its original form is to ignore the reality of the legislative process.</P>
        <P>On those occasions where a Private Members&rsquo; Bill has been enacted, major amendments have been made on Committee Stage.  I spoke earlier today to Senator Feargal Quinn who is making great efforts to pass legislation in the Upper House to facilitate early payment of subcontractors.  If the Senator&rsquo;s legislation is passed, it will be the first time in 40 years that a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill originating in the Seanad will have been enacted.  This is a terrible indictment of the political system and one which makes it difficult for any party to pour cold water on a Bill which tries to address this problem.  None of the parties in the House can take the high moral ground on the issue of having an Oireachtas which is open and allows all Members to participate.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, also criticised the Bill for not being sufficiently comprehensive.  In doing so, he listed the Government&rsquo;s entire political reform agenda while omitting to mention that it is not proposed anywhere in its agenda to deal with political funding legislation.  All parties support the establishment of an electoral commission, work on which has been under way for some time.  There are, however, no proposals to enact legislation in this regard in the coming months.</P>
        <P>The Government has not pointed to a single area which is omitted or a single difficulty with drafting which cannot be dealt with in committee.  This point relates to the different proposals contained in the speeches of Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies and members of the Technical Group.  Having listed the major reforms enacted in the past 14 years, the Minister of State unfortunately fell back on the already tired line that my party was in power for 14 years.  He knows full well that a Bill would have been enacted by now if the D&aacute;il had been sitting in February.  He is also aware that the Bill before us and the constitutional amendment represent the first time any party has ever put forward a detailed proposal to end corporate donations.</P><Col N="123"/>
        <P>I have been a Deputy for two months and I am proud to have my name attached to this Bill.  The Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, has been a Member of the House for nearly 20 years and many other Members have been here a good deal longer.  Unless they believe they did not have any responsibility for legislation during their time in the House, they should explain the reason they failed to introduce a ban on corporate donations, either in government or opposition.</P>
        <P>To claim that the Bill lacks &ldquo;vision, credibility and detail&rdquo; is untrue.  Ministers have asked Deputies to vote down the Bill on the basis that they will introduce a measure in this area shortly.  Where similar circumstances arose in the past, Governments have, as a statement of good will, declined to vote down Bills and instead attached a qualification to the vote.  Under this procedure, a date is set for the Bill to proceed to committee if the Government fails to fulfil its commitment.  For example, a Fianna F&aacute;il disability access Bill became law because the rainbow Government failed to enact promised legislation in time.  Availing of this procedure would have been a more convincing response to the Bill than the over the top opposition we have heard.</P>
        <P>The net effect of voting down the Bill tonight is that we will have to wait longer for a ban on corporate donations and the other reform measures proposed in the legislation.  The Government&rsquo;s measure will emerge at some point in the next month.  Under the rules of the D&aacute;il and Seanad and other formal requirements, the legislation will not be in operation during the period when candidates are raising money for the presidential election.  Perhaps it is the intention of Fine Gael and the Labour Party to have one last visit to the trough before the ban comes into effect.</P>
        <P>This is a good and comprehensive Bill which fulfils my party&rsquo;s election promise to bring this matter to a vote early in the new D&aacute;il.  Its date puts off the fulfilment of the Government&rsquo;s promise.  I commend it to the House and recommend its adoption.</P>

	<P>I would like to take this opportunity to invite a member of President Obama&rsquo;s visiting party to County Cork to visit the ancestral home of an Irishman who exerted considerable influence on the formative years of the United States of America, that is, Edmund Burke.  If Burke&rsquo;s vision of co-operation and trade had been embraced and implemented earlier, it would have dramatically changed the course of American and world history.  We might be living in a different world today.  However, Burke&rsquo;s early recognition of America&rsquo;s great potential as a market of singular global importance marks one of the earliest and most significant political connections between Ireland and America.</P>
        <P>Killavullen in north County Cork is the ancestral home of Edmund Burke, one of the greatest political writers and orators of his or any other time.  He intervened passionately on behalf of the American colonists in the 18th century in an attempt to avert war.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomBarry"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Barry</NameTxt>
	<P>Edmund Burke wrote: &ldquo;Politics ought to be adjusted, not to human reasonings, but to human nature; of which the reason is but a part, and by no means the greatest part&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Edmund&rsquo;s mother was Mary Nagle, whose people, a large extended family, were the leading Catholics in what is still known as Nagle country in the Blackwater Valley.  The poet Edmund Spenser was married to a member of the family and it was to Nagle country that Edmund Burke was sent from Dublin at the age of six years to live with his uncle Patrick Nagle in Ballyduff at the foot of the Nagle Mountains.  According to local tradition, he was returning to the place of his birth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is said that Edmund was sent to Cork for the sake of his health, as Dublin was an unhealthy place in the 18th century.  However, it is probable that the opportunity to receive a Catholic education was of as much, if not more, importance.  The penal laws of the time prohibited and penalised Catholic education, the presence of Catholic priests and attendance at mass, but while the code was strongly enforced in Dublin, places like Ballyduff in the parish of Killavullen in the 1730s were openly Catholic.  Edmund attended a hedge school under the walls of the ruined castle of Monanimy, formerly a Nagle stronghold.  The Blackwater Valley was and is one of the most beautiful regions in Ireland and is where Edmund Spenser drew inspiration for the landscape of <i>The Faerie Queene</i>.  Burke stayed in north Cork until the age of 11 years, immersed in a culture far removed from that of Dublin and the Pale.</P>
        <P>Elected to the British Parliament in December 1765, out of public necessity Burke played down both his Irishness and his Catholic associations.  His political ideology, inspired by his experiences in Ireland, were to extend out into the world and, particularly, to America.  He abhorred slavery and argued against seating representative Americans in the British Parliament on the grounds that this would mean the seating of slave-owners.  The cry of &ldquo;no taxation without representation&rdquo; had been raised as part of American resistance to the Stamp Act, and allowing American representation in the British Parliament was one proposed solution.  Historians claim a distinct link between his views on slavery and his formative years in an Irish Catholic hedge school pursing a forbidden education.  As a respected parliamentarian, Burke tried during the early phases of pre-revolution in the American colonies to persuade the English not to provoke the Americans into rebellion by taxation, but rather to extend their rights and independence.  Burke&rsquo;s repeated warnings were not heeded and the war that ensued was, in Burke&rsquo;s mind, a civil war.</P><Col N="126"/>
        <P>The Blackwater Valley region in north County Cork has very strong connections with North America, going back to the first ever European settlement on the Continent.  The settlement was organised by Sir Walter Raleigh, who owned land in the Blackwater Valley.  On 9 April 1585, Sir Richard Grenville, landlord of Fermoy and a first cousin of Sir Walter Raleigh, set sail for America with 100 colonists in seven vessels.  Among the organisers on board was the artist and cartographer John White, who had previously lived at Newtown, Doneraile.  John White&rsquo;s watercolour drawings are of great significance in American history as they gave detailed visual information about the native North Americans and how they lived, along with excellent detail of the flora and fauna of the region.  John White&rsquo;s granddaughter Virginia Dore, the daughter of John&rsquo;s daughter Eleanor Dore, was the first recorded European born on American soil, on 18 August 1587.  Although much of White&rsquo;s work has been lost, a number of drawings were retained.</P>
        <P>The potential for literary and cultural tourism in this country is enormous, and Edmund Burke is a pivotal figure in this respect.  This is good for Ireland and complements the recent jobs initiative.  I formally invite any member of the American visiting party to Edmund Burke&rsquo;s ancestral home.  If time prevents this, I would be obliged if the Minister would be so good as to inform the President and his party of this unique link and association between our two nations.</P>

	<P>The visit of President Obama, similarly to the visit of Queen Elizabeth, offers unparalleled opportunities to showcase Ireland on the international stage.  These historic visits provide us with a significant opportunity to focus on economic, trade, investment and tourism opportunities with Britain and the US, our two most important economic partners.  Naturally, there will be a high level of international media interest, which will provide an opportunity to put out a positive and forward-looking message that Ireland is open for business.</P>
        <P>The Government, in consultation with State agencies, will fully maximise the opportunities that the visits and media attention provide to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  As I speak, Tourism Ireland has extensive promotional programmes in place throughout Britain, America and other markets.  The Irish-US economic relationship is mutually beneficial and is stronger now than at any other time in our history.  Some 95,000 Irish people are employed by US companies using Ireland as a gateway to 500 million European consumers, and Irish companies in turn employ 82,000 Americans across all 50 states.  US investment in Ireland stands at $165 billion, which is greater than US investment in Brazil, China, India and Russia combined.  World business leaders such as Microsoft, Google, Intel and Facebook recognise Ireland as a pre-eminent location for fresh thinking and a global hub for innovation.  Ireland is still regarded as a good place to invest and we have many strategic advantages to attract global investors in the long term.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our partnership with the US in the fight against global poverty and hunger is important to us, and we regard it as a central element of our foreign policy and Ireland&rsquo;s role in the world.  We are also working closely with the US in the area of collaborative research and development among researchers and industry to generate innovation in the marketplace and lead to improvements in health care, disease prevention and technological innovation.  Our bilateral relationship is innovative and far-reaching, and the opportunity to highlight these connections during the President&rsquo;s visit has tremendous promotional value for Ireland and the potential to benefit Irish society as a whole.</P>
        <P>In March, when President Obama announced his intention to visit Ireland this year, he characterised the visit as a significant statement of confidence in Ireland.  The forthcoming visit will shine a much-needed light on the many positive qualities that have made Ireland renowned <Col N="127"/>throughout the world &mdash; our youth and resilience, our ingenuity and ability.  It is also an opportunity to celebrate the outstanding achievements of our people over many generations and across many continents, including those who, like Edmund Burke, foresaw and contributed to the success that America would achieve as a nation.</P>
        <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach outlined the details of President Obama&rsquo;s visit to this House and advised Members that arrangements for the President&rsquo;s visit are close to being finalised, with a number of senior officials travelling to Dublin in the coming days to agree the final details.  The programme will include a visit to Moneygall, and President Obama is expected to give a public address in Dublin.  This event is intended as a public welcome to the President and First Lady.</P>
        <P>In view of the short duration of his visit, I understand there are no plans, with the exception of his visit to Moneygall, for President Obama to travel outside Dublin on this occasion.  As Deputies will appreciate, there have been many attractive and generous invitations issued for consideration by the President, but unfortunately it has simply not been possible to accommodate them.  I listened to the statement made by the Deputy and acknowledge the significance of Edmund Burke.  I will convey to the visiting party the statement that was made here this evening in the hope that, if not on this occasion then perhaps on a future occasion, there may be suitable recognition of the work and significance of Edmund Burke.</P>
        <P>I know that people from all across Ireland will come to hear the President make his address.  The President&rsquo;s visit is an historic opportunity to put Ireland and our people on view before an international audience.  It is an opportunity to show Ireland at its very best, to focus on our trademark tradition of warm hospitality, and to celebrate our rich and diverse cultural heritage.  The economic benefits will extend across the Irish economy, far beyond the few locations the President will visit in person.  We hope the images of President Obama in Ireland will encourage other visitors to follow in his footsteps.  Together, the visits of the US President and Queen Elizabeth will showcase Ireland to a huge audience of potential visitors in Britain, the US and across the globe, and have the potential to deliver a major boost to Irish tourism in 2011 and beyond.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmKeaveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Colm Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me this opportunity to raise a matter of great concern and sadness on behalf of the Fitzpatrick family of 61 Shannon Park, Portumna, County Galway.  I raise this matter with the full consent of the family.  As a Government Deputy for the constituency of Galway East, I have been instructed by the Fitzpatrick family to highlight concerns relating to the death of their beloved son and brother Matthew.</P>
        <P>Matthew was the second youngest of nine children.  He was 34 years old and worked as an interface engineer for Sanmina International.  He lived in Mannheim, Germany, for three years prior to his death.  On the morning of 11 December 2010, Matthew was found dead in his apartment in Germany.  The Fitzpatrick family was not notified of Matthew&rsquo;s death until approximately 7 p.m. on 12 December, a full 36 hours after his death.  They were informed of this tragic and devastating news by a member of Matthew&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend&rsquo;s family.  To this day, Matthew&rsquo;s parents, Donal and Eileen, have not been contacted by any German official about their child&rsquo;s death.</P>
        <P>According to the German police, Matthew&rsquo;s ex-partner Sabrina Krause made the discovery when she arrived at Matthew&rsquo;s apartment at approximately 10 a.m. on the morning of his death.  Ms Krause was found a short time later by a neighbour, crying and saying it was her fault Matthew had died.  I am referring to commentary from the coroner&rsquo;s report and the report of <Col N="128"/>the German chief investigator.  The inquest heard that she had a knife in her hand, had taken an overdose and had to be restrained when she tried to jump out of a window of the apartment block.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>On 22 December 2010 the Mannheim police and the state prosecutor closed the case of Matthew&rsquo;s death, stating it was death by suicide.  Matthew&rsquo;s body was repatriated to Ireland and to his family on 17 December 2010 and, on the following day, 18 December, the deputy State pathologist in this country identified numerous injuries on Matthew&rsquo;s body to which cause had not yet been established or resolved to the satisfaction of the Fitzpatrick family, injuries such as a blunt force trauma to the back of Matthew&rsquo;s head, numerous contusions and abrasions to Matthew&rsquo;s face and body and a deep injury to his lower back which showed considerable haemorrhaging.</P>
        <P>The Fitzpatrick family claim with great concern that the number of injuries identified by the Irish authorities are not referred to or acknowledged in the autopsy report carried out by the German state prosecutor&rsquo;s office.  Giving evidence, the Irish deputy State pathologist was unable to clarify the matter further and said suicidal strangulation, suicidal hanging or third party strangulation were all possibilities in this regard, which is completely contrary to the outcome of the pathologist&rsquo;s report in Germany.</P>
        <P>It has been confirmed at the Irish inquest that Matthew had a friendly encounter with a married woman many months prior to his unfortunate death and that as a consequence of this brief situation, Matthew was subjected to a process of up to 20 unwelcome and unintended telephone calls days prior to his death.   The coroner, Dr. Kieran Geraghty, had advised the jury they should not bring in a verdict of suicide if they had any doubt with regard to the verdict.  A jury of nine Irish citizens recorded an open verdict after the hearing of that evidence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this regard I call on the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to meet the Fitzpatrick family with a view to identifying with the concerns set out by them.  It is critical that a family haunted by the tragic loss of a brother and son are satisfied by Government that it can be an agent of support if or when an injustice is perpetrated against an Irish citizen in this country or abroad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my sincere condolences to the extended family of Matthew Fitzpatrick.  It is very traumatic for any family to learn of the death of a loved one, and for this to have occurred overseas, in tragic circumstances, can only increase the family&rsquo;s distress.</P>
        <P>My Department was first alerted to the death of Matthew Fitzpatrick in Mannheim, Germany on 13 December 2010.  I am informed that the German authorities returned the cause of death as suicide.  When the remains were repatriated to Ireland, however, a post mortem examination was carried out in Dublin by the deputy State pathologist.  I understand that on 22 April at the Coroner&rsquo;s Court in Dublin, a jury returned an open verdict on the cause of death.  I am also informed that the family wishes to have the police investigation in Germany into the death reopened.  I assure the Deputy and the Fitzpatrick family that my Department will continue to provide all possible consular assistance to the family and will continue to facilitate their dealings with the relevant German authorities in the pursuit of their aims.</P>
        <P>As I am sure Deputy Keaveney will appreciate, any reopening of a police investigation may raise the possibility of future legal proceedings.  As I would not wish to prejudice any matter which may be put forward for the determination of a court, I will limit my comments in this case to the consular case involved and the consular assistance provided thus far by my Department to the deceased&rsquo;s family.</P><Col N="129"/>
        <P>My Department has been in contact with the deceased&rsquo;s family since our notification of the death on 13 December 2010.  Consular assistance has been provided by our embassy in Berlin and by our consular assistance section here in Dublin.  I understand that the arrangements made by my Department have included facilitating contacts with police, undertakers and lawyers in Germany and with the Dublin County Coroner&rsquo;s Office and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Ireland.</P>
        <P>An officer from our embassy in Berlin travelled to Mannheim on 15 December 2010 and met relatives of Matthew Fitzpatrick.  Our embassy supplied details of English-speaking funeral directors in the region to assist the family in making arrangements for repatriation.  The embassy provided assistance in dealing with the mortuary, local authorities and the appointed funeral director on behalf of the family.  The embassy also supplied a list of English-speaking lawyers practising locally in order that the family could get professional legal advice on the case and the procedures involved.  I believe that, following repatriation of Matthew&rsquo;s remains, our embassy provided unofficial translation services for a considerable amount of documentation to facilitate the family&rsquo;s contacts with the German authorities and also translated a number of representations made by the family into German, as Mannheim police had made clear that they were unable to process communications in English.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the family expressed their desire to gain access to Matthew&rsquo;s apartment to retrieve his personal effects and informed our embassy that an embassy liaison person was required for this purpose by the Mannheim police.  An officer from our embassy again travelled to Mannheim on 7 January to assist the family in this process and provided assistance in mediating between the family of the deceased and the family of his former partner.</P>
        <P>I am also informed that our embassy requested the assistance of the Garda liaison officer in The Hague, Netherlands, to assist the family further.  My Department understands from our contacts with the family that this link with their local garda&iacute; has been much appreciated and that the response received overall from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been of great support to them.  In addition, our embassy in Berlin provided unofficial courtesy translations of extensive police notes on the man&rsquo;s death.</P>
        <P>On 22 March 2011, the Garda liaison officer based in The Hague and the officer from our embassy in Berlin travelled to Mannheim to meet the police officer who led the investigation into the death.  I understand a senior representative of the state prosecutor&rsquo;s office of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg was also present and at this meeting.  Our embassy, I am informed, assisted the family to communicate their concerns regarding the manner in which the police investigation had been conducted.</P>
        <P>It is the understanding of my Department, at this point, that the state prosecutor&rsquo;s office in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg is now considering the report of the Coroner&rsquo;s Court in Dublin.  Clearly, it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with any investigation under way in that jurisdiction.  As I am sure Deputy Keaveney will be aware, the German authorities are fully expected to deal with all operational matters involved in such an investigation.  I am also informed that my Department has advised the family to take professional legal advice on their current position and on the legal options now open to them to pursue this case.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned earlier, my Department, through our embassy in Berlin and our consular section in Dublin, will continue to provide all possible consular assistance to the family and will continue to facilitate their dealings with the relevant German authorities in the pursuit of their aims.  I assure Deputy Keaveney that I will take a personal interest in the matter and will continue to liaise with him on it.</P>

      <sTitle>Garda Investigations</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for the Adjournment debate.  Yesterday, Mr. Justice Kelly issued a decision in the High Court refusing to sanction an application for a six month extension of time in the investigation by the Garda <Col N="130"/>S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Corporate Enforcement into certain matters concerning Anglo Irish Bank.  Instead, he gave the investigators until the end of July when the matter will come before the court again.  Essentially, Mr. Justice Kelly was putting us all on notice that the investigation by the Garda and the Director of Corporate Enforcement into Anglo Irish Bank is in danger of collapse.  He extended the investigation to the end of July and said that the progress of the two year inquiry was not satisfactory, that he would extend it to 28 July when he expected much progress to have been made, and warned that if a further extension was sought in July, he would have to be given a detailed update on progress, including what happened to material sent by the investigators to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions last December and last March.</P>
        <P>This decision by and these comments of Mr. Justice Kelly represent a wake up call, if one were needed, to the authorities on the urgency of concluding this investigation.  It is a function of this House, especially of the Government, to ensure the Garda and the Director of Corporate Enforcement are equipped with every possible tool to enable them to complete that work as soon as possible.  Mr. Justice Kelly is clearly frustrated at the length of time the investigation is taking.  This is a frustration shared by all citizens.  It is not for me to determine the guilt or innocence of anyone in connection with the Anglo Irish Bank investigation but we have a right to insist that all parties give full co-operation with the inquiry.</P>
        <P>There was a report in the media last week, one which has not been contradicted, that the former chief executive officer of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. David Drumm, now living in the United States, has refused to make himself available for questioning by the Garda and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  This is a disgrace.  Mr. Drumm, as Anglo Ireland Bank&rsquo;s head of lending between 2003 and 2005, and then as chief executive of the bank until 2008, is a key player in the catastrophic Irish banking crisis.  The bank that he led has cost the taxpayer almost &euro;30 billion.</P>
        <P>For Mr. Drumm not to co-operate with the investigation is to give the two fingers to the Irish people.  This is an affront to our citizens and to the democratic institutions of this State.  He must not be allowed to run away from his responsibilities.  All Members will agree that Mr. Drumm and everyone else associated with the investigations must be held accountable here for their actions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mr. Drumm is in the United States on an E-2 visa, which is for people who make a qualifying business investment in the United States.  Mr. Drumm, accordingly, remains in the US solely on the basis of the permission and grace of the US authorities.  The irony is that, while in the US on an E-2 visa, it emerged that Mr. Drumm filed for bankruptcy there in October 2010.  In addition, Anglo Irish Bank has lodged papers with the US courts challenging Mr. Drumm&rsquo;s eligibility for the E-2 visa.  Mr. Drumm can only be extradited from the US to Ireland if he is being prosecuted here and he cannot be extradited for questioning alone.</P>
        <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs raise the issue of Mr. Drumm&rsquo;s US visa with US ambassador to Ireland, the US State Department and urge the US authorities to revoke this visa?  The US authorities should be asked to revoke Mr. Drumm&rsquo;s visa on the basis that he is wanted in Ireland to be questioned as part of the most complex investigation of its kind in the history of the State.  I am sure he could be very helpful to the investigation if he made himself available.</P>
        <P>Several other issues also emerge from Mr. Justice Kelly&rsquo;s comments yesterday.  What are the blockages preventing a successful conclusion to the investigation into Anglo Irish Bank?  In the short time he has been in office, has the Minister for Justice and Equality had the opportunity to receive an update on the investigation?  If people are to have any faith in public administration, the criminal justice system and politics, it is important that the Anglo Irish Bank investigation is brought to a successful conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="131"/>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Anglo Irish Bank investigations cover several issues comprising the short-term back-to-back deposits of approximately &euro;7.4 billion executed by Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life &amp; Permanent at the end of September 2008; the provision by Anglo Irish Bank of funds to certain persons for the purchase of its shares in July 2008; the bank&rsquo;s loans connected to certain former bank directors which were not adequately disclosed in the bank&rsquo;s financial statements for many years; and an Anglo Irish Bank loan provided to one of its directors in September 2008.</P>
        <P>All sides of the House have supported the investigations by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  Significant progress has been made.  In its recent report to the High Court, the ODCE indicated three investigation files and several further reports were submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions in late 2010 and early this year.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the ODCE are working to complete the remaining aspects of their investigations.  They hope to do so by the end of the year.  The Government is anxious that these investigations be completed as quickly as possible.  The Minister for Justice and Equality and I have taken a keen interest to get an update.  We have ensured all necessary resources are made available to ensure these investigations are brought to a conclusion.  Any investigation, however, must also be thorough and meet the tests of evidence.</P>
        <P>Both investigations have received additional assistance in the form of extra staffing support.  In the ODCE investigation, some 16 staff, including the garda&iacute; seconded to the office, have been more or less exclusively engaged for the past two years on these investigations.  Six of these 16 staff are new to the office having been provided by my Department or the Garda Commissioner since 2009 at the request of the director.  My Department does not have any further request for additional staff on hands at this time from the director.</P>
        <P>The ODCE&rsquo;s investigation of Anglo Irish Bank has also been assisted by new legislative provisions, supported by all sides of the House, when it enacted the Companies (Amendment) Act 2009.  The ODCE has used the seizure powers in that Act, and it is the use of these provisions which has given rise to the recent High Court review.  I am aware of Mr. Justice Kelly&rsquo;s comments but Deputy Michael McGrath will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on court proceedings which are in progress.</P>
        <P>The task of conducting these investigations is difficult and complex and the processing of the millions of electronic documents seized by the ODCE in September 2009 is complicated and time-consuming.  In the area of white-collar crime, generally, the Government has moved urgently to provide new procedures and powers which will speed up current and future investigations, including investigations into offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will publish a criminal law Bill on Friday containing these changes.  I hope all parties will co-operate in its early enactment.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has assured the Minister for Justice and Equality that the resources allocated to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation are sufficient to meet the demands placed on it in the investigation of white-collar crime.  While the internal allocation of Garda personnel is a matter for the Commissioner, he has informed the Minister that 11 appointments, including ten new staff, have been made available to the bureau in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>The ODCE and the Competition Authority were significant contributors to the recent consultation process undertaken by the Department of Justice and Equality in the white-collar crime area having regard to their experience of work in the area.  These submissions are reflected in the Department&rsquo;s recently published overview of the submissions it received.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fully understand public frustrations at the delay in seeing an outcome to this investigation.  However, the time taken to conclude these investigations is not unique.  It is regrettable that complex investigations in large companies take time in many jurisdictions with a similar legal system to ours.  By way of illustration, I note the UK&rsquo;s Serious Fraud Office last week issued a <Col N="132"/>press statement relating to charging three people with offences of false accounting in a UK public company which is now in liquidation.  This investigation was accepted by the Serious Fraud Office in January 2007 and has been conducted since then in conjunction with the City of London Police.  Similarly in March 2011, the Serious Fraud Office reported that it had mounted extensive search and arrest operations in London and Reykjavik in co-operation with other authorities relating to the circumstances surrounding a banking collapse in October 2008.</P>
        <P>I am assured by the Director of Corporate Enforcement that his office is acutely aware of the public desire that the Anglo Irish Bank investigations be concluded as speedily as possible.  However, the ODCE is equally conscious of the absolute need, in the public interest, to avoid any short cuts that could damage the prospects of a successful prosecution in the event that the Director of Public Prosecutions decides to press charges in any case.  The ODCE is endeavouring to conclude its investigations as quickly as possible without compromising the prevailing legal standards for the acquisition of criminal evidence.  It will continue to work closely with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on their respective investigations into Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner and the Director of Corporate Enforcement are independent in the discharge of their criminal investigative functions.  This must be respected by everyone.  As an independent officeholder, the Director of Public Prosecutions will, likewise, make decisions in the Anglo Irish Bank case when he is in a position to do so.  It is important that all public representatives, in this House and outside of it, refrain from making comments which could potentially prejudice taking criminal proceedings in due course.</P>
        <P>These investigations have made substantial progress.  My Department remains available to offer any suitable assistance to the ODCE in concluding these investigations.  I am aware that the Government does not have a role in prosecuting offences.  However, we will take all appropriate action open to us to ensure these investigations are brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>I will bring the matter of Mr. Drumm&rsquo;s E-2 visa to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs so he can examine the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion regarding it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to the House.</P>
        <P>I raise this matter as the provision of support services to people at risk is becoming an increasingly important issue in my constituency and, I am sure, in many other constituencies throughout the country.  I agree that the Minister and the HSE have a duty of care to provide for young people at risk.  However, it is equally important to balance those duties of care to the young people at risk with an obligation to the communities where the services are being located.</P>
        <P>I represent the constituency of Dublin Central which probably has the highest concentration of residential social and support services in the country.  The recent experience at the Stepping Stone premises on Botanic Avenue shows the need for the proper management and regulation of such premises.  Stepping Stone opened a residential care centre for troubled adolescents at the premises on Botanic Avenue in January 2011.  From the outset, there were serious issues of anti-social behaviour on the part of the youths living in Stepping Stone and an inadequate response from management.  There were threats to people and damage to property locally.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that there was no consultation with the local community on the proposed use of the premises.  Moreover, there was no consultation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the matter.  They had not even been informed of Stepping Stone&rsquo;s intention to locate there.  Reports of anti-social behaviour from youths living in the premises started soon after Stepping Stone moved in and it was only then that the Garda S&iacute;ochana became aware of the nature of <Col N="133"/>activity being carried on.  The situation came to a head last week when a serious criminal incident occurred.  Fortunately, the Garda was able to deal with the matter effectively.  Nevertheless, a quiet residential community was seriously disrupted.</P>
        <P>The HSE has contracts with a large number of organisations such as Stepping Stone to run residential care units on its behalf.  It is not clear how much these organisations are paid as they are private operators but there is no doubt they are more than adequately remunerated for their work at the taxpayers&rsquo; expense.  The HSE should have complete oversight in regard to the provision of such facilities.  It should be the conduit of information with all of the relevant agencies in an area where such services are being located.  The HSE should also ensure that there are clear procedures in place for liaising with the relevant agencies.  For example, the local Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be the first agency to be consulted but in cases such as this it is the last to be consulted.  Moreover, there is a need for strict guidelines regarding the management and operation of such facilities, which clearly were not in force in the case of Stepping Stone.</P>
        <P>The HSE should put protocols in place to ensure that the senior management personnel liaise, consult and work with the local communities in which they are operating.  Clear procedures for responding to issues as they arise and before they develop into a crisis must be established.  Where the systems fail, the HSE and, ultimately, the Minister should be accountable.  Furthermore, on a broader scale, the HSE should develop procedures in regard to the number of centres and support services to be located in any one residential area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dublin City Council has acknowledged that a concentration of voluntary and statutory organisations is not in the interests of the people being served by these organisations and is not good for the local community where they are located.  Accordingly, DCC has adopted policies in its current city development plan stating the need to avoid a proliferation of institutions and support services in any one area.  The HSE should adopt a similar policy to ensure that there is not a concentration of its outreach facilities in any one area.  At present there is no register of facilities and services provided or funded by the HSE.  The Minister should instruct the HSE to compile a register and map outlining the location of such facilities to facilitate future planning.</P>
        <P>To date the HSE has failed to put in place adequate quality control and monitoring of the procedures and management of facilities managed by outside agencies.  It is time that the Minister ensured that the HSE took responsibility for the operation of the centres and facilities it funds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Costello for bringing this issue to our attention.  I agree that one is lining oneself up for trouble where one does not consult or get the support of a community for the location of a facility like this.  This should also be done through consultation with other agencies charged with keeping public order.  The business of putting facilities in place without telling anyone, thus allowing people to find out about them by dent of an occurrence in their area is completely wrong.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to reply to this Adjournment matter.  The Health Service Executive is required under the Child Care Act 1991 to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  There are a number of procedures which the HSE can use when dealing with children who are at risk or who are in need of care.  If a child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home then the HSE must apply to the courts to take the child into care.  The HSE is obliged to care for these children for as long as their welfare requires it.  All of these children have unique circumstances and experiences that need to be taken into account when HSE managers, social workers and other staff are planning and providing services.</P><Col N="134"/>
        <P Just="Left">Standards for children in residential care are governed by the National Standards for Residential Care.  The HSE centres are currently subject to inspection by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the non-statutory centres are currently registered and inspected by the HSE.  The centre referred to by Deputy Costello is a non-statutory centre which was registered by the HSE to commence operation on 10 September 2010 pending a full inspection as per the registration and inspection service protocol.  The centre was registered for a maximum capacity of two young people aged 12 to 17 on admission.  The written and agreed purpose and function of the centre was to offer short-term placements to young people.  The service was to offer a high level of support to young people in a community based setting.</P>
        <P>The first full on-site inspection of the centre by the HSE took place on 14 and 15 March 2011.  There were two young people living in the centre at the time of the inspection.  In general, the inspectors found that the centre was not in substantial compliance with a number of operational practices and there were issues with leadership and management of the centre.  It was also identified that there was no consistent model of care being utilised in the centre.  The inspectors have been in regular contact with the centre since the inspection and have been informed by the registered proprietors that it is their intention to request the suspension of the registration of the centre.  A meeting has been organised with the registered proprietors to formalise the suspension of the registration.  There is currently one young person in the centre and a move on plan has been identified for this young person in a planned manner.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Deputy for bringing this matter to our attention.  I will take on board his suggestion in regard to a register of non-statutory centres, which is probably where the problem arises.  I also agree that the register should be available to all local authorities in regard to planning matters.  The manner in which the centre concerned was put into operation is not the model we should be following.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my earlier reply to Priority Question No 29.</P>
        <P>As we approach the Centenary of the Easter Rising and of many other events of profound historical significance, I believe there is a need for an extensive and balanced programme of commemorative activities and events reflecting the cultural, economic, social and political events of the period.</P>
        <P>As already stated, the arrangements for National Commemorative Programmes are co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Reflecting the strong interest of the Government, the Taoiseach wrote on 3rd May seeking nominations from Party Leaders with a view to the re-establishment of the All Party Oireachtas Consultation Group on Centenary Commemorations.  This Oireachtas Consultation Group, which I will Chair, will offer a forum to consider the duration, scope and scale of an appropriate commemorative programme to cover the Centenary anniversaries of a momentous period of our national history.</P>
        <P>The national commemorative arrangements will reflect official consideration and consultation on an inclusive basis in the Oireachtas.  I would also welcome proposals from voluntary bodies, community groups and the Irish people at home and abroad.  I envisage a multi-annual programme extending in the first phase to 2016.</P><Col N="136"/>
        <P>The events of 1916 and the following years were momentous ones for the country.  In the natural order of things, it is the first major anniversary to be addressed by a generation with no direct involvement in that period of struggle and conflict.  Insulated in this way, there is an unprecedented capacity for objectivity and uninhibited dialogue.</P>
        <P>I should not embark today on the discussions which will take place within the Consultation Group on the possible arrangements.  It is sufficient to say that I am looking forward to meeting with the nominated representatives shortly to progress this initiative.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to supporting North/South co-operation, particularly in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are two North/South Implementation Bodies under my Department&rsquo;s remit &mdash; Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga (the Language Body).  The latter body consists of two agencies &mdash; Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency/Tha Boord o Ulst&egrave;r-Scotch.  These bodies were set up under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999.  Both of the Implementation Bodies carry out a range of activities in line with their remits with funding from the two Sponsor Departments &mdash; my own Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>I look forward, along with the Minister of State at my Department, Mr Donnchadh Mac Fhionnlaoich, T.D., to participating regularly in meetings of the North South Ministerial Council, in both the Waterways and Language sectoral formats and in its plenary format.  I am advised that a North South Ministerial Council meeting in plenary format is to take place on 10 June next and that meetings in sectoral format for both Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga are currently being scheduled.</P>
        <P>In general terms, it would be my objective to avail of all suitable opportunities to advance North/South co-operation across the range of my Department&rsquo;s functions, including arts, culture, language, islands and heritage.  In this regard, I hope to make early contact with my Ministerial counterpart in the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure when the appointment in question has been made by the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>

	<P>The Passports Act, 2008 requires that before issuing a passport to a person, the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be satisfied as to the identity of each applicant and that the person is an Irish citizen.  Documentary proof in respect of identity and entitlement to citizenship are required for all passport applications.  These requirements are outlined in the passport application form notes that accompany each application form.  Details are also available on the Department&rsquo;s website.   Birth certificates are among the standard documents that are required for all applications that involve children and persons, aged 18 and over the age, who are first&ndash;time applicants.  These certificates are critical to the passport process in the following ways:</P>
        <P LI="1">Each certificate confirms and verifies the applicant&rsquo;s personal details such as his/her date and place of birth which appear on that person&rsquo;s passport.</P>
        <P LI="1">They help to demonstrate the person&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship which is a prerequisite for passport issue; and</P>
        <P LI="1">Details of parents are stated on these certificates.  This is important to the Passport Service in ensuring that the full parental consent to the issue of a passport to a minor is provided.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the case of the person in question, an application for a passport was received by my Department on 11 February, 2011.  The application was supported by the applicant&rsquo;s certificate of naturalisation, which demonstrated his entitlement to Irish citizenship, and by an affidavit in regard to his birth details.  In line with passport policy, the Department wrote to him on 21 February, 2011 requesting him to provide his birth certificate.</P>
        <P>In a letter dated 11 March, 2011, the applicant claimed that due to the history of civil unrest in his country of birth, he was unable to provide his birth certificate.  This matter was investi<Col N="139"/>gated recently and subsequently verified by the Department.  As a result of this, a passport was issued to him on 9 May, 2011.</P>

        <P>The promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s economic and trading interests overseas is a key focus of my Department, in co-operation with other relevant government Departments and State Agencies.  Ireland&rsquo;s network of 76 Embassies and Consulates continues to work to restore Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation, which has been affected by the economic and financial crisis, and to support the export led growth which is crucial to our recovery.</P>
        <P>Discussions, based on the Programme for Government, are ongoing with the current Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation in relation to the transfer of trade promotion responsibilities to my Department.  A further enhanced role in trade promotion for my Department will provide a renewed emphasis for this work and will help facilitate a stronger relationship across all Departments and Agencies responsible for supporting the growth of Irish exports.</P>
        <P>As arrangements have not yet been finally agreed, I cannot comment specifically on the breakdown of the responsibilities between my Department and the current Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland currently enjoys very good relations with Canada on every level.  Our links in trade, tourism and education are particularly strong and growing.  Canada is one of Ireland&rsquo;s top 20 trading partners with total trade over &euro;1.5 billion.  There is good potential for this to grow with Irish exports to Canada increasing by almost 30% in 2010.  The investment links between the two countries are also significant as Ireland is currently the 5th largest recipient of Canadian outward investment.  Canada is attractive to Irish companies in the IT, pharmaceuticals, and agri-food sectors looking for a North American base and receives almost 25% of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign direct investment abroad.  Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry also benefits from our good relations with Canada with almost 95,000 Canadians visiting Ireland in 2009, the last year for which figures are available. <Col N="140"/> The promotion of economic and trading opportunities in all our priority markets is, of course, a key focus of my Department, and the Embassy network, in close co-operation with relevant Departments and State Agencies.  In relation to Canada, the Embassy of Ireland in Ottawa is actively working to restore Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation, which has been affected by the economic and financial crisis, and to support Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth.  The Embassy works closely with the State Agencies on the ground to advance Ireland&rsquo;s economic and trade interests in Canada.  The Ambassador chairs the local trade, tourism and investment team, established under the <i>Trade and Investing in a Smart Economy</i> Strategy.  This team has developed a detailed market plan and is already active in pursuit of specific targets.</P>
        <P>Recent activity in this regard includes Embassy support for a <i>Doing business in Ireland and the UK</i> seminar in Montreal last month and Embassy representation at 34 events throughout Canada over the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day period.  At the majority of these events, the opportunities for trading with, and for visiting Ireland, were highlighted in a positive manner.  The Embassy also collaborated on the inaugural business summit organised in Toronto by the Ireland Canada Business Association, which highlighted many positives of the Irish economy, the potential for Canadian investment in Ireland and for Irish companies to do business in Canada.</P>
        <P>The Embassy in Ottawa supports Enterprise Ireland, which is leading the drive to promote Irish education in Canada under the recently launched &ldquo;Education in Ireland&rdquo; brand.  Education Ireland will be exhibiting at NAFSA, the biggest annual gathering of international educators and Study Abroad advisors in North America, which will take place in Vancouver Canada at the end of this month.  They will be joined by Irish universities, Institutes of technology and other colleges at this event.</P>

Due to the present high level of demand, the turnaround time for non-Passport Express postal applications is currently approximately six weeks.  On the basis that all necessary documents have been submitted it is expected that the passport should issue by 24 May.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 59 together.</P>
        <P>The process of transferring functions from one Department to another is carried out by means of Government Orders under powers contained in section 6(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939, while in some cases primary legislation may be needed.  Each Order is carefully drafted so that all relevant legislation is listed in the Schedule to the Order.  The Departments which held the functions which are being transferred to other Departments have been fully engaged in this task since the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcements on 9 March.  Orders to implement the majority of the changes have already been made.</P>
        <P>On 29 March the Government made an Order transferring responsibility for the functions of the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs in relation to Equality, Integration, Disability and Human Rights to the Minister of Justice and Law Reform with effect from 1 April 2011.  A second Order was made to change the title of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to the Minister for Justice and Equality &mdash; and a similar name change for the Minister&rsquo;s Department, with effect from 2 April 2011.</P>
        <P>At the same Government meeting an Order transferring responsibility for the functions of the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport in relation to Tourism and Sport to the Minister for Transport with effect from 1 April 2011 was made.  A further Order was made to change the title of the Minister for Transport to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport &mdash; and a similar name change for the Minister&rsquo;s Department, with effect from 2 April 2011.</P>
        <P>On 5 April the Government made Orders to transfer the functions of the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs in relation to Marine Tourism to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the functions in relation to the National Drug Strategy to the Minister for Health and Children, the functions in relation to Social Inclusion to the Minister for Social Protection, and the functions in relation to Gaeilge, Gaeltacht and the Islands to the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport.   Each of these transfers came into effect on 1 May 2011.</P>
        <P>On 19 April the Government made Orders transferring the &ldquo;Heritage&rdquo; functions from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport with effect from 1 May 2011.  The Department became the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on 2 May 2011.  The Taoiseach also signed Orders on 19 April transferring further functions from the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.  These functions included the &ldquo;Community&rdquo; functions, Waterways Ireland and the &ldquo;Charities&rdquo; functions.</P><Col N="142"/>
        <P>On 10 May the Government made orders transferring functions of the Minister for Education and Skills regarding the National Educational Welfare Board to the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs. Residual functions of the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs were transferred to the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport. The resulting shell of the Department of  Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, which has been left containing only the Family Affairs and Family Support Agency, has permitted an order to be signed with effect from 2 June 2011 renaming the Department as the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</P>
        <P>On May 10 the Government also signed an order transferring<b> </b>the Office of the Minister for Children functions, with effect from 3 June 2011, from the Minister for Health and Children to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. This in turn allowed an order to be signed renaming, with effect from 4 June 2011, the Minister for Health and Children and the Department of Health and Children as the Minister for Health and the Department of Health respectively.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach also signed an order on 10 May transferring, with effect from 1 June 2011, the residual functions of the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport in relation to Tourism and Sport to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. This has allowed an order to be signed renaming, with effect from 2 June 2011, the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport and the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport as the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht respectively.</P>
        <P>The implementation of some of the changes to the structure of Government Departments will require primary legislation.  In particular, initial legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General suggests that the transfer of the Irish Coast Guard from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food &mdash; which will subsequently be renamed the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine &mdash; cannot proceed in full without primary legislation.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is awaiting written legal advice to this effect.</P>
        <P>A review of the legislation covering the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs functions is ongoing and primary legislation may be required in relation to some of them.  The Department of Health and Children has already received advice from the Attorney General that primary legislation is required in relation to the Child Care Act 1991.</P>
        <P>The Department of Justice and Equality has indicated that they will seek the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice regarding the possible requirement for primary legislation in respect of the transfer of certain functions of the Irish Youth Justice Service.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be established by primary legislation. I expect that I will be in a position to present the attendant Bill to the Government at its meeting of 17 May next.</P>
        <P>There are a number of other Transfer of Functions/Alteration of Name of Department and Title of Minister Orders currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.   These will be brought to Government as soon as possible at its meetings in May.  At this stage, I cannot give a precise date for the completion of all of the changes to the structures of Government Departments as this depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of the legislation governing the particular functions.  I can assure the Deputy that everyone involved in the process, both in my own Department, in the Office of the Attorney General and in the other Departments concerned, is making every effort to complete all of the changes at the earliest possible date.</P>

        <Quest> if, in view of the growing problem of fuel smuggling, the growth in the illicit selling of such fuel and the estimated loss of substantial revenue to the Exchequer, he will review the legislation pertaining to the laundering and sale of such fuel; if he intends to introduce tougher penalties and sanctions under the legislation targeted at those who have been found to be involved in such activities by the courts; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[10896/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of mineral oil tax and for tackling the illicit trade in fuel products, that they are conscious of the threat posed by laundered fuel, and that they have undertaken ongoing extensive enforcement action, which has led to the detection of oil laundries and the prosecution of individuals and companies involved. The Deputy will appreciate that, due to its nature, it is impossible to provide a reliably accurate estimate of the extent of any illegal activity. In 2010, four oil laundries and over 288,000 litres of laundered oil were seized.  Also in 2010, nine retailers were found dealing in laundered oil, and eight haulage companies were detected using laundered oil.  There were four convictions for laundered oil offences.  Already, in the period January to 5 May this year, four laundries and 102,000 litres of laundered fuel have been seized.  Two retailers and three haulage companies have been detected in respect of laundered oil offences and these cases are being considered for the institution of criminal proceedings. </P>
        <P>The laundering of marked fuel, and dealing in and possession of the subsequent product are indictable offences under the following legal provisions:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Removal of a marker from marked fuel (&ldquo;oil laundering&rdquo;), dealing in laundered fuel, and keeping laundering equipment (section 102(3) Finance Act 1999).</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Dealing in any illicit fuel (section 102 (1A) Finance Act 1999 as<i> amended</i>  ).</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Non compliance with the conditions for dealing in, and with, marked fuel (section 102(1B) Finance Act 1999 <i>as amended</i>  ).</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The last two provisions were introduced, in 2007 and 2011 respectively, in response to particular aspects of the illicit fuel problem.  The penalty on summary conviction for these offences is &euro;5,000 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months. The penalty on conviction on indictment is a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970 or a prison term of up to fine years, or both the fine and the imprisonment.  It is worth noting that the latter penalty amount was introduced in the Finance Act 2010 and is a considerable increase on the previous penalty of &euro;12,695.</P>
        <P>Of course, as the Deputy is aware, the precise penalty imposed on conviction in each individual case is solely a matter for the Courts.  These offence and penalty provisions will remain under review.  I do not propose, however, to make a further increase to the level of penalties until the effectiveness of the most recent increases can be assessed.</P>

	<P>Following my Statement on the restructuring of the domestic banking system on 31 March last, each of the covered institutions is required to prepare comprehensive plans detailing how the restructuring, reorganisation and deleveraging process will be implemented.  Under the revised terms of the Financial Measure Programme agreed with the IMF and EU, these plans will also form part of the individual Restructuring Plans to be submitted to the European Commission for approval under State aid rules by 31 July 2011.  This planning process will also encompass the significant human resource issues arising from the bank restructuring process.  Consistent with standard practice and convention in the case of any corporate restructuring, each of the institutions is itself primarily responsible for the management of staff relations, including any industrial relations aspects that arise.  This provides the appropriate framework to facilitate dialogue between management and staff interests on issues of common interest fully consistent with the principles and objectives of the Government&rsquo;s banking policy. </P>
        <P>All of the relevant institutions will of course continue to be subject to their obligations under employment law including where specific consultation requirements arise in particular circumstances.</P>

Staff of both the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will continue to work in their existing locations in Government Buildings in the Merrion Street/Merrion Row campus in addition to Lansdowne Road and Tullamore.</P>
        <P>In regard to policy areas, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be comprised of staff currently allocated to the Sectoral Policy and Public Service Management Development Divisions of my Department together with the staff of the Modernisation Unit of the Department of the Taoiseach who have redeployed to my Department. After the changes, my Department will consist of policy areas within the Financial Services and Budget, Taxation &amp; Economic Divisions.  Areas such as Corporate Services Division (Human Resources and Facilities Management), Finance Unit, Salaries Section and the Press Office will continue to provide the same services to staff in both Departments on a shared-service basis.  Similarly, services will be provided to both Departments by an IT Unit based in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The precise number of staff to be allocated to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently being finalised and assignments will be complete by the date of establishment.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has appointed one special advisor to date.</P>

He translated the first line of the chorus, &ldquo;Soldiers are we, whose lives are pledged to Ireland&rdquo; as &ldquo;Sinne fianna f&aacute;il, at&aacute; f&aacute; gheall ag &Eacute;ireinn&rdquo;&rsquo;.   With regard to the history, development and translation of the Anthem, I would direct the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to an article which appeared in &ldquo;History Ireland&rdquo; in Spring 1996 entitled &ldquo;The Story of the National Anthem&rdquo;. The article was written by Ruth Sherry Professor of English in the University of Trondheim Norway.  The full article is readily available on the internet using the following link:</P>

However, I understand from the Central Bank that the contracts with the consultants include performance criteria.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I understand from previous statements that the principal advisers to the Government on the night of 29 September 2008 were the official agencies.  The company referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question was, therefore, assigned the task of consolidating the range of options being developed by all the State agencies in a paper for consideration by the Government.  The Deputy may wish to note that the paper actually prepared by the company is now in the public domain &mdash; subject to certain redactions of commercially sensitive information having been published as part of the review of the guarantee decision by the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
        <P>In overall terms the paper summarises the advantages and disadvantages of the different strategic options available to Government stating that there was no right answer.  Indeed as pointed out in Governor Honohan&rsquo;s report on the banking crisis the paper set out arguments <Col N="146"/>against the introduction of a blanket guarantee.  In view of the foregoing, I do not believe that any useful purpose would be served by pursuing a legal claim in this case.</P>

        <Quest> the number of cases referred to the banking credit review group in each month since its inception, wherein appeal was made against a decision by banks to refuse credit, working capital and overdraft facilities; the total number of cases dealt with to date; if a satisfactory solution was found in each or all cases; the extent to which the customers&rsquo; needs were met; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no Banking Credit Review Group. I assume the Deputy is referring to the Credit Review Office. The Office was launched on 1 April 2010 and its function is to accept applications from SMEs, sole traders and small and medium-sized farm enterprises that have had their application for credit refused or reduced or have had credit facilities withdrawn by banks participating in the NAMA scheme, and feel that the bank&rsquo;s decision is unjustified. The Credit Review Office will, on application from the borrower, carry out an independent and impartial review of the bank&rsquo;s decision. The Credit Review Office review process operates after the borrower has unsuccessfully appealed through the bank&rsquo;s own internal appeals process. All participating banks are required to review their loan appeals policy and ensure that borrowers are made aware of their right to an internal appeal of an unfavourable lending decision.   Table 1 illustrates the number of cases referred to the Credit Review Office in each month since its inception.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> if there is any mortgage relief or financial assistance available to couples who are in difficulty with repayments. </Quest>
        <QRef>[10913/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of the availability of tax relief in relation to interest paid in respect of mortgages, the Deputy will be aware that Mortgage Interest Relief was refocused in Budget 2009 to assist first-time buyers.  The rates were increased from 20% to 25% for first-time buyers in years 1 and 2 of their mortgage and to 22.5% for years 3, 4 and 5. There is also a commitment in the Programme for Government to help homeowners in distress and the Government will examine a number of proposals in relation to this.</P>
        <P>One of these relates to increasing mortgage interest relief to 30% for First Time Buyers who bought between 2004 and 2008 and to finance this in part by abolishing mortgage interest relief for new buyers from June 2011.  When this proposal has been thoroughly examined and analysed and the findings and recommendations are presented to me, I will decide on the appropriate action to be taken.  However, it is unlikely that any measures will be introduced before Budget 2012.  As regards the availability of financial assistance the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme provides financial assistance to eligible claimants where the mortgage relates to the claimant&rsquo;s home.  The scheme is managed by the Department of Social Protection.  It currently supports approximately 18,500 mortgage holders.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Finance Circular 26/2006 sets out details of the confined competition for promotion to Executive Officer in the Civil Service.  The terms of the Circular did not envisage appointments being made from the competition after 30 June 2008.  For operational reasons this panel was extended until 30 June 2009. </P>
        <P>In the context of the implementation of savings measures on public service numbers, in March 2009 the Government announced a Moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service.  With regard to the Moratorium, my Department decided that it would not be appropriate to seek any further extension to the panel set up under Circular 26/2006 and the panel closed on 30 June 2009.  This is in line with the policy applying to promotion panels for other civil service grades where panels for promotion to the grades of Higher Executive Officer, Assistant Principal Officer and Principal Officer have also closed in 2009.  I do not have any plans to re-open this or any other closed panels.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>On 9 June 2010 a provisional application for co-financing support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in respect of workers made redundant in the construction sector in Ireland between 1 July 2009 and 31 March 2010 was submitted by my Department to the European Commission.  This <Col N="150"/>provisional application was costed at 63m Euros, of which an EU contribution of 65% (41m Euros) was sought under the EGF with the remaining 35% (22m Euros) to be funded from national sources.  The European Commission subsequently requested the breakdown and finalisation of the provisional applications into three separate applications by individual NACE 2 code. Final applications with a combined total value of 55m Euros (of which 65% is sought under the EGF) were duly submitted to the Commission in February 2011.</P>
        <P>These applications encompass a total affected population of almost 9,100 redundant workers. The lower total cost of the finalised applications reflects the interim experience of F&Aacute;S and other bodies and agencies supplying training, education and enterprise supports of more limited participation by affected workers than originally envisaged and lower than projected unit costs of certain of the supports being taken up.  The three EGF applications are currently being examined by the European Commission with relevant supports being provided, as appropriate, through national funding in the interim.</P>

The list of schools that will benefit from this announcement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.education.ie. My Department will be in contact with those schools approved for funding under this initiative shortly with further details relating to progressing the projects in question.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teaching hours to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Education and Skills (DES) is required to ensure that the overall allocation of teaching posts does not exceed the targets set out in the Governments Employment Control Framework.</P>
        <P>The DES had planned for a certain amount of increased growth in teacher numbers across the school sector in 2011, in line with increased demographic growth.  In respect of resource teaching hours for children with special educational needs, allowance was made for growth in 2011 over and above normal demographic increase levels.</P>
        <P>In 2010, the total number of Whole time Equivalent (WTE) posts provided for resource hours teaching (including under the General Allocation Model) was approximately 9,600 WTE posts.  By comparison approximately 9,950 WTE posts are provided for 2011.</P>
        <P>My Department requested the NCSE to provide data on the numbers and rate of application for additional resource teaching hours to date this year so that this information can be considered in the context of the Departments Employment Control Framework obligations.  The NCSE has also been asked to pause sanctioning additional resource teaching support hours to allow for collection and consideration of this data by the DES, in conjunction with the NCSE.  It should be noted that this is a temporary suspension of the allocation process in order to allow for consideration and analysis of this issue prior to any decisions being made.</P><Col N="152"/>
        <P>The NCSE issued a Circular to schools advising them that the final date for schools to submit any outstanding, completed, applications for resource teaching supports is 13th May 2011.  On receipt of all outstanding applications the DES and NCSE will be in a position to consider resource allocation for the coming school year, in the context of the Departments Employment Control Framework obligations.  Schools will be notified of their allocations as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In the interim, children who are eligible for resource/ learning support teaching can receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through the local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports.  This includes applications for the establishment of special classes.  The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in  allocating such support.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for enrolment to these classes rests with the individual school authority.  In circumstances where a child meets the criteria for Specific Speech and Language Disorder, as outlined in my Department Circular 0038/2007, and who is not enrolled in a special class for SSLD the child may qualify for additional teaching support where he/she is enrolled in a mainstream school.  Applications for such support may be made to the NCSE through the local SENO.  Pupils with mild speech and language difficulties may qualify for supplementary teaching support from within the school&rsquo;s general allocation of learning support/teaching support.</P>
        <P>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on<i> www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>This value for money review is part of the normal review processes undertaken by all Departments on an annual basis on selected areas of expenditure and is being conducted in line with the standard procedure for value for money reviews.  These procedures require that the views of stakeholders be obtained and the public consultations were designed to achieve this aim.  This was done by issuing a direct invitation to relevant interest groups to provide a submission.  The interest groups included the school patron bodies, management bodies, teacher unions, national parents&rsquo; council, Irish language groups and other groups who operate in the area of social inclusion.  </P>
        <P>The letter issued on 8th February 2011 and a deadline for reply was given for 18th March 2011.  As these groups represent a wide spectrum of membership it could be reasonably expected they would communicate with their membership in regard to the review.  In addition to the direct letter of invitation issued to these groups, a general invitation for submissions was <Col N="155"/>posted on the Department&rsquo;s website also at the same time.  Indeed the large response of in excess of 1,000 submissions seems to support the view that there is high general awareness of the review and a lot of interest in it.</P>
        <P>The review will attempt to explore the general policy options for re-organisation of small schools including the sharing of resources and clustering arrangements towards small schools.  I think it is important to clarify that this study is part of an overall requirement across all Government Departments to have a rolling programme of such studies.</P>
        <P>This review was initiated last October by the previous Fianna Fail &mdash; Green Party Government and is not driven by any ideology.  The study is simply about ascertaining the facts to inform future policy.  It does not mean that any policy decision has been taken at this point or that any particular outcome is sought. Given that the Government has recently announced a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, all Government expenditure and programmes will come under similar scrutiny.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference acknowledge the important role primary schools play in their local communities.  In considering any policy change in relation to small schools, the Department of Education and Skills is conscious that there is a wider dimension to be considered in addition to the cost of maintaining small schools.</P>
        <P>Among the issues that will need to be taken into account are questions such as availability of diversity of provision, ethos of schools, parental choice, language of instruction, travel distances, transport costs and the impact of schools on dispersed rural communities.  The review will examine the locations of small schools relative to each other and to other schools of a similar type.  It will also examine the costs of running small schools and the educational outcomes associated with small schools.</P>
        <P>Educational quality for the students must be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size.  We must also consider the needs of local communities and wider social and cultural factors.  Decisions on school provision and reorganisation must be widely perceived to be cost-effective, equitable and reasonable.  These decisions need to be based on a rigorous evaluation of requirements and needs, not just at a local level but also at both regional and national levels.</P>

	<P>The work placement programme provides up to 9 months work experience to unemployed individuals, including graduates.  The programme is open to all sectors of the economy, including the private and public sectors, as well as the community and voluntary sectors.  The aim of the programme is to assist unemployed people, including graduates, to establish or maintain links to the labour market and to gain valuable work experience in a real work environment that will enhance their employment prospects.</P>
        <P>There are a number of steps taken by F&Aacute;S in managing the work placement programme to prevent organisations from exploiting the scheme.  For instance, all potential providers must confirm with F&Aacute;S the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />That the placement will not be provided to fill an existing vacancy.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />That the placement will not be provided to displace an existing employee.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Under the guidelines a cooling off period of 3 months must elapse before another placement in the same area of activity is approved.  If the placement is in another area of activity from the previous placement no cooling off period will apply.  F&Aacute;S will review any subsequent applications for placement in an organisation in light of experience of a previous placement.  This review will take into consideration the experience of the participant and the results of monitoring visits.  F&Aacute;S will reconfirm with the employer that the placement sought is not a substitution for a job vacancy.</P>

It will also serve as a centre for conducting interviews and for registration of Personal Public Service numbers.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works has identified a suitable location for the new office and is currently negotiating a lease on behalf of the Department.  Following conclusion of these negotiations the office will be opened to the public.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together. </P>
        <P>Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), however, not all tenancies are required to be registered with the PRTB as the relevant legislation, the Residential Tenancies Act, provides for certain exceptions.</P>
        <P>Where registration is required, the landlord has up to one month after the commencement of the tenancy to register it with the PRTB at the standard fee and longer to register at a higher fee.  It is not, therefore, practical for the Department to insist that a tenancy be registered before rent supplement can be paid to the tenant as the establishment of the tenancy will be dependent on rent supplement being awarded.  As such the information requested by the Deputy is not available.</P>
        <P>The Department works closely with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to help ensure that rent supplement tenancies comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards.</P>
        <P>The Department advises the PRTB of all new rent supplemented tenancies to assist them in implementing tenancy regulations and co-operates in any initiatives taken by the PRTB to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act.  It is accepted that there is a need to ensure that all landlords, including those renting out property to people in <Col N="159"/>receipt of rent supplement, comply with the terms of the Residential Tenancies Act.  The PRTB has been given powers to deal with unregistered landlords and the information provided by the Department to the Board should help them to exercise these powers, while not placing rent supplement recipients in an unworkable and vulnerable position.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest> the reason a person (details supplied) that had previously been habitually resident here and moved to live and work in another country for ten years, resumed their permanent residence here, is now experiencing extreme difficulty in demonstrating that they satisfy the requirements of the habitual residence condition. </Quest>
        <QRef>[10794/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>An application for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, by the person concerned was refused by a deciding officer of the Department on the grounds that she did not satisfy the habitual residence conditions.  Similarly, her application for supplementary welfare allowance was also refused by a Community Welfare Officer of the HSE. </P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that appeals by the person concerned against both decisions have been registered in that office on 9 February 2011 and 24 March 2011 respectively and have been referred to an Appeals Officer who, in due course, will decide whether the case can be decided on a summary basis or whether to list it for oral hearing.</P>
        <P>The annual intake of appeals has increased from 14,070 in 2007 to 32,432 in 2010, an increase of 18,362 (130.5%) and currently it appears that another 30,000 will be received during 2011.  This has impacted on the processing time for appeals which, in 2010, was 27.4 weeks for cases dealt with by way of summary decisions and 45.6 weeks for those who were given an oral hearing.  In order to be fair to all appellants, appeals are dealt with in strict chronological order.</P>
        <P>In an effort to reduce these processing times, the Department has made 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.  These assignments will augment the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers serving in the office to 29.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

        <Quest> the steps she is taking to deal with potential difficulties arising from persons whose compulsory retirement age in their place of employment will apply in advance of the minimum age of qualification under the contributory State pension once the IMF-EU requirements in relation to the raising of pension age are phased in. </Quest>
        <QRef>[10824/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  In particular, the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  There are currently six workers for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050. </P>
        <P>Increasing State pension age is one of the ways in which we can sustain the pensions system and also maintain the value of the State pension at 35% of average earnings.  Therefore, as announced as part of the National Pensions Framework, State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of the State pension age at 66 and will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  As agreed under the EU/IMF Memorandum of Understanding, these changes will be provided for in legislation by mid 2011.</P>
        <P>Given the changes to State pension age outlined in the Framework, both employees and employers must be encouraged to change their attitudes to working longer.  In the workplace, employers must seek to retain older employees and create working conditions which will make working longer both attractive and feasible for the older worker.  Where this is not possible and people leave paid employment before State pension age, they will be entitled to apply for another social welfare payment until they become eligible for a State pension, as is the current situation.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.  While the primary responsibility for job creation rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, this Department already has a role in supporting people from welfare to work.  The National Employment Action Plan process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the Live Register.  It provides a <Col N="162"/>stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by F&Aacute;S.</P>

	<P>The Departments records, which are only readily available from 1998 onwards, show that a small number of payments totalling &euro;45,371 were made to the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) since 1998 in respect of corporate membership subscriptions, the Student Summer Job Scheme, reimbursement of costs of teas and coffees for meetings and the purchase of a publication.</P>
        <P>The Department has no record of any payments of grants or other supports to the Institute.</P>
        <P>The three statutory bodies operating under the aegis of the Department are the Pensions Board, the Citizens Information Board and the Social Welfare Tribunal.</P>
        <P>None of the above statutory bodies have made payments to the Institute of International and European Affairs during the past two decades up to 2011.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman (OPO) comes under the remit of the Department and the Department makes payments on its behalf.  There are no records of payments to the IIEA on behalf of the OPO.</P>

This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.  In the context of dealing with the considerable number of appeals now on hand, the Department has made a further 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person&rsquo;s oral hearing will be heard, but he will be informed when arrangements have been made.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the primary motivation in aligning the management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice is the conservation of the declining salmon stocks.  It is vital to afford every protection to the at-risk salmon stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch.  Ireland must fulfil its obligations under the Habitats Directive, namely to maintain or restore fish stocks, protected by the Directive, to favourable conservation status.</P>
        <P>The river Shannon, including the salmon fishery at Meelick, has been closed to salmon angling since 2007 under the current wild salmon management regime due to poor stock levels.  The estimated number of fish required upstream of Parteen Weir is in excess of 40,000 salmon and according to estimates there are less than 1,000 wild salmon spawning in the catchment. In order to address this deficit, in 2008 the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, now Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), initiated the Shannon Salmon Restoration Project.  This project, which draws on existing resources, sets about taking a fresh look at the issues facing the survival of wild salmon in the Shannon and its tributaries upstream of Parteen weir.  Led by IFI the steering group draws together the expertise of scientists of the Marine Institute and University College Cork, together with management of ESB Fisheries and IFI.  The broad objectives of the project, which were developed following a recent consultative process with anglers and local interest groups, are to address fish passage and habitat degradation on a long-term sustainable basis.  I welcome the efforts of the group towards the restoration of the salmon stocks sufficient to enable the reopening of the fishery in the future.</P>

        <P>The allocation of specific numbers in the 116 number range of numbers, which are reserved for services of social value, is managed in Ireland by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  In November 2007, ComReg alerted potential service providers, through an advertisement campaign, to the existence of the range of numbers beginning with 116, including the 116000 hotline for missing children.  The November 2007 advertisement invited suitable applicants to apply for the setting up of services of social value under the specified numbers.  I am advised by ComReg that no organisation has yet applied for the missing children hotline number 116000.</P>
        <P>While my Department has responsibility for policy and legislation governing electronic communications, the provision of services using electronic communications infrastructure, <Col N="165"/>including services of social value like the 116000 hotline for missing children, is not a matter in which I have a function.</P>

Despite worsening economic conditions generally, repossession remains extremely rare for local authority borrowers with only 103 repossessions across all local authorities carried out in the five year period 2005 -end June 2010.

	<P>My Department does not collect data on either the number or value of income related loans that remain outstanding.  Mortgage Protection Insurance (MPI) was introduced in July 1986 as a means of protecting housing loan borrowers in the event of death or disability.  It was mandatory for new borrowers but excluded existing borrowers at that date.  The majority of income related loans were extended pre-1986 and would not have had mortgage protection.  </P>
        <P>However, as part of the renewal of the MPI scheme in 2003, life cover was extended to pre-1986 loan holders on a voluntary basis.  If home owners who took out their loans prior to 1986 opted out of the scheme they may not have adequate life cover.  Currently death cover is extended to age 75 and disability cover to age 65 for individual and joint borrowers.  In the circumstances, I consider the cover provided by the scheme to be adequate.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants.  The grant schemes, introduced in November 2007, are funded by 80% recoupment available from my <Col N="170"/>Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  The detailed administration of the schemes, including the assessment and approval of applications, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority. </P>
        <P>At my Department&rsquo;s request, the Centre for Housing Research carried out an evaluation of the grant schemes in consultation with stakeholders, including the local authorities, representative organisations for older people and persons with a disability, and with a cross-section of grant applicants.  The need for revised guidelines with regard to the payment of grants by local authorities to approved applicants will be considered in the light of the evaluation report.</P>
        <P>To provide for continuity in the processing of applications and the payment of grants under the various grant measures, local authorities were advised by my Department that they could commit up to 50% of their current year allocation in respect of grant payments falling due in the following year.</P>

	<P>Under section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as amended), a licensee shall not sell or deliver, or permit any person to sell or deliver, intoxicating liquor to any person for consumption by a person under 18 years on the licensed premises.  While that section does not specify the manner in which the licensee must establish that a person is over the age of 18 years, it provides that in any proceedings for a contravention of its provisions, it shall be a defence for the licensee to prove that the person in respect of whom the charge is brought produced a Garda age card relating to himself or herself.</P>
        <P>While a licensee may choose to accept a passport or other form of identity card as proof that a person is over the age of 18 years, particularly in the case of young tourists or visitors, only production of the Garda age card provides a defence for the licensee in the event of any proceedings for a contravention of section 31 of the 1988 Act.</P>

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in December, 2007.  The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.  In that context, as I outlined in response to Parliamentary Question Number 69 of 7 April last, I can inform the Deputy that I have initiated steps within my Department to provide for speedier processing of applications to bring about a substantial reduction in the processing timescale.  The new arrangements will be publicly announced once my Department is in a position to implement them.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</P>

	<P>The European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, which became law on 1 January 2004, gives effect to the European Union Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European Arrest Warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States.  It puts in place simplified procedures for the surrender of persons between the Member States of the EU.  Under the provisions of the Act, a court may, upon application made by or on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, issue a European Arrest Warrant in respect of a person where it is satisfied, inter alia, that a domestic warrant has been issued for the arrest of that person but has not been executed and the person may not be in the State. As the Deputy will appreciate, both the courts and the DPP are independent in the exercise of their functions and, as Minister for Justice and Equality, I have no function in the making of such an application.</P>
        <P>In relation to a person outside the EU, a request for extradition can only arise where the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided that an individual should be prosecuted in the first instance.  The decision to seek the extradition of a person charged with a criminal offence in this State rests with the Director.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently 410 Garda applicants that have successfully completed stages 1 and 2 of the application process.  Of these there are a total of 164 applicants who have completed all stages of the application process and are approved for entry to the Garda College.  The remaining candidates are being processed through background screening, medical examination and physical competency tests.</P>
        <P>As the moratorium on Public Service Recruitment continues to apply to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, no date has been fixed for future intakes into the Garda College or for the commencement of a recruitment competition.  A decision on when recruitment will re-commence will take into account the rate of retirement in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Government targets for reductions in public service numbers.</P>

        <Quest> the current waiting times for the processing of an application for Garda vetting; if he will consider allowing the statutory declaration to be used while waiting for the Garda clearance; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do have concerns at the length of time currently being taken to process vetting applications.  I recognise that it is important to process these applications within a reasonable time frame both for the benefit of the applicants and the organisations involved.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that at present there are a total of five garda&iacute;, 76 full-time Garda civilian personnel and ten temporary civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU).  This represents a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development in Garda vetting began in 2005.</P>
        <P>A number of immediate measures are being taken to improve the situation.  The sanction of the Department of Finance has been obtained to retain the services of ten temporary employees in the GCVU.  A further sanction has been obtained to engage an additional ten temporary employees for the Unit and these are now being recruited.  This should have an impact on processing times.  In addition, further steps are under consideration with a view to alleviating the pressure on the staff of the GCVU and to reduce the time taken for the processing of applications.<b> </b> I am informed by the Garda Authorities that, at present, the average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately 10 weeks.</P>
        <P>The average processing time for vetting applications fluctuates in line with periods of increased demand.  In processing an individual vetting application, additional time may be required in cases where clarification is needed as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process.  However, the Garda&iacute; make every effort to reduce the time to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out what are very necessary checks.</P><Col N="175"/>
        <P>The vetting service has been expanded greatly in recent years as part of an ongoing, phased programme to roll-out vetting to an increasing number of organisations in the child and vulnerable adult care sectors.  This target group is the clear policy priority.  Under the current arrangements applications are made to the GCVU by organisations which are registered with the Garda&iacute; for vetting purposes.  In response to these applications, which can only be made with the consent of the vetting subject, the Garda&iacute; will release the factual information available to them on convictions and prosecutions, whether successful or unsuccessful, completed or pending.  This information is returned to the registered organisation.</P>
        <P>Given the importance of the vetting process in protecting and promoting the safety of vulnerable persons, and in preventing crime, it is not considered that a statutory declaration would provide a sufficiently robust alternative mechanism, even on a temporary basis, to support the decision making process of organisations employing or engaging people to work with children or vulnerable adults.</P>

In relation to properties that are surplus to military requirements the Department will dispose of them taking into account market conditions.  As is the norm, where a property is leased the leasee will be given first option to purchase the property.  The lands owned by the Department in County Kildare consist of the Curragh Plains, properties on the periphery of the Curragh, Magee Barracks, Kildare Town and a property in Clane.  Agreement has been reached in relation to the property in Clane and it is currently <Col N="178"/>being conveyed.  There are six properties located in Orchard Park, Curragh and an agreement is in place to sell one of these.  The Department is prepared to sell the remainder subject to reasonable offers being made by the occupiers.  Consideration is currently been given to dispose of the properties on the periphery of the Curragh.  The Department is considering the future of the old barracks in Kildare Town following the withdrawal of Kildare County Council&rsquo;s interest in acquiring it.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of tax incentives are in place to encourage the transfer of land to young trained farmers. These include:</P>
        <P LI="1">100% stamp duty relief on transfers of agricultural land and buildings to young trained farmers;</P>
        <P LI="1">100% stamp duty relief on land purchased by young trained farmers;</P>
        <P LI="1">Retirement relief on Capital Gains Tax for disposals to family members;</P>
        <P LI="1">Retirement relief on Capital Gains Tax for farm disposals up to the value of &euro;750,000 and marginal relief on disposals above this threshold;</P>
        <P LI="1">Retirement relief on Capital Gains Tax for lands which had been transferred in the Early Retirement Scheme; and</P>
        <P LI="1">100% stock relief for young trained farmers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">New entrants to farming have been catered for each year since 2005 under the Single Payment Scheme National Reserve. For effective operation of this reserve scheme, certain farming-related educational qualifications and off-farm income limits apply.</P>
        <P>In regard to assisting young farmers to remain in the sector, in the case of my Department&rsquo;s on-farm investment schemes, grant aid is available to young farmers for the purposes of supporting investments in relation to poultry and sow welfare, dairy equipment, sheep fencing/handling equipment, and rainwater harvesting equipment.  In the case of three of these schemes (Dairy Equipment Scheme, Sheep Fencing/Handling Scheme, and Rainwater Harvesting Scheme), the criteria for selecting applications for approval include the provision of additional marks for young farmers or young trained farmers.</P>
        <P>In the dairy sector, since the inception of the Milk Quota Trading Scheme in 2007, almost 73 million litres of milk quota has made its way into the hands of young farmers, and they will have an opportunity to further augment that figure under future Trading Schemes, the next of which will be announced in early September.</P>
        <P>The introduction of milk quota increases under the November 2008 Health Check agreement provided an opportunity to further encourage new entrants to dairying. The New Entrants Scheme resulted in the allocation of a total of 14.4 million litres of quota to 72 new entrants in 2009, and a further 14 million litres was allocated to 73 new or recent entrants in 2010. The assessment of applications for the allocation of a further 14 million litres for 2011 is currently under way and I expect to be in a position to announce the results of this scheme by the end of the month.  The scope for further schemes will be reviewed with the farming organisations in due course.</P>
        <P>The Presidency Conclusion on the &ldquo;CAP towards 2020&rdquo; which was agreed by most member states and which I supported at the Council of EU Agriculture Ministers on March 17th outlined the need to better address the specific needs of young farmers in the reformed CAP.</P>

	<P>An application under the Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on the 20th of April 2010. This application was selected for a Ground Eligibility and Cross Compliance inspection. </P>
        <P>During the course of the Ground Eligibility inspection, discrepancies were found which resulted in the claimed area of 203.99ha being reduced to a payable area of 131.57ha. The principle reason for this reduction was lands in Co. Wicklow (Parcel No. Z10714038) declared as 72.84 ha of permanent pasture on the 2010 application.  At inspection it was determined that this parcel was not being farmed as it was found to have been neither stock-proofed nor maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition and as such was deemed ineligible for payment as per the terms and conditions of the scheme.  As the total entitlements held are 178.88 and the difference between the area claimed and the area found is greater than 50% no payment could issue for 2010.</P>
        <P>The person named was informed of this decision and he was also advised of his right to seek a review of this decision and to have the outcome of any such review appealed to the Independent Agriculture Appeals Office.</P>
        <P>An application for review has been received and is currently under consideration and the person named will be notified of the outcome as soon as it is available.</P>

	<P>Under the Control of Horses Act 1996, Local Authorities have the primary role for dealing with wandering or straying horses. The Act includes provisions for seizure and detention of stray horses and disposal of horses seized.  I am empowered by the Act to make grants available to each Local Authority towards expenses they incur in its implementation.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to quantify the exact amount of Department staff time involved in this area of work because these duties are amongst a range of duties performed in the veterinary and animal welfare areas of the Department. Ordinarily a portion of time of an Assistant Principal Officer and a small number of support staff is allocated to this function, while Veterinary Inspectors across all Department regional veterinary offices become involved where necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In so far as expenditure is concerned, my Department has provided funding as follows to Local Authorities to assist them in implementing Control of Horses Act:  2008 &mdash; funding of &euro;1.988m provided, 2009 &mdash; funding of &euro;2.156m provided and 2010 &mdash; funding of &euro;2.466m provided.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 169 together.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme.  However, the terms of the scheme will be reviewed in the context of the Governments proposals for Universal Health Insurance and free GP care at the point of delivery.</P>
        <P>Under the Drugs Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than &euro;120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
        <P>In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</P>

        <P>A priority of the National Drugs Strategy (interim) 2009-2016 is to develop an integrated national treatment and rehabilitation service for all substance users.  The Strategy targets a 25% increase in residential rehabilitation places by 2012 based on 2008 figures.  The HSE&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2011 identifies the need to develop treatment services in residential and community based settings.  Additional funding of almost &euro;2.5m has been provided to the four regions of the HSE for the development of additional frontline addiction services including additional psychology services, counselling and outreach services.  The HSE is also working to provide additional detox beds.</P>

Each year, over the past five years, 800 new clients have been provided with methadone, an increase of approximately 7.5% per annum with around 450 per annum successfully completing their treatment episode in any one year.</P>

Neither my Department or the HSE were involved in the preparation of the report.  I would agree, in general, that children&rsquo;s needs are most appropriately met and provided in the home.  We also need to ensure that there is more efficient use of resources.  Many children availing of services provided by the Jack and Jill Foundation also avail of other disability services.

        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the HSE will continue to fund the Jack and Jill Foundation in 2011.

	<P>The Health Service Executive is moving ahead with its plans to centralise the processing of all medical cards and GP visit card applications and renewals to its Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.  This project is well under way and almost 40% of medical card applications are now processed centrally by the PCRS.  The issues in relation to the redeployment of staff are being progressed in accordance with the Croke Park Agreement. </P>
        <P>Last year a new online Medical Card application service was launched (www.medicalcard.ie) which guarantees a 15 day turnaround for complete applications.  This new facility was developed to enable people, anywhere in the country, to apply online for a medical card, as is the case with many other public services.  More than 5,000 online applications are being received each month with more than 50% of these made outside of normal office hours. The new online medical card application is suitable for people who are likely to quality for a medical card on income grounds.  On line assessments are immediate and for applicants who supply all evidence/documentation and are eligible on income grounds, medical card delivery is guaranteed within 15 days of receipt of the completed application pack.  Applicants who are over the income limits (i.e. Discretionary Cases) are informed immediately and may apply to the HSE for assessment in the normal way, if they wish. Any person who has applied through the national office can now view the status of their medical card application or review online, using a unique reference number which is provided to each applicant immediately on application receipt.  These online facilities are under continuous development with additional online services to be made available throughout 2011.</P>

At the time, the criteria permitted blanket grants of permits to people with a variety of medical conditions.  The review found that there had been a vast increase in the number of permits issued over the years, and that this had given rise to concerns that those most in need, and for whose benefit the Scheme was originally devised,  i.e. those with serious mobility impairments, often had trouble finding available disabled parking spaces.</P>
        <P>The review recommended a revision of the eligibility criteria to focus the Scheme more particularly on those with significant mobility impairments.  On the basis of this review I am bringing in new criteria from 1 June 2011 which will ensure that the Scheme functions better to help those it is meant to help.  In relation to the specific type of case the Deputy mentions, all applications for Disabled Parking Permits will be dealt with by the DDAI and IWA on the same basis as other applications, and, if the individuals meet the criteria in terms of serious mobility impairment, they will of course be eligible for a permit.</P>

	<P>I understand that the decision to reduce to two the number of routes covered by PSO air services was taken by the previous Government in line with the Value for Money Review of Exchequer Expenditure on the Regional Airports Programme.  This Review took account of a number of factors including the performance of the services, the requirement to make best use of scarce Exchequer resources as well as improvements in alternative transport modes and changes in EU legislation covering PSO services.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 to 183, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard is continuing to provide full day and night watch and rescue co-ordination services utilising the three centres in Dublin (National Maritime Operations Centre), Malin and Valentia.</P>
        <P>As part of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to the modernisation of the Coast Guard communications and coordination system a new national maritime communications infrastructure is being rolled out which will, when fully implemented, allow for greater interoperability and <Col N="192"/>work sharing by the three centres. For example, work currently being undertaken on the project will facilitate the connection of the entire communications grid later this year, thus enabling greater efficiencies to be realised across the three co-ordination centres at that time.</P>
        <P>My Department undertook, as part of the Croke Park Agreement, to carry out a strategic review of the Irish Coast Guard, including the watch manning system which accounts for the majority of the Coast Guards staff. The Coast Guard review will also take account of efficiencies that may be possible due to the introduction of the new technology referred to earlier. </P>
        <P>Three new Watch Officers are expected to be in position by next month and to have completed their training by the autumn. Further recruitment from the existing panel will be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance following on from the strategic review. Recognising the challenges faced by long lead-in times for the recruitment and training of Watch Officers,  I intend to have the review completed as quickly as possible.</P>
