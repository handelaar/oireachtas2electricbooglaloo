	<P>I welcome the call by the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach on the banks to cut interest rates in line with the cut to the ECB rate.  It is fair to say, however, that without actions words do not do much for us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>There were 14 years of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The banks&rsquo; refusal to pass on the reduction to both domestic and business borrowers is absolutely scandalous, given the hardship that will be caused.</P>
        <P>It has been brought to my attention that banks are using a small-print clause in contracts in the case of businesses which borrowed at rates linked with the Eurobor rates.  They are now changing and increasing the rates to cost-of-fund reference rates and using the small-print clause results in a severe extra cost to businesses.</P>
        <P>Will emergency legislation be introduced in the House next week to give the Financial Regulator the power to force the banks to pass on the ECB interest rate reduction and honour the rates offered to business customers and accepted by them in good faith?  Will the Government replace forthwith all public interest directors who are now not acting in the public interest?  Will it seek an immediate emergency general meeting of the guaranteed banks to remove the remaining directors?  Will it inform the guaranteed banks that if they do not conform on this issue, the cost of the guarantee will be increased next year by the amount they are not passing on in reduced rates associated with the ECB interest rate reduction?  Will it inform them that the extra funding will be used to provide financial assistance for those in difficulty with mortgages or business loans owing to the reckless policies followed by them?  Will it inform them, particularly AIB, 94% of which I understand is owned by the State, that all senior staff must conform with public service norms in their salaries?</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is time the Government walked the walk rather than just talked the talk.  I would appreciate it if I could receive specific answers to the very direct questions I have asked rather than the usual Labour Party revisionist history lessons to which I seem to be treated each week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me deal with the issue.  I welcome Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s support for the strong stand the Government has taken on the decision made by some of the financial institutions not to pass on the interest rate reduction to their customers.  Yesterday the Government had already arranged a meeting with Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Banks to discuss with them the issue of lending to small and medium-sized businesses which has been of concern both to Members and the Government.  The meeting, between the Government&rsquo;s Economic Management Council and the banks, afforded us the opportunity to raise with the banks their intentions with regard to the interest rate reduction.  The representatives of the three banks who attended the meeting yesterday told us it was not their intention to pass on the reduction to their borrowers.  We made the Government&rsquo;s view very clear to them, namely, that the interest rate reduction made by the ECB should be passed on.  People with mortgages need the reduction.  The ECB did not reduce interest rates in order that the banks could pocket the money; it did so with a view to having the reduction passed on to borrowers and to release more money into the economy.  We made that position very clear to the banks.  We also made it clear to them that, in the event that they did not comply with our request, the Government would consider legislating appropriately.  </P>
        <P>Following our meeting with the banks, the Taoiseach made direct contact with the Financial Regulator and conveyed what the banks had stated.  He discussed with the regulator the additional powers he might require to deal with these circumstances.  We have asked the regulator to give his assessment.  When we receive that assessment, the Government will take whatever decisions are necessary to ensure borrowers will not be treated in the manner proposed by the banks yesterday.  We expect to receive the assessment of the regulator quickly.  In the meantime, the banks concerned should reconsider the position they outlined to us yesterday.  The position of the Government on the matter is very clear.  The interest rate reduction should be passed on to customers.  This is what we believe the ECB intended.  Members and the public would want the banks to pass on the reduction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that, irrespective of the advice the Government receives from the Financial Regulator, it is its intention to ensure the interest rate cut is passed on to customers and that it will be backdated to the date it came into force and that whatever steps need to be taken, along the lines I have outlined to him, be it legislation or removing directors, will be taken to ensure the interest rate reduction is passed on?  As he rightly said, this was done by the ECB to help customers, not the banks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My second question is on a matter the T&aacute;naiste did not address.  Is it his intention to instruct the State-owned banks that they cannot pay more than public service wage rates?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is the view of the Government that the interest rate reduction should be passed on to customers and we are going to take this one step at a time.  As the Deputy said, it is about taking action, not words, and the Government is acting on the matter.  We had a meeting yesterday with the banks concerned, at which we told them what our objective and <Col N="209"/>intention were &mdash;  we believe this was also the ECB&rsquo;s objective &mdash; that the interest rate reduction should be passed on to customers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Will or should?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Should, of course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Government going to force the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That is step number two.  If the banks do not reconsider their position, as expressed to us yesterday at the meeting of the Economic Management Council, on the basis of the assessment we receive from the Financial Regulator, we will take action, as appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>When?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>What power does the Financial Regulator have?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We made it clear to the banks yesterday that the Government was contemplating introducing legislation in this regard.  There is a period of time within which the banks can reflect on what we said to them yesterday and reconsider the position they have adopted.  I hope they will take the opportunity to do this.  If they do not, we will have the assessment of the Financial Regulator and will take action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>What timescale does the T&aacute;naiste have in mind?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same issue, last evening the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s colleague in government, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, described as &ldquo;pathetic&rdquo; the response of bank executives to the Government&rsquo;s request that the banks pass on the recent ECB interest rate reduction to all mortgage holders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said, Brian.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>He is right, of course, but the reality for most people watching is that the word &ldquo;pathetic&rdquo; more properly applies to the situation where the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform were all in a room with representatives of AIB and Bank of Ireland which, to all intents and purposes, are in public ownership, as well as of Ulster Bank, and, in response to their polite request that the banks pass on the recent interest rate reduction, they were told, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  There is an absolute responsibility on the Government to stand up to the banking institutions.  </P>
        <P>In his reply to the last questioner the T&aacute;naiste said the Government would consider introducing legislation and that the Government was awaiting the assessment of the Financial Regulator of what he might deem appropriate at this time.  There is a requirement for the T&aacute;naiste to be fully honest with the House and the people.  Has he not already received an indication from the Financial Regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank of what their assessment is and does he agree that what we are awaiting is an unfolding enactment?  The reality is that he knows exactly where they stand on this matter and, despite all the jumping up and down, irrespective of what the Financial Regulator might recommend, the Government will have to take the decision to stand up and confront the banks to protect the interests of ordinary mortgage holders into the future.  Has he already received an indication from the Financial Regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank on this matter?  Has he, with his colleagues in the Cabinet, already made a decision to proceed with legislation to compel the banks to act in this respect &mdash; it would not be a voluntary act.  They should not only be compelled to pass on the <Col N="210"/>most recent interest rate reduction but all future interest rate cuts.  Will the T&aacute;naiste come clean with the House on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has been very firm with the banks on this issue.  The Deputy was not present at the meeting yesterday which he has portrayed as a polite conversation.  The Government was very clear with the banks about its wish and determination that the interest rate reduction be passed on to customers.  We made it very clear to them that if that did not happen, the question of introducing legislation was one the Government would consider.  We have asked the Financial Regulator for his assessment of what is required.  I think the Deputy will agree that it would be prudent to await that assessment from the Financial Regulator and to base whatever decision we make on legislation on it, but let us be clear: the Government is very determined in this regard.  The interest rate reduction announced by the ECB must be passed on to customers.  This was set out in very clear terms by the Government yesterday.  No one leaving the room was in any doubt that there was no ambiguity about the Government&rsquo;s intention and determination that mortgage holders and those borrowing from the banks should benefit from the reduction in the interest rate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the T&aacute;naiste received an indication, orally or otherwise, of the view of the Financial Regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank on this matter?  Will their assessment be the final determinant as to whether the Government proceeds with legislation, or will it act as the duly elected and accountable representatives of the people in their interests, irrespective of the position adopted by the Financial Regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank who might for their own reasons have a view that introducing legislation is not the way they would wish to proceed?  The only way we can guarantee and protect the interests of the ordinary people is by the Government legislating to compel the banks to pass on not only the most recent interest rate reduction but also all future cuts, as a matter of course.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give an assurance to the House that the Ministers named who engaged with bank representatives yesterday will act in the interests of the people in the first instance and not be deflected from their declared intent by any side interests on the part of people in positions of responsibility, namely, in the Central Bank?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may be absolutely assured that the Government will act in the interests of the people, in particular in this case the interests of those who have borrowed from banks and to whom the banks are saying they will not pass on the reduction in the interest rate.  We have made our position very clear to the banks.  One can communicate with them; one does not necessarily have to pull on a balaclava to communicate with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the T&aacute;naiste that I communicated with them on a daily basis for 12 sad years of my life.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Government has made its position very clear to the banks which I hope will reconsider the position they outlined to us yesterday.  They know, as we do and everybody else knows, that when the ECB reduced the interest rate, the intention was that it would be passed on to customers and that the money would not be pocketed by the banks.  We are considering whether we should legislate to deal with the matter.  I think Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will agree that it would be prudent to take the advice of the Financial Regulator who is independent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste has already received it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has said that a few times, but we have not received it.  Immediately after the banks had told us yesterday that they did not intend to pass on the interest rate reduction, the Taoiseach made contact with the Financial Regulator by telephone&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>What did he say?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and asked him for his assessment of the situation and told him what happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What did the regulator have to say?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>When we get the assessment we will have the considered position of the Financial Regulator.  I assure Deputies that the Government is acting on this matter and will continue to act on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is subjected to humiliation by the banks and the response of the Taoiseach is to make a telephone call to another banker to see what he should do.</P>
        <P>I wish to call a different humiliation to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s attention, however.  Last Friday, a foreign state, Israel, jailed 14 Irish citizens who were snatched from international waters while bringing humanitarian aid to Gaza.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has not uttered a single word of protest in public in response to this outrage.</P>
        <P>This morning, by agreement with the Irish embassy in Tel Aviv, seven of those citizens were to be put on a British Airways flight.  They were brought to the airport and driven around before Israeli security forces prevented them from boarding their aircraft and brought them back to prison, where they are now being held incommunicado.  For the past six days, citizens of this State, including an MEP, councillors and others of equal merit, have been kept in an Israeli jail and subjected to continuous harassment, strip searches, disorientation techniques and humiliation.</P>
        <P>The staff of the Irish embassy have worked hard but, while they have done their job, the T&aacute;naiste, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of this State, has not acted as he should to condemn this action and demand the immediate release of these citizens.  I ask him to summon the Israeli ambassador as soon as he leaves this Chamber to give him one hour to reveal the details on the release and safe sending home of our citizens.  If he does not, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to expel him.  At least we can thereby make it clear to the world that we and people internationally will not stand for what Israel has done in continuing to imprison the people of Gaza and in acting in this illegal high-handed way, like pirates.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Immediately following the arrest of the 14 Irish people on the <i>MV Saoirse</i> I arranged to have officials from the Irish embassy meet them when their boat was brought <Col N="212"/>ashore at Ashdod.  They have been visited every day of their detention.  They had an opportunity to be deported on Saturday, provided they signed a waiver against appealing the deportation order, but they declined to do so.  I understand fully why they declined this opportunity and I respect their right to make this decision.  Every day the officials in the Irish embassy in Tel Aviv have worked with the 14 Irish people and we have made it clear, both directly to the Israeli embassy in Dublin and to the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that we wish to have them released as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Deputy Higgins asked me to meet the Israeli ambassador but I have already done so.  I met the ambassador yesterday and conveyed my dissatisfaction at the length of time it is taking to have the 14 people returned to this country.</P>

	<P>I have already conveyed to the Israeli ambassador my views on their arrest and the length of time it is taking to have them returned.  Yesterday he informed me that it was the intention to put seven of the 14 on a flight this morning and the remaining seven on a flight tomorrow morning.  I understand that when those who were to take this morning&rsquo;s flight turned up at the airport, the airline was unwilling to board all seven of them.  That is the information I have been given and I have asked the officials of our embassy to check it.  As we speak, the embassy is working to secure alternative flight arrangements for the seven and to ensure all 14 are back in this country as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste gives the impression these 14 citizens could have been out of Israel in a matter of hours if they had signed an innocuous document.  They were asked to sign a document stating they had illegally entered Israel.  They could not sign that statement because it would be a lie.</P>

        <P>Last week the Government published its medium-term fiscal statement and in an hour or so it will publish its capital spending review.  Already it has signalled the cancellation of a very important infrastructural development that would have provided fair and equitable access to the north west of the island with the deferral, at least, if not worse, of the M2-A5 dual carriageway project.  This development was part of the St. Andrews Agreement and expected to be a critical flagship project to be unfolded on a joint basis by the Administrations North and South in the coming years, with all the economic benefits that it would entail.  One expects other very serious announcements today, but there is no signalled intent on the part of the Government to facilitate a proper debate on the consequences of the capital expenditure work cancellations or deferrals.  Will it accommodate an opportunity for Members to address these matters in the House today or next Tuesday in the context of the medium-term fiscal statement and the capital spending review?  Having such an opportunity is hugely important.  Therefore, I urge the T&aacute;naiste to give a favourable response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter should be raised with the Whips also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Later this morning the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, will publish the capital programme.  It will be a significant programme, notwithstanding our financial difficulties, amounting to over &euro;16 billion in the next four or five years.  Owing to the country&rsquo;s financial circumstances, as the Minister will explain later, it will be necessary to put back some capital projects, particularly in the roads and transport programme, because the money simply is not available to proceed with them.  I regret that the A5 is one of the projects that cannot proceed at this time.  However, there is, as the Deputy said, <Col N="216"/>a political commitment in the St. Andrews Agreement to allow it to go ahead and our commitment to it remains solid, but we cannot do what we do not have the money to do at this time.</P>
        <P>I am agreeable to having a debate in the House on the capital programme.  Perhaps the Whips might arrange to have that debate next week.  Undoubtedly, Members will wish to discuss the projects that are and are not going ahead and to put their case to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Some arrangement can be made to schedule that debate to take place next week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach indicated this week &mdash; and following the meeting of the Economic Management Council yesterday it now seems likely &mdash; that legislation may be forthcoming to oblige bankers to pass on the interest rate reduction from the ECB.  Will the Government consider introducing a clause in any such legislation that would criminalise bankers for failing to pass on such reductions and that would result in jail terms for chief executive officers, chairman and board members?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that on promised legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>On promised legislation, yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I already have stated, the Government has asked the Financial Regulator for his assessment of the current position following the meeting yesterday between the Economic Management Council and the banking institutions.  I hope the Government will have the that assessment reasonably soon and obviously the content of any legislation would be based on the Government consideration of that assessment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to legislation pertaining to the nitrates directive.  There is a crisis in rural Ireland at present whereby people in the farming sector are totally prohibited from spreading slurry, which is full to capacity in their farmyards.  This is an emergency that I have drawn to the attention of the Ministers in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as well as to the office of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  I seek some flexibility in this regard.  In County Kerry in particular, we experience twice as much rainfall as elsewhere and farmers are on tenterhooks.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to speak to the Ministers on this matter.  I was informed by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McEntee, that some flexibility also should be shown by the environmental departments of county councils.  I ask that departmental officials would ease off a little and perhaps arrive at a mechanism of agreement to facilitate those farmers.  This issue is causing them terrible problems and I ask that some leeway be given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No legislation is promised in respect of the nitrates issue and I understand the Minister does not have plans to provide the extension to which the Deputy referred.  However, the issues the Deputy has raised can be raised directly with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to promised legislation to make a clear ending to upward-only rent reviews, which would be a big help to struggling businesses that are finding it extremely difficult to keep their doors open at present.  As I believe this was part of the programme for Government, what is its present status?  In addition, I refer to proposed legislation on the introduction of a proper deposit protection scheme to protect deposits from being unfairly withheld from tenants by landlords who treat their tenants unfairly when their term of <Col N="217"/>tenancy expires by unfairly withholding their deposits.  Some protection should be put in place and some legislation should be introduced to protect such tenants and their deposits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of upward-only rent reviews is at present a subject of discussions between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General.  The issue of the possibility of legislation on deposit retention is a matter that is under consideration by the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised or required in respect of a matter about which Deputy Tom Hayes and I, as well as others, yesterday met the Minister for Defence, namely, the closure of the Army barracks in Clonmel?  The decision to close the barracks, if it is made, will be made as a cost saving measure and I note we handed over 7,000 signatures.  I have a document in my possession stating it would cost &euro;5.5 million to relocate the troops concerned to Limerick, which could not be described in any way as a cost saving.  Moreover, members of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s own party and some in the Cabinet also have concerns about barracks throughout the country.  While this is being done in the name of cost saving, what costs are being saved if it would cost &euro;5.5 million to transfer the troops but only &euro;160,000 to keep them in Clonmel?</P>

	<P>The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has announced his intention to reorganise and rationalise the industrial relations institutions and he is working on that.

	<P Just="Left">It may be, but it is also a matter of whether the T&aacute;naiste is willing to give time.  What has happened on the back of the Government decision not to do this is that the Northern Executive is deciding, and the First Minister is indicating, that they will allocate the &pound;400 million sterling to other projects.  It is critical that the Government tries to undo the damage that has been done to this project in the past 20 hours and get it back on track.  What it is doing by its actions is knocking this project into never-never land.  We need a debate this afternoon specifically to address this issue.  We then need the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to meet the Northern Executive to see if something can be salvaged out of this.  If not, the north west will never see this road built.</P>

    <Title>Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Mac Lochlainn is not present, I call Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickODonovan"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, and welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  In moving the economy forward, an element that will be critical in enabling us to encourage investment and employment is that we have the necessary and adequate infrastructure to sustain employment.  Part of this will be the provision of a good water supply and part will be the provision of reliable, fast broadband service but a very important part will have to be a good, reliable, accessible, affordable energy sector.</P>
        <P>It is a part of the competitiveness issue that we are often reluctant to put this sector in the headlights and examine the implications it has for the economy as a whole.  We are often encouraged to speak about competitiveness in terms of just one headline, that being salaries, costs of employment and so on, but access to a good and reliable energy source is something we have to come to terms with.  We cannot reach a situation where, for example, industrial employers are faced with energy interruptions.  Where employers look to move into the regions, isolated areas or small towns and villages, we cannot have a situation where they do not have access to a reliable energy supply, whether from EirGrid or another future supplier.</P>
        <P>In talking about the country&rsquo;s energy sector, it is important to point out that at present 95% of our energy comes from imported fossil fuels.  While huge improvements are being made in the renewable energy sector in terms of wind, particularly in my part of the country where there is a huge number of wind turbines, we are behind the curve in regard to international best practice on deriving energy from renewable sources.  One need only look at the amount of energy recovered in Ireland from tidal sources, which is practically nil.  Although many people have become involved in solar energy recently as private individuals from the point of view of retrofitting and making houses more energy efficient, the State is not doing much.</P>
        <P>With regard to the amount of energy used in State buildings, I ask that the State assess how energy efficient its stock of infrastructure is, whether this is in Government offices, post offices or any other national infrastructure, in the same way the local authorities did this in regard to their office buildings and, to a lesser degree, their housing stock.  The energy efficiency of these <Col N="222"/>buildings and the amount of renewable energy used to heat and light them is, I assume, practically nil.  From the Government&rsquo;s point of view, there is an opportunity to lead by example in this regard.</P>
        <P>Deputies referred to interconnection and the importance of having the national grid connected to the UK and mainland Europe.  This goes back to the point on over-reliance on imported fossil fuels.  While we have an emerging wind energy sector, the problem is that there are times of the year and even times of the day when there are fluctuations in the amount of energy that can be recouped from wind.  It is important, if we are building a good amount of renewable energy sources into the overall national picture, that we have reliability so we can switch on and off the tap from Britain and further afield in mainland Europe.</P>
        <P>This brings me to the section of the Bill dealing with energy efficiency.  We must question the efficiency of our grid and the amount of energy lost throughout the country through dissipation from power lines.  If we were to liken the national grid to a highway, there is a dual carriageway through the centre of the country, a set of national roads off it and a series of local roads.  We need to look strategically at the national grid with a view to addressing the imbalance.  At present the national grid is almost like a mainline railway station in that people can go anywhere they want as long as it is Dublin.  It is the same with the national grid in that it goes anywhere people want as long as it is Dublin, because the main power plants, some of which are located close to my area at Moneypoint, Tarbert and Ardnacrusha, are all cabled into and out of Dublin.  In terms of balanced regional development, there is an opportunity to act on this issue.</P>
        <P>The Bill refers to energy efficiency and to the sustainable energy Ireland project.  I implore the Minister of State to talk to his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who has responsibility for local authority housing.  At present, long-term local authority tenants have no way of getting their houses insulated to make them more energy efficient.  However, if they move out and leave a house vacant, the local authority will make it energy efficient, which is a ridiculous situation as the local authorities should try to reward the person who has been there and paying rent down through the years.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister of State with responsibility for the NewERA agency the best in the next few years.  This legislation is hugely important and has the potential to make a major impact on the economy.</P>
      <Speaker pid="SeanKyne"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill has been designed to improve and tidy up an increasingly important area.  Efficiency and effectiveness lie at the heart of the Bill, which is why it has to be warmly welcomed.  Features such as the energy demand reduction target programme and the empowerment of gas safety officers are essential in promoting better and safer use of our finite energy resources.  Other welcome aspects include the new provisions against the theft of electricity and gas in the new, open and competitive market and the extension of the powers of the Commission for Energy Regulation to provide for better regulation, with new electrical investigation officers and clarification of the power of gas safety officers.</P>
        <P>A major component of the Bill is the putting in place of a new legal framework in primary legislation for the placing of energy efficiency obligations on energy suppliers and distributors.  This will result in the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources being empowered to set energy efficiency targets and, crucially, oblige energy companies to provide energy efficiency measures for their customers.  The power which will be conferred on the Minister to go to the High Court in cases in which energy companies are failing to comply with their new energy efficiency obligations is even more significant.  I welcome the opportunities <Col N="223"/>that will be afforded by section 12 which provides the flexibility to establish voluntary agreements to promote energy efficiency and confers on the Minister the power to approve or revoke such agreements.</P>
        <P>Aside from the moral obligations on a developed country such as Ireland to enact legislation to combat climate change through better and more strategic use of our energy resources, there is another reason I welcome the Bill.  It concerns the recognition and rewarding of schools and businesses which display great foresight and initiative by installing renewable energy generators such as wind turbines.  Since early summer, I have been attempting to examine why it is a school or business cannot be recompensed for the unused electricity generated by its wind turbine which is fed back to the national grid.  For example, a school will use all of its wind-turbine generated electricity during the school day but very little after school hours, at weekends and during holidays.  It pays for the additional electricity it needs from the grid during the school day but receives nothing in return for the electricity it returns to the national grid.</P>
        <P>A consequence of competition and a liberal marketplace is the plethora of new actors in the sector.  Instead of just the ESB, we now have ESB Networks, EirGrid, the Commission for Energy Regulation, ESB Electric Ireland, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, Airtricity and others.  The result of this is that attempts to rectify problems and find solutions become overly-complicated, if not almost impossible.  The pleas of Lisheenkyle national school near Athenry and the Killary Adventure Centre in Leenane, Connemara, are prime examples.  Both have installed wind turbines, created and built by a local Galwegian company, with the aim of reducing electricity costs and promoting sustainability.  Neither is seeking financial gain from the additional unused electricity supplied to the national grid but merely a reduction in their electricity costs.  When I raised the matter in the House, I was informed that the Minister no longer had a statutory function in this area.  Moving to EirGrid, the body responsible for operating Ireland&rsquo;s electricity transmission system, I was informed that the matter was relevant to the electricity supplier, with which an arrangement would be required.  To complicate matters further, establishing such an arrangement would require the installation of a special meter, which work would only be carried out by ESB Networks.  When I contacted the ESB, I was informed that there were such agreements for micro-generation of electricity but that they were available to eligible domestic customers only.  Schools and businesses need not apply.  The Commission for Energy Regulation confirmed that these arrangements with domestic customers were voluntary and that the commission had no scope in specifying or directing such matters because the retail market was fully deregulated.  While it is clear that everyone agrees the promotion of sustainable and environmentally friendly electricity generation is a great idea, no one is prepared to take responsibility for it.  Is it any wonder, with all the pointless running around that has to done, that schools and businesses are despondent and exasperated?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nevertheless, this new Bill can represent a new opportunity.  If, as seems to be the case, it will facilitate and empower the Minister or another authority, as per section 13, to promote energy efficiency and sustainability and hence reward schools and businesses for their efforts, it is to be especially welcomed.  I am happy to support it because it provides an opportunity for positive change.  However, should it fail to provide for this recognition and reward and, thereby, reduce costs for the schools and businesses which have installed renewable energy generators such as wind turbines, a further amendment of energy legislation might be required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichelleMulherin"><NameTxt>Deputy Michelle Mulherin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the energy debate.  Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan painted a picture in this regard.  This is one of most exciting areas in which to be involved and I wish the Minister of State well in his brief.</P>
        <P>We spend billions of euro per annum on fossil fuels.  Economies and technologies have developed since the discovery of oil and everything is based on the use of fossil fuels, whether <Col N="224"/>it be our heating systems, transport, electricity generation and the generation of other forms of energy.  We are having difficulties in making adaptations such as introducing battery powered cars because there was no focus on this issue in the past.  If people had been more broadminded and had not put all their eggs in one basket, it is possible, for example, that many wars would have been avoided.  Some of the wars taking place today would not have commenced and there would not be trouble and suffering in many countries because of the rush to secure oil resources.  That is the challenge we face.</P>
        <P>Our indigenous renewable energy resources are a good news story.  I come from a county that has such resources in abundance, but there are serious problems with the development of their potential.  In particular, County Mayo has the highest wind speeds in Europe and planning permission was granted seven years ago for the largest wind farm in the State, a 350 MW wind farm at Bellacorick.  However, if it was to be built in the morning, the national grid would not have the capacity to harness the power generated by the farm.  The county council recently drafted and validated a renewable energy strategy which recognised the potential of the wind farm.  It also identified that the county had the capacity to generate 20,000 MW through the use of wind turbines, while avoiding any impact on SACs, housing and so on.  No one has suggested numerous wind farms should be built, given that no 400 kV line passes through the county.</P>
        <P>I have serious issues with the progress made by EirGrid in providing grid capacity in County Mayo.  Wind farms are being built elsewhere in the State, for example, in County Offaly where wind speeds are lower, because grid capacity is available.  County Mayo has the resources but infrastructure is not being provided.  There are not even plans for an expansion of the grid.  Investment capital and companies with expertise in this area were available and such companies were dying to invest, in my county in particular, but they have invested in Scotland or elsewhere where grid capacity and high wind speeds are available and the powers that be have the wherewithal through licensing and so on to make it more business friendly to generate power.</P>
        <P>Likewise, there are five ocean energy sites throughout the world, including the Cape of Good Hope.  A test site has been identified off the Mayo coast, but there is no connection for devices at development stage.  There is a great deal of interest in developing prototypes and transforming them into commercially viable wave energy machines that could be part of our energy solutions.  There is a test site but no cable; therefore, the prototypes are not being developed.  However, again, this is happening in Scotland.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will be aware that there is massive frustration.  Every other week I am approached by a lobby group or an individual in my office to find out what is happening because a connection to the national grid cannot be secured.  In the existing gate system, there are those with offers to the grid who have secured planning permission but if the wind farm is built in Bellacorick, there will be no capacity on the grid for them, so even though they invested money in developing community wind farms, they lose out.</P>
        <P>We need a Gate 4 to take cognisance of the ambition in the programme for Government to develop wind in a clustered fashion.  We have identified the hot spots for wind so we should fast-track the delivery of grid to those areas and avoid getting caught up in the current gate system, where there can be a person at one end of the county with a grid offer but no planning permission and a person at the other end with planning permission but no grid offer.  The person with the grid offer might not intend to build a wind farm and now has a commodity he wants to sell to the person who wants to develop a wind farm.  This is an absolute mess.</P>
        <P>From replies to parliamentary questions I have tabled, I know there is some recognition that there is a problem but we need to see movement.  Money is an issue in the country but these <Col N="225"/>are solutions.  If we invest now, we will achieve energy security while reducing carbon emissions.  We should think big about this, not just hitting European targets but becoming a major exporter.  If we invest now, it will be to everyone&rsquo;s benefit, with sustainable jobs and energy.</P>
        <P>I would like to see this area being given a new lease of life.  The Minister of State is very interested in this and is accommodating ideas and concerns.  This would be a good news story when so many things are outside our control, because this is our own resource.  Those of us who live in the west tend to look east but we have this resource and if we get assistance to develop it, it will benefit the entire country.  It will allow us to play our part in the economic recovery of the country and develop our green economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome a Bill that addresses such an important sector and the opportunity it gives us to discuss this issue.  There are elements in the Bill that we welcome.  Anything that enhances or improves energy efficiency is welcome, as is setting targets and making resources available to improve energy efficiency.  Similarly, anything that gives greater powers to State agencies to ensure safety is important.  Safety should always be paramount when talking about electricity or gas.</P>
        <P>Those measures are welcome but like much of the legislation the Government has introduced in recent months, these are partial measures that go a small way in the right direction, although not nearly far enough, while there is a worrying ideological element that underpins the legislation: the obsession with markets, liberalisation, as it is euphemistically called, and the deregulation of the energy sector.  This Bill it underpins that approach to dealing with this important issue.  While there is emphasis on energy efficiency and saving energy, and that is welcome, there is a worrying law and order approach to it.  It is the wrong focus; it is an example of the Government wanting to appear determined about something while focusing on the wrong area.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Mulherin that if we are talking about energy, we must talk about two key areas, one of which is partially addressed, while the other is not covered at all.  This country is massively dependent on imported energy, oil and fossil fuels.  In a situation of severe and worsening economic crisis and problems with the public finances, on the question of prioritising investment, and this must be public investment because the liberalised energy sector simply does not reach the mark, we need massive public investment to develop sustainable energy resources.  Deputy Mulherin is right when she talks about the west of Ireland.  We are probably uniquely located in the world to develop these energy resources.  We have wind, wave and tidal energy resources that are the envy of the world.  We have completely failed to develop those resources at the speed and on the scale necessary.  There have been improvements, but when the Deputy says there is frustration about this, the Government must agree with her.  The technology is being developed and innovation is taking place in the area.  There have been excuses about the technical difficulties of storing electricity but those are nonsense.  There are methods and concepts for the storage of renewable power that could be made to work if we invest in them.</P>
        <P>There must be large-scale investment.  Instead, part of the motivation for this Bill is the need to bring our energy authorities into compliance with the moves towards liberalisation of the energy market, which is really just another name for the privatisation of that market.  It is about opening the door to those who see this as an opportunity to make money but who do not see any priority in the State developing its energy resources in the interests of the people.</P>
        <P>I encourage the Government to consider the role the ESB played in the 1920s and 1930s, when this country was on its knees.  It was a poverty-stricken, virtually Third World country but the State decided &mdash; there were no socialists at the helm then &mdash; to electrify the country by creating a State enterprise to do it and investing resources and energy to make that happen.  That transformed this country.  As a result of the diktats of the troika, we are considering <Col N="226"/>selling off parts of that very successful State enterprise at a time when it should be protected, invested in, developed and expanded.  The enterprise to which I refer should be retained in public ownership and used as a vehicle for massive investment in both the infrastructure and research and development necessary to allow this State realise the enormous potential it possesses in the context of developing wind, wave and other forms of energy.  I take this opportunity to urge the Government to consider the importance of what I am saying.</P>
        <P>Much of the time, private entities do not have the resources necessary to allow them to proceed with projects.  In addition, as a result of their focus on making short-term profits, many companies are not willing to put in place the level of investment required in the long term to develop the type of natural resources to which I refer.</P>
        <P>I have some serious difficulties in respect of the thrust of the Bill.  In the context of energy deficiency, there is a considerable emphasis in the legislation on encouraging behavioural change on the part of customers as if this is really the way in which we should deal with the problem.  The Bill creates penalties for customers engaged in what is described as &ldquo;energy theft&rdquo; or inefficiencies.  I am not in favour of either inefficiencies or theft.  In so far as there are compulsions on energy producers to upgrade their technology, increase efficiency etc., these must be welcomed.  Pressure should be exerted on such producers in this regard.  However, the Bill emphasises that householders and consumers should be more energy efficient and I am concerned with regard to what this means.</P>
        <P>In recent years the ESB spent a great deal of money developing smart meters.  I do not know the current status of this project but I suggest that smart metering is not very smart at all.  The good old-fashioned meters one can find in most homes are reliable.  They do not need to be fixed and are not reliant on complex software, large computer databases etc., in order to operate.  The development of smart meters has given rise to major technical problems.  We do not need to install over 1 million smart meters, which would utilise untested computer technology etc., in order to pressure householders, particularly those who are less well off, not to use electricity at times when it suits energy providers to have extra capacity available.  This means that if one is poor, one will sit at home in the cold and wait to turn on the heating at a time when it is cheaper for one&rsquo;s energy provider to produce electricity.  That is not the way forward because it is not energy efficiency.  In effect, it could prove to be a way to turn matters even more in favour of energy producers and their ability to make money and could lead to further pressure being exerted on householders to, in some cases, sit at home in the freezing cold.  A huge proportion of the energy distributed throughout this country is used to heat people&rsquo;s homes.</P>
        <P>When justifying moves to remove the household benefits package, which provides elderly and vulnerable people with some support in the context of paying gas and electricity bills, and outrageous cuts to the fuel allowance, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, stated these developments would be balanced by investment in and support for household insulation programmes.  The cuts to which I refer were scandalous and the Minister for Social Protection&rsquo;s comments in respect of them do not represent a serious attempt to deal with the problem of energy efficiency.  As stated on a number of previous occasions, I am of the view that if we are serious about developing energy efficiency then the pay-as-you-save approach mentioned in the Bill would be an appropriate mechanism to employ.  However, the Government must make a much more determined effort to promote and must invest a higher level of resources in this approach.</P>
        <P>This matter was brought to my attention by Mr. Brian Connolly from County Meath, who is present in the Visitors Gallery and who rang me out of the blue and stated that I should recommend a particular methodology to the Government.  He suggested that we should <Col N="227"/>provide, either through local authorities or some easily accessible agency, people with loans to allow them to insulate their homes.  These would be long-term loans and the repayments in respect of them would be low and would be at or about the level of the savings they would make as a result of their homes being insulated.  Effectively, therefore, there would be no cost involved because the savings made from insulating their homes would cover people&rsquo;s loan repayments.</P>
        <P>If the Government made a serious effort to promote and made a large investment in such an approach, imagine the number of jobs which could be created.  Tens of thousands of construction workers who are currently unemployed could return to employment if a massive insulation programme were put in place.  Such a programme would represent real action in respect of the problem of fuel poverty among the poorer sections of society.  It would also generate massive savings and be a real move in the direction of ensuring energy efficiency.  In addition, it would have a major impact in the context of the amount of energy we are obliged to import.  I propose that the Government make a major push in respect of promoting such an approach.  It should also be prepared to make a massive investment.  Mr. Connolly argues that such a programme would not cost that much and would ultimately prove to be fiscally neutral for the State.  There would, however, be a need to make a large, up-front investment in order to launch the programme, which could have massive implications both for unemployed construction workers and in the context of promoting energy efficiency etc.</P>
        <P>The Bill empowers inspectors to search people&rsquo;s homes in order to discover whether they are engaged in energy theft.  As stated earlier, I am not in favour of people engaging in such theft.  Some 350,000 to 450,000 people lost their jobs in the past two years as a result of circumstances completely beyond their control and for which they were not responsible.  These individuals are being savaged by austerity cuts and their fuel allowances have been cut.  In the forthcoming budget, their rent allowance is going to come under attack.  In light of all this, one does not have to be a rocket scientist to work out that desperate people may do desperate things to ensure their homes remain warm.  The position in which they find themselves was created by the previous Government.  Is it fair, therefore, that the State should advocate an approach whereby a coterie of people will be dispatched to terrorise householders and charge into their homes to discover whether they are involved in energy theft?  I am of the view that the focus in this regard is completely wrong.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The focus we need is on investment in sustainable energy resources, which this country is uniquely placed to development.  It will have to be provided by the State and part of that means not selling off the State&rsquo;s natural resources and key State companies.  It means serious investment in a massive insulation programme and creating real incentives for people to insulate their homes by providing the funding up-front.  In the interim, it means not attacking or penalising the little support available to poor working and unemployed people in vulnerable sectors of society to address fuel poverty in the form of fuel allowances.  Such attacks are unconscionable.  It is outrageous that the Government would take measures, in a country where people die of hypothermia and winter-related diseases in their hundreds every winter, to attack provisions such as the fuel allowance.  It is beyond belief.</P>

	<P>On a matter not directly related to the Bill but something one could possibly squeeze in as an addendum to it, measures might be enacted to compel energy companies such as EirGrid and the ESB to have a little more consideration for landowners over whose land they want to put large electricity pylons and transmission lines to avoid the appalling situation which led Ms Teresa Treacy into prison simply because she wanted to see transmission lines put underground.  It is quite possible to put those lines underground <Col N="228"/>and the State should use its influence with the ESB and EirGrid to ensure that they are put underground where reasonable requests are made by people for that to be done and to avoid a situation where an elderly woman lands herself in prison because of the actions of a State company.</P>

        <P>As this is my maiden speech here, I thank the people of Dublin West and Swords who have lent me their votes to represent them here and assure them that I will work tirelessly on their behalf for so long as I remain here.</P>
        <P>I am glad to speak on the energy Bill before us today.  There are three aspects of it on which I want to focus: energy efficiency, what is called energy &ldquo;theft&rdquo; in the Bill and energy safety.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the provision to place in primary legislation energy efficiency obligations under the energy services directive.  It is vital that electricity and gas providers play their part in helping to reduce energy demand.  The best way to achieve such targets is through support measures which will achieve long-term savings such as better insulation and efficient appliances.  Such long-term actions not only provide savings for the consumer but in the long term will help us as a country to meet our energy demand reduction targets.  In that context, it is essential that the Better Energy Programme continues to be a priority for Government.  The fact that one third of the total funding for the programme this year will go to addressing energy poverty is a welcome step in the right direction.</P>
        <P>I very much look forward to the publication of the Government&rsquo;s energy affordability strategy.  I hope the Minister and the Government will be cognisant of the representations made by organisations such as Age Action, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Energy Poverty Coalition.  It is worth noting that investment in energy efficiency is a significant potential source for job creation here.  The 100,000 local authority homes across the nation is an area where, if we were to improve energy efficiency and insulation, we could not only make it easier to meet the targets we set ourselves in legislation and the targets set by the European Union, but we would put many of the people back to work.  I am sure Deputies from right across this House have received representations from tenants in local authority homes who, because of the funding mechanism within the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, cannot get important upgrades, for example, to double-glazed windows.  I urge the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to open dialogue with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to address that issue.</P>
        <P>On the question of what is called energy &ldquo;theft&rdquo; in the Bill, there is no doubt that energy theft, which the Commission for Energy Regulation estimates costs &euro;30 million per annum, can and should be reduced.  Importantly, these savings that accrue must be passed on to the consumer; they should not be retained by the large utility companies.</P>
        <P>It is vital that, in tandem with that, the updated measures outlined in the Bill are used with caution, diligence and responsibility.  Coupled with that, it is essential that the measures to address fuel poverty are given equal weight and vulnerable households are given support and <Col N="229"/>assistance in reducing their energy usage.  Where there is energy theft or fraud, that must be dealt with and it is right that it is dealt with in the Bill, but that is part of a package of measures.  Equally, I welcome previous assurances given by the Minister that no household will have its gas supply cut off this winter due to arrears.  It is an important assurance and it should be welcomed on the floor of this House.</P>
        <P>The measures on energy safety are important and it is good to see them being placed on a statutory footing.  For example, the extension of gas safety provisions to the LPG sector will assist in protecting households which derive their energy from this source and improving safety provision.  This is particularly important given that the Department has noted that fatalities have occurred in homes in recent years as a consequence of problems in this area and the legislative protocols that we are bringing forward in this Bill are vital in that respect.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the provision to allow electrical investigation officers to investigate works carried out by unregulated contractors.  This type of regulation is what is needed in this area and in many other aspects of public policy.  It is something that has been lacking over the past decade or more under previous Administrations.  I also welcome the fact that gas safety officers will be placed on an equal footing with their electrical investigation officer counterparts.</P>

	<P>As I am from the horsey county, the bit is being pulled back in the mouth occasionally.</P>
        <P>I will raise a couple of points on the Bill and I hope the Minister might take them on board.  I will speak on two points only: the energy efficiency fund and energy efficiency.  I will speak on energy efficiency, not from the consumers&rsquo; but from the producers&rsquo; point of view.  I like that an energy efficiency fund will assume the Government&rsquo;s responsibility for providing funding for individuals to upgrade their homes.  Of most concern is that there will be a choice for energy producers, in that they can get involved with the customer by increasing his or her home or business&rsquo;s energy efficiency or they can provide to the fund.  This makes me nervous.  Just as we have a public service obligation, PSO, levy, there is a fear that the cost of the moneys provided to the energy efficiency fund by the producers will be passed on to all consumers, not just to those who will be able to upgrade their businesses or homes thanks to the fund.  I hope the Minister of State is cognisant that, if energy companies decide to provide funding, it should come out of their own bottom lines instead of being passed on to consumers so that the latter are not hit twice.</P>
        <P>The energy efficiency fund invokes thoughts of something that is under way in the UK, namely, the green deal to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred.  Under that deal, energy companies supply energy efficient products to houses and businesses and businesses and consumers pay for them over a number of years.  If consumers decided to switch companies or sell their businesses or houses, what would be the consequences?  If we are to take the same route and get consumers to pay for energy efficiency through their energy bills, we must consider the proposal carefully so that nothing is left behind.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to energy producers&rsquo; energy efficiency and the PSO.  I do not have many difficulties with the levy, in that it is mostly a subsidy of electricity generation via renewable <Col N="230"/>energy, including wind energy, miscanthus and other organic products.  However, it is also used to subsidise what is probably the most inefficient source of energy in Ireland, namely, peat.  There are a number of peat power stations.  Approximately 50% of the PSO levy goes towards paying for power generation through the use of peat.  We all know the problems associated with peat.  For example, Bord na M&oacute;na has contracted with the ESB to generate power until 2017 and many peat bogs are being closed, although none is associated with Bord na M&oacute;na.  When the Minister of State comes to dealing with regulations, will he consider reducing the subsidisation of peat power stations?  They are less efficient, generate a greater carbon footprint and must be subsidised by other elements of the energy sector.</P>
        <P>I welcome most of the Bill, but I ask that the Minister of State take note of the two issues I have raised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Deputy Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been a good debate on energy efficiency and the management of energy resources.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute.  The Bill will place an obligation on suppliers and distributors to play their part in achieving energy efficiency targets that, in turn, will assist the Government in meeting its target to reduce carbon emissions by 20% by 2020.</P>
        <P>Good initiatives are in place.  For example, many houses&rsquo; attics and walls have been insulated.  However, we must take it to the next step.  Other initiatives mean to incentivise the installation of geothermal and solar heating elements in homes.  We must examine our initiatives closely to maximise the return for individuals and the country and to achieve optimum efficiency.</P>
        <P>The energy efficiency fund is to be welcomed and will sustain many of the programmes in question.  We must constantly review them and how they will deliver for householders.  It is important to acknowledge that, through the fund, the Government will prioritise low income, vulnerable households for energy upgrades.</P>
        <P>I disagree with Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s denigration of smart meters.  I encourage their installation in every home, but this will require that householders be educated on them to some extent in order that people might understand how best to make their electricity, gas and oil usage efficient.</P>
        <P>I will focus on two areas.  First, auto-production could lead to many efficiencies and reductions in emissions.  A multinational company in an adjacent constituency to mine lies in an area with great access to renewable energy sources, namely, wind and water.  However, our archaic legislation only allows the infrastructure that is necessary for auto-production to be installed on public roads by ESB Networks Limited.  The problem lies in the fact that the renewable source is separated from the company in question by a public road.  I hope the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials are listening, as numerous requests have been made to the Department to address this problem.</P>
        <P>Legislation needs to be reviewed so that auto-production can be encouraged and renewable sources of energy can be incentivised and made more accessible to large companies, such as the one to which I referred.  I am sure the officials know to which company I am referring.  Access would assist the company in decreasing its energy bill and allow it to compete on the international stage.  It would also reduce the carbon emissions of the company and the country. <Col N="231"/> The legislation needs urgent attention.  The provisions requested are already in place in respect of wind farms, but not in the case of auto-production.  A balance is necessary.</P>
        <P>Deputies referred to other sources of natural energy, for example, wind, tidal and wave.  I encourage the incentivisation of new technologies in those areas.</P>
        <P>I know of a case in which a local authority&rsquo;s swimming pool is separate from its head offices.  The offices have a combined heat and power, CHP, plant but, for the same reasons I outlined earlier, this cannot be connected to the pool because crossing a public road would be required.  These matters must be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Second, a basic heating process can be applied in every household.  Various heating programmes incentivise the installation of solar, geothermal and wood pellet heating systems, but these can be expensive and technologically complicated to maintain and operate.  Will the Minister and Department consider incentivising the installation of simple solid fuel wood stove burners, the likes of those made and distributed by Waterford Stanley?  Each stove costs &euro;400 and I am told by people in the IFA and the forestry sector that wood is a carbon neutral resource.  It can be readily grown in Ireland and burned.  Most of rural Ireland uses solid fuel.  Open fires are 80% inefficient whereas solid fuel stoves are 80% efficient.  For a great deal less money, the vulnerable households to which I referred &mdash; those of old people and others who have open fires &mdash; could be heated.  By installing a stove for &euro;400, someone could increase efficiency significantly and prevent heat from burning coal, turf and wood from going up the chimney.</P>
        <P>Simple solutions are possible.  I will be interested to listen to the contributions of other Deputies.</P>

	<P>Like my colleagues I congratulate Deputy Nulty on his great win in Dublin West and I wish him well with the work those of us on the Government side must do in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill which for the first time will provide a legal framework which places an obligation on energy suppliers and distributors.  The Bill also contains miscellaneous provisions on pension schemes for former ESB employees.  The Bill will ensure the Government meets its energy efficiency targets of a 20% reduction in energy demand by 2020.  This is crucial, as previous speakers have stated.  A European directive exists in this area which promotes energy efficiency and the provision of energy services by energy distributors.</P>
        <P>The Bill will restate in primary legislation obligations on companies such as the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is and will give the Minister powers to introduce an energy demand reduction target which will specify the quantity of savings to be achieved by all retail energy sales companies and energy distributors over a period of time.  Companies such as the ESB, Airtricity and Bord G&aacute;is will be required to offer services such as wall insulation and provide help to consumers.  This will be of benefit to consumers who are already put to the pins of their collars and need all the help and support they can get from energy companies.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness and the costs associated with it have improved in commercial buildings which were upgraded through insulation, and this is to be welcomed.  If companies and distributors do not sign up to energy efficiency schemes, they will have to invest money in an energy efficiency fund, and this money will replace the Government money being invested at present in schemes such as the home energy saving scheme, the warmer homes scheme and the green homes scheme.  These will be consolidated into one better energy homes scheme and the com<Col N="232"/>panies will be required to contribute to it.  These schemes are also important from an environmental point of view as a measure to reduce carbon emissions and greenhouse gas emissions in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Bill deal with the pension arrangements of former ESB employees who have moved to Gaslink or EirGrid.  These changes are being included in primary legislation in case of future court cases.</P>
        <P>With regard to energy fraud and energy theft, at present the Commission for Energy Regulation does not have the power to investigate or enter premises to check out various matters.  Under the Bill, authorised officers will be able to search premises and seize evidence and this is to be welcomed.  As previous speakers stated, costs of approximately &euro;30 million are being passed on to consumers at present and any way to strengthen the regulator&rsquo;s powers is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains many benefits and one of these is reduced usage of energy from fossil fuels.  We need to become more energy self-sufficient as each year we spend billions on importing oil into the country.  It will also encourage consumers to upgrade their homes, which will reduce their energy bills.  It will also ensure Ireland achieves its commitments in European legislation to provide energy savings by 2020.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year the ESB announced it would help those in arrears and the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, was very active in this area and must be commended.  The token meters need to be rolled out to many homes, particularly those on lower incomes and household budget plans.  I hope the other suppliers will follow suit.</P>

	<P>I congratulate Deputy Nulty on his maiden speech in the D&aacute;il and wish him well.  No doubt he will be here for many years.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate today and yesterday.  The debate was very constructive and well put together.  Regardless of one&rsquo;s political party, it is clear that when legislation is in the common good, people sign up to it in terms of examining its pluses and minuses in an objective and clear way.  It is clear from the debate that there is general support throughout the House for the Bill and the principles contained therein.  The number of Deputies who contributed to the debate demonstrates the importance and relevance of energy issues.</P>
        <P>A number of Deputies raised the issues of security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability.  I reiterate that the overriding objectives of Irish energy policy remain security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability.  These are general objectives and they resonate well with EU energy policy objectives.</P>
        <P>We are heavily dependent on gas for electricity generation.  This reliance is set to remain for some time as gas is the fuel of choice while we build our renewable capacity.  I was interested in the comments made on renewable energy by the many Deputies who spoke, particularly with regard to County Mayo, which has the highest wind speeds in Europe and needs connectivity to the grid to build on that energy.</P>
        <P>On competitiveness, analysis by the SEAI shows convergence in Irish electricity and gas prices towards the EU average.  The Government is firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on gas and electricity prices.</P>
        <P>I note the general welcome for the energy efficiency proposals.  These provisions are already provided for in secondary legislation.  By restating them in primary legislation, we will ensure the legislation is more robust.  This legislation will be important in regard to delivering on our targets for energy efficiency.  However, as the Minister remarked earlier in the debate, the <Col N="233"/>tenor of the draft EU energy efficiency directive currently being negotiated will mean even more stringent targets for our energy suppliers of 1.5% savings per annum.  This will require a significant ramping up in activity and the better energy programme is a necessary first step towards achieving the type of savings we need in the long term.  The Minister will publish a new national energy efficiency action plan in the coming weeks.  This will set out the key measures which we will take across key sectors of the economy to deliver on our challenging European targets.</P>
        <P>The support of Members of the House for the provisions of the Bill is most welcome.  We look forward to early consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I advise the House that the Minister proposes on Committee Stage to introduce a number of amendments.  In this regard, amendments will be proposed to the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 with regard to time limits set out in that Act, and amendments will be introduced to facilitate co-operation and the provision of information by oil companies in respect of oil contingency planning.  We also propose to introduce amendments to provide for the winding up of a number of non-trading statutory BGE subsidiaries.  I ask members of the select sub-committee to table their proposed amendments as quickly as possible to allow full and fair consideration to be given to them.  All amendments tabled by Deputies will be considered with an open mind.  The overall objective is to progress the Bill to the Statute Book as quickly as possible, and I look forward to constructive engagement with Deputies and Senators in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputy Halligan.  I welcome Deputy Patrick Nulty&rsquo;s maiden speech and I wish him luck, which one needs in here.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Bill, which is excellent news.  Reading through the EU-IMF agreement, this stuck out like a sore thumb because it was <Col N="234"/>the only thing I was happy with in the agreement.  It is sad that we must be forced to do something like this and it is a shame that we could not have done it ourselves.  Perhaps I am being too sceptical and we would have done it anyway.  The Bill will open up GP care and break up the cartel that existed for years.  It will allow all GPs to treat medical card holders, taking away the advantage of incumbents on the GMS scheme.  As matters stand, it is nearly impossible for newly qualified GPs to gain access to the GMS scheme, resulting in many young doctors leaving the country even though we have a shortage of skills in this area.  One indicator of the positive elements of this legislation are comments made by Dr. Ruairi Hanley when he said &ldquo;It is a great day for patients, who will now have an increased choice of fully-trained GPs.  It is a very bad day for a small section of the GP, IMO establishment&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>If it is a bad day for them, it is a good day for the ordinary citizen.  I hope the outcome of this legislation will be that patients get better value for money.  If they do, it will not only be of benefit to people&rsquo;s health, because they are obviously more likely to go and see GPs if it is cheaper, but it will make this economy more competitive.  There are many factors in making the economy competitive and we hear stories about how people, including civil servants, are paid too much.  The numbers might look big but when one pays all the bills, one does not have anything left.  I am firmly of the view that if one can survive on &euro;4 a week, one is rich on &euro;5 a week.  One can choose whatever version of that one likes.  It will also save the country money down the line because statistics, which I am sure Members have seen, reflect the reluctance of people without a medical card or an insurance scheme such as VHI to visit the doctor.  Many have not been there in the past five years because other bills get paid first and health gets put on the long finger.  Ultimately, this costs the country money because people end up with more serious conditions and they miss work, which means the economy loses money.  In that sense, this Bill is good news.</P>
        <P>I also hope it will bring a return to the situation that existed in my youth.  I am 39 years of age, which is not particularly old.  In the 1980s, when things were tough in my household and in the neighbours&rsquo;, if the child was sick in the house the doctor would come to visit.  I do not know why that situation changed.  GPs are even better paid than they were in the 1980s but for some reason they do not seem to be able to come out to people&rsquo;s houses anymore.  A child might have a bad cold and, in my town, one must travel up to 40 miles to see a GP.  Obviously this is not a good thing because one is taking a sick child out of the bed, into the cold air, into a warm car and to a doctor who, in general, does not know anything about the patient.  I have seen circumstances where people were about to be prescribed penicillin even though they were allergic to it because there did not seem to be joined-up thinking.</P>
        <P>I hope this Bill goes some way to creating a situation where there are enough doctors to provide cover.  I do not know whether there are enough doctors at the moment and I do not know the reason one cannot get a GP to visit a house.  People in my town must go to Mountbellew while five or six doctors in my town are tucked up in bed.  I know it is tough work to have to get up in the middle of the night but the local vet seems to be able to do it.  The conditions in the bedrooms in houses in Roscommon are a lot easier to deal with than a mucky farmyard when one is getting involved in the various practices of a vet.  If a vet can do this, the sick child should get equal treatment or priority.  Furthermore, vets provide a service for a lower price.  I wonder how this has become the case and whether this legislation will do something to solve the issue.</P>
        <P>The display of GPs prices is not covered by the Bill.  I phoned a number of GPs this morning to find out their prices but they were not quite sure of their prices.  GPs should be treated the same as petrol stations, with the requirement for a large sign outside.  Then, we can let people decide.</P>

	<P>I accept many of the provisions in this Bill but I am disappointed at the absence of maximum pricing orders for doctors, as alluded to by my friend and compatriot, Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan.  In spite of the recession and the deflationary trends in recent years, doctors&rsquo; fees remain static or have increased.  The average cost of a visit to a GP in Ireland is between &euro;51 and &euro;53 according to the most recent figures from the National Consumer Agency.  In some cases, one can pay up to &euro;70 in Dublin.  This is more than double the amount paid in some EU states.  Many people in Ireland are fed up with paying exorbitant fees for what they perceive to be an overpriced service.  Anecdotal evidence suggests visits to GPs have fallen between 15% and 30% across the country.  People tend to put off visits to the GP because they cannot afford it and this directly affects their health.  Many current Government Members pressurised the former Minister, Ms Mary Harney, for failing to introduce maximum pricing orders to prevent hikes in GP prices.  Statistics show that there are few developed countries where attending a GP is a major household budget decision.  This is fundamentally wrong.  Statistics show that one in two people now use the Internet as a port of call for health advice, but this is acknowledged by the health service as a dangerous trend.  OECD statistics indicate that GPs in Ireland are paid more than those in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Sweden.  Surely that is unacceptable.  If a GP charges &euro;55 for a five-minute visit, that works out at an hourly rate of &euro;660, which is ridiculous and outrageous.  It is too much to pay for low and middle income workers just above the medical card thresholds; as a result, they do not visit their GP when they should.  It is abject exploitation that GPs continue to charge such prices.  In bring forward the Bill the Government has utterly failed to tackle one of the most fundamental issues affecting thousands of households &mdash; the cost of visiting a GP.  It is unfortunate that this matter has not been dealt with in the Bill.  At a later stage, the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, should do what she said she would do when in opposition, that is, introduce a maximum pricing mechanism for GPs whose costs affect too many people on the wrong side of the medical card thresholds.  Even those who have one at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I have the honour of being one of those who can get up in the middle of the night to see patients.  Unlike the vet, tiredness and fatigue are not options if one is a general practitioner.  If one makes a mess of it as a GP, one cannot write it off as another cow or a calf.  It is far more serious than this and I am sure Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan knows exactly what I am talking about.</P>
        <P>This legislation is very good, although long overdue.  In introducing such legislation, however, we must ensure there is no potential downside to it.  Some excellent changes have happened in general practice in the last decade, including the provision of primary care centres and the grouping of general practitioners.  We are reaching critical mass in order that we can have allied health care professionals such as secretaries, practice nurses, chiropodists and physiotherapists together in primary care centres, as well as groups of doctors working together.  This has been a positive improvement in general practice.</P>
        <P>The role of information technology and computerisation in transferring information from hospitals to primary care centres has also radically changed in the past ten years.  Some 14 years ago, when I was working in hospitals, there was very little information technology in use. <Col N="236"/> Outpatient departments were run using a paper-based system and, to some degree, it is very much the same today.  When I started in general practice around 13 years ago, there were very few practice secretaries or nurses.  In addition, there was poor penetration of information technology in general practice surgeries.  Many things were very different, but the position has changed radically.  Most medical practices now have a practice nurse and all have secretarial support.  We have cost-effective primary care services that are working well for patients.</P>
        <P>Patients&rsquo; private fees are an issue on which we must focus.  There have been dramatic cuts in the payments made in the medical card system to primary care services, which is having an impact.  There has been a reduction in the numbers of practice nurses and secretaries coming into the system, but this is not impacting as much as we thought it might.</P>
        <P>In opening up the system we must also introduce minimum levels of patient care.  We cannot return to a time when there were GP surgeries in garages stuck at the sides of houses.  That would mean one could not have a practice nurse, chiropodist or physiotherapist, introduced as a result of the massive improvements made in the past decade and we want to maintain that progress.</P>
        <P>In addition, HIQA should provide for a basic level of services in GP surgeries, with proper standards of patient care in primary care centres.  There is nothing in the planning Acts to stop someone from converting a small shop to a small GP practice, bringing us back to where we were 15 years ago.  That is not the best approach to adopt for patients.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy Shortall, is present in the Chamber.  I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, who is driving the agenda forward to provide care in primary care facilities, rather than hospitals.  We are talking about chronic care management services, looking after patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, and a range of other problems.  Historically, general practice physicians treated acute illnesses such as chest infections and patients with a high temperature but the patient cohort changes dramatically as the population ages.  We are now dealing with chronic problems such as diabetes, from which a patient may suffer for 20 or 30 years.  If diabetes is not dealt with properly, it can lead to significant complications, including amputations and heart or kidney disease.  The same goes for COPD which can continue for a long period.  If it is not managed properly in the early years, it leaves a patient with a poor quality of life.  Such chronic care management is best provided in large private care centres with more than two or three doctors working in them, supported by practice nurses and HSE staff.</P>
        <P>If we were to revert to the old system under which a GP could set up anywhere he or she liked, those worst affected by it would be in the disadvantaged Dublin areas.  There are already gaps in primary health care for those living in disadvantaged urban centres.  However, people living in rural areas also suffer.  There are two practices in County Wexford that cannot get a GP to work in them.  One has had a locum doctor for at least three years, while the other has failed in two attempts to have a doctor appointed to it.  We must speed up the process of having doctors qualified to work as general practitioners.  I know of cases involving doctors from European countries who have completed their medical training here or in another recognised state, but because the training scheme is not recognised &mdash; there are only 150 or so such doctors &mdash; they are not eligible to apply for membership of the Irish College of General Practitioners and cannot, therefore, obtain a GMS number.  We must not just ensure we have the right types of doctors but also ensure we open up the system properly.  The Bill will only see an increase in the number of GPs in wealthy urban areas.  There is no problem in getting a young doctor to work in a practice on the southside of Dublin, but it is much harder to get someone to work in Ballyfermot and almost impossible to get them to work in rural areas.  At the same time, doctors are able to come here from various parts of Europe who are equally well qualified but <Col N="237"/>whose training is not recognised.  We must change what the Irish College of General Practitioners does, as well as the way the Irish Medical Council recognises such doctors.  They are suitably qualified because they can work for another GP but not for themselves.  There are massive problems in this respect which we must examine in their totality.</P>
        <P>It is important to examine the role of practice nurses and what they can do in primary care facilities.  They have assumed responsibility for a major portion of the work which they are doing fantastically well.  In the practice with which I am associated the practice nurse does antenatal work and provides vaccination, phlebotomy and chronic care management services.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, will be dealing with the actual contract.  Every progressive general practice has a care plan for chronic care management but there is no payment for this.  If one is doing the right thing for one&rsquo;s patients at present, one is at a disadvantage by comparison with those who are not.  The Department and HSE have no idea who is doing the right thing and who is doing the wrong thing because there are no inspections or basic standards.  These should have been covered in the legislation.  There is an opportunity to ensure we are doing our absolute best.</P>
        <P>We know general practice provides a very cost-effective service and that is why we want to move services from hospitals to primary care.  We also need to up-skill the general practitioners.  While we realise circumstances will change regarding how hospitals provide accident and emergency services and what occurs regarding such services in many parts of the country, the debate thus far has been very much focused on upgrading ambulance services, taking on paramedics, etc.  Many general practitioners are trained to deal with trauma at the roadside but there are many who are not trained to deal with trauma or serious illnesses in emergencies.   The latter, owing to their living in proximity to an accident and emergency unit in a major hospital, have been de-skilled to some degree over the years.</P>
        <P>If there are changes to be made, we need to consider the current cohort of general practitioners and not just engage in competence assurance, which is occurring at present.  We must up-skill the general practitioners.  While the Mid-Western Regional Hospital Ennis, for example, has not lost its accident and emergency department, it does not have the same number of non-consultant hospital doctors employed as it once had.  General practitioners work in the accident and emergency department but not every general practitioner in County Clare can do so because one may not be suitably qualified to do that type of work.  There is a need to up-skill general practitioners in order that they can carry out these functions.  They are well able to do so.</P>
        <P>We should seriously have a proper debate on this and not just focus on a few narrow subjects.  There are great opportunities to move towards primary care of a good standard and of high quality.  I refer not only to acute care but to chronic care and various other developments in the sector.</P>
        <P>Over the past decade, general practice has evolved from general practitioners working single-handedly in their houses to their working in large primary care centres that are fully IT compatible.  Some centres have 20 doctors and practice nurses and practice secretaries.  A range of services is now being provided and this represents a dramatic change.  If the changes were as dramatic in the hospital services as they have been in general practice, we would probably not be talking about hospitals as much as we are at present.  If hospital consultants and managers drove their institutions such that they could change as quickly as general practices, in order to give patients what they want, it would be of benefit.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct that house calls are not as common as they used to be.  The question of patients having to travel long distances at night is one of providing an out-of-hours service that encourages young doctors to work in rural areas and small urban areas.  Without services <Col N="238"/>such as Caredoc, SouthDoc, Shannondoc, Mid-Doc and North East Doc, we could have a bigger problem in primary care.  Who drove these initiatives?  It was the HSE, working with the general practitioners and the patients.  Irrespective of what Deputies may feel, patient satisfaction rates with the out-of-hours co-operatives are up to 95%.  The services are all quality assured and all the calls are tracked.  One can trace when a patient rang, when he was rung back and when he was seen.  The system is quality assured to an extent that did not obtain heretofore.  These are massive improvements and we need to keep driving such improvements.  All the stakeholders, including patients, doctors and the HSE, are seeking them.</P>
        <P>The process needs to be co-ordinated better and that is why I am glad we have a Minister of State in the Department of Health with responsibility for primary care.  Primary care was always a poor relation.  When we talk about it, we should not feel it is just about general practitioners and practice nurses within their practices.  It is also about the public health nurse and the community psychiatric liaison teams within primary care.  It is amazing how they have transformed care for patients with psychiatric illnesses.  I want to continue to see progress on having a fantastic service for patients.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support what is proposed in the legislation but I see the disadvantages.  I am glad a section states a doctor can have only 2,000 patients on his list because, if one does not limit the number of patients, corporations could run the primary care system.  In Australia, this was regarded as the means of solving some of the country&rsquo;s manpower problems but it ended up causing problems.  The Australians worked on the same basis promoted in the Bill with a view to promoting competition and improving services, but the result was the opposite of what was expected.  Services cost more and patient satisfaction is lower.</P>
        <P>When we are trying to make progress, we must constantly re-evaluate our approach to ensure we do what is right for patients.  We do not want to realise in ten years that we made a mess of the service just because the IMF sought change.  There are other aspects to be considered.  These include ensuring we have the right types of doctors.  As it stands, before we open up the market, we have a problem getting doctors to where they are needed.  What this legislation will do immediately is get doctors to where they are not needed.  Many doctors would end up in the leafy suburbs of south Dublin but there would be no improvement necessarily in terms of filling the posts in Wexford, other rural areas or deprived urban areas.  We must ensure there is a good flow of doctors to take up these positions as quickly as possible.  I may speak again on this at a later date.</P>

    <Title>Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Bill 2011: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Deputy Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too welcome the Northern Ireland delegation.  I had the pleasure of visiting Northern Ireland recently to see my in-laws.  I had the not so nice pleasure of having to visit a general practitioner there with my child, but an excellent general practitioner service <Col N="239"/>is offered in Northern Ireland and free of charge.  I am thankful for that and the delegates may carry that message home.</P>
        <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate.  We need to acknowledge the importance of general practice historically.  General practitioners in every village and parish have been known to almost every individual in their localities.  I always considered general practitioners as having a vocation.  The same applies to the public health nurses who have operated in the country over many years and kept health services running in the communities.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers are correct in saying the service has changed significantly over recent years.  It will change quite a lot more.  There is a fundamental shift in how we deliver general practitioner care and primary care.  This Bill will reflect that.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the role of the various general practitioners&rsquo; co-operatives.  Caredoc operates in my area.  In fairness to the co-operatives, they operate very successful after-hours services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan should note there was concern at the outset that there would not be a service at the level to which he referred and to which we have been used heretofore.  The service has responded well, however, and I do not hear as many complaints as I would have done some years ago.  The service is up and running and accountable, and this is reflected in the level of service provided.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is the intention of the Government, as indicated by various speakers, the Minister of State, the HSE and the Department of Health, to prioritise the delivery of primary care.  The intention is to have patients cared for in their homes and communities in so far as this is possible and to remove the burden on the acute hospitals.  This cannot occur unless there is a fully resourced primary care health system.  The availability and accessibility of general practice health care, health nurse care and all the ancillary services and supports are doubtlessly essential to the model.  This Bill is not only about reducing cost and increasing accessibility to health care services in the communities.  We need to be very careful about ensuring the existence of a carefully managed, cost-effective and good service when the model is fully delivered.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns outlined by Deputy Twomey regarding disadvantaged and rural areas.  There was a period in my area during which a practice could not fill a general practitioner vacancy but, thankfully, it has now been filled.  It is not easy to attract newly qualified GPs to set up practice in areas that may not be as economically advantageous as other areas. That aspect needs to be provided for in any new models to be rolled out.  Incentives are required to encourage young qualified GPs to set up practice in these areas.</P>
        <P>This Bill will fundamentally change the structure of how we deliver primary care and it will encourage young GPs to remain here and establish practices here.  For that reason, I welcome the Bill.  It will remove restrictions to access to the general medical service list.  It will allow young GPs, with the approval of the HSE, to competitively tender for those lists but they will have to prove not only their qualifications but that they can deliver a GP service and support services.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that good progress has been made in the delivery of primary care health centres but there is still a good deal of work to be done in this area.  The Minister is working hard with the Department to ensure that they are rolled out as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The role of the practice nurse was mentioned.  That role is an enhanced one and it should not be under-estimated.  Practice nurses now support GPs and these nurses have full professional qualifications in treating diabetes, obesity and heart disease, three of the biggest health care challenges facing the people of this country.  It is important to utilise the resource of a practice health nurse working with a GP and other practitioners such as physiotherapists, chiropractors <Col N="240"/>and psychologists.  I have noticed that consultants are also operating out of some  primary health care centres.  That is a good move.  I have noticed in my constituency of Waterford that some consultants travel from Dublin to run a clinic one day a week.  This means people can have access to that next level of service in primary health care centres and do not have to travel outside their communities.  That is important and should be encouraged.</P>
        <P>I refer to the provision of step-down bed facilities in communities.  HIQA has an important role to play in maintaining standards in community hospitals but we need to review legislation in that residential homes for the elderly are clearly not nursing homes.  There are a number of such residential homes in my area in south Kilkenny and Waterford, which have provided good step-down facilities for the elderly for many years.  Elderly people in the whole of their health are cared for in such secure residential homes.  Such homes have to meet the same standards as nursing homes and that is creating a problem for residential homes.  Some of them may not be able to remain open as a result of that.</P>
        <P>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital in Waterford is a hospital for the elderly with full geriatric services.  There was a commitment in the Health Service Executive plan for 2009 for the provision of a new 50-bed unit for that hospital but unfortunately that is no longer the case.  I would like to see that reinstated.  The service provided by hospitals such as this one removes a burden from the acute hospitals.  Such services enable people to move to a step-down facility from which they can subsequently return to their communities and take full advantage of a good GP service with the full role out of community services to support them.  This Bill is a step forward but we need to proceed with caution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We, as a party, are very much in favour of opening up this sector and allowing more doctors to qualify for general medical service contracts.  We accept this Bill in principle.  However, there are some issues we would like to tease out and deal with in the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  I am very much in line with what Deputy Twomey said in his excellent contribution in this regard.  This legislation could have a negative effect on primary care in certain areas.  As Deputy Twomey said, it may result in the flight of doctors form rural and low income urban areas because they may not be seen to be profitable enough.</P>
        <P>Does the Bill make provision for 24-hour GP access and what about a provision for capping costs?  We would like to co-operate and try to improve the Bill, rather than its introduction being a missed opportunity.  We recognise that in recent years there have been positive advancements in general practice, as has been said.  Primary care centres are innovative and professional with various fields of expertise within them, meeting new demographics and freeing up hospitals for more severe cases, and that is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Does the Bill adequately address the provision of out of hours services?  We do not believe it does.  In some areas doctors amalgamate to provide out of hours services.  Will that practice and their position be compromised by virtue of these proposals?</P>
        <P>With regard to qualifying doctors and the availability of doctors, how many do we retain within our system and how many move abroad?  What research and analysis on the training needs and requirements has been carried out?  Have those who have qualified been surveyed and analysed as to their response to what they find upon qualifying?</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the area of home care or step-down facilities to relieve our hospitals, can some mechanism be devised at this stage to improve the role primary care facilities can have in this regard?  Can health care and the promotion of healthy lifestyles be introduced to school curricula?  Is consultation taking place with the Minister of State&rsquo;s counterparts in the Department of Education and Skills to promote this idea?  What role can these primary health centres have to engender the healthy lifestyle aspect of living?</P><Col N="241"/>
        <P>We recognise that the key provision of the Bill is that the HSE will be entitled to enter into a GMS contract with any suitably qualified and professionally trained GP.  We note there will be no limits on the number of contractors, which should reduce costs, and this is a fact that we welcome.  The Bill will also result in some medical card and GP visit card patients having a greater choice of GPs under the GMS scheme.  We acknowledge that 74% of GPs believe that access to GMS contracts should be open to all qualified GPs.</P>
        <P>In regard to the free movement of GPs, new contractors will now be free to establish their practice in the location of their choice.  A contract holder who wishes to move location may do so and I presume that would be with the approval of the HSE.  The basis for such approval is not clear, nor is it clear how it will work.</P>
        <P>Will this deregulation cause a shortage of GPs in rural or low income urban areas?  Deregulation may lead to the State losing what control it may have over the distribution of doctors.  The IMO president said the deregulation of the GMS will lead to difficulties in filling GP posts in rural regions and areas of urban deprivation.  There could be a flight of doctors from low population rural areas and low income urban areas because they are not now seen to be profitable enough, which harks back to a point Deputy Twomey made.  Doctors should not necessarily just be allowed to set up in affluent areas, rural areas must be adequately covered.   I hope to hear from the Minister of State how that is to be done.</P>
        <P>There are no caps on GP fees.  Is this another missed opportunity or is their an avenue open to the Minister of State in the legislation to bring that about?  How does the legislation lead towards free GP care, as promised by both parties prior to entering Government?  In respect of some of the promises made, is there provision for them in the upcoming budget?  What provisions are made in this respect in the programme for Government and what is the timeframe for those to be brought forward?</P>
        <P>Universal primary care insurance was to be extended on a phased basis to the proportion of the population who do not have a medical card so that by 2014 it was envisaged that every person registered with a GP would be insured for primary care.  This means patients will no longer pay up-front fees when they visit their GP.  This was to begin in the first year of Government and I presume this legislation will provide for that.  This is to be done by extending primary care insurance for GP visits to people on the long-term illness scheme.  It is to be paid for out of existing Exchequer funding and savings provided for in the health budget going into a primary care insurance fund.  Can the Minister confirm whether this is provided for in this fiscal year and, if not, will provision be made in the next fiscal year and will it be confirmed in the budget?</P>
        <P>Fine Gael announced it would enter into discussions with insurers on how GP care could be extended to all clients at a reasonable cost.  Have the parties in Government reached a compromise in this regard and how will that impact the legislation?</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill in principle, albeit with the reservations we have outlined, and we welcome the opportunity to debate it.  I hope the Minister will be able to enlighten us on how he proposes to fill the gaps identified during the debate and how the commitment to providing free GP care for all will be funded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomBarry"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Barry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this discussion on the Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Bill 2011.  The Bill addresses issues highlighted by the EU-IMF programme and aims for legislative changes to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors.  It provides for the elimination of restrictions on general practitioners wishing to obtain contracts to treat public patients under the general medical services scheme by opening access to GMS contracts to all fully qualified and vocationally trained GPs.</P><Col N="242"/>
        <P>At present, GPs can only obtain GMS contracts under limited circumstances where a vacancy arises due to retirement, a new panel is created due to additional needs being identified in an area or where a GMS doctor obtains approval from the HSE to take on an assistant with a view to a partnership in his or her practice.  The Bill will allow patients a greater input in terms of nominating a doctor of their choice.  No longer will it be the case that a private patient has to move to a different GP because he or she is entitled to join the GMS.  The commercial viability of GP practices in an area will no longer be a factor in awarding GMS contracts and contract holders will be free to establish their practices in locations of their choice.  The legislation will encourage young GPs to remain in this country and encourage competition in the sector.</P>
        <P>The current GMS scheme provides free GP services to public patients throughout the State and covers 39% of the population, up from 34% at the start of 2010.  The previous GMS contract was to all intents and purposes a contract for life but GPs were free to terminate their contracts at any stage after giving a minimum notice of three months.  It was a one-sided contract.  We often hear of discrimination between private and public health care.  However, certain GPs could only treat private patients and not public patients, which might have led to the assumption that the GPs on the GMS scheme were giving a better service.  Affordability is also relevant because GPs with GMS contracts were charging the same fees as those who only had a private contract when business principles suggest that a larger patient base and a guaranteed source of income implies those practices would have been better value for money.  This is not the case, however, and GP figures remain too high and too variable.</P>
        <P>This legislation, which has been earmarked as part of the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland, should have been introduced years ago.  However, the medical profession is now going to be regulated prescriptively because it failed to address the issues arising through self-regulation.  Having a GMS contract proved profitable to many GP clinics, with 58 receiving more than &euro;500,000 in 2009.  The long disputed scoring system used to award entry into the GMS scheme is also being reformed.  This system proved frustrating to new entrants because it effectively gave existing GPs an advantage over them.</P>
        <P>The HSE has been progressive in its approach to GMS contracts but this legislation is required to help it in its task.  Only a few months ago the HSE facilitated a six month trial period for a GP service in Doneraile, County Cork, provided that the new GP could demonstrate adequate demand for his services from GMS patients in the area.  I am grateful to the HSE for its assistance and, with the support of the local community, the practice is proving successful.</P>
        <P>The Competition Authority has pointed out that between 1982 and 2005 there was a large decrease in the number of GPs with lists of fewer than 1,000 patients and a simultaneous increase in the percentage of those with more than 2,000 patients.  In effect, larger GP practices were mopping up the smaller practices as they became available.  We do not want to emulate the situation that obtains in London, where a few GPs employ large numbers of salaried assistants who have no prospect of securing permanent employment.</P>
        <P>One aspect of the GMS service not addressed in the Bill is that the visitation rate among individuals who receive GP services free of charge is significantly higher than among those who pay for their visits.  In 2007 medical card patients visited their GPs an average of 5.2 times compared with 2.4 visits among those with private health insurance and only 1.9 visits for those without medical cover.  This is a significant disparity.  Whatever the underlying reasons for this disparity, we need to be aware that the considerable number of people who were in the middle income bracket until the financial meltdown and can no longer afford private medical insurance <Col N="243"/>may be compromising their own health or that of their dependents because of financial distress.  This is a worrying trend.</P>
        <P>The new legislation will allow the HSE to take a more proactive role in ensuring adequate GP coverage.  This is important because patient care has to be central to any changes made.  The Irish Medical Organisation has stated that it remains to be seen how well services to patients will be protected.  However, it seems that it was late in updating its interview marking scheme for obtaining GMS contracts and slow in trying to regulate this sector.  It has also indicated that the shortage of GPs in Ireland is due to worsen in the short term.  Approximately 2,800 GPs are registered to practise in Ireland, which represents a ratio of 0.6 GPs per 1,000 of population.  The IMO has also stated that practices will have to ensure they have sufficient resources to provide fully staffed and equipped services from modern premises.  I welcome this statement from the IMO and hope it was issued out of concern for patients rather than as a cynical obstacle in the way of new GPs.  Capital costs are incurred in the establishment of any new business and a GP practice is essentially a business.  In light of the IMO&rsquo;s concerns about sufficient resources for new practices being sufficiently resourced, the funds should come from the GP sector.  It could be based on the modulation arrangements in the agriculture sector, whereby every GMS recipient pays a percentage of income, such as 6%, into a common fund.  The amount paid could be based on earnings, with those earning less contributing a smaller proportion than, for example, the 58 GPs who earn over &euro;500,000 per annum.  Those who earn less than &euro;5,000 should not have to make a modulation contribution.  This would create a fund of &euro;26 million for primary care centres.</P>
        <P>Targeting GMS funding towards GP practices in primary care centres should be further explored.  Primary care centres such as the one in Mallow are proving successful in treating patients with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, at 20% of the cost of the same treatment in hospitals.  Any industry which does not put aside funds for new entrants or exceptional circumstances will inevitably run into trouble.  It is astonishing that it took the IMF to highlight this issue.  The IMO has stated that competition must be implemented with care, and that markets can produce instability, variations in performance and inequalities which might be at odds with the underlying principles of the health service.  However, this legislation will help us deal with any of the organisation&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
        <P>In summary, change is never easy and there will be cost implications to be borne by many of the excellent general practitioner practices that are being run in a professional and dedicated manner.  In the longer term, however, it is better to have a situation where all general practitioners are treated as equals and no obstacles are put in the way of suitably qualified young general practitioners setting up a business where they choose to live and work.  It makes no sense to force young general practitioners to emigrate after many years of expensive education which is paid for by the taxpayer, especially when the number of general practitioners is at such a low level.  This Bill will benefit the Government, the general medical services that administer the general practitioner scheme and, most importantly, the patient.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill.  It means that if suitably qualified general practitioners, GPs, decide to set up practice they will be able to treat not only private patients but also holders of GP visit cards and full medical cards.  There is no limit to the number of contractors who can be involved.  The changes are being introduced on foot of a commitment in the EU-IMF programme which dictated the introduction of legislative changes to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors, including eliminating the restrictions on GPs wishing to treat public patients.  It was also part of the pre-election pledges made by the Government.</P><Col N="244"/>
        <P>The current restrictions are detrimental to the ability of young, properly qualified GPs to set up a practice and deliver care and services to their community.  In many instances in the past the restrictions accounted for whether GPs decided to stay in this country or to emigrate, which was our loss.  I recall debating this issue many years ago when I was a member of a health board.  I was extremely concerned about the matter.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise another concern I have had for some time.  There is a need for D&aacute;il reform because Members do not have an opportunity to raise issues of extreme concern.  I refer to an article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> by John Mooney entitled &ldquo;Course to treat eating illnesses lacks weight&rdquo;.  This is an issue I have raised previously.  In the article he states that a high profile psychotherapist who offers diplomas in the treatment of eating disorders has no official professional accreditation in Ireland and has not obtained any medical or psychological qualifications from a university.  I am concerned about unqualified people involved in psychotherapy and counselling at a very delicate level in treating people with serious psychological, psychiatric and emotional difficulties.  Serious damage can be done by unqualified people operating in this area.</P>
        <P>Mr. Mooney referred to the Eating Disorder Resource Centre of Ireland which offers diploma courses at a cost of up to &euro;3,000.  These take eight weekends to complete.  It was stated by the centre that it is accredited to the British Psychological Society, but a spokesman for the society stated that it does not recognise any courses offered by this centre.  I investigated this issue more than 18 months ago when Bodywhys, the Eating Disorders Association of Ireland, brought it to my attention as a result of its concern.  People had contacted Bodywhys in extreme distress following a discussion with somebody who had completed a diploma and was practising and charging for psychological assistance, advice and counselling.</P>
        <P>There are no statutory regulations in the State for the registration of psychotherapists and counsellors.  There is no State control over them and over what qualifications are held by people practising in these areas.  It is dangerous for untrained, unskilled people to probe others&rsquo; unconscious mind.  They are dealing with human vulnerability and serious damage can be done to such delicate people.  There is a historical situation in this regard which dates back to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  That Act provided for registration of persons qualifying in the use of the title of a designated profession for the determination of compliance relating to their fitness to practise.  Twelve professions were listed but psychotherapy and counselling were not included.</P>
        <P>For more than 12 months, when an agreement was reached between all the relevant psychological and psychotherapeutic groups and counsellors, we have been seeking the introduction of regulation in this area.  The Government has stated that it will introduce a Bill in the new year to deal with this area but I understand the Bill will deal with difficulties experienced with the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 rather than the regulation we have been seeking for some time.  When the Fine Gael Party was in Opposition, it fully accepted this and last December I introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to provide for it.  This has been a matter of extreme urgency for some time because we are aware of the difficulties experienced in this regard by people who have been damaged by their experience with untrained professionals.</P>
        <P>There is another matter I wish to raise which has concerned me greatly for a number of years.  It is in the psychiatry area.  I and many psychiatric professionals believe that the family has a key role in the recovery of a person who is in crisis or has a psychological or psychiatric problem, including suicidal ideation.  However, a large section of the psychiatric profession fails to recognise the benefit of family involvement.  Too many professionals refuse to include family members in the recovery plan for their patients.  In too many instances psychiatrists refuse to <Col N="245"/>discuss the after-care needs of a patient after discharge from a mental ill health residential service.  This refusal to discuss the after-care service on leaving a hospital is unique in the health services.  In general medicine, professionals see the family involvement as part of the recovery programme after discharge from hospital.</P>
        <P>Too often, I have met families who are stressed owing to a lack of information on the treatment regime that best serves the convalescence of a person coming out of a psychiatric institution.  Patient confidentiality is given as the reason.  Family members are key to identifying a member in danger of losing his or her life.  Too often, however, I receive complaints that the professionals do not listen to families with this experience.  Sadly, the family&rsquo;s views may be borne out and in many instances, the person in crisis has taken his or her life.  The culture of excluding a family in such a crisis from the recovery programme of a person with a mental health issue must change and the full family must be involved.  In the United States, in the event of a person being diagnosed with a psychiatric or psychological difficulty, the family are called and are involved in the recovery plan for that person.  Psychiatric treatment must pertain to recovery rather than to containment.  I believe mental health to be central in building a healthy, inclusive and productive society.  Illnesses such as depression and schizophrenia can be treated successfully for the majority of sufferers, and with early intervention and treatment &mdash; early being the operative word &mdash; people can live healthy lives fulfilling their individual potential.</P>
        <P>In this context, I again raise the issue of the adoption by the Government of the strategy, A Vision for Change, as the basis for the development of mental health services in Ireland.  The policy framework as set out in A Vision for Change built upon the recommendations made in the Planning for the Future document of 1984.  Moreover, recommendations have been presented in various reports from the 1960s in respect of the development of psychiatric services that have not been acted on over the decades.  A Vision for Change was greeted with universal approval as being the best model that was comprehensive and would introduce a world class service to meet the mental health challenges facing our society.  However, five years since its announcement, there has been a lack of progress in implementing A Vision for Change as well as an absence of leadership at a national level.  I was pleased that during questions to the Taoiseach two or three weeks ago, the Taoiseach again confirmed and reiterated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ring-fencing &euro;35 million each year during its five-year life towards the implementation of A Vision for Change.  Given the pressures on the Exchequer and particularly during recessionary times, it is easy to be concerned regarding areas of vital importance to the health of the people.  I again welcome the confirmation by the Taoiseach that the aforementioned &euro;35 million will be ring-fenced for the development of A Vision for Change.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>There certainly are positives aspects to this Bill, such as opening up the General Medical Services scheme to a wider group of doctors.  However, one concern I have is I honestly fail to discern a coherent approach to the issue of primary health care, and many others have made precisely the same point on areas that are not areas of advantage.  There is no framework to provide some certainty and there is a lack of values that underpin this legislation.  For example, a value I would expect to see is an entitlement to good quality primary health care.  I am fairly sure I remember such an entitlement being included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  However, it appears to have been sidelined in favour of the more central argument on economic matters, and social matters have taken a hit in consequence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The proposals for universal health insurance contained in the programme for Government, or at least elements thereof, obviously will have an impact on the availability of or access to primary health care.  I understand the need for a broad spread and the necessity to open up <Col N="246"/>the availability of locations.  However, it really commodifies health care and I have a major concern about this approach.  It appears that when the troika sought changes, it only considered one dimension of what needed    to be changed.  Ireland has a highly fragmented health service, which largely has been inherited from our colonial past.  Indeed, if one looks far back into the past, one will find the city of Dublin had a proud history of taking a pioneering approach to health care.  For example, I believe the Rotunda Hospital was the first maternity hospital established in Europe.  Similarly, the first operation performed under anaesthetic was carried out in the Richmond Hospital.  It appears as though that fine pioneering approach has gone backwards in that the present system comprises a mixture of many things, and I cannot see coherence in the system under development.  There are both not-for-profit and for-profit organisations as well as co-location, although I am unsure whether we got that far.  In addition, there is a privatised service at primary level, albeit with some amalgamations such as the development of the doctors on call groups, which has been a worthwhile initiative.  However, no coherence is evident and to open up the system in the absence of having values that should underpin the kind of health care to which we aspire is to miss a vital link.  Consequently, some coherent overarching statements are required.  I acknowledge some elements have been included in the programme for Government but how they are to be rolled out is not obvious.  At what point will there be a health care system in which most people feel sufficiently confident to believe they do not require a form of secondary insurance arrangement if they can afford it?</P>
        <P>I certainly do not oppose this measure but neither am I wildly enthusiastic about it.  While it will do no harm, I have major doubts as to whether it will provide the kind of service that people, particularly in disadvantaged communities, should have an entitlement to expect as citizens of this country because I believe it will add to the existing fragmented approach.  I would welcome a debate in this House on what will be the overall approach and what is the anticipated timeline for its arrival.  Such a debate would discuss what it will look like, how a citizen who is ill will interact with it and when it will become a health system, as opposed to an illness system.  The constant emergency that appears to face our hospital system will only be relieved if it is underpinned by a decent primary health care system in which people are kept well and only end up in acute hospitals if they become ill, rather than the present approach whereby one queues up repeatedly and is delayed even for elective surgery, after which it becomes an emergency.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>That is the public perception of the health system.  It is deeply damaging in terms of people&rsquo;s confidence and is certainly very frustrating for people working within that system, as we see regularly outside the gates here and also through people contacting us.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt the Government would wish to put such a system in place but it would be very useful to understand what the nuts and bolts will be, rather than the &ldquo;we have to do this because we are told to do it&rdquo; type of approach.  As I said, while I do not oppose the Bill, it is only a tiny part and is too fragmented.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Deputy Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I strongly welcome the changes that will be brought in by its introduction.  The introduction of competition into the GP market will see a reduction in prices for patients, which is a good thing for the two out of three people who need a GP but do not have access to a medical card.  It will mean that GMS patients will not have to wait as long to be seen by the local doctor as more <Col N="247"/>doctors will be available.  It will also see a reduction in the numbers attending hospitals as illnesses are caught more quickly and people get to the doctor in time.  It will also mean that new GPs who are finishing their training will have greater opportunities in Ireland, so many of them will not have to go abroad to work in places such as Australia or the UK but can practice at home.</P>
        <P>We need to be very clear about this.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to make sure every euro spent in our economy is spent effectively.  The current GMS contract has not seen a good return on investment for the general public because of the restricted access to the scheme.  We have fewer than one GP for every 1,000 people, which compares to the figures in the United States and Germany.  According to the Competition Authority, my county of Meath has the least number of GPs per head of population, which is not good enough.</P>
        <P>I see this Bill as bringing more responsibility to the public funding of GPs.  At present, we are spending just over &euro;400 million a year to fund GP visits alone, and this is spread among approximately 2,300 GPs.  At a time when everybody is being asked to tighten their belts because of the state of the economy, the average payment to GPs is some &euro;220,000 a year, which includes funding to run their surgeries.  However, that is not ring-fenced just to be spent on public patients so the general public through taxation is subsidising the operation of GP surgeries for both public and private patients.  Moreover, that payment of &euro;220,000 is just an average.  Some GP practices are getting a lot more than that, depending on the number of public patients they see.  Of course, GPs are not only seeing public patients but are seeing private patients as well, so the other 50% of visitations are from private patients who are paying between &euro;50 and &euro;70 per consultation.  The price for a consultation has not gone down to reflect the pressure on people&rsquo;s pockets over the past three years.  In fact, the cost of going to the doctor has risen by nearly 90% since 2000, whereas inflation was just 30% over the ten years since then.</P>
        <P>Another issue is that many surgeries, some 50%, do not display their prices, so it is very difficult for people to work out whether one doctor&rsquo;s surgery is giving better value for money than another.  In addition, some GPs are asking patients to pay for services that are covered by the GMS, an issue I have raised in the House previously.  People in Meath who have medical cards have told me that doctors asked them to pay for blood tests.  It is an issue I will continue to raise as these are vulnerable people who are too scared to speak back to the doctors and to complain, and they end up paying for a service that the Government is paying for through the GMS system.  The IMO claimed that GPs were giving people free blood tests and that the Government is at fault due to tightening its budgets but this is hardly fair at a time when we are giving the average practice &euro;220,000 per annum.  I call on the Minister to ensure no patient under the GMS receives less treatment than it is contractually bound to under the scheme between GP and patient.</P>
        <P>I support the Bill and am glad to see it introduced.  I wish the Minister the very best in this reform of the health service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, and I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Although a relatively short Bill, its provisions have the potential to deliver tangible improvements to GP services.  It provides for both the elimination of restrictions on GPs wishing to treat patients under the GMS and allows patients the freedom to choose their own doctor without being tied to their GMS contracted practitioner.</P>
        <P>At the most basic level, I welcome the fact the Bill provides the right for any suitably qualified and vocationally trained GP to set up a practice in the location of his or her choosing.  For too long, the GP industry has been a closed shop or sheltered profession, providing unnecessary <Col N="248"/>barriers to entry for young, aspiring GPs and, more importantly, creating conditions which have allowed for the escalation of GP fees for the ordinary Irish family.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The archaic restrictions referred to in the Bill created a form of elitism.  We are witness to this in other sheltered professions in Ireland such as pharmacy and especially law, which retains the totally outdated and exclusionary practice of &ldquo;devilling&rdquo;.  These professions also need to be tackled in the same way that the Government is tackling general practitioners in this Bill.</P>
        <P>The GMS is currently availed of by 80% of GPs, who are cumulatively receiving upwards of &euro;500 million of State funds to treat medical card patients.  Examples of the individual amounts some GPs are receiving are quite staggering.  In 2009 one GP in Dublin received &euro;767,000 for seeing medical card and GP card patients, in Donegal a doctor received &euro;754,000 and so on.  In all, 58 GP clinics received over &euro;500,000 in 2009, 156 received &euro;400,000 to &euro;500,000, while over 1,000 GP clinics received between &euro;200,000 and &euro;400,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These figures highlight to all of us the benefits to some of the barriers to entry for others.  It also places the 20% of GPs not included in the GMS at a competitive disadvantage.  GPs in this category are unable to avail of guaranteed State income and in many cases end up losing patients who qualify for a medical card and have to change to a GMS covered practice.  With this Bill, patients will have the freedom to choose their GPs and will not be tied to one practice.  This should also serve to end instances of opportunistic charging of medical cardholders for tertiary services such as routine phlebotomy services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The removal of limits in the number of contractors contained within the Bill will allow new GPs to set up business in areas where, up to now, one GP or practice has held a monopoly over a particular town or region.  As with all monopolies, the customer, or in this case the ordinary Irish patient, suffers.  Without competition, GPs can and do set excessively high prices to non-medical cardholders.  These people, usually low to middle income earners, many with families, can face high GP costs should they or a member of their families become ill.  The standard price in my constituency of Dublin North is approximately &euro;50 but there are practices charging higher prices for what can turn out to be a ten-minute consultation.  Of course, there can be follow-on costs for prescribed medicines which further add to the cost of health care for the ordinary person.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All Deputies in this House know of people in their constituencies who just cannot afford to go to their GPs.  If they do go to their GPs, their shopping bill, electricity bill or heating bill will have to be put off, with serious consequences.  This is the reality of the situation in Ireland today, and our task in this House is to introduce legislation which will ease the hardships being faced by ordinary people.  In this Bill, we have an opportunity to improve services and decrease costs for ordinary people.</P>
        <P>The Competition Authority in its report in July 2010 highlighted the fact that competition between GP practices and access to GP services will lead to greater access to GP services and better choice and quality of service for all patients.</P>
        <P>I refer to general medicine&rsquo;s sister field of dentistry.  Recent legislation obliging all dentists in Ireland to display prices publicly for all services they deliver, combined with other factors, has led to a more competitive market with some dental practices reducing consultation fees from &euro;60 to between &euro;30 and &euro;40.  Over the past three years, almost every person in this country lucky enough to retain a job has faced a wage reduction.  This has impacted on people&rsquo;s standards of living but while they took wage reductions, there was no perceptible decrease in GP fees.  By opening the market for GPs, increased competition from fully qualified practitioners should lead to reductions in prices for patients.</P><Col N="249"/>
        <P>While the ultimate goal of this Government is to provide universal health care, the reality is this will take a few years to implement.  In the meantime, I welcome the potential in this Bill for a reduction in the cost of health care.  Health provisions are dealt with in the section entitled &ldquo;Fairness&rdquo; in the programme for Government.  I believe this Bill will help rebalance what has up until now been an unfair system and I warmly welcome it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill, which provides that suitably qualified general practitioners setting up practice will not only treat private patients but will also treat patients holding both GP visit cards and full medical cards.  There will be no limit on the number of contractors.  The legislation is being introduced as a result of the commitment in the EU-IMF programme which required the introduction of legislative changes to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors, including eliminating restrictions on GPs wishing to treat public patients.  These restrictions have had a detrimental effect on younger, properly qualified GPs setting up in practice and delivering care and service to the community.</P>
        <P>I would like to raise the matter of the provision of a GP service in the north city fringe part of my constituency in Dublin North-East through a proposal to provide a primary care centre in the Clongriffin-Coast area.  Following the proposal to develop the Dublin north city fringe and the Fingal-Baldoyle-Coast area for residential and commercial development with the granting of planning permission in 2002 and subsequent appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the then Eastern Regional Health Authority first proposed in 2004 at a meeting with local public representatives that a state-of-the-art primary care centre would be required for the north fringe area to cater for the future needs of the new community.  It was planned that a 19,500 sq. ft. primary care centre would incorporate GPs, public health nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, social work and other services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">By 2007 a considerable number of new residents had moved into the area and they began to demand answers as to when the primary care centre would be in place.  A pharmacy had opened in a unit at Clongriffin town centre with the expectation that the business would be viable once the primary care centre was opened.  The tardiness in completing the Clongriffin DART station was a factor for some time but the rail station eventually opened in the early part of last year.  The plan up to that point was that the primary care infrastructure initiative scheme would allow GPs to provide to the HSE accommodation suitable for the provision of primary care team services.  In return the HSE would enter into a 25-year lease with the providers for accommodation occupied by the HSE.  This agreement is subject to various conditions but the principal condition is that the preferred provider must secure a minimum number of GPs to service GMS patients in the locality who would operate out of the same building as the HSE under the banner of the primary care centre.</P>
        <P>While serving as a local authority member, I was on the HSE Dublin north-east regional health forum and, in early 2010, it became apparent that there was a breakdown in discussions between the HSE and a group of GPs regarding the opening of the proposed Clongriffin primary care centre in a unit provided by Gannon Homes under the primary care infrastructure initiative scheme.  Unfortunately, hopes that the promised primary care centre would be put in place were dashed when the GPs, who had previously declared their support for the centre, withdrew from the process.  Following their withdrawal, the HSE was no longer in a position to proceed with a lease agreement for accommodation at this location.  The HSE subsequently informed forum members that a potential new location for a primary care unit for the Baldoyle-Clongriffin area has been identified at Myrtle Court, a new estate off Grange Road, Baldoyle, and that advanced negotiations had been taking place between the executive and a major health care provider over the previous six months.  It was stated that construction would commence in <Col N="250"/>early 2011 subject to planning permission and site acquisition.  This has not happened and I have not received an update from the HSE in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Due to this uncertainty, the pharmacist in Clongriffin was forced to close leaving the area without the services of a chemist.  The economic downturn was also a factor in the slow uptake of the commercial units in Clongriffin town centre and the hope was that the opening of a primary care centre together with the new DART station would provide a much needed stimulus essential for the success and future viability of Clongriffin.  Will the Minister intervene with the HSE to ensure the proposed primary care centre for the Clongriffin-Coast area of Dublin North-East is put back on the agenda and that a timetable for its implementation is provided as a matter of urgency?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaraConway"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciara Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is a worthwhile Bill.  The GMS scheme has been in operation since Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon was Minister for Health in 1989 and, like many other things, it is about time we took a fresh look at it.  It is high time we re-examined the scheme.  It is a shame in a way that it has taken the pressure of the troika to achieve this but perhaps this is a patch of silver lining in a dark cloud that has been cast by the restrictions we face as a result of the EU-IMF bailout.  The need for change is highlighted when one considers the substantial difficulties with the current scheme, especially from the point of view of qualified GPs who are unable to access the GMS list as well as for patients seeking affordable health care.  The legislation will enable non-medical cardholders to access more affordable health care, which is a strong component of Labour Party policy in government.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Currently, GPs can only secure GMS contracts in restricted circumstances and this has led to a situation where aspirants must wait for a colleague to die or retire and they cannot access a list of medical card patients, which is far from ideal.  It creates problems for GPs not on the list as they can only see private patients which, in turn, contributes to driving up prices for non-medical cardholders.  The GMS scheme has come to be seen by some GPs as a guaranteed cash cow in addition to the benefits they receive through employing additional staff for their practices and drawing down State fees.  One GP in my constituency received more than &euro;500,000 in payments, which is an incredible sum.  Statistics like this give me great pleasure in welcoming the Bill to address an inequality that needs to be tackled and I am glad the Government is doing so.</P>
        <P>The State spends a significant amount annually on the education of young medical students, many of whom must leave because they cannot find somewhere to finish their training.  I have a number of female friends who are qualified doctors and who, for different reasons, would prefer the life of a GP and the opportunity to work in the community but they have been forced to emigrate.  This is another element of the brain drain.  These are young doctors who have been educated by the State and they must leave because opportunities are not available for them to pursue a GP career.  I welcome the Bill in the hope it will open the GMS scheme to new applicants and that the system will be fairer.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">However, I add a word of caution. The new Bill does not contain any measure to encourage GPs to display their prices, as dentists must.  This should be made obligatory so people can compare prices.  If a person goes to the hairdresser or to the dentist, he knows what he will pay, but currently there is no provision for a doctor to display his prices.  This should be examined as the Bill goes through the House.</P>
        <P>This Bill is welcome; it is a positive step that will help to open the market and will benefit patients and GPs, paving the way for something I fundamentally support as a member of the Labour Party &mdash; universal health care.</P>

I cannot understand why it took the troika to add haste to the situation.  No matter the reason, I am glad it happened.  There is a great deal of anti-competitive practices.  I compliment the vast majority of GPs and their staff, who work hard and give a good service in a difficult job.  Many have given long years of good service to the community.  A situation, however, has evolved where change is badly needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Entry to the GMS scheme is an issue.  In 1970 medical cards were made available to people who in the opinion of the health service were unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.  These were followed by doctor-only medical cards.  The 1989 agreement is outdated and it is time to change it.  Previously, vacancies were not available until someone retired or died.  Older people might enjoy a long relationship with their doctors but times have changed and medical practice has advanced.  It is a pity to see young GPs, who have made a huge investment over the years in their education, emigrating, as is happening in so many sectors, when they are needed at home.  They often made considerable sacrifices to attain their qualifications.  It is a shame there is not more competition so there would be more areas for them to move into.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Competition Authority made recommendations in this area, although in many other areas it did nothing, and these were taken into account in this Bill.  The statistics are frightening.  There are almost 2 million medical cardholders and 129,000 GP visit cardholders.  Expenditure amounts to &euro;435 million.  There are 2,600 GPs in active practice, with 2,279 holding a GMS contract.  An additional 300 doctors work in a locum capacity.  Those are phenomenal numbers providing a service to people who need it.</P>
        <P>Some consultants use hospital services to treat private and public patients but GPs must have their own surgeries and equipment.  Investment is huge so we must not throw the baby out with the bath water.  There should be a cap on the remuneration that can be earned from the GMS scheme.  While we are trying to introduce a maximum wage and to be fair and balanced, they are self-employed and must pay insurance and provide facilities but there must be a way to avoid the fatigue that results from having too many patients.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a pity we had to wait for the IMF to come in to make these changes but I welcome them anyway.  Dentists were mentioned and I remember the protests when they were made to display their prices.  It has worked for the benefit of the consumer and I see no one complaining about getting less of a service.  A visit to the dentist is unnerving but no one is saying they are any worse off.  In fact, prices have come down because the displays mean people can shop around.  This legislation could include such a provision for GPs to be required to display prices of all services clearly.  I have a large family and barely a week goes by without having to visit the doctor but sometimes we might only see a nurse.  There is a range of services and the charges for them should be clearly displayed.  If blood is being taken, a person should know how much he or she is being charged.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A person should also have the right to change GP, as I have because I do not have a medical card.  My GP provides a good service and is located in a large practice with a number of GPs.  I have an issue, however, with the availability of doctors at night, something the Bill fails to address.  It is a sad state of affairs that in 2011, if a person has a sick animal, a vet can be called at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and he will be there in a half hour but the same person cannot get a doctor.  Caredoc operates in my region, and I welcome the fact that fears that some of its services were being cut back have been allayed, but no mother wants to bring a child to the doctor unless she needs to and it is desperate when she cannot get a GP home visit.  Even in the practice I attend it is so busy that if we want a home visit, we must wait until 7 p.m. or <Col N="252"/>8p.m.  Doctors are reluctant to do it.  It is terrible that a pet can get treatment quicker than the owner; that is morally wrong.  GPs have earned their time off but there are huge issues in the Caredoc system.  It is a fire brigade service and it is not good enough that if a person wants a GP, he or she cannot get one.  He or she must ring this service, tell the person on the other end of the line what is wrong and that person will ring back.  That is not good enough.  Someone who is panicking or lying out cold on the floor cannot relay that information.  It is not fair for those elderly people who have given some service to the State and paid their taxes.  They deserve better.</P>
        <P>I referred earlier to consultation charges.  Like most people, I am charged &euro;50 for a visit to my doctor.  Some individuals are charged &euro;60.  In the past two to three years, most fees have been reduced.  The Government, like that which preceded it, is concerned with reducing the cost of living and prices.  I had many discussions &mdash; some of which were quite animated &mdash; with the former Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney, in respect of this issue.  Ms Harney always maintained that in certain European countries one will only be charged &euro;10 or &euro;15 for a visit to a GP.  It is not acceptable that Irish GPs have not reduced their prices or have not been obliged to do so.  The Competition Authority should be involved in this matter.  Everyone has been obliged to accept cuts, large numbers of people have lost their jobs and many businesses are struggling to survive but GPs are still charging the same amounts they charged during the Celtic tiger years.  That is not acceptable.  GPs should be obliged to display their prices and they should be forced to reduce the cost of a visit to at least &euro;40.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When medical cardholders are obliged to seek additional services from their GPs &mdash; such as having driving licence application forms completed, blood tests, and so on &mdash; some are being charged an additional &euro;10, &euro;20, &euro;25 or &euro;30.  That is not good enough.  The people to whom I refer have medical cards because they do not have the money to pay for medical services.  It is not acceptable that GPs should be paid through the GMS in respect of patient visits and then charge extra for additional services.  The Competition Authority should address this matter also because the transactions involved are all done on a cash basis.  I do not know if these transactions are recorded but what is happening is not acceptable.  Many of my constituents are concerned with regard to this type of practice.</P>
        <P>People have always respected and admired their doctors, which is only right and proper.  However, this has led to a situation where individuals are afraid to challenge their doctors or discuss matters with them.  Let us face it, one is generally in a fairly delicate situation when one visits the doctor.  I have a fear of injections  and that places me and others like me at somewhat of a disadvantage.  Elderly patients who have built up relationships with their doctors over many years would not dream of questioning them and if they were asked to pay &euro;100, they would hand it over.  The Competition Authority should investigate what is happening.  I am surprised that GPs have not been requested to display their price lists and those relating to chiropodists, nurses and others who might provide services on their premises.  I accept that GPs provide their own facilities, but a cap must be introduced in respect of the fees they charge.</P>
        <P>I am concerned with regard to the bureaucracy which attended the recruitment of non-consultant hospital doctors from abroad earlier in the year.  The advertisement process relating to this matter was expensive and elaborate but it was also well done.  The only difficulty is that some of those who were offered jobs here have still not entered employment.  I do not know the exact figure but it is outrageous that some of these doctors are still not working in our hospitals.  I do not know whether the HSE, the consultants or the Irish Medical Council caused this problem but what has happened is scandalous.  The junior hospital doctors to whom I refer came to this country, in good faith, to work and now we are hearing all sorts of stories about some of them being placed in rented accommodation and not being allowed to work.  Some <Col N="253"/>bureaucratic barrier put in place by one or all three of the entities to which I refer stopped a number of these doctors entering employment.  As a result, there has been increased pressure on consultants, beds and wards have been closed and hours of service have been reduced.  The junior doctors to whom I refer have almost been the subject of house arrest since they came here.  The situation in which they find themselves is degrading and steps should be taken to ensure that there will be no recurrence of what has happened.</P>
        <P>I compliment the parties responsible for recruiting these doctors.  They did a good job and those who were offered work in Ireland travelled here in good faith.  What befell them could only happen in Ireland.  Bureaucracy has reached a crazy level.  Governments and Ministers come and go but officialdom is permanent and it is draining the lifeblood from this country.  All those in officialdom are concerned about is protecting their own patch.  These people are afflicted by greed.  I am not in a position to point the finger at anyone in particular but the type of greed to which I refer must be rooted out.  What happened in the case to which I refer was extremely distasteful.  The junior doctors brought here from abroad are eminent and qualified.  Everything was done above board in this instance and no shortcuts were taken.  Had shortcuts bee taken, these individuals would never have been recruited or brought to this country.</P>
        <P>What happened in this case sent a terrible message to the home countries of these junior doctors.  In the past, Ireland has sent ambassadors abroad &mdash; both lay people and members of the clergy &mdash; and they did much work wherever they went.  They and others, such as the NGOs, continue to work.  However, their legacy is being tarnished by this shameful and outrageous episode.  I hope the Minister for Health will be able to come to grips with the matter and that there will be no recurrence of the events we have witnessed.  I do not envy him his task and I wish him well in respect of it.  The mandarins who caused the problem must be rooted out because they are giving our country a bad name and delaying progress.  In addition, their actions are having an effect on people&rsquo;s health.</P>
        <P>I represent a rural constituency.  I am aware of a case involving certain doctors who were providing services to a rural village and its hinterland and who decided to retire.  Following their announcement, everyone in the area was involved in a great battle to retain the health centre and to have a new GP appointed.  People in the community to which I refer were quite scared when they realised they could lose their local health service.  I am aware of other instances where public meetings were held and lobbying took place in counties Waterford and Tipperary because people were frightened that they would not have access to local health services.  It is not acceptable that people should be concerned in respect of issues relating to health.  In the instance to which I refer, great efforts were made to oblige the HSE to appoint a new GP to the local health centre.  The excuse put forward by the executive on many occasions was that it was not possible to employ a GP to take up the position.  That may well have been the case but situations such as that to which I refer must be addressed.</P>
        <P>The position is this regard is similar to that which exists in the context of rural transport.  I am involved with the fledgling rural transport service in Tipperary &mdash; which is operated by volunteers &mdash; and it is not acceptable that people in rural areas do not have access to the same services as those in more built-up areas.  Some of the medical practices-health centres in rural areas that have been closed were not exactly small operations.  I do not know whether the HSE just wanted to close them down but whatever the position, a great deal of unnecessary worry and angst was visited upon families and others.  Elderly people and mothers with children who did not have access to transport needed the security of having a doctor nearby.  Their doctors might not be at the health centre every day but they were present on most occasions and had all patient records on file.  This matter is not addressed in the Bill but it should be because continuity of service is required.</P><Col N="254"/>
        <P Just="Left">People need to know that if their doctor becomes ill or decides to retire, a locum or replacement will be put in place.  Citizens must be able to visit a GP whose practice is situated within reasonable distance of their homes.  Not everyone is in a position to travel to the nearest town.  Many families never had second cars and with the advent of the recession, those who did no longer possess them.  If one partner is working, it is often the case that the car will not be available to the other.  As a result, people cannot travel far to visit their GPs.  As already stated, unlike their colleagues in veterinary medicine, GPs no longer make house calls.</P>
        <P>I welcome the many benefits to which the Bill will give rise.  In the future, people with GP-only medical cards will have greater choice in respect of which GP they attend.  It is important that people should have such a choice, particularly if they have difficulty with a certain individual, wish to change practices or want to seek a second opinion.  People are entitled to a second opinion and to move to another practice if they so desire.</P>
        <P>The Bill will ensure that any suitably qualified doctor who wishes to obtain a GMS contract will be free to do so.  I wholeheartedly welcome this development because for too long a monopoly and certain restrictions have held sway.  It is important that a change is being made because it will encourage young GPs to establish practices in Ireland and remain here with their families.  These individuals have devoted a great deal of time and money to their medical studies and training.  It is important, therefore, that we should encourage them to remain here.  We should not educate and train them only to allow them to leave and work in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>The Competition Authority issued its report in July 2010.  I am glad the authority did because I was critical of it last night.  I am glad that some matters in that report were acted upon.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  I look forward to its passage through the House.  I am positive about most aspects of it.  As I stated, we must never forget the customer is a paying customer, whether under the GMS or a private patient, and he who pays the piper should call the tune.  We should never forget &mdash; I will not knock the doctors &mdash; that the patient must always come first.  Some 99.9% of GPs put patients first.  Patients must have security of access as well and the GPs must remain there for them.  We must examine the unavailability of GPs after hours, at weekends or at night.  It is not good enough that one cannot get a doctor.  If one is sick, one needs a doctor and one should be able to get one.</P>

	<P>One of the results of the programme introduced by the EU-IMF is the provision to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors by the end of September 2011.  This encapsulates restrictions on general practitioners wishing to treat public patients.  It is with this in mind that the Bill provides for the elimination of restrictions on GPs wishing to treat public patients under the General Medical Services, GMS, scheme.</P>
        <P>Essentially, the Bill will open access to GMS contracts to all fully qualified and vocationally trained GPs, subject to general suitability criteria.  This will ensure greater benefits to all stakeholders, in particular the public and patients.</P>
        <P>At present the entry terms to the GMS scheme form part of the 1989 agreement with GPs.  There are three routes for entry into the GMS scheme for GPs: where a vacancy arises due to <Col N="255"/>the retirement, resignation or death of an existing GMS doctor; where a new GMS panel is created in response to an identified need for an additional doctor in an area; and where a GMS doctor obtains approval from the HSE for the creation of an assistant post with a view to partnership within his or her practice.</P>
        <P>Developments in primary care should always build upon and add to the strengths of the current system.  This Bill ensures an enhanced provision for the patient, and for this reason and many others I have no hesitation in supporting it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Historically, GPs, public health nurses and other professionals have provided primary care in Ireland.  They have provided a critical frontline service which has acted as a gatekeeper for many secondary elements of the broad range of health and personal social services.  In many cases, and for long periods, it has been the commitment of such professionals in primary care which has ensured the public has been able to avail of a personal, local, accessible and timely service with which they have been satisfied.</P>
        <P>As mentioned, the legislation will create a more open playing field with all suitably qualified GPs being able to access GMS contracts.  The most fundamental aspect of the Bill is that there will be no limits on the number of contractors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">New GMS contractholders will be free to establish their practices in the locations of their choice, but once established, any contractholder who wishes to move location will only be able to do so with the prior approval of the HSE.  This is designed to ensure continuity of care for patients.  The fact this Bill ensures there will be no limits to the number of contractors clearly complies with the EU-IMF programme, removing restrictions to trade and competition.</P>
        <P>This Bill has two main strands.  In the first instance, as mentioned previously, it fulfils the requirements established by the EU-IMF.  Second, and more importantly, it confers numerous benefits on the State and, therefore, on patients.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The enactment of the Bill will result in medical card and GP visit card patients having a greater choice of GPs under the GMS scheme.  This should not be underestimated, particularly in the less populated towns and villages of the country.  Greater choice can instil better confidence in patients and ensure they are not compelled to return to a practitioner where they may have had an unfavourable experience.</P>
        <P>In addition, the greater range of service providers in an area should ensure they deliver a better service to the patient.  By this, I mean they may effectively compete for custom in many ways.  Examples include extending opening hours, opening on Saturdays and Sundays, providing better waiting and parking facilities, investing in the latest technology, and providing the latest advances in treatment and diagnosis.  All these aspects help improve the delivery of services to the patient.</P>
        <P>This Bill will ensure that any suitably qualified doctor who wishes to obtain a GMS contract will be free to do so.  Thus, those with drive, passion and enthusiasm will be rewarded and, more importantly, afforded the opportunity to excel in their profession.  By allowing greater access to such practitioners, it will also greatly raise the standard of delivery and patient care.</P>
        <P>This Bill will also encourage young GPs to remain in Ireland and to establish their practices here.  As has been all too often documented in the media recently, we are losing vital and crucial talent through emigration.  This Bill will in a strategic way help address the export of our young GPs, the very core of our future improved health system.  After all, it is these young men and women in whom the State has invested, via the provision of education and universities.  It is imperative that we try to arrest their decline and encourage them to stay within our shores.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Furthermore, this Bill will encourage competition among GPs at a time when many fee-paying patients have less money at their disposal.  This competition will ensure a greater choice <Col N="256"/>for the patient and in doing so, will put downward pressure on charges.  This can only be of benefit to our already financially stretched people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another aspect of this Bill that ought not be overlooked is that the extra GPs should ensure greater provision of frontline services, therefore reducing some of the supply to the over-stretched hospitals.  This aspect of the Bill will have a preventative element and will help ensure a better delivery of services at both GP and hospital level.</P>
        <P>The current capacity of primary care is insufficient to meet the evolving needs of the population.  Changes in demography, reorientation towards prevention and health promotion and shifting the focus from secondary care towards primary care will increase the burden already facing community services.  This Bill addresses in an effective and fundamental way these issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I alluded to the fact that GPs provide a crucial gatekeeper role to secondary care services.  Studies have shown that patients value this gatekeeper role and it has also proved to be cost effective.  Greater availability of GPs will further cement this vital and sometimes underestimated role.</P>
        <P>In addition, this Bill may reduce the strain on an already under pressure secondary care sector.  The secondary care sector is providing many services which are more appropriate to primary care.  This Bill has the potential to address this over-reliance on secondary services.  Essentially, by providing greater access to and choice of primary care, it will reduce the pressure on secondary care providers.</P>
        <P>A further aspect of the Bill that warrants mention is that it affords the potential to facilitate and develop otherwise underdeveloped out-of-hours primary services.  It has the scope to provide greater choice and service to the patient, with resultant benefits to hospital accident and emergency departments.</P>
        <P>Finally, I want to address another commendable aspect of the Bill.  In addition to the already stated benefits, this health Bill will further address the following recommendations in the Competition Authority&rsquo;s July 2010 report on general medical practitioners, which was aimed at increasing competition within the GMS scheme: access to GMS contracts should be opened to all qualified GPs, decisions to award a GMS contract in a particular area should not take account of the viability of GPs already practising in the area and GPs in possession of a GMS contract should be free to set up in, or move to, the location of their choice.</P>
        <P>I have no hesitation in recommending this Bill as it has a multitude of benefits to both the State and the people.  By opening GMS contracts to all fully qualified and vocationally trained GPs, this is welcome and timely legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on the Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Bill, the Title of which is important.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall.</P>
        <P>It is vital that the health service is undergoing transformation.  People have legitimate concerns regarding the condition of the health service and the type and quality of the health service being provided.</P>
        <P>I welcome the appointment of Deputy Shortall as Minister of State with responsibility for primary care.  Given the importance of her task, she is a critical part of the Government and her appointment demonstrates its commitment to the primary health care of the people.  Speaking as someone who admires the Minister of State, I am thrilled that, given her many years in the House, she has been given this responsibility.  She has the political determination and vision to get the job done with the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  It is important that we pay tribute to her.</P><Col N="257"/>
        <P>It is also important that we support workers in the wider health service and that they see the Government as being willing to embrace change within the service.  As the Minister of State knows, the programme for Government is ambitious, in that we are committed to the development of a single-tier health service, one that guarantees universal access to medical cards based on need, not income.  We must move away from an income-based health model.</P>
        <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick was correct, in that this proposal fulfils our commitment in the EU-IMF memorandum of understanding, but we must put it in context.  Under the memorandum of understanding, the Government will introduce legislative change to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors, including medical services.  It will eliminate restrictions on the number of general practitioners, GPs, qualifying, GPs wishing to treat public patients and advertising.  For these reasons, the Bill is important.  It will provide greater choice, the buzz word in this debate.  Choice is important.</P>
        <P>Equally, the relationship between GP and patient is of critical importance.  As a non-medical cardholder, I have a choice.  I attend my GP because I like, respect and trust him.  He is competent and capable and will look after me.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 1989 agreement with GPs enshrined restrictive practices, closed routes of entry into the general medical services, GMS, scheme and limited the number of GPs who could participate in the scheme.  In effect, it ensured there would be no competition.  A new GP could only participate if a doctor retired, resigned or died, if there was an identified need for an additional doctor, or if a GMS doctor required an assistant.  Even if these criteria were met, the shelter was reinforced by the requirement for the HSE to consider the viability of existing practices.  The interim entry provisions were negotiated in 2009 and further strengthened restrictive practices.  Under the scheme, medical card patients were not allowed to transfer from one GMS doctor to another.  For years the HSE, the Department and the medical profession have worked together in establishing a sheltered environment in which to practise.  Some might say a cartel was in operation.  As much as the doctors themselves, previous Governments were responsible for promulgating restrictive practices.  It is essential that the patient be put at the core of everything we do.  Given that, in this instance, the patient&rsquo;s interests lie in reform, it is important that reforms be enacted.</P>
        <P>The changes will have an immediate impact on approximately 400 practising GPs not currently part of the GMS scheme.  If they so choose, they will allow them to participate in the scheme and access their own GMS lists.  They will also allow doctors working as assistants under the scheme to branch out on their own, further augmenting the themes of change and choice.  The effect of the changes will be increased competition.  The House discussed the Competition (Amendment) Bill this week.  Today, we are discussing legislation that, as the Minister stated at the beginning of the Second Stage debate, will result in medical card and GP-only medical card patients having a greater choice of GPs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The changes to be made under the Bill will benefit newly qualified GPs and those who choose to return from training overseas.  It will immediately make it viable for newly qualified GPs to open practices.  The Minister of State must consider how to reach out so that communities can have a greater choice and the responsibilities thrust upon many hospitals&rsquo; accident and emergency departments can be diminished.  We must move away from the first port of call being an emergency department.  We must teach people that presenting at an emergency department immediately is not necessary in every case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the past six months we have been made acutely aware of the shortage of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs.  The Joint Committee on Health and Children, which I am privileged to Chair, has met all of the interested parties to discuss the reasons for the shortage and how to solve the problem.  Some believe we are only sticking a Band-Aid on it and that we <Col N="258"/>have not addressed the critical issue and prevented a shortage from recurring.  Owing to a lack of training opportunities and career development and advancement options, many doctors trained in Ireland have opted to work abroad.  Many also train abroad.  Eliminatingcertain practices under the GMS scheme will provide an opportunity for more doctors to remain in Ireland.  We want to keep as many doctors as possible here, as Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned.</P>
        <P>For medical card patients, the only way doctors can compete is not through price but through quality of service, having a special relationship built on a caring, competent and professional one-on-one interaction.  The Bill will remove the requirement for the HSE to consider the viability of practices.  It will be for each GP to ensure his or her practice meets the best standards in order that it can attract new patients and expand.  This is a matter of providing for a greater variety of service choices.  I hope the Bill will impact on the charges for private patients.  If doctors open new surgeries to cater for GMS patients, they will also need to attract private patients.  It is important, therefore, that the price issue be tackled by GPs.  I hope pricing, a key issue, can be considered by the House in the future.</P>
        <P>Patient care is important.  We must acknowledge the great work being done by GMS scheme GPs working in communities.  In many cases, they deal with elderly, vulnerable and disadvantaged patients.  How will the umbrella organisations, namely, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and the Medical Council, and vested interests react to the relationships outlined in the Bill?  Is it the case that the representative groups are stating one thing and doing something else?  Are they merely lobbying to protect their members&rsquo; interests, as is their entitlement?  In the overall context of the Bill, it is important that a balanced approach be taken and that there be competition to deliver better outcomes for patients.  The organisations should not use words that could be translated as meaning they opposed the Bill or would not take care of patients.  The IMO and GPs have a great role to play in targeting the delivery of health care services.</P>
        <P>Reform in the wider health sphere is essential.  I hope we will consider the HSE and its role in the outputs of the health service.  Instead of protecting existing practices, we should provide opportunities to be bold, innovative and expansionary and create new partnerships and primary care policies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Health is a reforming doctor and the Minister of State has vision and determination.  Both have knowledge of the GMS scheme and are leading the charge for change.</P>
        <P>In this regard, several key stakeholders who have practical knowledge are willing to embrace change and in this context I hope we will have reform.  It is imperative that we acknowledge that reform of the health service will not happen overnight; it will take time.  The Government has been in office for eight months and has introduced legislation on non-consultant hospital doctors and the Bill before us today dealing with the GP scheme.  The one thing people will not allow is a lack of reform of the Health Service Executive.  They want to see change in the structure and management of our health services and they want that change now.  It is critical that a reforming Minister is given the opportunity to introduce change which will benefit the children in the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery, their parents and their grandparents.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Setting aside the merits of the Bill, it is regrettable that it comes before the Oireachtas at a time when we face a deepening financial crisis which is having serious and far-reaching implications for our health care system.  The main concern is that the most vulnerable people in our communities are those who suffer the most.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My party colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, pointed out that many of our citizens who wish to access the General Medical Services Scheme cannot do so because of the exclusiv<Col N="259"/>ity of the current arrangements.  However, despite the obvious need for change, some in the medical profession want to see the retention of the <i>status quo</i>.  This is unethical and untenable as clearly there are too few GPs overall and too few GPs who have access to GMS contracts which allow them to treat medical card patients.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our health system is failing people throughout the State and nowhere is this more clearly illustrated than in my constituency of Dublin South-West.  For many years Tallaght hospital has been rarely out of the news, unfortunately for all the wrong reasons.  I note in a joint statement issued today that the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, announced a series of initiatives to reform and modernise the governance structures of the hospital.  While I welcome the potential of this announcement, the Minister must also address the years of under-funding of Tallaght hospital which still has a proven track record in providing quality care in the face of almost insurmountable demands and having to function with wholly inadequate resources.  Its management has consistently advised on the staffing and other resources required to rectify obvious imbalances and any restructuring of the management structures at the hospital will make little or no difference if the resources deficit is not corrected to ensure Tallaght hospital operates properly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since it opened in 1998, Tallaght hospital has become the busiest hospital in the State.  In 2010,  its accident and emergency unit treated 93,000 people.  Recent figures obtained from the HSE show that it sees more emergency department attendees, treats more inpatients, and sees in excess of 30% more patients in its outpatient department than the next busiest hospital.  Despite this, it has the fewest numbers of consultant doctors of the four Dublin teaching hospitals and there is also a shortfall on the requisite number of consultants.  This was identified in the hospital review conducted by Dr. Maurice Hayes in September 2010 when he inquired into the issue of radiology and the scandal of unread reports and X-rays.  He reported that relative to other Irish hospitals &ldquo;the degree of understaffing in Tallaght Hospital in 2009 was substantially greater than in the other sampled hospitals&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Tallaght hospital is funded by the HSE to supposedly service a population area of 350,000 when in reality it must service a population of up to 500,000 people.  A breakdown of Dublin hospitals&rsquo; annual financial allocations yields startling figures, with Tallaght hospital&rsquo;s allocation set at &euro;176 million, compared with St. James&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;220 million and a &euro;200 million allocation for St. Vincent&rsquo;s.  This equates to &euro;800 per person in St. James&rsquo;s, &euro;727 in St. Vincent&rsquo;s and &euro;350 in Tallaght.</P>
        <P>Having a properly functioning acute hospital depends on appropriate health service provision in primary care and in continuing non-acute care beds.  It is clear that tremendous challenges face Tallaght hospital and these are further exacerbated by the shortage of GPs servicing local communities compared to other similar areas.  For example, if one compares Galway city and the Tallaght urban areas, both have similar populations of more than 70,000 yet Galway city has more than 40 GPs compared to 26 GPs for Tallaght.  This is significantly below even our poor and low State-wide level of provision and this needs to be examined.</P>
        <P>The absence of an out-of-hours GP on-call system means people have nowhere to turn except Tallaght hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency unit.  This was touched on by other speakers during the debate.  People complain about patients turning up at accident and emergency units but if they have no alternative that is where they will go.  Fettercairn, which is an area in my constituency, has a population of 7,000 people but no GP service is available.  This is a scandal in what is supposed to be a modern country.  Where do people go?  They go to their local hospital.</P>
        <P>In addition to this, the provision of so-called &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; beds for patients who have completed their acute care treatment is very poor in the Dublin south-west region when compared with other catchment areas.  This compounds the problem of, to use the awful expression, <Col N="260"/>&ldquo;blocked beds&rdquo;, adding to long waits for accident and emergency unit admissions and elective procedures which tie up 50 of Tallaght hospital&rsquo;s 640 beds at any time.  We also have the added pressures that will result from the imminent closure of the St. Brigid&rsquo;s Nursing Home in Crooksling which for decades provided highly specialised care for high-dependence patients who suffer from very debilitating illnesses.  It has 89 patients at present and not 80 as was stated in the statement issued by the HSE.  Of these, 65 are high-dependence patients and it is proposed to move them to another site.  However, it will not be suitable for high-dependence patients and another crisis in the system will ensue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Good management and governance are crucial in ensuring patient care but progress can be achieved only if adequate resources are put in place so the hospital and its staff are able to provide the necessary care which is essential for the general wellbeing of our citizens.  As the medical board of the hospital stated, it is not possible to deliver optimum safe care with continually diminishing resources and steadily increasing patient activity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My party supports the Government&rsquo;s commitment to provide, during its term of office, free GP care for all and this is something we have long advocated.  However, like much that has been promised, there is very little tangible evidence that the Government is making good on its pre-election pledges.  This was highlighted by the Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall.  While the Minister of State has acknowledged that there are what she termed &ldquo;blackspots&rdquo;, such as Tallaght, where there is a shortage of GPs, this can be addressed only if effective measures are put in place to improve the present unacceptable situation.  Good planning and good implementation of an effective primary care strategy is needed to ensure that all communities are served equally and that every citizen has access on the basis of need and within reach of where he or she lives.</P>
        <P>I came up with a solution for the situation in Fettercairn.  A Polish doctor, who is a consultant in Tallaght hospital, was willing to work in the area but because of the crazy rules in the medical system on access to medical cards he was not allowed.</P>
        <P>An audit was carried out on the patients in a hospital in Limerick with regard to their needs and background.  We need to look at similar hospitals in Dublin to see why people are coming to the accident and emergency units.  This Bill only addresses one aspect of the problem of primary care delivery.  The system is flawed in so many ways and people&rsquo;s worst fears about December&rsquo;s budget are that things can only go from bad to worse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I remember going to a launch concerning primary care, hospital care and access to doctors in the south west of Dublin.  Where was it held?  In Fettercairn.  I do not know if others can see the irony in launching a primary care programme in the specific area when there is no doctor operating.  I look forward to hearing the comments of the Minister of State in responding to the debate.  I hope the positive elements of this Bill will have a positive effect on patients who have no option but to go to the accident and emergency unit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonHarris"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which is a welcome and important initiative in the development of our community-based health care services.  In the pre-election manifesto of Fine Gael and in that of our colleagues in the Labour Party, we made a commitment to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors and I am pleased to see this commitment is now being honoured with the abolition of the current restrictions on GPs seeking to treat public patients.  As we enter a budgetary process dominated by many difficult decisions imposed by the EU-IMF agreement, this is one of the more welcome elements.</P>
        <P>I believe in a health care system where, in so far as possible, patients can access the care they need in their community.  The roll-out of primary health care services is about much more <Col N="261"/>than the provision of GPs but GPs will have an integral role to play as an element of that service.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the current inequity in the way GMS lists are awarded by the HSE and, in particular, the removal of the requirement that the HSE consider the impact the awarding of a list would have on existing practices within the locality.  All too often, the closed GMS list currently operated by the HSE takes choice from patients.  It is important that any public health service puts patient choice at the centre.  Anybody who has had reason to interact with the health service will recognise it can be a very stressful and frightening time.  Having a GP who one respects and has an ongoing relationship with can be a huge support in such difficult times.  However, the current system works against patients, often requiring them to move to a new GP if they need to access the health care system using a medical card.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is my understanding that this affects primarily two kinds of patients &mdash; the first is those whose circumstances have changed in our challenging economic times and now access their GPs through the public medical card system.  The second is those who qualify for a discretionary card on the basis of a medical diagnosis.  Under the current system, these patients are often required to leave their family doctor, who knows their history and with whom they have built up a rapport, often over years, and to attend a GP holding a GMS list granted by the HSE but who may have no knowledge of, or involvement with, that patient or the family.  This Bill will restore choice to these patients, empowering them to choose who provides their care and to stay with the doctor they know and trust.  This is a welcome development and I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As we move towards a system where more services are based in the community, and are accessed through local GPs, it is vitally important that GPs have the skills and patient knowledge they need to provide the best possible standard of care.  Consequently, we must ensure that the brightest and the best qualifying GPs recognise that there are opportunities for them in Ireland.  At the moment, the system works against young doctors as they are not entitled to treat any public patient until they have a contract with the HSE.  This can take several years to obtain.  The provisions of this Bill are therefore very important in ensuring we have a suitably qualified workforce in place to support the move of services from a hospital setting back into the community.  I welcome the opening of the GMS system to competition as it will make it easier for young, ambitious and talented doctors to establish themselves in Ireland without having to break into existing practices and the closed shop arrangements of the HSE.</P>
        <P>Opening up the area of general practice to increased competition will not just benefit public patients but all users of the service, as GPs will be forced to become more cost effective in the way they run their practices.  They will also have an incentive to provide a wider range of services to their patients.  This will take place hand in hand with the commitment in the programme for Government to deliver universal primary care to patients without any cost barrier and to alleviate the pressure currently seen in our accident and emergency units.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a Deputy representing a constituency with urban and significant rural areas and with many houses and families spread out over a wide geographic area, I am keenly aware of the need to ensure that all residents in my constituency will be able to access the same standard of care.  Anecdotally, I have heard tales of rural practices struggling to attract GPs, either on long-term or short-term contracts, due to the differing requirements of the role, such as the need to make time-consuming house calls in remote areas.  As we move towards a more equitable, but also a more competitive system, we must ensure patients will be able to access the same standard of care regardless of where they live.  We cannot allow a situation to arise where rural residents are deprived of the same standard of care as their urban peers due to urban areas being seen as more profitable.  We cannot have quality health care delivered on the basis of <Col N="262"/>postcode.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, to keep this under consideration as she embarks on playing a major role in the reconfiguration of the health care system.</P>
<P>It is important that we look at the role of the GP in terms of the reconfiguration of the health service. As we move towards providing more services within the community, we must look at other stakeholders and professionals within our health service and the enhanced role they can play.  I refer to community nurses in particular.  In other systems in the EU, many more services are provided by nurses than GPs.  It is a cost-effective way of delivering services and it is a way of recognising the qualifications and training of these health professionals.  It also alleviates pressure on GPs and from an economic and social point of view, it keeps people out of hospitals.</P><P Just="Left">This Government is determined to rectify the mistakes of the previous Government, which threw billions of euro at the health service without delivering any real and meaningful change.  By the end of this term of office, we will be well on our way to delivering free GP care and putting in place the infrastructure for it.  This is an important Bill, which is part of the EU-IMF agreement.  Regardless of that, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party feel strongly about it.  I welcome this legislation and thank the Minister for introducing it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must have a broader discussion about the role of community health care.  This should not just be based on medical cards and doctors and we need to hear details in the coming weeks about our primary care system.  In my constituency, where there has been talk of reconfiguring the hospital service, it is important to show people that we are serious about not only closing existing services based on promises and the nirvana that has not been delivered in the past despite promises and economic wealth.  We need to have our ducks lined up correctly.  Throughout the reconfiguration of our service, we need to make it clear to people that the roll-out of primary care goes hand in hand with reconfiguration.  While the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, is in the Chamber, I stress the need to examine the roll-out of primary care centres.  She has done much work on this.  In my constituency, there are large urban areas such as Bray and Greystones where people are needlessly going to hospitals for services that could be provided at the local level.  This would be beneficial from every point of view, including traffic, the environment, the economy, a sense of community, spin-offs for other GP practices and benefits to doctors.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This is an exciting time to reform the health service.  In the past, increasing the budget has not delivered improvements and better results.  I have seen this in my constituency.  We must reform within a difficult financial situation.  It is difficult to reform when funds are not available given that we must bring people with us.  There is always a fear that the Government will introduce reforms to save money.  We must explain to people that, while change is always difficult, reforms are in their interest.  When this Government leaves office, we will not leave glossy reports on the shelves.  We will have made a real difference to people&rsquo;s lives, which is what I want to see in Bray, Greystones and across my constituency.  This Bill is a start and there is a long way to go.  The Government has been careful to outline that change will not happen overnight.</P>
        <P>It is a process and in that regard this legislation is very much a welcome start.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>As President McAleese takes her leave of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in today, she can be happy that as she says goodbye to her home of the last 14 years, she travels out into a country so much better for her being its President.  Over the years we became accustomed to her warmth, her compassion, her love of life and her approachability.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The facility and fluency she achieved in humanising and personalising the role of the President never, on a single occasion, took from the dignity and solemnity of the office.  Even this alone made her Presidency one to watch.  It is easy to forget that she reared her family while in office.  Her shy young children Emma, SaraMai and Justin, became teenagers, students, graduates.  Her husband, Senator Martin McAleese, was strength itself to the President not only as a loving and supportive husband, but as her engineering partner in the complex business of building bridges.  What they achieved together, with and for communities, was as remarkable as it was brave.  It leaves relations between the peoples of this island on a stronger, warmer and more confident footing. Their work gave us a great gift of insight &mdash; the ability to stand in the other's shoes.  It gives us common territory of the heart and mind, on which we can strike out on new journeys and imagine new possibilities.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">There is so much to say about our exemplary, departing President.  She was there to comfort and reassure in times of crisis.  After the Omagh bombing, she gave calm and eloquent voice to the shock and revulsion of all the peoples of our island.  On 9/11, her words brought the solace and security of home to our Irish family, grief stricken, across the Atlantic.  In every parish across our country, people felt touched and uplifted by the presence of their President.  She had the same beaming smile for everyone.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first among equals, she made equality, real equality, the hallmark of everything she undertook, every community centre she opened and every hostel she visited.  Today, her last official function was to open a Society of St. Vincent de Paul refurbished building for homeless men in Dublin.  It is no surprise that President McAleese chose to spend her last official <Col N="264"/>moments with the marginalised, the excluded, and those who work with them.  It is a testament to the compassion and generosity of her Presidency.</P>
        <P>For me, two of the more recent iconic images come to mind.  Two women, head to toe in black, standing silently beside each other: our President and Queen Elizabeth at the Island of Ireland Peace Park in Messines.  On this, the eve of Armistice Day, it is a good time to say that President McAleese went a long way to fulfilling the dream of the nationalist and proud soldier, Tom Kettle, who died in the Great War.  As he wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">This tragedy of Europe may be, and must be, the prologue to the two reconciliations of which all statesmen have dreamed &mdash; the reconciliation of Protestant Ulster with Ireland, and the reconciliation of lreland with Great Britain.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The second image is that of the Queen of England coming here and the closing of that circle of history.</P>
        <P>At her inauguration in 1997, President McAleese quoted Apollinaire:</P>
        <P LI="1">Come to the edge.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">They said: We are afraid.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Come to the edge, you said.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">They came.  You pushed them and they flew.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I am honoured to offer thanks and congratulations to President Mary McAleese as she completes her 14-year term of office today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the recent presidential election, there was extensive discussion and debate about the Office of President and the desirable attributes in one who holds that office.  In fact, those are things that it is extremely difficult to articulate in an abstract fashion.  The simple truth is that we know a great President when we see one.  It is fair to say that President McAleese was not entirely a household name when she first offered herself for election to her office.  In that election, she won the support of the people of Ireland through her obvious personal qualities, her impressive qualifications, and her message of bridge-building and peace-making.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since that time, she has gone on to win over not just the minds of the Irish people, but also their hearts.  Over 14 years, she has come to be held in the highest esteem by the Irish people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Office of President is hard to define.  A President is as much a moral as a political leader.  A President shares in the good times and is a pillar of support in bad times.  President McAleese was all of these and more.  From the very beginning she made it her mission, in her own words, to build bridges on the island of Ireland.  She made it her particular mission &mdash; assisted by her husband, Senator Martin McAleese &mdash; to establish connections with people in the loyalist community in particular, people who have in the past been alienated, not just from the South, but in some cases from the rest of society in Northern Ireland.  In undertaking this work, the President and Senator McAleese have been prepared to take risks, but they have achieved quite dramatic results.  I pay particular tribute to them today.</P><Col N="265"/>
        <P>It is widely known that President McAleese worked tirelessly to improve relations, not just on a North-South basis but also between Ireland and our nearest neighbour the United Kingdom.  She has spoken in particular of the importance that she attached to the recent and highly successful State visit by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth.  This was a true milestone in the improving and maturing relations between our two countries.</P>
        <P>I understand that Queen Elizabeth has today written to President McAleese, offering her own thanks and congratulations on the occasion of her stepping down from office.  She has recalled with fondness their many meetings, beginning at the Peace Park in Messines and culminating in the recent State Visit.  I believe it fair to say that their joint work has contributed greatly to the huge advances that have been made in Anglo-Irish relations in the past 14 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A President is, quite rightly, referred to as our first citizen.  In a republic all citizens are equal and in this Republic we do not confer titles of nobility on each other.  Yet, we also know that a republic stands or falls on the willingness of individual citizens to serve it.  President McAleese has been a true embodiment of this ideal of public service.  She has been the first citizen, but also the first servant of the people.  I offer her my warmest thanks and congratulations.  I wish her, Martin and their family health and happiness in the years ahead.  Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; le M&aacute;ire Mhic Giolla &Iacute;osa ins na blianta at&aacute; romhainn agus &aacute;r m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas l&eacute;i as a s&aacute;r-obair, as a saothar agus as tortha&iacute; a huachtar&aacute;nachta.</P>

N&iacute;l aon dabht agam ach go mbeidh &aacute;it on&oacute;rach aici i stair na t&iacute;re seo ins na blianta amach romhainn.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Article 15.1.2<sup>o</sup> of the Constitution defines the Oireachtas as consisting of the President, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is, therefore, appropriate that we take time today in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to pay tribute to President Mary McAleese on this her last day in office.  As Ireland&rsquo;s eighth President, she has done an outstanding job and represented the country fantastically well for 14 years.  It is said a week is a long time in politics.  Fourteen years is a significant and lengthy period in any person&rsquo;s life and an extraordinarily long time to dedicate oneself to the role of Ireland&rsquo;s first citizen.</P>
        <P>Mary McAleese is one of only four Presidents, alongside Se&aacute;n T. O&rsquo;Kelly, &Eacute;amon de Valera and Patrick Hillery, to serve two full terms in office.  It is fair to say that during this lengthy period, every day at home and abroad, she has been a President who has made the people proud.  She has carried out her duties wisely and independently, motivated only by her overwhelming commitment to serve the people.  For the skill and warmth she has shown throughout her long tenure in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, she rightly enjoys a special place in the hearts of the people.  Her service to the nation has been immense and her legacy is one of extraordinary public service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are blessed that each of the people who have held the role of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann has distinguished himself or herself and the office he or she has held in trust for the people.  That I believe history may well record Mary McAleese as our finest President underlines the ability she has shown in her time in office.  The country has truly benefited from her Presidency and the contribution she and Senator Martin McAleese have made to Irish society since 1997 has been superb.</P><Col N="266"/>
        <P Just="Left">Mary McAleese&rsquo;s Presidency will forever be synonymous with the cause of peace.  This is appropriate because she was our first President to be born in the North.  She was the first to hail from the historic province of Ulster.  From the outset, she put reconciliation at the heart of her Presidency.  She sought election under the theme of building bridges and she has delivered on this theme spectacularly.  It is important to say this was no easy task.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When Mary McAleese set out on the journey of reconciliation that would define her Presidency, the Good Friday Agreement was not in place and many were sceptical that she would be able to deliver on her pledge to improve relations on this and with the neighbouring island.  Her work and achievements in peace building are a credit to her perseverance, warmth, political skills and judgment.</P>
        <P>Mary McAleese was assisted every step of the way in the work of promoting peace and reconciliation by her husband, Martin.  It is appropriate to acknowledge his energy, determination and wisdom in extending the hand of peace and friendship to so many.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When Minister for Foreign Affairs, I had the pleasure of working closely with President Mary McAleese and Senator Martin McAleese.  I know how valuable the work they have done has been and will prove to be for the development of a shared Ireland beyond conflict.  I was especially struck by the work they did to listen to, understand and reach out to people in the loyalist community.  Prior to Mary McAleese&rsquo;s Presidency, many of the people in question may have had ingrained suspicions, or worse, about people on this side of the Border.  The President has done so much to foster understanding and trust across the island.  Hers has truly been a healing Presidency for which we and all future generations will be grateful.  On behalf of the entire Fianna F&aacute;il organisation and all its members, I thank her sincerely for her tremendous public service on behalf of the people on the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Many say the Presidency is above politics, but that is not the case.  It is a highly political office, but it is removed from party politics.  As a party, Fianna F&aacute;il was proud to nominate Mary McAleese and campaign vigorously for her election in 1997.  We are prouder still of the integrity, independence and impartiality she has shown in office.  Taking the oath of office on 11 November 14 years ago, she pledged to &ldquo;maintain the Constitution of Ireland&rdquo; and dedicate her &ldquo;abilities to the service and welfare of the people of Ireland&rdquo;.  She has faithfully kept that promise.  The Presidency belongs to the people and, by her actions, Mary McAleese, has been the people&rsquo;s President.  She has been inclusive and open and is someone in whom people from all political affiliations and none can share pride and look to for inspiration.</P>
        <P>During the downturn in the country the President has been a voice for community values, civic spirit and solidarity.  She has travelled the length and breadth of the country meeting people and supporting community projects.  She has shone a spotlight on marginalised groups and it is no surprise that one of the final things she will do today as President is to support the homeless in the capital.</P>
        <P>During my time as Minster for Foreign Affairs, on many occasions I had the honour of representing Ireland abroad with President McAleese and can readily testify that as an ambassador for the country, she was passionate and effective.  On trade missions she would come into her own and her presence and diplomatic skills have helped to secure investment and jobs for the people.  It is right that this be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>For many, the highlight of the President&rsquo;s two terms in office was the visit of the British monarch to our shores in March.  This was the culmination of President McAleese&rsquo;s long and dedicated work for reconciliation and a visit the President had hoped for many years would happen.  The credit belongs to her and the then Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen, who had the courage to back his analysis that such a visit was desirable as &ldquo;part of the normal courtesies <Col N="267"/>enjoyed by friendly, neighbouring states.&rdquo;  We cannot ignore our history and long interaction with Britain, nor should we deny people in Northern Ireland the right to identify themselves as being British or Irish, or both.  What is especially positive about Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s visit is the further transformation of relationships between Ireland and Britain as another major step on the journey of reconciliation.  President McAleese has our enduring gratitude for the role she has played in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the visit of the British Queen was a happy day in Mary McAleese&rsquo;s Presidency, there were also dark days, in which the people drew solace from her and the articulate way in which she lifted spirits, expressed our collective hurt and captured the national mood.  I still remember vividly the manner and dignity in which she conducted herself in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing, in addition to the powerful interview she gave following the events of 11 September 2001.  For so many, the Presidency of Mary McAleese has meant so much in so many ways.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank President Mary McAleese for her distinguished service to the nation.  She has worked tirelessly and diligently on the people&rsquo;s behalf and we all wish her well in her new life as a private citizen.  In addition to extending my gratitude to President McAleese and Martin, I acknowledge the contribution made by the President&rsquo;s children, Emma, SaraMai and Justin.  I wish all of the McAleese family success and continued health and happiness in life beyond the gates of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith acu.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ar son fhoireann Shinn F&eacute;in san Oireachtas agus san Tion&oacute;l sa Tuaisceart, ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le hUachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, M&aacute;ire Mhic Giolla &Iacute;osa, as an s&aacute;r-obair at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aice le 14 bliain anuas.  Inniu a l&aacute; deireanach in oifig an Uachtar&aacute;in agus is maith an rud go bhfuil an t-&oacute;m&oacute;s seo &aacute; thabhairt againn di agus d&aacute; fear c&eacute;ile, Martin.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Oireachtas Members and our party representatives across the island, I express our gratitude to the outgoing President, Mary McAleese, for her 14 years of service as Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann.  This is her last day in office and it is fitting that we should mark the occasion with some words of thanks in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Mary McAleese will be remembered as a President who made a very significant, long-term and consistent contribution to the building of lasting peace and true reconciliation in Ireland.  She came to office in 1997 when the peace process was at an early and very delicate stage.  The Good Friday Agreement was yet to be negotiated.  When that Agreement was reached it was followed by months and years of delay, doubt and, at times, despair.  Many doubted that it could be made to work.  However, through persistence and patience it did work.  It has been implemented and huge advances have been made away from conflict and inequality and towards lasting peace and equality.  Society in the Six Counties has been transformed and the whole island of Ireland has benefited.</P>
        <P>If the peace process could be compared to a tapestry, one of the brightest threads running through it would be the role of President Mary McAleese and her husband Martin McAleese.  They consistently championed the potential of a new dispensation on this island.  They worked in a very special way for reconciliation between the diverse traditions in Ireland.  They undoubtedly made a significant contribution to mutual understanding.  They helped to make dialogue a reality, encouraging communities in the North to engage as never before.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As she came from the North President McAleese brought an understanding and a personal commitment to the work of peace and national reconciliation.  She was a President of the Irish nation, as defined in Article 2 of the Constitution which states: &ldquo;It is the entitlement and birthright of every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and [territorial] seas, to be part of the Irish nation.&rdquo;  During the presidential election there were some <Col N="268"/>who lost sight of that article.  For them, a permanent mist has descended on a part of our island and of our nation.  There were some who continued to display the type of mindset that in 1997 called the then presidential candidate, Mary McAleese, a &ldquo;sectarian time bomb&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The outgoing President and her husband proved them wrong a thousand times over in a Presidency that encompassed all of our island and all of our people.  President McAleese embraced the marginalised and those who were discriminated against.  She learned and used the Irish language while in office and she represented the nation abroad in an exemplary fashion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ar &aacute;r son uile, gabhaimid bu&iacute;ochas l&eacute;i agus guimid gach rath ar obair an Uachtar&aacute;in nua, Miche&aacute;l D. &Oacute; hUiginn.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I wish to share time with Deputies Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan and Mattie McGrath.</P>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for this opportunity to pay tribute to the great work of President Mary McAleese on her last day as President of this country.  She has served her country well for 14 magnificent years.  She is a person of great courage, integrity and a President who reached out and built many bridges with all of our people on the island.  That was the constant theme during her 14 years as President.  She has helped us all to come on a long journey.  The regular contribution of our President during the past number of years has been to reach out to the marginalised, bringing people, North and South, together, particularly cross-party.  She was also a magnificent woman in reaching out to people with disabilities, particularly people with intellectual disabilities.  She had 14 years of opening the &Aacute;ras to bring in people with disabilities and many of other marginalised groups.  I commend and thank her for that.</P>
        <P>It is important in paying tribute that we also say to Mary McAleese: &ldquo;we thank you for helping us all to try to build a democratic, inclusive country&rdquo;.  That is something we all needed, and a vision I have always had.  I always wanted a President who would bring Catholic, Protestant, dissenter, Hindu, Muslim, Jew and non-believers together, celebrating diversity and accommodating difference.  That is what Mary McAleese did during the past 14 years, for which I commend her.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mary McAleese has spent her time as President building bridges and reaching out to the opposite side of the community.  We have a duty as Members of this House to continue on that journey to reach out and break down barriers, particularly to reach out to people who are on the opposite side of the fence and to many people with whom we would strongly disagree.  Many bridges have to be built and we have to try to do our best to end political exclusion.  That to me was also a theme of Mary McAleese.  I encourage all of our people to carry on that tradition and the great vision of President Mary McAleese.</P>
        <P>I pay special tribute to her husband, Martin, for his own great peace work and particularly in reaching out to the loyalist and Unionist communities.  This type of peace-building is at times not very popular or trendy but when good people do it and they deliver all of us have a duty to acknowledge and respect that.  However, there is also a lesson in that.  We need to get balance and to ensure that all of us are fair to all of the people directly affected by the conflict on this island.  That is something we, as Members of the Oireachtas, need to do.</P>
        <P>I welcome this opportunity to congratulate Mary McAleese on her 14 wonderful years and I wish her, Martin and their family the best of luck in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are so conscious today of restraints, budgetary requirements, cuts and so on that I know people are questioning if the Office of the President is cost <Col N="269"/>effective, of any use, whether it makes a difference and should we be considering its abolition.  A viciousness was brought into the recent campaigns for the Presidency with which we could have very much done without.  We do not need that kind of thing to uncover the truth.  On the question of whether the Presidency makes a difference, going back to our first President, Douglas Hyde, we can say that each of our Presidents, in his or her own different way, has made a major contribution to Irish society.</P>
        <P>President McAleese and her family and their residency, &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, are in the constituency of Dublin Central which I represent, so there is an added poignancy to today.  We also very much appreciated the fact that she took time to come to the removal of the late Tony Gregory two years ago.</P>
        <P>I read the article by the northern editor in yesterday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times </i> in which he looked at her role in terms of the North and reminded us of the abusive comments she had to put up with in the beginning of her term as President and yet by the time she was finishing her term of office she had won so much respect from so many Unionists in the North, and that is a considerable achievement.  The one quality that is very obvious is her perseverance and that she did not give up no matter what was being thrown at her.</P>
        <P Just="Left">She understood the complexity of the North because she came from there.  She spoke this morning at an event for the homeless about how she knew what it was like to be homeless.  I look at her as a bridge builder and as a person with a great sense of humanity.  In that article yesterday, which was wonderful and worth quoting, the northern editor wrote that she felt it was important to say the gentle word and the healing word instead of the bitter world.  That sort of legacy is wonderful.</P>
        <P>I was at an event this morning with marginalised people launching a drugs programme in the north inner city and I listened to the President on radio.  She was talking about where she was, which was at a shelter for homeless men.  That, to me, is what she is all about.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am also struck by the difference between a President like her and royalty.  Looking at pictures of her at the time of the Omagh bombing and at other events, she was able to go out and put her arms around people, shake their hands and she had that common, human touch that so many members of the royalty do not have.</P>
        <P>She made mistakes and that is wonderful.  She made comments and did things that people did not like and that also showed her humanity.  To use an inversion of the phrase &ldquo;behind every great man there is a great woman&rdquo;, in her case, behind this great woman there was a great man.</P>
        <P>I finish with words that were used here on another occasion long before my time by a person who said he had done the State some service.  President McAleese has done the State some service.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; m&eacute; an-bhu&iacute;och as an seans seo chun c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; mar gheall ar sh&aacute;r-obair an &Uacute;achtar&aacute;in, Mh&aacute;ire Mhic Giolla &Iacute;osa.  I am privileged to speak about the outgoing President, Mary McAleese.  Article 15.1 of the Constitution deals with the Oireachtas and the Office of the Presidency.</P>
        <P>Even though 14 years is a long time, every minute of the President&rsquo;s tenure has been spent tirelessly working at home and abroad on behalf of Irish people.  She shone a beacon of light on all that is good about Ireland and the Irish people.  She encouraged and supported the efforts of people in every community in these 32 counties.  One of her greatest strengths was the way she made herself available to perform a wide range of functions, whether the opening of community halls or voluntary housing schemes, officiating at all-Ireland matches or supporting services for the needy.  She supported and encouraged the volunteer groups without which <Col N="270"/>our country would be much worse off.  I am sure our next President will do likewise and I wish him well in his new role.</P>
        <P>Her greatest achievement was on the peace process, on which she worked with her husband, Senator McAleese.  I acknowledge the Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision to appoint Martin McAleese to the Seanad and I look forward to working with him when he fully takes up his responsibilities.  They broke down barriers and built trust between communities.  She defied the comments that were made against her during her election campaign and proved her detractors wrong.</P>
        <P>Two delegations from the Northern Ireland Assembly visited the Houses of the Oireachtas this morning.  History will be kind to the President and her husband.  Whether she remains in a public role or resumes private life, she will be a good ambassador for her country.  I wish the President, her husband and her three children a long and fruitful life.  They can look with pride on the contribution she made to this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatrickNulty"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick Nulty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to address the urgent matter of Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown which serves 331,000 people.  There are some 35,000 attendances at the emergency department each year and I welcome the commitments given a couple of weeks ago by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, that the Government will retain a 24-hour full service at the accident and emergency department.</P>
        <P>However, services in the hospital are under pressure and I call for a resolution of this issue.  Last January, 32 beds were closed in Connolly Hospital and that number has now risen to 44.  The total number of closed beds in our health service has spiralled and on 11 October last there were over 2,000 hospital beds closed throughout the Republic.  A recent review conducted by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, revealed high levels of overcrowding in our emergency departments.  The record numbers of people waiting on trolleys is the result of cuts in services, reducing the number of long-term care beds and increasing the volume of acute bed closures.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has implemented a number of measures to achieve so-called savings in Connolly Hospital.  First, there has been a reduction in the use of agency staff and overtime hours.  Second, the surgical day ward was temporarily closed and re-opened with eight places rather than 24.  This ward will close fully again for three weeks from 19 December.  The result of these reductions and bed and ward closures is increased waiting lists, growing numbers of patients on trolleys and an increased risk of the spread of infectious diseases.</P>
        <P>The implementation of crude cuts and financial controls by HSE management is pushing services in Connolly Hospital and other hospitals to the brink.  The decision to implement these cuts as we head into winter, when demand for hospital beds and services is at its highest, undermines the capacity of our health care professionals to deliver a fair, safe and efficient service.  A recent report published by the Think Tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, showed that access to health care and life expectancy is determined by class and social background.  An immediate and urgent strategy is required to eliminate the inequalities in life expectancy that exist in Ireland today.  The first part of such a strategy must be to halt the implementation of crude cuts and closures in our health care system.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the people who loaned me their vote and sent me to Leinster House, I call for the lifting of the recruitment embargo by the HSE.  In Connolly Hospital, for example, 50 nurses have been taken off the roster, with the gaps being filled by agency work and overtime.  This is not providing value for money.  We must review that policy if savings are not being made, as well as the impact on patients.  I also call for the opening of closed beds and hospital wards and for emergency funding for Connolly Hospital through the winter.  A guarantee must be provided that full accident and emergency services will be retained in the future.  I welcome the previous assurances and I hope to receive them again today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue on which I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.</P><Col N="272"/>
        <P Just="Left">Connolly Hospital is an academic teaching hospital which provides a full range of acute services, including a 24-hour accident and emergency department.  It serves a catchment population of 331,000.  Multidisciplinary teams of medical, nursing and allied health professionals, as well as management and general support staff, play a pivotal role in the development, delivery, monitoring and evaluation of these services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The efficiency of all services is being reviewed by the HSE in view of the current budgetary and financial position.  The Minister for Health has emphasised to the HSE that budgetary compliance must be maintained with the delivery of service levels set out in the national service plan.  Activity and expenditure at Connolly Hospital are ahead of the levels approved in the 2011 national service plan.  A comprehensive review of services at the hospital has been undertaken by the HSE and hospital management, and certain measures have been taken as a consequence of this review.  These include a reduction in the use of agency staff and overtime hours and some limited bed closures.  The latter measures include the temporary closure in the latter quarter of the year, for two short periods, of the surgical day ward.  There will also be a limited reduction from 24 to eight places in the surgical day ward from early November.  In addition, there are currently 24 acute inpatient beds closed in Connolly Hospital, although it is planned to open these beds where feasible to relieve specific pressures during peak times over the winter period.  Two of the 11 critical care beds at the hospital are also closed but are being utilised when they are clinically required.</P>
        <P>Deputy Nulty, being a new Member, might not know this but usually the ministerial reply on a topical issue debate is circulated when the Minister stands to speak.  The copies of my reply have not yet arrived but the Deputy will receive one.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Deputy on his recent victory in the election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do likewise.  The copies of the reply are on the way to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Good.  I was anxious to let the Deputy know.</P>
        <P>The Minister has made it a priority to unblock access to acute services in our hospitals by improving the patient flow through the system.  Access to services is not about bed numbers <i>per se</i> but is about how the bed capacity in a hospital is managed to maximise throughput and provide safe and quality care to patients.  This can be seen in the variations in performance in hospitals across the country.</P>
        <P>The special delivery unit, SDU, which was established by the Minister in June this year, is focusing on these issues.  The SDU is in the process of establishing an infrastructure based on information collection and analysis, hospital by hospital, in order to ascertain what is happening in real time.  It provides information tools for hospital managers, including clinical managers, to map and measure bed capacity in their hospitals depending on variations in, for example, the average length of stay of patients.  This will allow the Department to begin to embed performance management in the system, to manage bed capacity and to sustain shorter waiting times.</P>
        <P>In principle, opening additional beds is not a panacea to resolve the difficulties in the hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should conclude shortly as we must move on.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="273"/>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude.  The entire reply will be included in the Official Report and will be supplied to Deputy Nulty.  I again congratulate the Deputy on his election.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>In the absence of real and sustained change in how the existing capacity is managed, additional beds will be quickly absorbed without any net gain for patients.  The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  The SDU&rsquo;s initial focus is on emergency departments and it will work to support hospitals in addressing excessive waiting times for admission to hospital.</P>
        <P>As part of the process of forming the overall picture of the emergency departments situation nationally, the SDU has identified 15 hospitals, which between them account for 80% of the trolley wait problem in the hospital system and of which Connolly Hospital is one.  Liaison officers from the SDU are working proactively to support these sites including Connolly Hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister also has agreed that some additional funding may be provided, on a strictly one-off basis, based on specific proposals from the hospitals to reduce waiting times.  Adherence to the agreed criteria will be closely monitored by the SDU.  The SDU is currently examining a plan for some additional funding for Connolly Hospital.  Where this type of support has been provided elsewhere it has been on the strict understanding that it will only be released to hospitals where the specific performance measures and specified conditions have been met.</P>
        <P>The conditions and performance measures which hospitals must meet are as follows: for the remainder of the year and throughout January 2012, no patient will wait more than 23 hours in the hospital&rsquo;s emergency department.  In addition, the trolley wait target must be maintained at least 70% below the maximum daily trolley count since January 2010.  Other conditions or performance measures include seven-day ward discharge rounds, achievement of all acute medicine programme milestones and implementation of approved measures to stream elderly patients effectively.  For the plan from Connolly Hospital to be seriously considered, it must convince the SDU that hospital management, by which I also mean clinical management, is fully signed up to the kind of performance measures needed to deliver real change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickNulty"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick Nulty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I commend the Minister of State on the fantastic work she is doing in the areas of disability and mental health.  She is dealing with serious issues under difficult circumstances.</P>
	<P Just="Left">To return to the issue under discussion, the manner in which the moratorium is being operated must be examined.  The argument is that the moratorium will provide savings.  However, as frontline staff are being replaced with agency workers and through overtime, I do not believe it provides savings to the Exchequer.  Therefore, a pragmatic approach should be taken, particularly in respect of frontline services such as health, whereby frontline staff who need to be replaced should be replaced in the conventional way.</P>
        <P>In addition, while I agree beds constitute just one aspect of the delivery of quality health care, it is an important aspect.  In the health sector, both patient care and value for money are crucial but ensuring an adequate throughput of patients requires staff and requires beds to be open and operational, particularly in winter.  Consequently, I ask that funding to ensure the operation of Connolly Hospital at an appropriate and high quality level be assured over the winter and that the accident and emergency unit, which serves 330,000 people, will be secured.  I thank the Minister of State for her response.</P>

In addition, I note the Minister is not averse to providing additional one-off funding to ensure the waiting times in Connolly Hospital are reduced.  Moreover, he is committed to ensuring the lengthy stays on trolleys seen in the past of people who are ill will be greatly reduced.  However, as the <Col N="274"/>Deputy is aware, it is not always about care but sometimes relates to something more fundamental, namely, structure and management.  This is a longer term goal even though I do not believe we have the time to wait and must act more urgently.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of the report of the national registry of deliberate self harm, which is under the auspices of the National Suicide Research Foundation, on the level of attempted suicide and self-harming 2010.  Last year, 11,966 presentations, involving 9,630 individuals, were made to hospitals due to deliberate self-harming.  Taking the population into account, the age-standardised rate of individuals presenting to hospitals following deliberate self-harm in 2010 marked a significant 4% increase over the rate for 2009.  Moreover, it constituted the fourth successive increase in the national rate of hospital-treated deliberate self harm.  In 2010, the male rate of deliberate self-harm was 4% higher than was the case in 2009.  This again is the fourth successive year in which male deliberate self-harm increased, and the female rate also increased by 4%.</P>
        <P>The economic recession is likely to be a key contributor to the recent increases in hospital-related deliberate self-harm.  Since 2007, that is, the year before the onset of the recession, the report states the male rate in deliberate self-harming presenting at accident and emergency units has increased by 27%, while the equivalent increase in female rates is 7%.  While there is a number of notable changes in the deliberate self-harming rate between 2009 and 2010, the most striking one concerns the 20 to 24 age group.  The rate for men in the aforementioned age group increased by 19% from 2009 to 2010, while the rate for women increased by 30%.</P>
        <P>This reveals how significant is the increase in attempted suicide and deliberate self-harming that is developing.  This issue is somewhat under the radar and I have been trying to raise it for six weeks.  However, I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office received 27 requests today and perhaps this issue is not topical.  My purpose in introducing this issue is to make it topical.  There also is a widespread variation in the male and female rates when examined by city and county.  The lowest rates for females was recorded in County Leitrim, while the highest was in Limerick city.  Relative to the national rate, a high rate of deliberate self-harm was recorded for male and female city residents, as well as men living in Sligo and women living in Longford, north Tipperary and south Dublin.  I ask the Minister to look at some of the most common methods, because this is the key to involvement in this regard.  Finally, the director of the National Suicide Research Foundation, Dr. Ella Arensman, and international research have shown that for each person who presents at an accident and emergency unit having deliberately self-harmed, at least six to seven others who self-harm do not present to such units.  They present to their general practitioners, who do not report it at all, their families hide it because of the stigma or such people may not even report it to their own families.  On that basis, between 70,000 and 80,000 people each year are deliberately self-harming in Ireland and this is a serious issue that must first be recognised by society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this important issue.  It is not the first time he has done so and given his commitment to the subject, I dare say it will not be his last.  At the outset, I note that just this morning, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and I launched a leaflet on behalf of Shine and the IFA in respect of farm stress.  While one sometimes is inclined to think of this issue as only pertaining to one particular group, it affects everyone in all sectors of society.</P>
        <P>Over the years, all Members have been aware of deliberate self-harm but few realised the extent of the problem.  It is difficult to imagine that 9,630 individuals, representing 11,966 pres<Col N="275"/>entations, presented to emergency departments in 2010 having self-harmed.  It also is worrying that one fifth of all deliberate self-harm presentations were due to repeated acts.  It also is important to recognise the aforementioned figures do not include those who engage in self-harm but who never present to an emergency department.  Deliberate self-harm is a serious issue and it is hard for many people to understand the despair of a person who engages in deliberate self-injury.  International studies have found self-injury to be one of the most significant risk factors associated with suicide and those who engage in self-harm are 20 times more likely to die by suicide eventually.  Moreover, studies have shown that at least one third of all suicides have a history of self-injury.  I believe early intervention with people who engage in deliberate self-harm would prevent some people from continuing to self-harm and could prevent some deaths by suicide.  Several initiatives are ongoing and in development that take account of the recommendations of the recently published national registry of deliberate self harm report for 2010.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, is working to progress a more unified and consistent response to self-harm presentations in emergency departments.  A self-harm awareness training programme is also being developed which will be rolled out nationally in the coming years, beginning next year.  The HSE clinical care national lead on mental health is working with key stakeholders to develop a uniform approach to self-harm assessments in emergency departments in order that all those who present will receive the most appropriate care and treatment.  In addition, a pilot project is under way in the Cork Hospital Group to train all appropriate clinical staff in self-harm and suicide management and it is planned that in due course this will be rolled out to other hospitals.  The NOSP has also funded a number of suicide community assessment nurses, SCAN, who work primarily with GPs to provide early intervention services for clients in suicidal crisis and thus avoid admission to hospital.  A number of voluntary organisations also provide services for those who self-harm.</P>
        <P>The total annual funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives is in the region of &euro;9 million.  This includes the annual budget of &euro;4.1 million for the national office, with the balance of &euro;5 million used to fund resource officers for suicide prevention, self-harm nurses in hospital emergency departments and the development of local suicide prevention initiatives.  The additional &euro;1 million provided for the national office this year is being used to develop the number and range of training and awareness programmes, improve and standardise the response to deliberate self-harm, develop the capacity of GPs to respond to suicidal behaviour and ensure helpline supports for those in emotional distress are co-ordinated and widely publicised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge there is great commitment in many sectors to tackle this serious health and social issue.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of mental health services in line with A Vision for Change and Reach Out was clearly shown in the programme for Government which provides for the ring-fencing of &euro;35 million annually within the overall health budget to develop community mental health services, ensure early access to more appropriate services for adults and children and implement Reach Out, the suicide strategy within A Vision for Change.  We must all continue to work together &mdash; researchers, policy makers and service providers &mdash; to identify people at risk and ensure appropriate services are in place to provide the help and support needed.  Everybody recognises that this is a crisis issue within communities and the Government will do its very best to address it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment and again welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment two weeks ago to ring-fence &euro;35 million annually within the overall <Col N="276"/>health budget to develop community mental health services in line with A Vision for Change, a vital issue in the development of the mental health services.</P>
        <P>The National Office for Suicide Prevention has asked that priority be given to effective interventions at multiple levels, including the early identification of people at risk of self-harm by introducing evidence-based depression, self-harm and suicide awareness and skills training for professionals working in health care and community based services.  It is also recommended that we seek to prevent repeated self-harm by introducing uniform procedures for assessment and the after-care of deliberate self-harm patients presenting at hospital emergency departments.  In order to deal effectively with the needs of deliberate self-harm patients following discharge from hospital, it is recommended that a wider range of evidence-based treatment programmes should be made available for this high risk group, the focus on which is vital.  I have seen programmes in other countries for this group of people who are discharged from hospital.  It is vital to inform the general public about the symptoms of depression, warning signs of suicidal behaviour and relevant help services through positive mental health promotion campaigns.  While there have been some such campaigns, the issue of promoting mental health awareness and de-stigmatising mental illness has to be re-examined because it is vital that we tackle the very serious issue of attempted suicide, deliberate self-harm and completedsuicide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot disagree with anything the Deputy said.  This is a crucial group, one we have identified.  There are, of course, others within the group who never come to the attention of the medical profession, but, nevertheless, it is an issue about which we will have to do something very quickly.  The training programmes we are rolling out, including the pilot programme in Cork, will give us the expertise we need both to identify and treat patients.  I could not agree with the Deputy more that when people are released from care and discharged back into the community, follow-up, if only a telephone call to have someone to make that connection, is vital.  We simply cannot abandon people as soon as they are discharged from care because, clearly, they are in distress or they would not have been admitted to the service in the first place.  We hope the &euro;35 million which the Taoiseach has guaranteed us will be available from the health budget will be used to put in place the people we need to deliver this service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelHarrington"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Harrington</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic for debate as it is of vital importance to the 125 residents of Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire &mdash; Cape Clear island &mdash; in going about their daily work.  There is a huge problem in that the Bull&rsquo;s Nose pier at Tr&aacute; Ciar&aacute;n in the north harbour has been battered by the sea since it was built during the Famine.  It is in danger of collapsing and blocking the harbour to all navigation, thereby closing this gateway for the 125 residents and almost 120,000 visitors who visit the island every year.  If the phrase &ldquo;a stich in time saves nine&rdquo; was ever applicable, it is in this case.  The pier is in urgent need of remedial works, as it is the gateway for an industrious and hardworking population who, since the fourth century, have made mammoth efforts to combat their remoteness eight miles into the Atlantic &mdash; Ireland&rsquo;s most southerly point.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his attendance.  I know he has a comprehensive interest in and deep knowledge of marine and maritime affairs and is very familiar with this pier.  The problem is that if this pier, one of three in the north harbour, collapses, it will totally block access to the other two piers and effectively close the island to the outside world.  The pier acts as a breakwater for the rest of the harbour and has already been deemed to be unsafe since the late <Col N="277"/>1990s, when severe and deep cracks appeared in the concrete capping on the original pier in the 1920s.  Berthing at the pier has been prohibited for some time.</P>
        <P>The pier which is only 20 m in length has four major cracks which run the length of the pier and has been the subject of different studies and reports since 1997.  In fact, I was informed only this morning that further studies were being carried out by UCC to examine the swell and wave heights at the pier.  There is a tidal difference of at least 3 m at the harbour walls.  While I accept these studies have to be carried out, it is 14 years since the first one began.  Efforts were made to patch the pier at the turn of the century by pouring concrete into the cracks, but this work was immediately stopped when the concrete, unfortunately, ran straight into the sea.</P>
        <P>The people of Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire desperately need decisive action to be taken to secure the pier for the foreseeable future by the completion of the studies and the putting in place of a plan to conclude the work required.  I note that yesterday the Government launched its website to prepare the population for possible severe winter weather.  If this pier was to collapse at this time of the year, it might well be May or June of the following year before construction equipment or materials could be brought onto the island to undertake the necessary repair work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been significant investment on our islands in recent years.  They are one of our greatest resources.  Off the west Cork coast there are seven inhabited islands, each of which has massive tourism potential and a resilient and hard-working native population that fights in challenging times to maintain the island way of life.  I compliment the work of Cork County Council, through the county development board, which has focused as a priority on these islands off the west Cork coast in recent years and adopted an inter-agency islands strategy to deal with the problems they face.  I earnestly ask the Minister to support this issue on Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire and to help to resolve this engineering issue, which is a terrifying prospect for local people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I know the island and the pier well.  I have visited every year for the past 15 years and, therefore, I am aware of the issue raised by the Deputy.  I accept this is an issue of concern.  The maintenance and development of the harbour at Cape Clear Island is my responsibility and that of my Department.  The main portion of the harbour was constructed in the mid-1800s and it is of masonry construction.  In the early 1900s, there were further works consisting of an inner harbour cross wall with entrance and booms at one end.  Repairs and improvements to the harbour walls and deepening of the inner harbour were carried out under the Marine Works (Ireland) Act 1902.  The layout of Cape Clear Harbour has remained substantially unchanged since these works.</P>
        <P>The various bodies charged with responsibility for the harbour have carried out significant works over the years to preserve its fabric.  In 2005, my Department carried out major works at a cost of &euro;870,000 to refurbish and stabilise the main pier, known as Duffy&rsquo;s Pier, which is on the left hand side as one enters.  This is used by ferry services as the main landing pier for the island and it is currently in a safe structural condition.  My Department has set aside an annual budget for maintenance and safety works at Cape Clear with annual outturns in the years 2008 to 2010 of &euro;30,000, &euro;43,000 and &euro;28,000, respectively, and an allocation of &euro;30,000 for 2011.  A number of studies were also carried out at a cost in excess of &euro;50,000 between 2008 and 2010.</P>
        <P>Two matters are a cause for serious concern.  The first relates to the penetration of large waves into the harbour during storms which render the harbour unusable.  During these events, all boats retreat in to the inner harbour, which is then sealed by means of wooden booms put in place by a crane.  The second concern relates to the deterioration of the outer end of the main harbour breakwater, which is referred to as the Bull&rsquo;s Nose and which has been exhibiting signs of stress and deterioration for years.  This has manifested in several large cracks in the <Col N="278"/>sides and surface of the structure.  Repair works were carried out in 1999 but do not appear to have been successful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department has been monitoring the Bull&rsquo;s Nose structure since 2006 and has noted a slow but steady deterioration.  In 2009, it took the precautionary step of closing access to, and prohibiting berthing at, the Bull&rsquo;s Nose.  Berthing and unloading of goods and passengers can continue at the main landing pier.  In recent years, the Department has undertaken extensive measurements and analysis of wave conditions at Cape Clear Harbour.  It is clear from this work that wave conditions are complex and the issue of wave penetration into the harbour does not present a ready or obvious solution.</P>
        <P>With regard to the stability of the Bull&rsquo;s Nose, the Department appointed consulting engineers in 2010 to report on the condition of the structure and to prepare a detailed design for the construction of a new or modified structure.  The consultants&rsquo; terms of reference stated that cognisance should be taken of the information available on the wave conditions and access problems at this harbour and, rather than reconstructing the Bull&rsquo;s Nose as it currently exists, should make provision in whatever way could reasonably be made for further works to improve access to the harbour.  During their work, the consultants retained specialist hydraulic consultants from the Netherlands and University College Cork to provide detailed advice on the storm wave aspects of their evolving design.  A report has been received from the consultants, which is being reviewed by and discussed with the Department&rsquo;s engineers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelHarrington"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Harrington</NameTxt>
	<P>I sincerely thank the Minister for his reply.  However, the islanders need to know when the necessary remedial works will start, how long they will take, when the pier will be made safe and when it will reopen for berthing.  I acknowledge the Minister may not have the answers to these questions in his brief but I ask him to provide the answers over the coming weeks.  The pier was originally constructed during the Famine.  We have had years of studies of wave movements, swells and tides by scientists, engineers and departmental officials and the islanders feel it is time to make a decision on what is to be done while acknowledging it is a historical pier, which was built 160 years ago.  The islanders at that time invested in the structure to make the harbour safe.  The officials need to reflect on that and focus on coming to a decision on how this issue can be progressed on the basis of the studies they have conducted.  It is frustrating for the islanders to have to wait for further studies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The islanders will not have to wait for further studies as the studies have been carried out.  We are examining the conclusions of the consultants which provide an expensive six options.  The cost ranges from &euro;750,000 to &euro;20 million.  There is no easy, quick fix, cheap solution to this.  However, there is a concern that the Bull&rsquo;s Nose is unstable and could collapse at any time, as the Deputy has pointed out.  He is correct to raise this issue, as are the islanders.  I will give an assurance that we will try to make this project a priority.  I face budgetary constraints in making commitments.  This is not a case of making a decision and paying out the money; I must find the money.  People will be aware following the announcement at midday today of the limitations on capital expenditure faced by all Departments over the next five years.  However, we have a responsibility to make this harbour safe.  It is not a safe harbour in certain conditions and we need to improve that situation if we can while solving the structural problems at the Bull&rsquo;s Nose, which is now a breakwater rather than a pier.</P>
        <P>This is not the first time this issue has been raised and I have spoken to the Deputy about this previously.  He is correct to keep raising it and to keep the pressure on.  I will try to respond as quickly as possible and in as comprehensive a way as is possible and affordable in the current climate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this most important issue and I welcome the Minister to the House to respond.</P>
        <P>Over the past few weeks, the communities of north County Dublin have mobilised in an unprecedented manner to voice their resounding opposition to the proposed monster sewage treatment plant planned for the area.  Fingal County Council, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, has nominated nine potential sites in the townlands of north County Dublin for the plant.  These sites are within a short distance of the heavily populated towns of Lusk, Rush, Swords, Loughshinny, Skerries, Ballyboughal and the Naul.  Essentially, every town and village in Fingal is now living with the threat of having a monster sewage treatment plant constructed within its environs.  We have had public meetings in Lusk, Rush and Loughshinny.  Tonight I will be in Ballyboughal and I will attend meetings in Swords and Skerries next week.  These were not poorly attended public meetings.  There were hundreds of people in attendance with standing room only and people spilling out into corridors.  Last Saturday, so many people turned up to voice their disapproval at the plans at Fingal County Council&rsquo;s open day for the project that the council had to put stewards in place to manage the crowd.  Taken together, this demonstrates a collective rejection of this proposal by the people in north Dublin who I represent.</P>
        <P>Why are the people so understandably outraged?  There are very valid environmental considerations.  The proposed monster sewage treatment plant would process up to 1,000 litres of sewage per minute from Dublin and surrounding counties.  This is similar to the capacity of the Ringsend plant in Dublin.  The negative impact that the Ringsend plant has had on the environment of the surrounding landscape and seascape in Dublin Bay has been well documented.  The traffic created by the construction of a monster plant in north Dublin would be intolerable on the rural roads of the region.  The traffic caused by the removal of the solid waste sludge from the plant once it is up and running, with some estimates stating it would require 40 trucks per hour, is also of major concern.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must not forget that north County Dublin is a combination of towns and large rural areas which grow fruit, vegetables and flowers.  Fingal is the market garden of Ireland, with 60% of our horticulture produce being grown in the area.  To quote one constituent of mine who wished to have her objection read into the public record, &ldquo;Who would buy food grown near a monster sewage plant?&rdquo;  This is a valid point and needs to be reflected upon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">North County Dublin has taken more than its fair share of projects which have had negative environmental impacts.  Balleally landfill near Lusk and Rush has taken the waste of greater Dublin for almost 40 years.  The Nevitt super-dump planned for the same area hangs threateningly over both communities.  The EirGrid east-west interconnector which makes landfall in Rush has and is causing upset for that community.  The sub-sea gas interconnector between Loughshinny and Moffat in Scotland has caused untold problems for the people of Loughshinny.</P>
        <P>Fingal is lacking in so much, with inadequate water infrastructure and public transport systems and today we heard that metro north has just been deferred.  We need infrastructure which has a net positive effect on the region rather than just being the dumping ground for the State&rsquo;s problem projects.  I stood with the people of Portrane and Donabate when this idea was earmarked for that area and I stand with all the people of north Dublin who oppose this proposal now.  It is a costly plan, it is an environmentally negative plan, it is a flawed plan and most importantly, it is a bad plan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Government was elected to bring fresh ideas and impetus to this country.  I ask the Minister, with his responsibility for the environment, to revisit this proposal with a view to <Col N="280"/>examining alternative approaches thoroughly, including the possibility of smaller treatment plants to cope with the waste from smaller clusters of towns.  A good example is the Portrane plant which will deal with the sewage needs of Portrane, Donabate, Lusk, Rush and Loughshinny.  People will accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this issue for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, who apologises for not being able to be here.  I am aware this issue is causing a great deal of concern in the part of Dublin Deputy Ryan represents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The greater Dublin strategic drainage study, published in 2005, analysed the existing drainage system in the greater Dublin area and proposed policies, strategies and projects for developing the drainage system to meet the development needs and anticipated population growth of the area for the period to 2031.  This study was undertaken by Dublin City Council on behalf of the other local authorities in the area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This study took account of the needs of the greater Dublin area, including parts of Meath and Kildare.  The study took account of the needs which would be met from the proposed new wastewater treatment plants in Shanganagh, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and at Portrane in Fingal.  Both these plants are nearing completion, with funding being provided under the water services investment programme for 2010-12.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The study examined eight possible solutions for new treatment capacity for the entire Dublin region but six were ruled out due to technical, social, economic or environmental constraints.  The recommendations therefore were for capital works estimated at &euro;2.3 billion involving an upgrade of Ringsend wastewater treatment plant to its full design capacity; a new wastewater treatment plant in north Dublin which the study referred to located in Portrane; and an orbital sewer and a series of trunk sewers.</P>
        <P>Fingal County Council subsequently decided that certain aspects of the GDSDS should be subjected to a strategic environmental assessment.  The SEA assessed 16 strategic drainage options for the greater Dublin area and involved a public consultation phase.  The recommended strategy arising from the SEA is that a new regional wastewater treatment plant be built in the northern greater Dublin area and that the outfall should be located along the north Dublin coastline following a detailed site selection process.  The location of the new plant is to be determined based on the site selection criteria set out in the environmental report of the SEA.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fingal County Council has now engaged consultants to prepare a preliminary report for the scheme, including the site selection process.  The council is currently engaging in an non-statutory public consultation on the site selection process, with the consultation period due to draw to a close next week, on 18 November.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s main role in water services projects is to provide capital funding for the work through the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme and he may in the future have a statutory role should there be a requirement for a foreshore licence for a project.  It would therefore be inappropriate for him to engage in discussions which might prejudice his statutory role.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This proposal was formulated and promoted under previous Governments and has in essence been inherited by this Administration.  Like many things inherited by this Government we must revisit the rationale and costing behind those decisions, especially with major infrastructural projects of this size.  It is only prudent to do so.  Estimates place the <Col N="281"/>cost of constructing this facility at the high end of &euro;2 billion.  Is that the case and is the money available given current strictures on capital funding?</P>
        <P>Taking all things into consideration &mdash; the environmental impact, the potential for high financial cost to the Exchequer and the many other negative impacts &mdash; will the Minister consider looking at alternatives such as smaller treatment plants?  The people of north County Dublin have no problem treating their own waste in this fashion.  The smaller plants approach would allow for a more modular approach that would spread the costs over a longer period and would have less of an impact on the surrounding environment.  There is cross-community and cross-party opposition to this proposal, including from the Labour Party and Fine Gael representatives, and the arguments against it are sound.  The alternatives to it, like the one I propose, are also sound.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appeal to the Minister to at least review the rationale and the assumptions which underpin the proposal to see if they are valid today and put the project on hold until that has been done.  They may be out of date because of the recession.  The people of north County Dublin demand a change in policy from Fingal County Council and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on this matter and I fully support them.  I ask for a positive response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will pass the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns to the Minister.  The note I have makes it clear that additional wastewater facilities are needed for the Dublin area in the medium to long term.  It is also clear that despite the downturn generally, the population of Fingal has shown strong growth and the area will require further additional wastewater facilities in the coming decades to meet demographic and enterprise needs.  The strategic environmental assessment process, including public consultation, examined the issue of the number of treatment plants that should be constructed and determined the optimum solution was to provide one plant.  I know the Deputy disagrees with that and I will pass his objections to the Minister.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that the project will require planning permission, which will be subject to an environmental impact assessment and may require a foreshore licence.  Each of these has a statutory public consultation element to it so it would not be appropriate for the Minister to engage in discussions directly that might prejudice his role in that process.  I will highlight to the Minister the strength of the arguments put forward by Deputy Ryan on behalf of his constituents and ask him to revert to the Deputy directly in respect of this matter.</P>

        <Quest>  the reasons he closed the Irish Embassies to the Holy See, Iran and Timor-Leste; the measures he has taken to continue representation there; if and when he informed those countries of the decision to close the embassies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As outlined in my statement on Thursday last, it was with the greatest regret and reluctance that a decision had to be made to close Ireland&rsquo;s embassies to the Holy See and Iran and its representative office in Timor-Leste.  This decision is in line with the tough choices that the Government must make to address the current economic challenges that face the country.  Our targets under the <Col N="282"/>EU-IMF programme mean that cuts to public expenditure must be made across a wide range of public services, including our diplomatic service.  The decision to close the three missions followed a thorough review of the overseas diplomatic network in which particular attention was paid to the promotion of Irish economic interests and the economic return from missions abroad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Iranian ambassador and the charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires at the Papal Nunciature were informed of the decision shortly before it was announced on Thursday last.  Our ambassador in Tehran and our charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires to the Holy See subsequently called to the respective foreign Ministries.  Our representative in Dili conveyed the news to the foreign Ministry there.  The information was received with understandable disappointment, although there was recognition of the severe budgetary pressures Ireland faces and the difficult decisions that have to be made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Diplomatic relations will be maintained with the three states in question.  I assure the Deputy that we intend to continue our active engagement with the Holy See, Iran and Timor-Leste.  The Government believes that our relations can be sufficiently dealt with by representation on a non-resident basis.  Arrangements are being made to accredit a senior Dublin-based diplomat as ambassador to the Holy See and to accredit an ambassador in the region as ambassador to Iran.  Our ambassador to Singapore will continue to be accredited as non-resident ambassador to Timor-Leste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his reply.  When he took office, I congratulated him in the House for developing the concept &mdash; it was already in existence &mdash; of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our embassies abroad playing a critical role in the area of promoting trade.  I am, therefore, concerned about this matter from a number of perspectives.  In supporting and actively encouraging the T&aacute;naiste to continue to develop the trade role, I must state that we still have a responsibility to maintain important diplomatic links that are already in place.  The T&aacute;naiste made a major decision in respect of this matter.  I put it to him that this was the wrong decision.  Many people throughout the country &mdash; practising Catholics and also those who have a respect for the role the church plays in world affairs &mdash; are hurt and offended by the decision relating to our embassy in the Vatican.  Will the T&aacute;naiste reconsider the position in respect of this matter?  Fianna F&aacute;il would be absolutely committed to re-establishing our embassy presence in the Vatican.</P>
        <P>Is the T&aacute;naiste in a position to indicate the extent to which the decision to close these embassies was discussed by the Cabinet?  Was it merely rubber stamped?  Did the T&aacute;naiste engage with his Ministers of State in respect of it?  I am concerned with regard to Iran and the decision to close our embassy there.  Iran is extremely important both in the context of world security and with regard to the influence of the Shi&rsquo;ite Muslim community.  There is some &euro;86 million in trade between our two nations and the bulk of this, over &euro;80 million, takes the form of exports from Ireland to Iran.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our establishment of a presence in Timor-Leste was linked to our development aid role and the question of human rights.  The issues which affect that country are as important now as they were in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept everything the Deputy said with regard to the desirability of maintaining a resident embassy in each of the three states involved.  However, the difficulty is that we are operating in circumstances where, in the first instance, we are obliged to reduce costs.  In addition, as a result of the reduction in numbers across the public sector, the number of staff available to the Department is declining.  We are, therefore, obliged to focus our operations.  It is unfortunate that we cannot maintain all of our resident missions and we have been <Col N="283"/>obliged to make some difficult choices.  For example, and in view of the fact that we are due to assume the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in January 2013, we had to decide whether to reduce the number of resident missions in Europe.  We have only two resident missions in South America.  This is despite the fact that we are involved in a high level of trade there.  We also have only a small number of people operating on the ground in Asia.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The conclusion I reached in respect of this matter was that the Holy See could be effectively and adequately serviced by a senior diplomat based in Dublin.  Iran can be serviced from an embassy in another jurisdiction in the Middle East region.  Our ambassador in Singapore will continue to serve as non-resident ambassador to Timor-Leste.  I am willing to review the position in respect of these missions when we are in a position, both financially and from the point of view of personnel, to consider reopening them.  That is something we can do in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s indication that he is prepared to revisit this matter.  It is important that he should do so.  I again put it to him that there is a political imperative in the context of our trading relationships with foreign countries.  We should consider expanding our diplomatic and trade footprints in Indonesia, South America and elsewhere.  On 21 July, the T&aacute;naiste, when replying to a question from one of his parliamentary colleagues, indicated the importance of the mission to the Holy See in the context of the enormous importance of the Vatican as a listening point and as a huge, internationally renowned hub of diplomatic activities.  I implore him to review the position in respect of this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>All of our missions abroad will remain under ongoing review.  I am not offering any hope or prospect that the position can be changed, either in the short term or in the foreseeable future, because there are financial and staffing considerations which militate against such a change.  We have a small diplomatic team and we must concentrate our efforts.  Compared to other countries, we have a small number of resident missions and we must be extremely focused in the context of how we use them.  Diplomatic relations will continue with the three states to which the original question refers and which are very important.  Diplomatic relations with the Vatican are particularly important and that is why we have decided to seek to have a senior diplomat from Dublin accredited as a non-resident ambassador to the Holy See.  We will have an ambassador to the Holy See but he or she will be a senior diplomat based in Dublin.  We can review the question of having a resident mission to the Vatican when the position relating to the financial and staffing considerations to which I refer changes.</P>

        <Quest>  if his attention has been drawn to the profound concerns of international human rights organisations regarding the implications of the Peru-Colombia trade agreement as it stands; and if he will bring the proposed agreement before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for debate and clarification.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2009, negotiations commenced on a multi-party trade agreement between the EU and two member states of the Andean Community of Nations, namely, Colombia and Peru.  The negotiations concluded in March 2010 and the agreement was initialled by the parties on 13 April 2011.  The T&aacute;naiste, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and I are well aware of and share the concerns that have been expressed over human rights in Colombia, particularly in the context of the position of trade unionists and human rights activists.  The T&aacute;naiste had an opportunity to discuss the human rights situation in that country when he met <Col N="284"/>the Colombian ambassador in July.  During their meeting, the T&aacute;naiste outlined the ongoing concerns of the Government at reports of human rights abuses in Colombia.</P>
        <P>The EU believes that the multi-party trade agreement will be a key tool in addressing the human rights situation in Colombia, not only through a robust human rights clause but also by means of a number of binding commitments to implement core labour and environmental conventions and the use of a mechanism for monitoring their implementation which will include civil society institutions.  It is expected the agreement will be signed in the first half of 2012.  The issue of the designation of the agreement as one which involves mixed competence requiring approval and ratification by all 27 member states or as one in which the Union has exclusive competence will be determined by the European Council in light of analysis of both the final text and legal advice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton.  I welcome the fact that she acknowledged the concerns the Government shares on the human rights situation in Colombia, which is quite profound.  Even with the arrival of the new Administration of President Santos, the human rights problems have not eased all that much.  In the first year of his Presidency, more human rights defenders were killed across the country than in the previous year.</P>
        <P>There is the significant issue of displacement.  Some 286,000 people were displaced in 2010.  Then there is the concern around the indigenous peoples that such displacement is related to foreign multinationals with speculative investment in mining, agriculture, and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Would Deputy Mac Lochlainn frame a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the case that we are not forcefully ensuring that this ends with a proper dialogue?  Are we too hasty?   Is there quite a road to go yet before Colombia and Peru, and particularly Colombia, have reached the human rights bar that we seek?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is fair to say that there is a challenge here in terms of balancing the need to provide an incentive to governments such as the Colombian Government to make progress on human rights issues while being conscious that we cannot turn a blind eye.  In fairness, the European Union and the Government, in feeding into that process in our engagement with the Commission, and at Council level, have made a robust and clear statement on how we want to see human rights promoted and protected within the parameters of the agreement.</P>
        <P>There is a substantial and robust human rights clause in the first article of the trade agreement which has the potential to contribute to the enhancement and protection of human rights in the future.  I certainly consider that to be a more constructive, engaged and, hopefully, productive approach than simply wringing our hands and aspiring to an improvement in the human rights situation but actually not being able to do anything tangible about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">For example, countries in the Balkans and eastern European Baltic states applying for membership of the European Union have had to go through a process over a period and have had to reach an acceptable standard of human rights, not to mention economic competency, to be accepted.  My concern is that it is clear the situation in Colombia is still serious.  I listened to a presentation from a senior trade unionist in exile, Mr. Javier Orozco, who is touring the country addressing human rights activists and trade union members.  He showed a documentary that was made by human rights organisations in various regions and cities of Colombia.  I urge the Minister of State to try to access a copy of this because it is <Col N="285"/>disturbing.  The situation in Peru is similar.  The bulk of civil society and trade union movements are opposed to the FTA there too because of the impact it would have.</P>
        <P>There is a sense that while in Ireland we rightly defend the livelihood of our farmers, whenever there is a free trade agreement it can cause significant distortion for the small farmers in these countries in terms of what we give as subsidies to our farmers in that competition of produce.  That is another big issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn is over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>The organisations that signed up to the excellent document I hold are internationally respected and very much respected in Ireland: Christian Aid, CAFOD, Oxfam GB, SCIAF and Tr&oacute;caire.  These organisations recommend that we do not proceed and I urge the Government to follow their lead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>We will certainly take on board the concerns of those important and reputable agencies.  There is no question about that.  We are moving in the direction of concluding the trade agreement, but it has not been done yet and there still is opportunity for further negotiation.</P>
        <P>I accept Deputy Mac Lochlainn&rsquo;s point about the process for accession to the European Union and the length of time it takes, but this process began formally in 2009.  Obviously, there has been engagement on a human rights level for a longer period than that.  It will be a minimum period of three years &mdash; up until 2012 &mdash; when it is anticipated that the agreement will be signed.  There has been an opportunity to give it careful consideration but there still remains some opportunity for consideration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take on board all of the points Deputy Mac Lochlainn makes.  There is active engagement and dialogue between the European Union and the Governments of Colombia and Peru on the area of human rights, but those are negotiations and talks that have gone on for quite some time without tangible results.  By engaging such countries in a trade agreement which basically imposes binding obligations on them, one has the power to be able to say that one will suspend the trade agreement &mdash; that is contained in the terms of the proposed agreement.  The issue of the risk to small farmers is a real one of which we must be conscious but balanced with it are the significant opportunities for farmers to sell their produce.  We have seen in other Latin American countries the significant opportunities that have opened up, for example, in Brazil and Argentina.  Hopefully, there will be opportunities for farmers in those countries as well.</P>

        <Quest>  if he sees a role for Irish parliamentarians in Ireland and developing countries in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to help achieve the millennium goals; the position he will take at the upcoming high level forum on aid effectiveness in Busan, South Korea; the engagement he has had with Irish aid agencies in the preparation for this summit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[33914/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, to be held in Busan at the end of this month, will be a milestone in the international effort to strengthen the quality of development assistance.  The Government will be represented at this major international meeting by a delegation headed by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.  The del<Col N="286"/>egation will include the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Breen, who will also attend the parliamentary forum at the Busan meeting.</P>
        <P>Parliamentarians at home and in developing countries have a critical role to play in oversight and in holding Governments to account for the achievement of clear results from development assistance.  Ireland is working to ensure that the outcome document from the meeting includes a firm commitment to strengthen the capacity of parliamentarians in developing countries to fulfil this role.  We are also arguing that parliamentarians be included in existing forums on aid effectiveness at national level.</P>
        <P>The Government has consulted widely in preparing for the forum.  In addition to our discussions with Members of the Oireachtas, we have engaged with the higher education and research institutes and with Irish aid agencies.  They have made valuable suggestions which we have taken on board in the ongoing negotiations on the final outcome text.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s position in Busan will be to focus on progress in poverty reduction and on the achievement of development results, particularly in fragile states.  We are working to ensure that women and girls are more effectively prioritised in development.  Other priorities include strengthening the transparency and accountability of development spending, reducing the bureaucracy of aid management and ensuring civil society can play its legitimate role as partners in poverty reduction.</P>
        <P>I hope that the forum in Busan will mark a clear decisive move in placing the effectiveness of aid at the heart of development policy to accelerate progress towards achieving the millennium development goals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>We know there will be so many demands on our budget and we are talking about cuts, but it is only moral and just that we should try to maintain our development aid budget.  It is really important that such aid is effective.  There is a definite role for Parliament since parliaments are different from governments.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister is considering the progress being made, but in the draft outcome document the word &ldquo;oversight&rdquo; is still not included.  We know of countries where the aid has been manipulated by governments and it is really important that it is validated by parliament so that the aid is distributed fairly and justly.  The question is: will Ireland take a strong position at EU level before Busan to ensure that the word &ldquo;oversight&rdquo; is in the document?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The officials of my Department have been actively engaged in the preparations for the Busan meeting over the past 12 months.  Final negotiations on the outcome document will take place in Busan.  In the meantime, a number of high-level officials from partner countries, donors, emerging economies and civil society are working on the text of the outcome document.  Within this group, we are engaging actively with the EU and the Nordic Plus group of like-minded countries to ensure agreed priorities for the document are included in these negotiations.  We are placing a particular emphasis on parliamentary scrutiny within the donor countries, for example, we have a robust committee system, and the receiving countries.  The countries with which we partner must have developed parliamentary scrutiny systems to ensure the aid is used to its greatest effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is positive.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, in the Association for European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA.  He has done a great deal to ensure the word &ldquo;oversight&rdquo; is included.  I would hate to see his work undone.</P><Col N="287"/>
        <P>I welcome that Deputy Breen will attend the parliamentary forum.  It would be a great boost were the T&aacute;naiste able to ask or encourage the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, to attend as well, as her presence would give credence to our involvement with parliamentarians.  Some 50 parliamentarians from the global south will attend, 20 of whom will be brought by AWEPA.  Were the Minister of State able to attend, it would be a positive step.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, intends to take an active role at the meeting.  I will ask her, but her attendance will depend on the schedule of meetings.  As the Deputy knows, there are ministerial, governmental and parliamentary schedules at these types of event.  Sometimes they overlap.  I am sure the Minister of State will endeavour to liaise with Deputy Breen on what is happening and, in so far as she can, attend some of the parliamentary sessions.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The &ldquo;Promoting Ireland Abroad&rdquo; conference in June enabled interaction with all of my Department&rsquo;s senior overseas representatives, Irish business leaders and heads of Irish economic agencies.  The Taoiseach and I outlined the Government&rsquo;s approachto promoting Ireland as open for business and set out the role of the State&rsquo;s diplomatic networks in this regard.  I set as a priority our contribution to renewed and sustainable growth by promoting Ireland&rsquo;s economic and trading interests, cultural and scientific profile and reputation internationally in close co-operation with other Departments and agencies.  Responsibility for certain trade functions transferred to my Department on 1 June.  I now chair the new Export Trade Council, which has held its inaugural meeting and which aims at creating a more co-ordinated approach to promoting our trade, tourism and investment sectors.</P>
        <P>Last month&rsquo;s Global Irish Economic Forum allowed the opportunity for a discussion of our priorities for economic renewal with key members of the international business community and for strengthening our ties with the Irish diaspora.  The forum was marked by a high level of enthusiasm among the participants.  The global Irish network in particular will be an important partner in our efforts to restore our international reputation.</P>
        <P>I have led a number of trade missions, including to Japan and South Korea last month and to Moscow this week.  My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, is leading a trade mission to South Africa.  The diplomatic network has also had significant involvement in a range of economic promotion activities, including trade missions led by other Ministers.</P>
        <P>Aside from the closures of the three missions mentioned in an earlier question, there are ongoing efforts to explore greater efficiencies in our external representation.  To this end, I am extending the pilot scheme that provides for missions with only one diplomat.  I have also carried out an internal restructuring of the Department in Dublin aimed at organising work on a more geographical basis with new regional units having lead responsibility in the management of the fullest possible range of relations with their particular countries.  The restructuring is designed to meet the need for more focused and efficient delivery of services and policy goals and should result in more coherent and efficient outputs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his response.  On the face of it, his initiative on 1 June was positive, but where is the beef?  Has there been an obvious change in the <Col N="288"/>diplomatic stance of our ambassadors and heads of mission across the world?  Will the T&aacute;naiste point to specific measures operating to the benefit of the country that are now in place that were not in effect before 1 June?</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste raised the issue of achieving economies across the diplomatic system, an important aim that we accept.  The T&aacute;naiste also referred to the question on the three missions to be closed.  A broad-based cost saving measure might have been preferable to his decision to save &euro;1.8 million, a small amount of money.</P>
        <P>Where is the beef?  What are the specific, tangible changes in the approaches of our diplomats that are beginning to yield benefits for us?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The beef is in the country&rsquo;s improved reputation.  It is fair to point out that, when we took office in March, Ireland had suffered considerable damage to its international reputation and the weekly reports we got on what was being said about Ireland in the international press made for embarrassing reading.  I am happy to say that this situation has been turned around.  Our strategy is aimed at restoring the country&rsquo;s reputation and has been pursued successfully in Europe through my work and that of the Taoiseach and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  We have made a concerted effort across Europe to improve the country&rsquo;s reputation.  The convening of the meeting of the heads of mission formed part of that strategy, as did our briefings for other countries&rsquo; diplomatic representatives to Ireland, the programme of visits we have undertaken to a range of countries, the convening of the global Irish network and our joined-up approach to trade promotion.  The Export Trade Council will co-ordinate our entire trade operation across Departments.  This format is replicated at a country level where our ambassadors will act as team leaders for those countries in which we have representation, be it in the form of embassies or agencies.  Even though we will have a small presence in individual countries, our representation and impact will get the greatest bang for our limited buck.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend no disrespect to our diplomats.  I have much respect for them, but surely the T&aacute;naiste agrees that the restoration of our reputation abroad derives from the implementation of the previous Government&rsquo;s four-year plan and that many of our reputational difficulties derived from the negative comments made in this Chamber and this country.  I wish the T&aacute;naiste well with his efforts to continue rebuilding, but let us be clear about where the difficulties came from in the first instance.</P>

        <P>This week I had a very successful meeting in Russia of the joint economic commission which agreed to concentrate on work which will promote trade and business between Ireland and Russia in five sectors.  It is the BRIC country which is nearest to us geographically.  It is part of the European continent and there is enormous potential for development of trade and business between the two countries.  We will continue to work proactively at this.  I would welcome an opportunity here or at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade to have a longer discussion on where I see the potential for increasing these trade and business links.</P>

        <Quest>  the pressure he thinks that he could apply on the United States and Israel to shift their political opposition to the recognition of an independent Palestinian state; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has supported the achievement of an independent Palestinian state for 30 years.  I have made clear my strong view that I would wish to see this achieved very soon, and that the indefinite continuation of the occupation is quite unacceptable.  It is incumbent on all parties, including Israel, to seek actively to bring the occupation to an end through the negotiation of a two-state agreement based on the borders of 1967.  The United States has consistently expressed support for a Palestinian state.  Israeli Governments also claim to support the concept although Israel&rsquo;s aggressive policy of territorial annexation and settlement of occupied Palestinian territory would appear to undermine the prospect of such an outcome.</P>
        <P>Both the US and Israel have made clear their strong opposition to the current Palestinian effort to achieve immediate recognition at the United Nations for the state of Palestine.  They argue that this can only come about as a result of a negotiated settlement, and that what they regard as unilateral action at the UN is a threat to this.  I do not consider there is any prospect for now of convincing them otherwise.  Indeed, they are exerting strong pressure on others to come around to their point of view.</P>
        <P>Given Ireland&rsquo;s close friendship with the United States, I regret our difference of opinion on this point.  The fact is, however, that our contrasting positions reflect deeply held views among our respective peoples.</P>
        <P>The Government does not accept that the Palestinian initiative is a legitimate threat to negotiations.  We consider it a parallel process born out of deep Palestinian frustration with the lack of progress in almost 20 years of on-off negotiations since they accepted the existence of Israel.  I have made clear therefore that, subject to our scrutiny of the exact terms, Ireland would support a resolution at the UN General Assembly to admit Palestine as either a full member or a non-member observer state.</P>
        <P>Ireland voted in favour of the admission of Palestine to UNESCO on 31 October.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnHalligan"><NameTxt>Deputy John Halligan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge and accept the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s support for the Palestinian cause and the concern he has expressed over the long number of years I have known him.  I know he will agree with me that the right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign state has awaited implementation not for 20 or 30 years but for 64 years.  I am glad to hear the T&aacute;naiste acknowledge, and I believe he did acknowledge, that Israel has no valid claim whatsoever to any of the land it has occupied since 1967.</P>
        <P>In the coming weeks parliamentarians throughout Europe will urge their respective Ministers with responsibility for foreign affairs to do more to pressure the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Israel to accept the state of Palestine.  Will the T&aacute;naiste make personal contact with them as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of this State?  Palestinians have lived in the most inhumane conditions during the past 60 years.  Perhaps the time has come &mdash; perhaps the T&aacute;naiste has already done so &mdash; for personal intervention.  I will not criticise the T&aacute;naiste because I acknowledge his support for the Palestinian cause through the years.</P>
        <P>I am sure the T&aacute;naiste is aware that of the seven Irish detainees who were to return home today two were removed from the plane and forced back to Israel.  I regret having to raise this matter.  I merely wanted to ask a question about Palestine but perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will give me an answer on this also.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Halligan for his comments.  The Taoiseach and I have already discussed the Palestinian issue and the Middle East peace process with President Obama.  We discussed it with him when he was here in May.  In EU-US bilateral discussions I have also discussed the issue with the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.  In addition, I have also spoken directly with the Israeli and Palestinian Foreign Ministers about the issue.</P>
        <P>A quartet statement was agreed during the United Nations General Assembly which sets down a timetable for negotiations.  It is important that we support this timetable which sets certain deadlines.  We are working through the EU Foreign Affairs Council and the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, will attend the Foreign Affairs Council&rsquo;s meeting on Monday where I expect the issue will be discussed.  Again, we will support the efforts being made by the High Representative, Ms Catherine Ashton, in this regard.</P>
        <P>In respect of the people of the <i>MV Saoirse</i>, I am deeply disappointed.  Seven were to be flown home this morning and I am disappointed this did not happen.  We worked to make alternative flight arrangements for them this afternoon but only five of them managed to board the plane.  I understand the other two will return home tomorrow.</P>

We felt we had that issue resolved by this afternoon and that all seven would be on board a flight.  I understand that what happened this afternoon was that two of the seven were detained because of security clearance issues on the Israeli side.  Frankly, I do not see how there can be a problem with security clearance for people already in custody who were being deported.  As I stated, we have communicated to the Israeli ambassador here and the Israeli foreign ministry our deep dissatisfaction at what happened this afternoon.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope to visit China on an official visit at a mutually convenient date in the coming months.  The Government attaches great importance to widening and deepening bilateral relations with China, including the political and economic relationships.  China was at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s Asia strategy and remains a key high-growth and high-potential market for Ireland under the strategy and action plan for Irish trade, tourism and investment to 2015.  The local market team, set up under the strategy, includes all of the State agencies present in China in addition to the embassy in Beijing and the consulate-general in Shanghai.  The team is chaired by our ambassador in Beijing and has been actively working to build on our growing economic and trade relationships with China.  Ireland had a modest trade surplus with China in 2010.  Total merchandise trade between Ireland and China was worth almost &euro;5.3 billion in 2010.  Trade in services during the same period was worth &euro;2.3 billion.  Over 130 Irish companies now have a permanent business presence in China, an increase of 300% over the past five years.  I hope to visit China in the near future in order to build on the excellent bilateral relations that exist between our two countries; to have discussions with my opposite number in China on matters of mutual concern; to promote Irish interests; and to further enhance our political, trade, investment, education and tourism links with China.  A visit must take place at a time mutually convenient for my Chinese counterpart.  This entails continuing discussions between the Irish and Chinese sides through diplomatic channels.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>While we welcome any trade development for this country in the current circumstances, the T&aacute;naiste is well aware of the brutal human rights record of the Chinese regime, its completely undemocratic character, its persecution of Falun Gong and the people of Tibet and its regular execution of political dissidents.  Did the T&aacute;naiste raise these issues with the Chinese authorities during his visit?  Does the T&aacute;naiste think it is right that the western world seems to be willing to turn a blind eye and pay lip-service to human rights issues in China because there is so much trade?  We do not really put pressure on them to democratise and improve their human rights record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Human rights issues in China, including individual cases, are regularly discussed on a bilateral basis with the Chinese Government, both in Beijing and in Dublin. <Col N="292"/> At such meetings the Government continues to stress the importance attached by Ireland to human rights, and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, and to urge the Chinese authorities to ratify the international covenant on civil and political rights.  In my meetings with Chinese leaders who visited Dublin recently, I raised human rights issues in a frank, friendly and respectful manner, which reflects the maturity of our relationship.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</askee>
        <Quest>  if he is planning on proceeding with the proposal undertaken by the previous Government to clearly label any produce that comes from illegal Israeli settlements in order that customers here are aware of the origins of what they are buying.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[33717/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulation of product labelling is not the responsibility of my Department, but is overseen by a number of domestic Departments.  The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Martin, undertook to discuss with other Departments the possibility of introducing labelling to identify products of illegal Israeli settlements.  He reported to the D&aacute;il in November last year on the outcome of those discussions.  The position then was that, bearing in mind the existing labelling requirements, the likely small volume of products involved and the absence of significant stakeholder pressure on this issue, this was not seen as a priority by domestic Departments. </P>
        <P>However, it is important to be clear that there is nothing to stop Irish retailers, if they wish, from clearly labelling goods to distinguish settlement produce.  They could do so along the same simple and obvious lines as in the DEFRA guidelines in the UK, as either &ldquo;Produce of the West Bank (Palestinian produce)&rdquo; or &ldquo;Produce of the West Bank (Israeli settlement)&rdquo;, or any similar wording.  That advice has been available since last year on my Department&rsquo;s website, where it may be viewed by or cited to retailers or members of the public.</P>
        <P>Taking the matter further forward within the regulatory framework is a matter for those Ministers and Departments responsible for product labelling.  I have also raised at EU level the question of whether settlement products should not be excluded altogether from the EU but as I have reported to the House, there is not yet sufficient support for such a proposal to have any chance of success.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>Two issues arise, the first of which the Israeli labelling after the 2000 agreement between the EU and Israel, and the deal in recent years where products from the Palestinian territories are labelled as from West Bank to allow the Palestinian territories to develop economic activities.  In the middle, produce from illegal settlements that are against various UN resolutions and which Ireland and many other European countries have condemned can be labelled as Israeli produce and in some cases West Bank produce.  In the failure to confront Israel over the settlement, it is completely unacceptable to allow Israel to benefit economically, never mind the fact that it has torn down hundreds of homes.  In response to the UNESCO vote, where the international community democratically voted for full membership for Palestine, Israel threatened to build more settlements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Mac Lochlainn and I had an exchange on this general issue during the meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We are <i>ad idem</i> in terms of the Government&rsquo;s approach to settlements.  As the T&aacute;naiste mentioned in his response to previous questions, we are deeply disturbed by the aggressive action of Israel in respect of settlements.  If there is some way we can manifest this through labelling, we will be happy to do so.  The issue has been raised at European level but there is no willingness to go down that road.  At this point, it is deadlocked because the Irish Government has one position while other member states do not share that position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Government satisfied there is no settlement produce being circulated in the Irish economy?  Is the Government considering a ban on produce from these illegal settlements, in order to be absolutely clear on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to say that no such produce is circulating because there is no mechanism for clearly identifying and labelling it.  There is probably a small amount circulating in the economy.  The issue is how to identify it and how to oblige suppliers to label it clearly.  That is a matter for the line Ministers and the issue has been explored.  There is no appetite to go down the road of identifying such produce because of the small quantity in question.  There is nothing to stop producers and retailers from identifying this produce but this practice has not been taken up.  The information is available on the departmental website.  A full-scale ban has not been discussed at Government level.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</askee>
        <Quest>  if he has engaged in any communication with Israeli officials regarding the issue of the on-going shooting and shelling of Palestinian minors working near the border fence between the Gaza Strip and Israel which between 26 March 2010 and 17 February 2011, there have been 27 children shot while collecting building material as documented by DCI-Palestine.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[33720/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the report of DCI-Palestine, which documents the cases of 27 teenage children shot and injured while collecting building material near the border fence between the Gaza Strip and Israel between March 2010 and February this year.  These children and a number of adults scavenge for building materials among the destroyed buildings close to the border fence.  This is testament to the inadequate volume of construction materials being allowed into Gaza and to the complete collapse of economic life and employment opportunities in the territory as a consequence of the blockade.  I have raised this disturbing report in recent discussions with the Israeli ambassador and I intend to pursue it further when I visit Israel and Palestine, as I plan to in the near future.  These shootings arise from the maintenance by Israel of a no-go zone of about half a kilometre in front of the border fence and I am also concerned about the effect this has in preventing farmers in Gaza accessing much of their land, which is in very short supply already. </P>
        <P>I must acknowledge, however, that it would be very much easier to make this case if militant groups in Gaza were not regularly launching and seeking to launch attacks on or across the border, including attacks on the crossing points through which Gaza&rsquo;s supplies come.  In this context, I make it clear that I condemn all acts of violence across the Israel-Gaza frontier, regardless of by whom or from where they are initiated.</P>
        <P>Ireland has raised other issues concerning the treatment of Palestinian children generally in the Occupied Territories with the Israeli authorities, as well as in international fora such as the <Col N="294"/>Human Rights Council in Geneva.  I have also made clear my strong views on the overall blockade of Gaza which forms the background to this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>The report I have seen from the organisation Defence for Children International makes for harrowing reading.  It includes pictures of children who were shot and injured by the Israeli defence forces in the region.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and in the Irish Embassy to Israel for their assistance in recent days in dealing with the 14 Irish human rights activists.  Anytime I rang the officials, they came back quickly with clarification.  In addition, they did everything they said they would to make the families aware of the state of play on their loved ones.  I must give credit where credit it due and personally thank the officials.  However, we have nine more activists to get home; therefore, let us work together to achieve this.  We can then deal with the wider issue involved.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for his kind remarks about my departmental officials who have worked very hard in the past week.  Each day they have visited the 14 people in detention and worked to have them released and returned to their families here as quickly as possible.  I have been in daily contact with our officials both here and in Israel on the matter.  I had hoped that seven of the 14 people held would be home today and the other seven tomorrow.  I still hope all of them will be home by tomorrow.  That is our immediate priority.  As the Deputy said, there are issues which we can raise with the Israeli authorities and I have already indicated some of them to the Israeli ambassador.</P>
        <P>The blockade of Gaza should not be continuing.  The international community has to work to get the negotiations back on track between Palestine and Israel to find a solution to the problem.

      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 24 and 37 to 40, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>When EU and euro area leaders met on 26 October, they agreed a comprehensive package of measures to restore stability to the euro area.   The deal covers all the key issues, including bank recapitalisation, debt sustainability for Greece, robust firewalls to prevent contagion, and improved governance within the euro area.  In each area Irish interests have been fully protected.</P>
        <P>The deal, together with the growth promoting measures agreed by the European Council on 23 October, constitutes a complete package that will allow the European Union to address the immediate challenges posed by the financial crisis, while also focusing on supporting the development of sustainable growth and jobs at national level.  If implemented in good faith and <Col N="297"/>in full, I am confident that this balanced and robust set of measures can provide the basis for a return of stability and confidence to the euro area and, more broadly, the European Union.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As well as addressing the immediate issues of concern, euro area leaders further agreed on 26 October that the President of the European Council, working closely with the Presidents of the European Commission and the euro group, would prepare a report for the December European Council on possible steps to further strengthen economic convergence within the euro area, improve fiscal discipline and deepen economic union.  As part of that report, President Van Rompuy will explore the possibility of limited treaty changes.  The December report is to propose a roadmap for how to proceed.  This will, of course, be the subject of discussion in the run-up to and at the December European Council meeting.  A further report with proposals on how to implement the measures agreed is to be finalised by March 2012.</P>
        <P>The Government has consistently advocated that the first step is to examine what needs to be done and only then to identify how best to achieve it.  I am satisfied that the approach being adopted is the right one.  We continue to maintain that the existing treaties provide considerable potential which, as yet, remains untapped.  We will continue to pursue this point.  It should be noted that the principles of conferral, subsidiarity and proportionality remain critical foundations on which the relationships between member states and the European Union are built.   I welcome the improvements the Lisbon treaty made in these areas and believe they are working well.</P>
        <P>While new treaty changes will not form part of our response to the immediate crisis over the longer term, they comprise one of a range of possibilities that President Van Rompuy has been asked to explore.  It should be clearly understood that although a particular treaty change may not have direct consequences for every member state, treaty change is always a matter for the 27 member states of the European Union and must be agreed on the basis of unanimity.</P>
        <P>Together with the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and other members of Government, I will continue to engage proactively with our EU partners on every issue in respect of which Ireland&rsquo;s interests are at stake.  In addition to my having met EU colleagues on the margins of regular European Council meetings, I have visited a range of European capitals for consultations and will be extending these bilateral contacts over the period ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that some of this subject matter was dealt with, by way of a <i>tour de force</i>, at the meeting of the joint committees earlier today.  The prospect of treaty change, certainly treaty change that may require referenda, strikes fear into the hearts of all those who are pro-European.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State on what she said on the need for us to continue to maintain very strong, close and good relations with all our European partners.  However, there is much concern among people in Ireland and across Europe about what is emanating from the Franco-German axis.  In this regard, I was struck by two statements in the past two days.  Ms Angela Merkel stated the political Community will not survive if it is not capable of changing, and President Sarkozy stated there will be two European gears, one focused on more integration in the eurozone and the other on a more co-federal response in the Union.  I want to give the Minister of State the opportunity to say that while engaging in the hard work she is doing on this matter, which I acknowledge, she will not countenance, under any circumstances, this federalist type of approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not necessarily share the view that a referendum on treaty change inspires fear.  We must go through an important process in this country.  If there is a <Col N="298"/>question of changing the balance of competence between member states and the European institutions, a referendum is needed.  We will engage in this process if or when the time comes.  We should not fear this because it is a very democratic process and it enables us to have a very robust and meaningful debate on all these issues.</P>
        <P>The proposed treaty change, which we know encompasses budgetary control and making the management structures more robust within this Union, is not one I fear in principle.  However, if one opens up the prospect of treaty change, one must deal with something much broader.  There ought to be a much more holistic response to how we approach the future of the European project and European Union.  In this regard, of most direct concern to us at present is the eurozone.  I stated the at the joint sitting of the committees earlier today that we must have meaningful engagement in our own Parliament.  Other Parliaments need to engage also.  This cannot happen overnight and will take time.  President Van Rompuy is very mindful of that fact.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, there is an immediate crisis that must be dealt with.  There has been much criticism of the very prominent role of the German Chancellor and French President in this regard.  I share some of the concerns.  Consider the discussion on treaty changes in respect of a reversion to the sort of Community method that obtained in the past, which method served us very well and led to huge strides being taken in European society and the EU economy over many decades.  That all happened through the Community method and through a robust European Commission.  The European Commission, whether we like it or not, has been very much sidelined in this process.  I would like to see the Commission, which represents all member states equally, returning to the centre of European decision-making.  This is in our interest as a small member state.  Many other member states share that view.  Unfortunately, the current crisis occurred in a vacuum in that there was not a mechanism to deal with it.  There was no sufficiently robust decision-making mechanism and, therefore, it was imperative that the French and German Heads of State stepped up to the plate and showed leadership.  Many of us were complaining for months that there was no leadership from Germany and France.  We saw some decisive leadership, particularly at the last meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the eurozone on 26 October and 27 October.  That was welcome and I am glad we saw it.  It puts us on a firmer footing for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy of the Government is to cut the State&rsquo;s deficit to 3% by 2013, thereby returning to us our sovereignty, yet it is now supporting the potential of the European Central Bank to become the central bank and ruler of our banking system.  Power is taken from our hands in any case.  I would like the Minister of State to elaborate on this.</P>
        <P>The policy of austerity will bring all countries to their knees, particularly Italy, Spain, Greece and Ireland.  Deputy Shane Ross asked some days ago whether there is a plan B.  Are Irish punts being printed?  Having listened to Ms Christine Lagarde referring to ten years, or more, of austerity, I believe this must be asked. To what extent is the Government willing to put the people on its knees and impose further austerity measures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Minister of State not acknowledge that the main players in Europe and many major economists are of the opinion that the Union, as currently arranged, will not keep the euro alive?  Is it not pretty understandable that the Germans and French are talking about a two-tier union?  They do not expect to get 27 countries to agree to the sorts of measures they regard as necessary to make the euro sustainable.  Does the Minister of State not agree that we must either accept what the Germans want lock, stock and barrel or end up in a second tier?  I am not saying it would necessarily be the end of the world.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="299"/>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question on the European Central Bank becoming the ruler of our banking system, Deputy Collins&rsquo;s view of the world is very distorted.  We have a monetary union that has been in existence for over a decade.  The euro is our currency, not somebody else&rsquo;s.  It is not in some far-off, distant land and not just the preserve of Brussels; it is our currency and we need it to survive.  It behoves the Deputy and every other Member to ensure it survives and to fight for its survival.  The consequences of the disintegration of our currency would be unprecedented and unthinkable for the people of this State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the consequences of austerity?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Deputy allow the Minister of State to continue?  There is a time limit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the austerity that would mandatorily ensue next month or week if we pulled the plug on the funding coming into the State from both the European Central Bank and the EU-IMF programme?  It would begin with a budget adjustment for 2012 of &euro;11 billion.  I would like the Deputy to suggest to this House where that money would come from.  Who would she tax?  Would it be the working people, who are finding it difficult to meet mortgage repayments and pay all their bills?  Would it be the people in receipt of social welfare?  Would she like to increase bin charges or water charges, about which she complains all the time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the billionaires and millionaires?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to inject a little bit of reality into this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Tax the billionaires, the developers and the bankers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I put on record that the European Central Bank is the solution to the euro crisis.  It is our task to convince the German Chancellor and the German Government that we have to relax the rules on intervention from the ECB and we have to make the ECB the backstop for the EFSF to ensure that we can continue to fund the services we provide in this State, pay the people in receipt of social welfare their social welfare benefits every week and to pay the people in receipt of pensions from this State their pension payments.  We have to ensure we can maintain that line of funding and protect services.  That is the only option.  I have not heard a credible alternative option from anybody on the other side of the House in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>We have put forward many options, one of which is to tax the wealthy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to the Deputy Joan Collins&rsquo;s question as to whether there is a plan B, there is no plan B.  We have one currency and plan, incorporating every letter of the alphabet, which is to save our currency.  That is in the interests of Irish citizens, Irish business and everybody in the Chamber.</P>
        <P>Finally to answer Deputy&rsquo;s Wallace&rsquo;s question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</askee>
        <Quest>  his views that the high level of militarisation in north-eastern Sri Lanka is directly linked to most of the other problems prevalent in the area such as the breakdown in the social fabric, state brutality including sexual assault, land grabs and occupation and that it is completely unacceptable that more than two years since the conclusion of the war, the Government of Sri Lanka has failed to facilitate the proper transition of these areas from a situation of conflict to a normal environment.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[33718/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>While there have been some improvements in living conditions in the north and east of Sri Lanka, areas formerly held by the LTTE, there are still many matters of concern.  The north and east remains heavily militarised.  The Sri Lankan army is closely involved in daily life, with the local population under surveillance by soldiers and military intelligence. </P><Col N="301"/>
        <P>I am concerned at reports of continued violence against the local population by the Sri Lankan military.  Suggestions that people are being moved into the north and east from other parts of Sri Lanka are extremely worrying.  Approximately two-thirds of the people who were displaced by the war have now returned home.  The intention of the Government of Sri Lanka in regard to the remainder are unclear.  In September 2011, the Emergency Powers Regulation and the Prevention of Terrorism Regulation were not renewed.  However, the more comprehensive Prevention of Terrorism Act remains in force.</P>
        <P>Despite the best efforts of the United Nations and the wider international community, the Sri Lankan Government has, to date, refused to co-operate with the Panel of Experts on Accountability appointed by UN Secretary General Ban ki-Moon and has failed to address the recommendations contained in their report concerning allegations of atrocities and human rights violations during the war.  Ireland is supportive of the mandate of the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka.   I urge the government in Colombo to co-operate fully with the UN and address the recommendations made by the panel.</P>
        <P>A Lessons Learned and Rehabilitation Committee, with a limited mandate, was established by the Government of Sri Lanka in May 2010.  The committee&rsquo;s focus was on restorative justice, not on tackling impunity for actions during the war.  It is due to submit its report by 15 November 2011.</P>
        <P>Overall, there is an urgent need to initiate a comprehensive peace and reconciliation process in Sri Lanka.  It would be important to address impunity and the crimes of the past as part of that process.  Officials from my Department have conveyed our positions to the Sri Lankan authorities, directly in bilateral contacts and in multilateral fora, including through the European Union and at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva and at the UN in New York.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a detailed report before me about the ongoing grave situation in what would be considered Tamil areas in the north and east of Sri Lanka from which I will read a particular sentence.  I could read the whole report but the Ceann Comhairle would not allow me do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Certainly not.  The Deputy is not allowed quote from documents during Question Time.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay.  When families in that area are receiving guests they must inform the army who the guests are and that is the case for any family event.  The intrusion and the sense of humiliation and subjugation goes down even to the right to associate within one&rsquo;s community and have a social event in one&rsquo;s home.</P>
        <P>What is the United Nations doing allowing these types of situations to continue when civil society, NGOs and people whose credibility is beyond question are circulating these reports?  This is a horrendous report about what is happening in the region.  What message are we sending out to these regimes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>First, Ireland has played an active part in the European Union and particularly in the decision in 2010 to suspend duty free access for Sri Lankan exports under <Col N="302"/>the generalised system of preferences after the Sri Lankan Government failed to deliver a written undertaking on human rights conventions dealing with torture, children&rsquo;s rights and political rights.  Second, Ireland is active at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, most recently at the council session in September, highlighting the human rights situation in Sri Lanka as one of the most important human rights problems to be addressed by the international community.  Ireland was also instrumental at EU level in including concerns about Sri Lanka in discussions with at the UN General Assembly and we support the continuing work of the UN mission in Sri Lanka and the recommendations by the UN panel of experts in their report on accountability in Sri Lanka.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to that, Irish Aid is providing humanitarian funding.  Almost &euro;500,000 in humanitarian funding has been provided to Sri Lanka since 2009.</P>

	<P>The question of land ownership in Africa is a deeply emotive one given its centrality to issues of national identity and of food security.  </P>
        <P>There has been a trend in recent years of large-scale land acquisitions in Africa by foreign private sector and state-owned companies.  Certain wealthy countries, concerned about the stability of food supplies, have been promoting the acquisition of farmland in developing countries as an alternative to purchasing food from international markets.  Some developing countries have welcomed this new wave of foreign investment, and have been implementing policy and legislative reforms to attract investors.</P>
        <P>If properly regulated and implemented, there are enormous benefits for developing countries from foreign direct investment in land.  Africa needs such investment to provide the stimulus for economic growth, for employment creation and infrastructure development and to guarantee food security.  However, this must be balanced against the rights of the poor and most vulnerable, such as smallholder farmers and minority groups.  Genuine local consultation is essential, as is sustainable land management and the enforcement of investor commitments.  Otherwise, there is a clear danger that land acquisition will lead to increased exploitation of poor rural communities.</P>
        <P>Ireland supports equitable land reform programmes throughout our aid programme, both in our Programme Countries and in our engagement in multilateral institutions.  For instance, in Tanzania, our work with rural communities includes assistance with land ownership issues and access to land.  In Uganda, we are financing the translation of land ownership laws into native languages to inform the population of their land rights and promote security of tenure.</P><Col N="304"/>
        <P>Through our engagement in UN agencies, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation, we are working to increase the transparency of land acquisitions in developing countries.</P>
        <P>We will maintain this focus on land issues so that Governments, civil society and the private sector in Africa can prioritise measures to build inclusive economic growth and fight poverty and hunger.</P>

        <Quest>  his position on the tragic circumstances of the landless peasant communities in the Bajo Agu&aacute;n region of northern Honduras where peasant communities who fight for access to land in order to exercise their right to feed themselves are faced with a situation of permanent harassment and abuse by public security forces, as well as by members of private security companies, and where between January 2010 and March 2011 25 deaths &mdash; 23 peasants, a journalist and his partner &mdash; have been registered relating to conflicts over land in Bajo Agu&aacute;n.  </Quest>

	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern at reports of human rights related deaths in northern Honduras.  We have worked closely with our European partners to ensure that our concerns relating to human rights abuses are conveyed to President Porfirio Lobo and his Government. Honduras was reviewed under the UN Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism in November 2010. At the UPR, Ireland made several recommendations. We specifically expressed our ongoing concern about restrictions on freedom in Honduras, and recommended that Honduras adopt measures to end threats against, and harassment of, human rights defenders and journalists, as well as the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) community, and made a number of recommendations in the area of women&rsquo;s rights.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department met with representatives of the United Peasants Movement of Aguan (MUCA) organisation when they visited Ireland in March.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid has provided &euro;1.4 million since 2009 to Trocaire for their work in Honduras in the areas of food security, environment, and protection and mitigation against HIV/AIDS.  I know that Honduras was the country of focus for Trocaire&rsquo;s Lenten Appeal in 2011, specifically focused on the plight of dispossessed farmers in the Aguan valley region, to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
        <P>Ireland also continues to provide support for human rights in the region. Funding of &euro;100,000 was approved in April this year for an Inter-American Commission on Human Rights project which seeks to protect the rights of human rights defenders in Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador. Ireland provided &euro;50,000 of funding in May 2011 for the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). In 2010 Ireland provided &euro;50,000 in funding for a security sector reform project, Certipol, through which an independent civil society organisation, the Institute for Security and Democracy, seeks to further the ongoing process of police reform in that country.</P>
        <P>Honduras experienced a turbulent period after the military coup which took place in June 2009. However, I am encouraged that Honduras was readmitted to the Organisation of American States (OAS) in June. Relations with the EU have been normalised under President Porfirio Lobo&rsquo;s administration. Ireland, along with EU partners, remains committed to supporting the process of national reconciliation in Honduras.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme, managed by my Department, has an enviable international reputation and is rightly recognised as one of the best in the world.  The programme&rsquo;s primary objective is the fight against extreme poverty and hunger.  It is concentrated in some of the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa, has a rigorous focus on achieving results and provides strong international leadership in making aid more effective.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)recentlyundertook amid-term review of our aid programme, and in its review report published last month, it found that Ireland is one of the best performing members in relation to aid effectiveness.  In this House, Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme enjoys strong cross party support and consistently attracts high levels of public support. We, in this Government, are strongly committed to the programme, which is central to our foreign policy, and are proud of its achievements.  The Programme for Government underlines our commitment to the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on Overseas Development Assistance (ODA).  We remain focussed on this 0.7% target and are working towards its attainment.   </P>
        <P>The Government will publish the outcome of comprehensive expenditure review in the first week of December.  This review, which was initiated by the Government in order to identify expenditure savings and efficiencies across the public service, is now before the Government for consideration and will inform decision making in the annual Budget and Estimates process across public expenditure.</P>
        <P>Decisions on the allocation for the aid programme in 2012 will be taken within the overall budgetary framework and the fiscal constraints facing the Government.  The 2012 estimates process in now at an advanced stage, and I can assure you that I will continue to make the strongest possible case for funding for development cooperation.  However, final budget allocations for next year will ultimately be a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>I am committed to maintaining the high international reputation of our aid programme in order to ensure that we continue to deliver real and sustainable improvements to the lives of the world&rsquo;s poorest citizens.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 19 together.</P><Col N="306"/>
        <P>The decision to close the Irish Embassy in Iran was taken following a review of overseas missions carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which gave particular attention to the economic return from bilateral missions.  Trade volumes with Iran have fallen short of expectations with merchandise trade between the two countries in 2010 amounting to &euro;87m. In light of the current pressures on public finances, the Government has decided that such a low volume of trade did not justify maintaining a full diplomatic Mission in Tehran.  Ireland will continue to have full diplomatic relations with Iran and the Government intends to seek the appointment of a non-resident Ambassador. I can confirm that there were absolutely no other factors taken into consideration in the Government&rsquo;s decision to close overseas missions.</P>
        <P>While I am aware of unconfirmed media reports concerning contingency planning for potential military action against key Iranian nuclear facilities, the closure of our Embassy in Tehran is entirely unrelated to such reports.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s position on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear activities remains unchanged. We continue to urge the Iranian government to comply fully with all relevant UN Security Council and International Atomic Energy Agency Resolutions and to address openly and transparently all the many major concerns which exist within the international community about their nuclear programme.</P>
        <P>We fully support the continuing efforts of EU High Representative Catherine Ashton, on behalf of the EU3+3 (France, Germany, UK, US, Russia, China), to engage in meaningful dialogue with Iran about these matters and to pursue the twin track of negotiations and application of sanctions until such time as there is full compliance. The Government also remains steadfast in its view and will continue to express this at EU and international level that concerns over Iran&rsquo;s nuclear activities require a diplomatic resolution.</P>

	<P>A programme of Minister-led trade missions, organised in association with Enterprise Ireland to develop and expand Ireland&rsquo;s exports to existing and new markets abroad, is planned for next year.  The full range of destinations is still being finalised at this stage.  Once this has been done, I will be discussing the allocation of leadership responsibility for individual missions with my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Trade Missions provide an opportunity for Enterprise Ireland client companies to develop links in a market, to win export sales, to engage in international partnerships and joint ventures and establish in-market presences.  A focus on exporting underpins all missions, ranging from export opportunities identified in the mission market, market opportunities for specific firms or sectors and future growth opportunities.  </P>
        <P>Over the coming years, the potential of trade missions will be maximised by integrating trade, tourism and investment promotion activities, in line with the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to export led growth and the development of new markets<i>.</i></P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The devastating earthquake which struck Haiti on 12 January 2010 killed more than 230,000 people and injured 300,000 others.  The earthquake, which destroyed much of the capital city, Port-au-Prince, and surrounding areas, also left approximately 1.5 million people homeless and caused losses and damage estimated at approximately &euro;5.9 billion. Over 550,000 people remain homeless, living in temporary camps or with host families.  The earthquake decimated the Haitian health sector which, as the Human Rights Watch report points out, was already extremely weak. Sixty percent of health facilities were damaged and ten percent of health professionals were killed or emigrated in the aftermath of the earthquake. The headquarters of the Ministry of Health and Population Services (MSPP) was completely destroyed. This damage was not only devastating for the health of Haitians living in the capital, but to the country as a whole since the bulk of Haiti&rsquo;s health system was concentrated in Port-au-Prince. As a consequence, women in Haiti continue to face considerable challenges in accessing sexual and reproductive health care, including safe ante and post-natal care.  </P>
        <P>Sexual violence and other forms of gender-based violence were also, unfortunately, widespread in Haiti prior to the earthquake. In the 1990s, Human Rights Watch (HRW) documented the use of rape as a form of oppression during the regime of Raoul C&eacute;dras. From 2004 to 2006, the UN Security Council estimated that 35,000 women and girls were subjected to rape and sexual violence in Haiti.</P>
        <P>Ireland, through the Government&rsquo;s programme of official overseas assistance, Irish Aid, attaches considerable priority to supporting efforts to combat Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV).  Irish Aid works in partnership with, among others, UN organisations, Non-Governmental Organisations, and the International Red Cross movement to provide safe and accessible Sexual and Gender based violence response and prevention services.  Irish Aid is also one of the founders and an active member of the Irish Consortium on Gender-Based Violence.  The Consortium has invested in considerable research aimed at strengthening programming in this area and is currently conducting research on Gender-Based Violence in so-called fragile states like Haiti.  Irish Aid&rsquo;s focus on SGBV informs our funding support in response to humanitarian emergencies and this has been the approach in our interventions in Haiti since the earthquake.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid&rsquo;s initial assessment mission in the days following the earthquake recommended a focus for humanitarian aid on the issues of clean water and sanitation, shelter, protection, and early recovery. These recommendations and the importance of protecting the most vulnerable, including expectant and new mothers, have guided our assistance to date.</P>
        <P>As regards Ireland&rsquo;s funding response to the humanitarian needs in Haiti following the earthquake, Ireland pledged funding of &euro;13 million for the period 2010-2012 at the Haiti Donor Conference which took place in March 2010.  To date, Ireland has provided total funding support of &euro;11.25 million to Haiti since the earthquake. We continue to pay close attention to the protection needs of those affected by the earthquake and to play our part in strengthening the protection of the most vulnerable populations, including expectant and new mothers.</P>

	<P>The Ambassador&rsquo;s Residence in Ottawa was acquired by the State in 1960.  Only modest investments were made in its upkeep over the years and it had long been in need of substantial refurbishment.  In 2006, my Department was advised that total renovation was required to address a wide range of serious structural and maintenance issues.  Some of these problems were aggravated by the long term cumulative impact of the severe local climate.  A number of extensions to the property were found to be structurally flawed and had to be demolished and replaced.  Large quantities of asbestos were discovered in the building and all services including electrical, heating and air conditioning had to be renewed or upgraded to conform to contemporary local legal codes. </P>
        <P>The alternatives, including relocation, were examined.  However, the necessary renovations mitigated against the sale of the property.  At the time, before the onset of the current budgetary pressures, it was concluded that refurbishment and retention was the most cost- effective option.</P>
        <P>The decision was taken to renovate and upgrade the property so it could serve as a multi- purpose &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo; type amenity to enhance the Embassy&rsquo;s capacity to promote all aspects of  Ireland especially trade and culture and provide conference and presentation facilities for use by State Agencies, Irish companies and artists.</P>
        <P>The renovated premises represent a valuable asset for the State and a platform for the consolidation and enhancement of our important relationship with Canada.  Canada is the world&rsquo;s seventh largest economy and a member of the G8.  It is one of Ireland&rsquo;s top 20 trading partners with total trade of over &euro;1.5 billion and it has been identified as a high-potential market under the Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015. Some 4 million Canadians (12% of the population) claim Irish descent.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the project was rigorously monitored and all tender and approval procedures were strictly adhered to.  Tenders were sought locally on an open competitive basis and the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder in accordance with normal procedures.</P>
        <P>The cost of the project was estimated at &euro;5.2 million in 2008, including preliminary investigations, professional fees, excavation, demolition and construction work.  The project was properly authorised by the then Secretary General my Department in 2008 and all expenditure was duly sanctioned by my Department in accordance with prescribed procedures. Work commenced that year and was completed in 2009. The final total demolition and construction cost (including fees) was &euro;6.2 million.  The increase in cost over estimate was due to technical problems which arose during the construction related to the poor condition of the house.</P>
        <P>I understand that the refurbishment is fully complete and that no further work is outstanding.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 23 and 25 together. </P>
        <P>I fully respect the motives, intentions and objectives of those seeking to campaign against the Israeli blockade of Gaza, both through engaging in peaceful protest and through seeking to send humanitarian aid there. However, as I have stated in the House previously, I could not support a venture whereby citizens intended to place themselves at risk by attempting to break an armed naval blockade. This view has increasingly been taken also by the Governments in the region from which the ships were sailing, and by the UN Secretary General.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the voyage of the MV <i>Saoirse</i> and the Canadian ship the <i>Tahrir</i>   was to draw political attention to the blockade itself, but I believe that a small consignment of medical supplies for Gaza may also have been carried.</P>
        <P>On this occasion and prior to the original intended sailing in July, I have been in constant contact with the Israeli authorities, both personally and through my Department&rsquo;s officials, to reiterate my insistence that any military interception which Israel chose to conduct must ensure the safety of Irish citizens on board.</P>
        <P>My primary reaction to the reports of the interception on Friday was therefore that I was relieved that nobody on board was injured, bearing in mind of course the dreadful events of last year. Fourteen Irish citizens in total were detained on the <i>Saoirse</i>, and brought to the Israeli port of Ashdod. Officials from the Irish Embassy have visited them on a daily basis, and have been engaged with the Israeli authorities to ensure their prompt repatriation. They have reported no injuries or physical harm, although it appears there was damage to the boat during the interception.</P>
        <P>I and my Department have been consistently pressing the Israeli authorities for the earliest possible release of our citizens, following the interception of the MV Saoirse.  While the Israeli authorities were willing to deport them immediately, the persons themselves chose not to waive their right to appeal deportation.  I respect this decision as they clearly did not wish to give credence to the assertion that they had entered Israel illegally.  I myself met with the Israeli Ambassador last evening to impress upon him the importance which I attach to the earliest possible release of the detainees. Arrangements are now being made for seven of those detained to fly home later today while the remaining seven detainees are due to fly home tomorrow morning.</P>
        <P>On the broader issue, while I would once again condemn the ongoing rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel, I have made clear many times my insistence that the overall blockade of Gaza, as it is practiced, is illegal and counterproductive, and must be ended. While Israel has a right to prevent smuggling of weapons to Gaza, and therefore to search cargoes, it has no general right to prevent other materials or persons entering or leaving. Boats sailing to Gaza can never carry more than a symbolic fraction of the needs of the territory, and so the only <Col N="310"/>real answer is the full opening to normal business of the land crossing points from Israel. This is the key issue on which I will continue to focus, at EU level and internationally.</P>

        <Quest>  the progress being made on bilateral economic partnership agreements between the EU and third countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 2002, the EU has been negotiating a series of new trade and development agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of States.  The negotiations for these Economic Partnership Agreements are being carried out by the European Commission, on behalf of the European Community and the Member States.  They were necessitated by rulings by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) that the unilateral trade preferences which the EU had previously granted to the ACP countries established unfair discrimination between developing countries. </P>
        <P>The original aim had been to conclude comprehensive Agreements with six regional groupings of the ACP States by the end of 2007, the deadline set by the WTO.  However, following a process of protracted and difficult negotiations, only one of the ACP regional groups, representing Caribbean States, was ready to initial an Economic Partnership Agreement by that date.  In order to avoid trade disruption, interim Agreements were agreed and initialled at the end of 2007 with 21 other ACP States, either individually or in regional groupings.   These interim Agreements provide for full duty and quota-free access to the European Union market but allow the ACP countries a flexible and asymmetric trade liberalisation schedule.</P>
        <P>In recent years, there have been well-founded concerns that momentum in the negotiations was being lost.  It was also clear there was a need to revitalise the original shared commitment to the achievement of strong Agreements which serve the development needs of the ACP countries, promoting inclusive economic growth and regional integration.  Political leaders from both sides agreed at the EU-Africa Summit in November 2010 &ldquo;to conclude Economic Partnership Agreements that support socio-economic development, regional integration and the integration of Africa into the global economy&rdquo;.  As a result, the European Commission has this year engaged actively and flexibly in renewed negotiations at the regional level.  In tandem with this approach, at the end of September the Commission adopted a proposal, for submission to the Council, which would set a deadline of 1 January 2014 for the conclusion of the negotiations.</P><Col N="311"/>
        <P>As Minister of State for Trade and Development, I am following the negotiations for these trade agreements closely and we are considering the Commission&rsquo;s September proposal.  I believe it is essential that all such agreements clearly support the development needs of developing countries, and specifically their programmes to reduce poverty.  I am working with our partners to help ensure that the EU&rsquo;s negotiating approach is as flexible as possible under WTO law and that the negotiations being led by the European Commission serve to strengthen the EU&rsquo;s partnership with developing countries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has 58 Embassies, 7 multilateral missions and 11 Consulates General and other offices overseas.  In addition to their country of primary accreditation, many Ambassadors are also accredited to additional countries on a non-resident basis. Ireland&rsquo;s missions abroad perform a wide range of functions in pursuit of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy interests.  These include representing and advancing government policies with other States and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas; engaging with Irish communities and harnessing the resource they offer in assisting economic recovery; and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.  It will be noted, for example, that missions to international organisations have no direct trade promotional function.  </P>
        <P>The influence that a diplomatic mission can bring on trade volumes is just one of many factors that determine the overall level of business being conducted.  Our diplomatic missions have particular strengths in relation to facilitating access to key economic and business decision-makers; ensuring, in cooperation with the relevant State Agencies, that a cohesive message about the fundamentals of the Irish economy is conveyed to major opinion-formers internationally; targeted promotion and, in some locations, in dealing with regulatory issues.</P>
        <P>Since assuming office, I have directed that all embassies and consulates should redouble their efforts in promoting trade, in supporting Irish business and in seeking out new markets.  Ireland&rsquo;s network of Embassies and Consulates is also playing a frontline role in the drive to restore Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation.</P>
        <P>The Embassy network works very closely with the State Agencies with a remit for the promotion of Irish trade, tourism and inward investment &mdash; Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and IDA Ireland &mdash; and other relevant Departments in assisting Irish producers to find and access new markets.  Where possible, overseas offices of State Agencies are co-located with Irish Embassies and Consulates on the ground in an &lsquo;Ireland House&rsquo; arrangement.</P>
        <P>Local market teams, chaired by the local Ambassador and including representatives of State Agencies, have been established in all of the priority markets under the Trading and Investing <Col N="312"/>in a Smart Economy Strategy.  These teams prepare annual market development plans and report to the Export Trade Council which I chair.</P>
        <P>Below is a table listing all Irish Missions abroad, their operating budgets and the level of merchandise trade in 2010 in countries where Ireland has resident representation.  However, the variety of functions performed by diplomatic missions and the range of factors that affect trade volumes make it very difficult to establish any meaningful correlation between diplomatic costs and trade volumes. The budgets of missions that manage significant programmes on behalf of Irish Aid (Vote 29) reflect the additional management and oversight required for the effective implementation of those important programmes.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</askee>
        <Quest> his policy on both the Cambodian and Malaysian governments&rsquo; failure to regulate recruiters and employers which leaves Cambodian migrant domestic workers exposed to a wide range of abuses, in which tens of thousands of Cambodian women and girls who migrate to Malaysia have little protection against forced confinement in training centres, heavy debt burdens, and exploitative working conditions. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about the plight of Cambodian migrant domestic workers.    I understand from our Embassies in the region that discussions are going on at the highest political level between the two governments involved regarding this problem.  I welcome this and hope that the discussions will bring an end to the exploitation of these migrant domestic workers.</P><Col N="314"/>
        <P>I note that Cambodia and Malaysia have each ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).  As parties to these treaties, both countries have particular obligations in this regard. A number of UN agencies are working to protect the rights of domestic workers globally, a group often neglected by national labour laws.  In particular, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has a number of projects to address risks of vulnerable migrants in the greater Mekong region.</P>
        <P>New global standards address the specific obligations of governments to protect domestic workers. In June 2011, the International Labour Organization (ILO) adopted Convention No. 189 Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers.</P>
        <P>Although, like Ireland, both Cambodia and Malaysia have yet to ratify this new ILO Convention, it provides valuable guidance on the minimum standards that countries could implement.  These include equivalent labour protections provided to other workers, accessible complaints mechanisms, substantial penalties for agencies that violate standards, and prohibitions on salary deductions for recruitment fees.</P>
        <P>Ireland, through the Irish Aid programme of overseas development assistance, has supported a partnership programme with ILO for the past nine years.  This partnership has, among other issues, provided funding support to activities aimed at ending forced labour practices.  Gender equality is a priority issue in Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme.</P>

        <Quest> further to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech on 20 July 2011 following the publication of the Cloyne report, if he has been notified of any intention of the Holy Father, Benedict XVI, to make a pastoral or Head of State visit to Ireland in the coming 12 months; if he will consider inviting the Holy Father with a view to addressing the outstanding issues in relation to the issues raised in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech on that day; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no outstanding invitation to Pope Benedict XVI to visit Ireland, nor have the Government been made aware of any desire on the part of the Pope to visit Ireland in the coming twelve months.  I am sure, however, that should the Government be made aware of the Pope&rsquo;s interest in coming to Ireland at any time, an official invitation would be forthcoming.  As to the other matters raised in the question, I would refer the Deputy to the Statement of  8 September by the Government of Ireland on the response of the Holy See regarding the report of the Commission of Investigation into the Catholic Diocese of Cloyne, which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;The Government of Ireland thanks the Holy See for its response of 3 September regarding the report of the Commission of Investigation into the Catholic Diocese of Cloyne (the Cloyne Report) and the representations made to it by the T&aacute;naiste in this regard in his meeting with the Apostolic Nuncio on 14 July 2011.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Government acknowledges and welcomes the statement in the response that the Holy See is sorry and ashamed for the terrible sufferings which the victims of abuse and their families have endured.  The victims of abuse and their families must remain foremost in our considerations.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Having considered carefully the Cloyne Report and the response of the Holy See, the Government of Ireland remains of the view that the content of the confidential letter in 1997 from the then Apostolic Nuncio, Archbishop Storero, to the Irish Bishops, regardless of <Col N="315"/>whether or not it was intended to do so, provided a pretext for some members of the clergy to evade full cooperation with the Irish civil authorities in regard to the abuse of minors. This is a matter of great concern to the Irish Government.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Government of Ireland notes the comments in the Holy See&rsquo;s response on the political debate which ensued in Ireland after the publication of the Cloyne Report and in particular the statements made by the Taoiseach and other political leaders.  The Government of Ireland must point out that the comments made by the Taoiseach and other political leaders accurately reflect the public anger of the overwhelming majority of Irish people at the failure of the Catholic Church in Ireland and the Holy See to deal adequately with clerical child sexual abuse and those who committed such appalling acts.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">It is the Government of Ireland&rsquo;s hope that, in spite of outstanding differences, lessons have been learned from appalling past failures.  In this regard, it welcomes the commitment in the concluding remarks of the Holy See&rsquo;s response to a constructive dialogue and cooperation with the Government.  In welcoming this commitment, the Government expects the fullest cooperation from the Holy See, the Catholic Church in Ireland and all other relevant bodies with a view to ensuing that Ireland is a society fully safe for children and minors and that all of those with responsibility for the welfare and care of children in this country are fully subject to Irish laws and requirements.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">In this context, I look forward to an early exchange of Ambassadors between Ireland and the Holy See and to our close cooperation in dealing with the scourge of child sexual abuse.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 36 together.</P>
        <P>The Government welcomed the adoption by the United Nations Security Council of Resolution 1973 on 17 March which demanded the immediate establishment of a cease-fire, a complete end to violence and all attacks against, and abuse of, civilians and which decided to establish a no fly zone over Libya in order to help protect civilians.  I have no doubt that, had resolution 1973 not been passed, thousands of people in Benghazi &mdash; and elsewhere in Libya &mdash; would have suffered the &lsquo;merciless&rsquo; retaliation which Gaddafi himself promised as his forces massed on the edge of that city. Indeed, in the months that followed, despite NATO efforts, <Col N="316"/>civilians in Libya remained under attack by pro-Gaddafi forces, including through indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas and the use of cluster munitions.</P>
        <P>At any point, Colonel Gaddafi could have brought the conflict to an immediate end by ordering his forces to cease their attacks on civilians and enabling a transition process to begin. Intensive political efforts largely conducted under the auspices of UN Secretary General Ban&rsquo;s Special Envoy, Mr. al-Khatib, continued throughout the conflict to try and bring about such an agreed ceasefire. The role of regional organisations, including the African Union as well as the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Conferences, was extremely valuable and supportive of such peace initiatives which were, however, consistently thwarted by the Gaddafi regime&rsquo;s unwillingness to comply fully with the relevant Security Council resolutions and halt attacks against the civilian population.  It is worth noting that it was the Arab League which initially called for a no-fly zone to be implemented over Libya. Ireland and the EU strongly supported and advocated a leading role by the relevant regional organisations in seeking to resolve the Libyan conflict.</P>
        <P>NATO&rsquo;s Operation Unified Protector ceased its operations on 31 October 2011, following adoption of Security Council Resolution 2016 terminating the no fly zone over Libya.  On the basis of the monthly reports submitted by the NATO Secretary General to the Security Council, it would appear that NATO made every effort to comply fully with its mandate of civilian protection, to avoid civilian casualties and to honour its obligations under Resolution 1973 and international humanitarian law.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that very major human rights violations did occur during the recent conflict in Libya, including cases of extra-judicial killings, which according to reports were perpetrated by both sides to the conflict.  Respect for human rights and the rule of law will be crucial in the new Libya and must be a key priority for the National Transitional Council and its international partners.  I welcome the commitment of the NTC and its leaders to protect and promote human rights, to fully investigate allegations of human rights violations, and to fully cooperate with the Commission of Inquiry established by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law in Libya. I also welcome that the NTC has extended an open invitation to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council to visit Libya.</P>
        <P>The ending of impunity in Libya and accountability for any violations committed during the conflict must also entail a full, impartial and credible investigation into the circumstances surrounding Colonel Gaddafi&rsquo;s death.  I welcome the NTC&rsquo;s commitment to conduct such an investigation which is essential if Libya is to move forward on a path towards full democracy in which the rule of law and basic human rights are fully respected.</P>

        <P>The operating budgets for the Embassies in Iran and the Holy See for 2011 amount to &euro;420,987 and &euro;348,049 respectively. These allocations cover items such as local staff salary costs, premises expenses, office machinery, official travel and post and telecommunications.

Given the current budgetary situation, and recognising the role that our diplomatic network is playing in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery, any further adjustments to our diplomatic network will continue to be strategically focused.</P>

	<P>I am aware of recent reports, produced by international organisations such as Human Rights Watch, that allege mines in Zambia, in particular those operated by Chinese firms, are dangerously unsafe, with poor health and safety conditions in contravention of labour laws and regulations. China is a very significant investor in the Zambian economy particularly in the critically important mining industry which accounts for over seventy percent of Zambia&rsquo;s foreign earnings. I am concerned about the nature of the allegations made in these reports and I will closely follow the response of the Government of the Republic of Zambia.</P>
        <P>The recently elected President of Zambia, Michael Sata, has been very strong in his commitment to improving workers&rsquo; rights and labour conditions. The new Government has announced its intention to review the minimum wage in Zambia and also its labour laws and regulations to ensure stiffer penalties are in place for those employers found guilty of exploitation of workers. I understand that tripartite discussions have already commenced in this respect involving representatives of Government, employers and workers.</P>
        <P>Ireland has the opportunity to regularly raise issues of concern with the Government of Zambia, through our Embassy in Lusaka and together with the European Union.</P>
        <P>Ireland has also supported improved labour conditions in Zambia through our support to the International Labour Organisation. One element of that support has been to address the issue of forced labour. With Irish Aid support, the International Labour Organisation has worked with the Ministry of Labour in Zambia to strengthen the capacity of labour inspectors to detect and act on possible cases of forced labour and severe exploitation.</P>

	<P>The second Global Irish Economic Forum was held in Dublin Castle on the 7th and 8th of October.  The primary purposes of the Forum were to engage fully with the Irish Diaspora in developing Ireland&rsquo;s global business and trade relations; to discuss face-to-face the Government&rsquo;s priorities for economic renewal with key members of the international business community; and to strengthen ties with the Irish Diaspora as a key part of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to restore Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation abroad.  There was an exceptional uptake on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s invitation from among members of the Global Irish Network.  In addition to the members of the Network, attendees also included members of the Government, Secretaries General of Government Departments, CEOs of State Agencies and members of the Opposition and leading members of the Irish business and cultural sectors. </P><Col N="319"/>
        <P>Over the course of the two days, I made an address at the opening session and took part in the opening plenary debate which discussed &ldquo;Ireland: the road to recovery&rdquo;.  I was also a panellist for other debates including &ldquo;<i>Ireland&rsquo;s image abroad: communicating the message&rdquo; and the closing plenary discussion, alongside the Taoiseach and President Clinton.</i></P>
        <P>In response to requests from participants at the 2009 Forum, a considerable amount of time was devoted to small breakout working groups. Each working group focussed on a topic of relevance to the Programme for Government and, in most cases, involved the participation of the relevant Minister, Minister of State and/or representatives from appropriate Departments or State Agencies.  I took part in two working groups, &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s reputation abroad&rdquo; on 7 October and the &ldquo;Job Creation&rdquo; group on 8 October. I also delivered the closing address to the Forum.</P>
        <P>The Forum was marked by a high level of enthusiasm among the participants, with candour and frankness characterising the discussions. The feedback to date from all who attended has been extremely positive with participants expressing significant satisfaction with the quality of the discussions and the management of the event.</P>

	<P>As a small trading country increasing the volume of our exports is vital to ensure sustainable growth for our economy.  Despite the difficult trading conditions Irish exports have proved resilient in recent years.  The total value of merchandise exports in 2010 was &euro;162.7 billion, the highest ever total, representing growth of 8% on the 2009 figure.  Services exports have also seen growth in that period, increasing from &euro;67.1 billion in 2009 to &euro;73.8 billion in 2010.  My Department is focused on achieving maximum growth in exports for Ireland through progressively implementing, with other Departments and State Agencies, the recommendations in the Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015.  In this context I was pleased to chair the first meeting of the Export Trade Council recently.  The Council will strengthen co-operation and co-ordination across all Government Departments and State Agencies involved in the promotion and development of trade and exports.</P>
        <P>Ireland has 58 Embassies, 7 multilateral missions and 11 Consulates General and other offices overseas.  In addition to their country of primary accreditation, many Ambassadors are also accredited to additional countries on a non-resident basis.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s missions abroad perform a wide range of functions in pursuit of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy interests.  An important focus, among these, is working actively to restore Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation and to support export led growth.  Local market teams, chaired by the local Ambassador and including representatives of State Agencies have been established in all of the priority markets under the Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy Strategy.  These teams prepare annual market development plans and report to the Export Trade Council.</P><Col N="320"/>
        <P>The State Agencies with a remit for the promotion of Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and IDA Ireland, also have offices overseas.  Where possible they are co-located with Irish Embassies and Consulates on the ground in an &lsquo;Ireland House&rsquo; arrangement.  However, even where the Ireland House concept does not apply, the Embassy network works closely with the State Agencies and other relevant Departments in assisting Irish producers to overcome barriers to export and find new markets.</P>

	<P>Addressing the situation of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements with the United States remain important priorities for the Government in its relationship with the US Administration and Congress.  The Taoiseach and I discussed these issues with President Obama when we met with him on 23 May in Dublin.  Responding to our concerns, the President expressed his interest in achieving progress.</P>
        <P>I also discussed the issue of Irish immigration with Secretary of State Clinton during our meeting on 18 March and with Senator Patrick Leahy, Chair of the Senate Judiciary committee when I met him in Dublin on 3 June.  I met with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and the Coalition of Irish Centres in New York on 23 September.  The Government has provided almost $365,000 to support that organisation since 2006, including $40,000 this year.</P>
        <P>Acting on my behalf, our Embassy in Washington continues to engage on an ongoing basis with the US Administration at various levels and with both parties in the US Congress.</P>
        <P>The introduction of a new Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill in the Senate on 22 June last is a welcome development.  This Bill which has been brought by senior Democrats including Senators Harry Reid, Charles Schumer, and Robert Menendez is similar to that introduced in the previous Congress and, once again, includes provision for a new E-3 visa for Ireland.  While Senator Menendez has indicated that in circulating the bill he aimed to provide a framework for debate and negotiations, the continued inclusion of the E-3 for Ireland in the Bill represents an important achievement for the Government and the Irish community.</P>
        <P>The successful passage of E3 visa legislation would strengthen the human bridge between the two countries, which underpins our excellent existing bilateral relations, and provide a mechanism for Irish nationals seeking to work in the USA in the future.  However, and while we continue to press for such a scheme, including with members of Congress, any efforts to pass immigration-related legislation in the current US domestic political climate would face considerable challenges.</P>
        <P>I am also conscious that the E3 would not provide a solution to the difficulties faced by the undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I and my Department, particularly the Embassy in Washington, will continue to work very actively on highlighting the situation of the undocumented Irish in the US in our contacts with the US Administration, Congressional leaders and Irish immigration reform advocates, and work towards identifying positive outcomes on their behalf.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together. </P>
        <P>Since its inception in 1974, Ireland&rsquo;s programme of official development assistance has had a particular focus on the continent of Africa.  Both historically, and in many cases up to and including the present day, African countries have been obliged to face enormous difficulties, including food insecurity, poverty, protracted conflict, environmental degradation, weak government capacity, unequal global trading relationships, severe infrastructural weaknesses, poor governance, debt and the effects of HIV/AIDS.</P>
        <P>In an effort to help the countries of the continent confront these far-reaching challenges, approximately eighty percent of Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance continues to be channelled to Africa, with Irish Aid operating intensive and wide-ranging country programmes in Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zambia, Uganda and Malawi.  Thanks in part to this support, many of these countries have made significant progress with regard to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including in relation to the fight against extreme poverty, work to improve school enrolment and child health, and activities aimed at expanding access to HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment.  In addition to this bilateral support, Irish Aid also provides development assistance to these and other countries in Africa, through our partnerships with the United Nations, the Red Cross family and NGOs such as Concern, Goal and Tr&oacute;caire.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy notes, some countries in Africa continue to face particularly acute challenges in terms of conflict and food insecurity.  Irish Aid&rsquo;s emergency humanitarian budget allows us to respond quickly and effectively to needs arising from such emergencies as well as to the effects of natural disasters across the continent.</P>
        <P>Most recently, this budget has helped to form the central component in the Government&rsquo;s response to the increasingly dire situation in the Horn of Africa.  With almost &euro;11 million in emergency assistance allocated to date and a pledge to provide a total of &euro;20 million in humanitarian assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable in the region before the end of 2012 , this means that Ireland&rsquo;s contribution is one of the most significant and generous responses to the crisis on a per capita basis.  In addition to this financial help, Irish Aid has also carried out two airlifts of humanitarian supplies from its pre-positioned stockpiles in Dubai and deployed 24 members of its highly skilled Rapid Response Corps to directly assist in humanitarian operations on the ground.</P>
        <P>The Government has also been actively involved at EU and international level in pushing for a strongly coordinated approach to the humanitarian crisis in the Horn.  In this context, the T&aacute;naiste and I look forward to addressing the issues involved, including the ongoing conflict and instability in Somalia, at next week&rsquo;s meeting of EU foreign and development ministers in Brussels.  We have also led the way in discussions on the issues involved in a variety of fora in Geneva and New York where we have stressed the need to move beyond the trauma of the present and towards a vision of sustainable long-term food security across the region.  In spite <Col N="322"/>of the enormous challenges faced both in the Horn and elsewhere across the continent, progress is undoubtedly being made right across Africa.  Indeed, many countries, previously mired in poverty, are experiencing rapid economic growth and developing faster than ever before.  While remaining committed to helping to tackle poverty and inequality and to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable communities in Africa, the Government is therefore eager to strengthen our overall engagement in the continent and to take a fresh look at ways in which both we and our African partners can benefit from the opportunities involved.  In recognition of these new and exciting opportunities, the T&aacute;naiste and I recently launched the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s new Africa Strategy at the first ever Africa-Ireland Economic Forum at the Smurfit School of Business in Dublin.</P>

	<P>Ireland, together with our EU partners, is committed to enhancing stability in the Western Balkans region. The EU perspective for the countries in the region, agreed at the June 2003 Thessaloniki European Council, is essential in helping to build and maintain this stability. The EU will remain engaged in assisting the countries in the region to undertake the reforms necessary to move forward in their path to the EU.  While there remain issues of serious concern, and much remains to be achieved at national level, the regional dynamic is more encouraging.  The expected signature of Croatia&rsquo;s Accession Treaty at the European Council in December is particularly welcome evidence of this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The arrests this summer of Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic and their swift transfer to the Tribunal in The Hague marked an important milestone for reconciliation in the Western Balkans. The arrests demonstrated the commitment of President Tadi&aelig; and the Serbian Government to fulfilling their obligations with regard to International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) cooperation.</P>
        <P>These arrests were preceded by a number of important initiatives by the governments of the region to deal with the legacy of the Balkan Wars. In March 2010, Serbia&rsquo;s parliament passed a declaration condemning the Srebrenica massacre and apologising to the families of the victims. In the same month, Bosnia and Herzegovina appointed an Ambassador to Serbia after a three-year hiatus. This was followed by a joint visit by the Serbian and Croatian Presidents to Bosnia and Herzegovina in July 2010 to attend a commemoration to mark the 15th anniversary the Srebrenica massacre. In November 2010, the Serbian and Croatian Presidents paid a joint visit to Vukovar in Croatia, where the Serbian President laid a wreath to commemorate the victims of the three-month siege in 1991.</P>
        <P>Over the past two years, the region has also received a boost in its relations with the EU through the extension of a visa waiver scheme for entry to the Schengen Zone to almost all countries of the Western Balkans.</P>
        <P>Following on from a joint EU-Serbia resolution at the UN General Assembly last year, Serbia and Kosovo have been engaged in an EU-facilitated dialogue since March 2011. The talks are focused on practical matters such as land registry, customs stamps, telecoms and electricity. It is hoped that the parties will reach agreement on some of these matters soon, even if higher level talks have been delayed because of the continuing tension in northern <Col N="323"/>Kosovo, where members of the local Serb population have resisted the location of Kosovo police and customs officials at the northern border between Kosovo and Serbia.</P>
        <P>Elections took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Albania and Macedonia in the past year. In all cases, the elections passed off peacefully and marked an improvement on past elections.</P>
        <P>However, more than a year after the elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina, government formation has yet to be completed and the political atmosphere remains difficult. In May, EU High Representative Ashton achieved a notable success in the EU&rsquo;s efforts to stabilise the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina when she persuaded President Dodik of the Republika Srpska to repeal a planned referendum which could have questioned the state-level judiciary and the international presence in the country.</P>
        <P>Montenegro, which was granted candidate status last December, was the subject of a broadly positive assessment in October by the Commission, which is now proposing that a date be agreed to open negotiations on accession.</P>
        <P>While the Council of Ministers has already agreed that accession negotiations should begin with Macedonia, the &ldquo;name&rdquo; issue remains a stumbling block.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s aid programme, which is managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is sharply focused on the fight against global poverty and hunger.  It is recognised internationally for its effectiveness, and for its concentration on some of the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid channels a higher proportion of overall assistance through development Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) than other international donors, reflecting the strong support of the Irish people for the work of NGOs and missionaries.  This assistance is provided to support the long term development work of NGOs, in accordance with the objectives of the Government&rsquo;s aid programme, the work of NGOs on emergency and humanitarian assistance, and development education programmes.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid has established strict eligibility criteria to determine which NGOs are eligible to apply for significant grant funding.  The main eligibility criteria include a proven organisational capacity for the effective use of funding, a solid track record of delivery and a sound compliance record.</P>
        <P>The partnership between Irish Aid and NGOs is focused on the achievement of real and long term development results in the lives of some the most vulnerable people in the world.  This is achieved through the targeting of assistance to some of the most remote and disadvantaged communities in sub-Saharan Africa.  Aid interventions are prioritised to reach the poorest and most vulnerable members of those communities who are further disadvantaged on grounds of gender, disability or minority status.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid assesses and evaluates the NGO programmes against specific objectives and expected results.  Procedures to ensure funding is used for maximum benefit include regular field monitoring visits to programme partners, annual narrative and financial reporting against <Col N="324"/>agreed objectives and budgets, end of programme evaluations and ongoing reviews of compliance.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Evaluation and Audit Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade periodically evaluates and audits NGO partners.  Recently evaluations of Concern, Goal, Tr&oacute;caire and Christian Aid have been completed and provide evidence that Ireland&rsquo;s funding to these NGOs has contributed to the alleviation of poverty and vulnerability in the communities where they work.</P>
        <P>The Government is firmly committed to targeting our aid to ensure the alleviation of poverty among the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Our NGO partners will continue to play a crucial role as we strive to achieve the maximum benefit from Ireland&rsquo;s development co-operation programme and its contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</P>

	<P>As I have previously stated in my reply to PQ27601/11 of 4 October, the human rights situation in Iran is profoundly disturbing, and the period since the Presidential election of 2009 has been characterised by an intensification of human rights abuses on many fronts. I am greatly concerned about the targeting of the academic community and educators in Iran, amid a widespread and intentional erosion of political and civil freedoms in Iran. I deplore the jail sentences of four and five year terms which have been handed down in recent days to seven members of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; community in Iran associated with the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; Institute for Higher Education in Iran. I reiterate my call upon the government of Iran to respect fully its obligations under international human rights instruments. In this regard, I fully support the strong Conclusions on human rights in Iran issued by the Foreign Affairs Council on 10 October as well as the statements of EU High Representatives Catherine Ashton on this issue. The EU has repeatedly raised human rights issues in Iran with the Iranian authorities this year. In a further effort to increase the EU&rsquo;s impact on human rights in Iran, the Foreign Affairs Council on 10 October decided to add additional individuals to the travel ban and asset freeze it had adopted on 12 April 2011 against those responsible for grave human rights violations.  This sends an important political signal to those in the judicial system and elsewhere in the Iranian regime who perpetrate human rights abuses. The EU has also introduced measures to enable it to respond in a more timely fashion to serious violations of human rights in Iran while also trying to keep some basic channels of communications open with the Iranian authorities. I welcome these steps which demonstrate the depth of our concern. Ireland will continue to be active at EU level in pressing for stronger EU action in relation to the human rights situation in Iran.</P>
        <P>At UN level, Ireland was active in ensuring the successful adoption at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in March of a decision providing for appointment of a Special Rapporteur to examine Iran&rsquo;s human rights situation. I welcome the first report of Ahmed Shaheed as Special Rapporteur on 28 October and regret the fact that Mr Shaheed was not permitted to visit Iran. I call upon the Government of Iran to take immediate steps to address the serious violations of human rights highlighted in the report and which was based on first-hand testimonies from individuals and organisations, including the dramatic increase in executions in Iran, as <Col N="325"/>well as the repression of opposition leaders Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi and their wives. I also call upon Iran to facilitate full and unhindered access to Iran for Mr Shaheed. A further resolution expressing the international community&rsquo;s deep concern at the human rights situation in Iran, and calling upon the Government of Iran to take a number of specific and urgent steps to improve the situation, is likely to be adopted by the UN General Assembly later this month. Ireland, together with EU member states, will co-sponsor this resolution.</P>
        <P>At a bilateral level, my Department engages in ongoing dialogue with the Iranian Ambassador and his Embassy on these issues. My officials have already held a number of meetings with the Ambassador since the start of this year to convey our grave concerns at the human rights situation in Iran. Ireland will continue to raise human rights in Iran, including the rights of academics and other detainees, bilaterally and at the EU and UN, at all appropriate occasions.</P>

	<P>Human Rights are, and have always been, a priority of successive Irish Governments and a central part of our foreign policy.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources, including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations.  Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council.  We fully support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses, including supporting the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedures and Mandate Holders and the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. The EU regularly makes statements at these UN bodies on the human rights situations in a number of countries from all regions. Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</P>
        <P>Since its creation in March 2006 Ireland has proactively engaged with the UN Human Rights Council&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism.  The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 192 UN Member States every four years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments.  Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance. Ireland was examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011.  We welcome the opportunity provided by the UPR mechanism to help us to examine the issues and recommendations raised by UN Member States some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and consider how we can improve the protection and promotion of human rights.  Ireland has also made numerous interventions at the UPR sessions during the examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the States under review.</P>
        <P>The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.</P><Col N="326"/>
        <P>Together with our EU partners, we have been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</P>
        <P>Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and Human Rights Council on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as in the implementation plan of EU Guidelines on human rights defenders in third countries, to ensure human rights defenders can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.</P>
        <P>Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, Irish Aid supports concrete actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions, in particular through legal training. Legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses is also supported and Irish Aid has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Democratic transition in any country must first and foremost be led by the country itself if the budding democracy is to have deep and enduring roots. However, there are important practical and political ways in which the international community can assist. With this in mind, the international community has extended significant help &mdash; and will continue to do so &mdash; to Europe&rsquo;s neighbours who have recently embarked upon a democratic transition: Libya, Egypt and Tunisia.  With regard to Libya, for example, the High-level Meeting on Libya in New York on 20 September en marge of the 66th session of the UNGA, which I attended, made clear the international community&rsquo;s political support for the National Transitional Council as the interim authorities in Libya as well as providing for formal acceptance into the United Nations of the new Libya.  The Security Council also authorised on 16 September a United Nations Support Mission for Libya (UNSMIL) which will lead the international community&rsquo;s practical assistance during the transition period to Libyan national efforts in a range of areas, including the restoration of public security and order, the promotion of rule of law, the restoration of public services and support for human rights.</P>
        <P>In Tunisia and Egypt, too, the international community has rallied to offer support to the interim authorities. In addition to substantial financial assistance, there has also been assistance directly aimed at building a democratic culture. For example, at Tunisia&rsquo;s request, the EU deployed an EU Electoral Observation Mission to assess and offer recommendations on Tunisia&rsquo;s first democratic elections on 23 October and has offered similar assistance to the Egyptian authorities. Another example of practical assistance was the first meeting of the EU-Tunisia Taskforce on 21 and 22 September which sought to galvanise private sector development in <Col N="327"/>Tunisia. Economic development will be a key factor in the successful democratisation of these countries, and must be considered as an integral part of the democratisation effort.</P>
        <P>Ireland and the EU&rsquo;s overall approach to the Southern Neighbourhood during this transition period is guided by the reformulated European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) which was partly shaped by events in North Africa and which Heads of State and Government broadly endorsed at the European Council in June 2011. One principle outlined in the ENP is the concept of positive conditionality or &ldquo;more for more&rdquo;. This concept allows for greater political association, economic integration, mobility and financial support for neighbouring partners in return for progress on democratic reforms and closer alignment with the EU&rsquo;s core values. The revised ENP also allows for greater cooperation with civil society. The ENP is complemented by regional and multilateral co-operation through the Union for Mediterranean (UfM). The UfM is an intergovernmental process which emphasises economic and social cooperation.</P>
        <P>Ireland and the EU will continue to seek ways to assist Libya, Tunisia and Egypt in their nascent democratic transitions which have the potential to bring greater economic growth and stability to this neighbouring region.</P>

	<P>As outlined in my statement on Thursday last, it was with the greatest regret and reluctance that a decision had to be made to close Ireland&rsquo;s Embassies to the Holy See and Iran and its representative office in Timor Leste.  This decision is in line with the tough choices that the Government must make to address the current economic challenges that face the country.</P>
        <P>Our targets under the EU/IMF programme and our need to reduce public expenditure mean that cuts to public expenditure must be made across a wide range of public services, including our diplomatic service.</P>
        <P>The decision to close the three Missions followed a thorough review of the overseas diplomatic network in which particular attention was paid to the promotion of Irish economic interests and the economic return from missions abroad.</P>
        <P>Diplomatic relations will be maintained with these three States and I can assure the Deputy that we intend to continue our active engagement with the Holy See, Iran and Timor Leste.  However, our diplomatic network needs to be flexible and responsive to changing circumstances.  The Government believes that our relations can be sufficiently dealt with by a non-resident Ambassador to each of the States concerned.  As regards the Embassy to the Holy See, the Government is of the view that our interests can be sufficiently secured by a non-resident Ambassador.  The Government has nominated a senior Dublin-based diplomat to this position.</P>
        <P>The intention is to relocate the offices of the Embassy to Italy and the residence of the Ambassador to Italy to the Villa Spada, the present premises of the Embassy to the Holy See.  Given that the Villa Spada is owned by the State, this will allow a considerable saving in annual rental costs.  It will also retain a useful asset for the State as the platform from which the Embassy to Italy can promote Irish interests in that country.</P>

	<P>The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is the UN agency which has responsibility for the provision of assistance and services to five million Palestinian refugees in five areas of operation, the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.  The agency operates essential programmes for its target population in areas such as basic education, health care, community employment and food aid for vulnerable families and delivers an annual budget of some &euro;450 million.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been, and continues to be, a strong supporter of UNRWA and its vital work. In 2010, Ireland pledged a commitment of &euro;12 million over the three year period 2010-2012 to UNRWA&rsquo;s general fund and remains on target to meet this pledge.  As a result, programme funding of &euro;4 million has been provided in each of 2010 and 2011, including &euro;2 million earmarked for use to assist the particularly vulnerable Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.</P>
        <P>In addition, a further &euro;550,000 in humanitarian assistance was made available to UNRWA in 2011. This included &euro;500,000 in response to the agency&rsquo;s emergency funding appeal in Gaza last month to address shortfalls in funding which represented a considerable threat to food supplies for vulnerable Palestinian families.  Further support of &euro;50,000 was provided for UNRWA&rsquo;s summer games programme for children in Gaza.  This assistance brings total support to date in 2011 to &euro;4.55 million.    Over the past five years, funding of &euro;21.7 million has been provided to assist UNRWA in helping vulnerable Palestinians.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s position as a key donor to UNRWA and the significant levels of funding provided over recent years to assist vulnerable populations have also resulted in Ireland&rsquo;s appointment to UNRWA&rsquo;s Advisory Commission in 2008, following a resolution of the UN General Assembly.  The Advisory Commission provides guidance to UNRWA on key issues relating to the agency&rsquo;s management and organisation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 56, 58, 61 and 62 together. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I would very much hope that individuals already saving for their retirement and those considering doing so would not be unduly influenced in a negative way by the pension fund levy. The levy is a charge for a temporary period on the significant assets of pension funds, much of which are represented by investments outside of Ireland. The Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 legislation which gives effect to the pension fund levy provisions makes clear that it is to apply for a four year period only.</P>
        <P>The moneys raised from the pension fund levy is being used to pay for the tax reductions, including VAT and PRSI reductions, and the additional expenditure measures announced in the Jobs Initiative in May last. There are timing differences as between the receipt of moneys from the levy and the measures which the levy will fund but the Jobs Initiative is designed to be budgetary neutral over the 4 year period 2011-2014.</P>
        <P>The various measures in the Initiative represent the first steps by this Government towards improving the competitiveness of important sectors of the economy and facilitating the return to work of people currently unemployed. The levy is a reasonable and targeted tax measure being introduced to fund the various measures set out in the Jobs Initiative.  The country is facing an economic and unemployment crisis and the Jobs Initiative will help tackle that crisis and applying a temporary levy to pension funds is less damaging economically than raising other taxes.</P>
        <P>As regards speculation that the Government would now proceed to &ldquo;raid&rdquo; investment funds or deposit accounts, I want to assure you that the Government has no plans whatsoever in this regard.  The Government regards it as its top priority to safeguard the security of savings and would not wish to consider any step that would impact negatively upon confidence in this area.   Other savings or investment products have not benefited from the generous tax reliefs that pension savings have historically been granted and continue to receive. Deposit accounts and savings products have already been subjected to additional taxation in recent budgets, via the increase in the rate of DIRT and exit taxes, neither of which impacted on pension funds. There is the view that tax relief on contributions to pension saving is<i> </i>simply tax deferred and<i> </i>  that such reliefs are balanced by the eventual taxation of pension benefits over the period of payment of the pension.</P>
        <P>While I understand this view to a point, these matters are not always so clear cut. For example, while individuals will get tax relief at the marginal rate on their pension contributions out of pre-retirement income, the tax liability on their retirement benefits will be impacted by issues such as the tax-free retirement lump sum and the level of post-retirement income.</P>
        <P>Individuals may be affected in different ways by the pension fund levy. However, I am not in a position to comment on what the precise impact of the levy will be in all cases on individuals or individual funds, schemes, members or retired members as this depends on whether and to what extent pension fund trustees and Life Offices decide to pass on the levy to individual members, given the particular circumstances of the pension funds or pension plans that they are responsible for.</P>
        <P>I can say that the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 provisions include certain safeguards in this area.   The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, will be entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it must essentially be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members. <Col N="330"/>In no case may the reduction in an individual member&rsquo;s or class of member&rsquo;s benefits exceed the member&rsquo;s or class of member&rsquo;s share of the levy.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are given authority to review any case where assets are disposed of by administrators or trustees in order to pay the levy so as to ensure that any such disposals are in keeping with or needed to pay the levy.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are also afforded oversight authority to review, where they consider it appropriate, instances where benefits are adjusted as a result of the payment of the levy to ensure that any such adjustment is in keeping with the requirements of the levy legislation. In undertaking any such review Revenue may consult with appropriate experts as they see fit. However, before Revenue could act in that regard, instances of concern on foot of actual adjustments made would first have to be brought to their attention.</P>

	<P>In the particular circumstances outlined, where a couple is cohabiting rather than married, they are treated as separate and unconnected individuals for the purpose of Income Tax.  Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes and, accordingly, credits, bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.     Cohabitating couples are expressly recognised for the purpose of social welfare law but are not recognised for the purposes of Income Tax law. Although this may appear contradictory, the main aim of both the welfare code and the tax code is to uphold the constitutional right of married couples not to be treated less favourably than unmarried couples.</P>
        <P>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy v the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.</P>
        <P>The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</P>

	<P>The provision of certain free or subsidised childcare facilities by employers were exempt from a benefit-in-kind charge on the employees that availed of such facilities. This exemption was abolished in Budget and Finance Act 2011. <Col N="331"/>With a view to keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers, there was no notification procedure for employers involved. Accordingly, the Revenue Commissioners do not have separately identifiable costs or statistics for the scheme.   It was estimated at the time of Budget 2011 that its abolition would yield &euro;3 million to the Exchequer in 2011 and &euro;6 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>The relief was introduced in 1999 to encourage employers to invest in childcare facilities and thus increase the overall supply of childcare places. At the time of its introduction, there was a scarcity of childcare places and the costs associated with childcare were increasing. The aim of the exemption was to encourage employers who were not traditionally associated with the provision of childcare to provide such facilities for their employees.</P>
        <P>Cost was not the only factor that was taken into account when the decision was taken to abolish the exemption. Indeed, the Commission on Taxation recommended the abolition of this exemption, citing equity, due to the likelihood that only large employers would have the ability to make the necessary investments.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the abolition of this relief, a number of other support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying FAS and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above supports, an exemption from income tax for individuals who mind children in their own home is also available. To avail of this scheme, the childminder concerned may not mind more than 3 children, excluding their own. This income exemption is subject to a limit of &euro;15,000 per annum.</P>
        <P>In view of the availability of all of the above-mentioned supports, I have no plans to re-introduce the benefit-in-kind exemption.</P>

	<P>The Central Bank has advised me that they wrote to all mortgage lenders to ascertain whether they were offering, or intended to offer, a mortgage product that would allow home owners to sell their existing home and transfer the negative equity portion of the original loan to the new loan.  The Central Bank was concerned as to whether such products were in the long term interest of consumers as it could lead to indebtedness at a time when there was no certainty over the direction of future property values. In addition consumers would be moving to a new product and consequently those on tracker mortgages would move to fixed or standard variable rates which were generally higher than existing tracker rates. The higher rates would impact on the continued affordability of such mortgages and there would also be an increase in the loan to value ratios of many mortgages.  In response to the Central Bank&rsquo;s letter, only a small number of mortgage lenders said that they would consider offering such a facility, but it would be on an exceptional basis, would only be considered following an approach from an existing customer and would be subject to strict criteria in relation to debt service ratio, net disposable income, loan to value ratios, <Col N="332"/>income multiples, credit history, transparency and suitability. A trial period commenced in mid-2011 and was due to be assessed by the Central Bank and the institutions involved before the end of the year. However, the low level of activity makes it difficult to conduct a meaningful review at this time and the proposed review will not take place until the first half of 2012. Any institution offering such a facility may only do so in accordance with criteria agreed in advance with the Central Bank and subject to a trial period. Consequently any arrangement that might be agreed with a customer would have to be in the context of the parameters set out above and not as a result of the introduction of a negative equity type product.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware when the Programme of Financial Support was initially agreed in late 2010, the average interest rate on the &euro;67.5 billion available to drawdown from the external sources was estimated to be 5.82% on the basis of market rates at the time of the agreement. The average life of the borrowings, which will involve a combination of longer and shorter dated maturities, under each of the sources was initially set at 7.5 years.    The Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HOSG) agreed on 21 July 2011 to reduce the cost of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to lending rates equivalent to those of the Balance of Payments facility close to, without going below, the EFSF funding cost.</P>
        <P>In addition, further amendments to the EFSF framework have removed the interest rate margin on EFSF funds and were incorporated into a new legal agreement on the 27th of October in which the interest rate margin is now defined as zero. The agreement incorporates a guarantee commitment fee of 0.1% per annum and a service fee to cover the cost of operations of the EFSF. It is now estimated that the overall net reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s EFSF interest rate margin and other changes will be in the range of 2.7% to 2.8%. It should be noted that the EFSF&rsquo;s cost of funds depends on the interest rate it pays for its market issuance when raising funds for programme countries.</P>
        <P>In October, the EU Council of Ministers approved an EU Commission proposal to eliminate the margin of 2.925% on the EFSM facility. This change was incorporated into an amendment to the existing legal agreement on 28th of October and the margin is now defined as zero. This will apply to EFSM borrowings back to the date upon which they were issued. The actual cost of funding depends on the prevailing market rates at the time of each drawdown.</P>
        <P>Lengthening of maturities provides benefits in terms of phasing of loans and ensuring that the profile of redemptions is more orderly &mdash; avoiding as far as possible exceptionally large amounts in particular years. By contrast, money borrowed at longer maturities is generally more expensive. However, on balance, savings arising from maturity extension are significant though complex to calculate.</P>
        <P>Given these changes, figures provided by the NTMA show that the total savings on the original EU facilities with an average life of 7.5 years is some &euro;9 billion, or approximately 5.7% of 2011 estimated GDP. This reduces the annual repayment on these loans by an average of &euro;1.2 billion per year over 7.5 years or by an approximate average margin reduction of 2.80 percentage points.</P><Col N="333"/>
        <P>In addition, the cost of our IMF loans will reduce as a result of recent and forthcoming increases in our IMF quota. The NTMA has calculated the overall benefit of this interest rate reduction at some &euro;1.9 billion. Some &euro;30 million of this arises in 2012. In the case of the IMF loans, the estimated savings take account of a quota increase which will not come into effect before autumn 2012 at the earliest. These expected savings may change either upwards or downwards in the light of future quota revisions.</P>
        <P>For 2012, the interest rate margin reductions in the EU and bilateral loans amount to some &euro;875 million. When the impact of the IMF changes are taken into account, the savings amount to some &euro;900 million on a General Government basis or a reduction of our interest repayment in 2012 of 0.57% of the current 2012 GDP estimate.</P>

	<P>The EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support provides the funding we need for essential public services.  The Government has repeatedly stated its commitment to the Programme targets.  Meeting these conditions on time and on target, is the best way to ensure that we emerge successfully from this programme.  That will mean that we can return safely to the financial markets for funding in as timely a manner as possible.  This is one of the principal objectives of the programme.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the Programme does not stop us from seeking and agreeing changes to aspects of the programme.  We have already done this successfully.  The Government will continue to do so at the appropriate time.  In this context I am pleased to note the successful outcome of 4th quarterly review mission in October, and look forward to the successful completion of the overall review process.  The Government will continue to explore ways to reduce our debt with colleagues in Europe as the State had been expected to bear a disproportionate amount to protect the European banking system.  We have already had significant success in this regard.  The reduction in the cost of our EU and IMF funds, which is now in place, will reduce the cost of programme funds by over &euro;10 billion over the initially envisaged 7.5 year average maturity.  In addition the liability management exercise in relation to bank subordinated debt has saved a further &euro;5.2 billion.  </P>
        <P>We are committed to pay what we owe, but we will also continue to look creatively at existing financing commitments and structures to reduce as far as possible the debt burden on the state by refinancing payment obligations at the lowest possible cost. Work, including with our EU partners, continues in this respect.</P>

	<P>It is assumed that the threshold for the proposed new tax bands mentioned by the Deputy would not alter the existing standard rate band structure applying to single and widowed persons, to lone parents and married couples.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2012 incomes, of the introduction of each of the proposed new rates and bands would be of the order of &euro;55 million, &euro;45 million and &euro;35 million respectively.  However, given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how, in practice, such new rates could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.</P>
        <P>These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2009 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2012.  They are, therefore, provisional and likely to be revised.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from increasing the Capital Acquisitions Tax rate by 5%, based on the expected outturn in 2011, could be in the region of &euro;55 million, assuming no change in the existing thresholds.  The additional full year yield from existing taxpayers from reducing the existing thresholds by 10% and applying the proposed rate of 30% to the additional amounts thus brought into charge is estimated at &euro;17 million.   Revenue do not receive information on gifts and inheritances which currently do not have to be declared so it is not possible to estimate the potential yield if such benefits were brought into the tax net.  These estimates are based on transactions recorded in 2010, the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available.  It should be noted that these estimates are based upon an assumption that there would be no behavioural impact of these changes, which could lead to a less than expected impact on Exchequer yield.  In addition, the realization of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets, which are currently occurring in the economy.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that some &euro;10.3m in tax was paid for the year 2010 by managers of approved retirement funds (ARFs) in respect of deemed or imputed distributions of assets in ARFs. This amount would have been generally based on a deemed distribution rate of 5%. On this basis, the full year yield from an increase in the deemed distribution rate to 10% could be of the order of &euro;10m, assuming no change in asset values or behavioural changes on the part of ARF owners.   It is important to note that the deemed or imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage draw downs from ARFs so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of income in retirement in the same way as a retirement annuity, for which ARFs are supposed to operate as a more flexible alternative.</P>
        <P>The measure, in itself, does not give rise to significant tax revenues as it does not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs, which are taxed in the normal way.  The level of the imputed distribution was increased from 3% to 5% in Budget and Finance Act 2011 and was estimated to yield an additional &euro;5 million in a full year.  Increasing the percentage notional distribution from ARFs generally, and for ARFs  of modest value in particular, to a level 10% of ARF assets would increase the risk that such ARF owners&rsquo; funds could be depleted during retirement and before death.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 67 together.</P>
        <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to individual pension contributions, the tax relief on which is allowed at the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal tax rate &mdash; the standard or higher rate of income tax as appropriate in each case.  A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to <Col N="336"/>occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level. An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &mdash; retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts &mdash; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.</P>
        <P>There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures. However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, it is estimated that the full-year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts would be approximately &euro;500 million.</P>
        <P>The estimated full-year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to a rate of 30% for individuals who can obtain relief at the 41% rate in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts would be approximately &euro;260 million. It is assumed that tax relief at the flat rate of 30% would not be available to claimants who are currently confined to tax relief at the standard rate of 20%.</P>

	<P>National debt interest expenditure in 2012 and 2013 was forecast in the recently published Medium-Term Fiscal Statement (MTFS) at &euro;6.8 billion and &euro;7.2 billion respectively. General Government debt interest expenditure in 2012 and 2013 was forecast in the MTFS at &euro;7.2 billion and &euro;9.5 billion respectively.  The large increase in General Government debt interest expenditure in 2013 over 2012 is due primarily to the Promissory Note interest.

	<P>I announced the establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on 7 July 2011.  The Council is part of a wider agenda of reform of Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary architecture which is envisaged in the Programme for Government. The Council is an independent non-statutory body. It will be put on a statutory basis underpinned by legislation to be brought forward by Government in the coming months in the proposed Fiscal Responsibility Bill. Its role is to provide an assessment of, and comment publicly on, whether the Government is meeting its own stated budgetary targets and objectives. It will also be charged with assessing the appropriateness and soundness of the Government&rsquo;s fiscal stance <Col N="337"/>and macroeconomic projections as well as an assessment of the extent of compliance with the Government&rsquo;s fiscal rules. The latter are also to be brought forward in the proposed Fiscal Responsibility Bill.</P>
        <P>The five members of the Council are:  Mr Sebastian Barnes, OECD, Professor Alan Barrett, TCD (on secondment from the ESRI), Dr Donal Donovan, University of Limerick (formerly IMF staff), Professor John McHale, Head of Economics, NUI Galway and Chair of the Council, and Dr R&oacute;is&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan, Associate Professor, Smith College, Massachusetts.</P>
        <P>I appointed the members having regard to a number of criteria including the desirability of having a mix of appropriate backgrounds (academia, the financial sector/financial markets and public finance), macroeconomic/microeconomic expertise, a strong international dimension as well as the need to take gender considerations into account.  I am satisfied with the composition of the Council and I am pleased that individuals of such high calibre have agreed to serve on the Council.</P>
        <P>The Council recently published its first assessment report which was generally well received.  Their advice, along with advice from other bodies, domestic and international continues to inform Government thinking in the development of fiscal policy.  As I said at the outset, the Council is an important element in the reforms we are making to improve Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal framework.</P>

	<P>The main area which is expected to benefit in terms of additional revenues in 2012 from measures introduced in 2011 is income tax. As with all new income tax measures, the first year yield is expected to be significantly below the full-year yield for a number of reasons including the fact that a portion of the tax collected in the year in which a measure is introduced relates to earnings in the previous year and therefore does not benefit from the changes to the tax system.</P>
        <P>The reductions to the tax credits, the reductions in the standard rate bands and the reductions in the age exemption limits implemented in 2011 are expected to generate an additional &euro;0.3 billion in revenues in 2012 over the amounts these measures were estimated to generate in 2011.  The tax revenue benefit in 2012 compared to 2011 from the abolition and restriction of various tax reliefs such as Rent Relief, Trade Union subscriptions relief, the relief on loans to acquire an interest in certain companies and the introduction of a ceiling on the tax exempt earnings of artists is estimated to be over &euro;0.1 billion.</P>
        <P>Changes to PRSI including the abolition of the &euro;75,036 ceiling and the increase in the Class S rate are expected to generate close to another &euro;0.1 billion in revenues in 2012 over 2011. Pensions related measures are also expected to generate approximately &euro;0.1 billion more in receipts in 2012 than in 2011.</P>
        <P>Other measures such as the increase in the rate of Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) and reduction in the group tax free Capital Acquisitions Tax thresholds are also expected to deliver a small amount of increased revenues in 2012 over 2011.  The estimates of the sums that are expected to be realised from the carry-forward of measures introduced in 2011 will be updated further in the coming weeks in the run-up to Budget 2012.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Housing Finance Agency that while some 96% of the Agency&rsquo;s short-term debt is now borrowed from the NTMA (as an agent of the Minister), the Agency raises some short-term debt from other parties. It borrows cash which local authorities and the Environment Fund have available for short-term investment, and also uses a note issuance facility from an Irish bank to manage its short-term cash requirements which arise in the normal course of its day-to-day business. The Agency also has an overdraft facility from an Irish bank, the usage of which currently is minimal.   The Agency&rsquo;s overall debt position as at 31 October 2011 is set out in the table.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the estimated annual saving to the Exchequer from reducing the maximum tax free retirement lump sum from &euro;200,000 to &euro;150,000. </Quest>
        <QRef>[33923/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The following arrangements currently apply to retirement lump sums paid under pension arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  Lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax.  They are also paid free of USC.  The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%.  This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum.  No USC is chargeable.  Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;575,000 is taxed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available).  In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess.  These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums. </P>
        <P>I assume from the Deputy&rsquo;s question that he is proposing that retirement lump sums in excess of &euro;150,000 be taxed as outlined above.  As there is no general requirement for data on the number of persons who are receiving payments of retirement lump sums of less than &euro;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &euro;200,000 to &euro;150,000</P><Col N="339"/>
        <P>As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the savings involved, it is estimated that  just over 3,000 individuals in the public service would be on salaries of over &euro;100,000 and less than &euro;133,500 which, under existing pension scheme arrangements generally applying across the public service, would deliver retirement lump sums of between &euro;150,000 and &euro;200,000.  If it is assumed that these individuals would retire in line with retirement trends from the public service in a normal year (about 2.5%), then the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums in excess of &euro;150,000 at 20% could be less than &euro;0.5 m in a full year.</P>
        <P>I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector.  I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum.  This option is not available to members of public sector schemes.  Depending on the impact of any tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.</P>

	<P>The National Diploma made by DIT Bolton St is a legacy award and is no longer made since the introduction of the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) in 2003, but has been placed at Level 7 of the NFQ.  I understand from the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), which is responsible for the Framework, that the placement of an existing or former award in the framework does not imply that someone holding such an award has achieved all of the outcomes associated with a new, framework-based award-type at the same level.  Therefore, while the Ordinary Bachelor Degree is also at Level 7 of the Framework, holders of the National Diploma may not call their award an Ordinary Bachelor Degree.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 80 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating teaching staff and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to special schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Departments criteria in allocating such support, which now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</P>
        <P>As set out in my Departments Circular 0042/2011, in order for the NCSE to complete the processing of applications for mainstream schools in the first instance, the existing 2010/11 level of SNA supports have been maintained in special schools for the coming school year, other than for schools with declining enrolments, with a review to take place in Autumn of the 11/12 school year.  The school referred to by the Deputy has therefore not received a reduction in its SNA staff levels over those applying at the end of the last school year.  The review of SNA support at special schools is currently ongoing and I understand that the review of SNA provision at the school referred to by the Deputy will take place in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In relation to teaching posts, Circular 0042/11 states that there are a small number of special schools which have significant excess teacher posts and that the NCSE may therefore contact such schools to review the individual circumstances in these schools.  The Circular indicated that the NCSE may suppress a post in schools which have excess teaching posts in order to create a post in a school which does not have excess posts and which has growing pupil numbers.</P>
        <P>The special school referred to by the Deputy caters for pupils with severe/profound disability and ASD.  The correct teacher allocation ratio for schools catering for children with severe and profound disability is 6:1.  In 2010/11 the school had 7 approved class teaching posts, 3 surplus teaching posts and 28 SNAs.  The enrolment is 38 pupils, including 9 new children enrolled for September 2011.  One of the surplus teachers retired at the end of the last school year and the school is not eligible for a replacement.  A further surplus post has been withdrawn leaving the school with 1 surplus post above recommended staffing allocation levels.</P>
        <P>It is the position of both my Department and the NCSE that given the exceptionally high levels of teaching and support staff which have been allocated to the school, that notwithstanding the outcome of any review of SNA support at the school, that the school has sufficient <Col N="341"/>support within its overall allocation to enable it to provide for the teaching and care support requirements of all of the children enrolled to the school.</P>

My Department is responsible for completing and submitting the Irish questionnaires.  This data required is sourced from both within the Department and from external bodies such as FETAC, the HEA and FAS.  Some indicators are based on other sources such as the OECD-INES Network for the Collection and Adjudication of System-level descriptive Information on Educational Structures, Policies and Practices (NESLI) and the OECD-INES Network on Labour Market, Economic and Social Outcomes of Learning (LSO) which are also provided by my Department.  Other indicators are based on the Labour Force Survey (the Quarterly National Household Survey in the case of Ireland) and the EU-Survey on Income and Living Conditions both of which are provided to the OECD both directly by the Central Statistics Office and via Eurostat.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs.  In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) coordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services.  The SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Another specific function of the SENO is to identify available educational placements for children with special educational needs.  SENOs are a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children.  The NCSE have been fully engaged in identifying placement options for the child in question.  The NCSE has advised my Department that there is a school placement available for this child.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Home Tuition Scheme is to provide a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department approved home tuition from the commencement of the current school year until the 28th October 2011 for the child concerned in order to facilitate transitional arrangements for the child to take up a school placement.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) have been fully engaged in identifying placement options for the child in question.  The NCSE has advised my Department that, irrespective of the assessed levels of ability of the child, there are schools placements available for this child. I also understand from my officials that the parents of this child have been advised of their placement options by the NCSE.  It is now a matter for the parents of the child concerned to engage with the schools in question and to apply to have their child enrolled to a school.  </P>
        <P>The purpose of the Home Tuition Scheme is to provide a compensatory educational service for children who are unable to attend school for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, or for whom there are no available placements.</P>
        <P>Home tuition was approved for the child in question by my Department from the start of the school year until the end of September 2011 as there was no available placement.  Home Tuition was subsequently extended until 14th October 2011, for the purpose of completing the enrolment process.  My Department may consider whether there is a requirement to extending this period further to facilitate transitional arrangements, as an exceptional measure, once a school based placement has been accepted by the parents.</P>

	<P>The particular funding for the schools referred to by the Deputy was withdrawn with effect from 1 January 2009 due to real concerns about the constitutionality of making grants available to fee-charging schools of one ethos and not to those of another.  The Constitution specifically states that the State shall not discriminate against one religion in favour of another.</P>
        <P>There are 26 distinctively Protestant schools, of which 20 charge fees.  Many of the schools have a boarding facility, reflecting the dispersed nature of the communities across the country.  The six Protestant schools within the free education scheme receive the same funding as all other schools within the free education system.</P>
        <P>This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</P><Col N="343"/>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is paid to the Secondary Education Committee, an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the schools.  The Secondary Education Committee then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of boarding fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos.  Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually.  In addition to this funding, teachers employed within the approved annual staffing allocation granted by my Department in fee-charging schools are paid by the State; an arrangement that pre-dates the introduction of free education arrangements and which has existed since the foundation of the State.  The estimated cost of these posts in 2011 is in the order of &euro;100 million.  I am already on record as saying that this is not a simple matter as these arrangements, which are historic and of long standing impact upon a substantial number of schools which cater for religious minorities.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the reality of our economic situation presents significant challenges that have to be reconciled with limitations on public resources.  Ireland must adhere to its agreed economic recovery programme in order to reduce the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2015 and to restore our independence.  This will mean that forthcoming budgets will involve further adjustments in taxation and public spending.  Regrettably, education cannot be spared from this adjustment as the size of the challenge is so large.  This is the unfortunate legacy caused by the reckless economic management of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; Green Party Government.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious of the fundamental role played by the free fees and student grant schemes in supporting families who are putting their children through further and higher education and I understand their concerns at the measures announced in Budget 2011 by the previous government.</P><Col N="344"/>
        <P>I will take account of those concerns in considering any future changes to the schemes as part of the budgetary process for 2012 and beyond, having regard to the position of the public finances.  A sustainability study is currently being undertaken by the Higher Education Authority which will make recommendations to the Minister for Education and Skills shortly.  I expect that the final report will be available in the next few weeks and will help inform the Government&rsquo;s decision-making as to the range of decisions that will be announced in December&rsquo;s Budget.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is undertaking a Comprehensive Expenditure Review across all areas of Government spending.  This process will inform funding allocations for the coming years. In this context, the Deputy will appreciate that in line with normal practice I am unable to comment on future savings options during the budgetary deliberative process.</P>

	<P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school.  My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </P>
        <P>Under section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</P>
        <P>The parents/guardians of the pupils in question may wish to contact my Department at the Section 29 Unit Friars Mill Road, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, (phone 044 9337008) if they wish to take an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998.</P>

	<P>Over the past three years Government policy has re-focussed the resources and work of F&Aacute;S from training for the employed to training for the many newly unemployed persons and jobseekers who come to F&Aacute;S seeking assistance. Consequently, the primary client group of F&Aacute;S Training Services are unemployed persons, many of whom cannot afford the costs associated with taking up a place on a private training course. In this regard it is not and never has been the intention of F&Aacute;S to compete with private training providers. I understand that F&Aacute;S Training Services Division has contracted with many private sector training providers to deliver a substantial volume of training to a diverse range of F&Aacute;S clients. F&Aacute;S Training Services Division is constantly developing new employment-led training programmes and services to address the career and employment aspirations of a range of unemployed persons. These new training initiatives are often piloted by private training providers.

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, there are 55 fee-charging schools in the State. Fee-charging schools do not receive capitation grants or related supports. </P>
        <P>The only current funding provided to fee-charging schools by my Department in 2011 is the Assistive Technology grant for students with particular special educational needs. Almost &euro;16,000 was paid to fee-charging schools in respect of this grant to date this year (as at 9 November 2011).</P>
        <P>The total amount of capital funding provided to fee-charging schools this year, up to 9 November, is &euro;1.9m.  It must be noted that this is less than 0.4% of the entire 491m capital budget for education in 2011.</P><Col N="348"/>
        <P>In addition to this funding, teachers employed within the approved annual staffing allocation granted by my Department in fee-charging schools are paid by the State; an arrangement that pre-dates the introduction of free education arrangements and which has existed since the foundation of the state. The estimated cost of these posts in 2011 is in the order of &euro;100m. I am already on record as saying that this is not a simple matter as these arrangements, which are historic and of long standing, impact upon a substantial number of schools which cater for religious minorities.</P>

	<P>The current arrangements in place regarding established civil servants wishing to take a career break are set out in civil service circular no. 18/98 &mdash; Special leave without pay for career breaks &mdash; and <Col N="349"/>were amended in a letter to Personnel Officers of 3 March 2008 &mdash; available on <i>www.personnelcode.gov.ie.</i> This scheme allows for established civil servants, who have satisfactorily completed two years&rsquo; continuous service, to apply for special leave without pay for a career break, provided they have not reached retirement age and the duration of a career break may not extend beyond retirement age.</P>
        <P>A career break consists of special leave without pay for a period of not less than six months and not more than five years.  A career break may be extended by periods of six months or more up to a period of five years.</P>
        <P>Eligible staff may, in general, avail of two career breaks in the Civil Service. The maximum limit of two career breaks may be waived at the discretion of the head of Department, provided the total period of special leave does not exceed ten years in total.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Special Civil Service Incentive Career Break Scheme, this scheme was introduced as a once-off measure in the Supplementary Budget on 7 April 2009.  The measure was extended to staff in different areas of the public service, including the local government sector and the HSE.  The closing date for participation in this scheme has expired and I have no plans to extend the scheme at this time.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware my colleague, the Minister for Finance will introduce the Budget in early December, and I am not in a position to pre-empt what will be contained in that Budget.</P>
        <P>Pay rates in the public service have already been reduced by up to 15% and a progressive pension related reduction applied through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009. More recently, the Government accepted my proposals to introduce a general pay ceiling of &euro;200,000 for future appointments to higher positions across the public service, a general pay ceiling of &euro;250,000 forfuture appointments to CEO posts within Commercial State Companies and a voluntary waiver system of up to 15% for current post holders who have salaries in excess of the relevant pay ceiling.</P>
        <P>Under the Joint Programme of Assistance the Government is committed to continued falls in the overall cost of the public service pay bill. This will be achieved through planned <Col N="350"/>reductions in the numbers of public servants as set out in the Programme for Government and through greater efficiencies in the way in which public services are delivered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Increments within the Public Service vary in terms of timing, cost and application both within and across the various sectors of the Public Service and estimates of cost are of necessity, tentative.  </P>
        <P>It has been estimated that the annual cost in a full year of increments would be around &euro;250 million. However, significantly reduced recruitment and higher numbers on the maxima of scales will mean that this cost will reduce in the coming years and will be affected by other factors.  These include retirements, voluntary redundancies, number reductions, recruitment rates and the numbers of employees reaching the maximum of the scale, which cannot be quantified.</P>
        <P>No specific provision is made in the financial allocations to public service bodies as they are required to meet the cost within their allocations.</P>
        <P>Suspending increments would affect some public servants but would have no effect on others. Generally, incremental scales are longer for lower paid than for higher. Accordingly a higher proportion of lower paid including front line staff would be affected by a suspension of increments.</P>

	<P>Since being appointed Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in March last, to date I have undertaken a total of 5 Missions abroad.  These have been either Trade Missions, leading client companies of Enterprise Ireland in support of their export drive in foreign markets, or Investment Missions, in support of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s work in attracting Foreign Direct Investment to this country.  In addition, the Minister for Small Business, Deputy John Perry T.D., led one Trade Mission, to Australia. </P>
        <P>The details requested are set out in the table.  In the case of the Investment Missions, it is not possible to establish a direct relationship between the number of jobs created or investment secured in any one year to discussions/marketing undertaken in that year.  The business of FDI generation is a complex process that takes place over a period of time and is not necessarily completed immediately following the Investment Mission.</P>
        <P>The issue of jobs secured or total investment secured does not arise at all in the case of Trade Missions.  These are intended to open opportunities to generate exporter connections in the case of new exporters or to help established exporters build on existing export success and so the benefits flowing from such missions are realised over time.  The continued strong interest from companies in participating demonstrates clearly the value they place on trade missions.</P>

	<P>On 19 October last, Aviva announced its proposal to combine Aviva Ireland with Aviva UK to form a new UK and Ireland Region.  In addition, Aviva announced its intention to restructure its European regional operations to strengthen the business and create a leaner cost base.</P>
        <P>According to Aviva, both these proposed initiatives could result in a total reduction of up to 950 posts in Ireland over two years, subject to consultation, comprising 180 posts from Aviva Europe and 770 from Aviva Ireland.</P>
        <P>However, the company has also said that it would investigate the feasibility of establishing additional centres of excellence in Ireland and as other elements of its business grow, job losses could be mitigated by some 200.</P>
        <P>Aviva has stated that any proposed structural changes in the Irish business are not expected to begin to take effect before March 2012 and the company anticipates that it could take up to two years for a new structure to come into full effect.  I understand no announcements on Irish job numbers will be made in 2011.</P>
        <P>Arising from a number of complaints that I have received from Aviva workers, I wrote to the Chief Executive of Aviva Ireland to ascertain the steps being taken by the company with regard to engagement with staff on their restructuring proposals.  I have been informed by Aviva that it is committed to providing weekly updates to all employees regarding the progress the company is making on the business transformation proposals.  The first update was communicated last week and the company will continue to provide updates in the coming weeks and provide employee support through its line management and HR department.</P>
        <P>I have also been informed that the company has entered into formal consultation with the trade union Unite regarding the pan-European dimension of the proposed restructuring of its European regional operations and that it will continue to engage with employees and their representatives in this regard.</P>
        <P>The company has indicated that it will endeavour to achieve as many of the potential redundancies as possible through voluntary means.  However, I understand that workers at Aviva have recently voted to take industrial action if the company moves to implement its proposals before agreement is reached with staff.</P>

	<P>The purpose of Community Employment is primarily about developing the skills base and work readiness of individuals who are unemployed for long periods so that they can re-enter the workforce or pursue other training opportunities.  The criteria for participating on community employment, and similar initiatives, have not, in general, encompassed young people and those still attending places of education.  Persons aged 18 and older are eligible for community employment where they are in receipt of certain Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Blind Pension and Invalidity Pension or if they are Travellers, refugees, residents of off-shore islands, ex-offenders or referred by the Probation Service or Drugs Task Force.</P>
        <P>As with all programmes and schemes, Community Employment will be considered in the context of the Comprehensive Expenditure Review which is currently being finalised and may be affected by decisions made by the Government in its determination of the conclusion of that review.  Additionally, I have already indicated that I will be looking at all programmes and schemes supporting those who are unemployed to see if they can be made more responsive to the needs of people who are unemployed.</P>
        <P>I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to JobBridge, the national internship scheme, that was announced as part of the Jobs Initiative, which is open to any person aged 18 or over meeting the eligibility criteria.</P>

	<P>The Community Services Programme is designed to address locally identified gaps in the provision of services and to exploit the potential of community assets and resources to improve community well-being.  The programme co-funds the services delivered by some 430 community based not-for-profit enterprises across the State.  The financial allocation for the programme in 2011 is &euro;47.4m.  It is estimated that 2,800 people are directly supported in full and part-time employment with funding provided by the programme.  A key requirement of the programme is that service providers must generate a significant element of their funding requirement from non-public sources.  My Department continues to accept expressions of interest from service providers where they consider the programme has a role in supporting their operations.  Consideration of an open call for new proposals can only be made when the funding position for the programme for 2012 is determined in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Following adoption of a Site of Community Importance by the Commission, Member States must proceed to complete the formal process designating the sites as Special Areas of Conservation. In Ireland, this will be done by making a statutory instrument for each site.  This process is due to commence shortly and to be completed by the end of next year.  It does not affect the legal protection afforded to the sites.</P>

	<P>The designation of Ireland&rsquo;s suite of Special Protection Areas (SPAs) is almost complete. Some 152 SPAs, of an eventual network of 153 sites, have already been classified in accordance with the  terms of the Birds Directive, as clarified by the European Court of Justice in its judgment against Ireland in case 418/04. The remaining site will be classified in the coming weeks. The designation process for our suite of SPAs will be completed with the making of a Statutory Instrument for each site and I expect this task to be completed next year. </P>
        <P>In addition, between 2003 and 2005, some 155 sites throughout the country were designated by Statutory Instrument as Natural Heritage Areas. When the designation of our suite of SPAs and Special Areas of Conservation is complete, my Department will begin a review of previously proposed Natural Heritage Areas to consider their designation, as appropriate, under the Wildlife Acts.</P>

	<P>The electronic communications market is, and has been since its liberalisation, a commercial competitive market.  Thus, the provision of services, including broadband, is a matter for those private sector service providers, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). The Government only intervenes in cases of market failure.</P>
        <P>Between the significant private and public sector investments over recent years all areas of the country now have access to at least a basic broadband service.</P>
        <P>The Government accepts that the widespread availability of next generation broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.</P>
        <P>Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband customer access to every home and business in the State.</P>
        <P>In June of this year I established the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, which I chair and which also comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies currently operating in the Irish market and the CEOs of some Internet Service Provider companies.  The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss the optimal policy environment required to facilitate the investment in and provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Taskforce, and four Working Groups reporting to it, are considering issues such as appropriate targets in terms of speed and service, potential barriers to investment, spectrum policy issues and possible demand stimulation measures aimed at increasing overall Internet usage.</P><Col N="359"/>

	<P>A finding from a research study sponsored by my Department estimated that there could be a total reserve potential in the order of ten billion barrels of oil equivalent in the frontier basins west of Ireland.  This figure is simply an estimate of unproven potential, derived from an assessment of the scale of acreage, the state of knowledge of offshore geology and experience elsewhere.  It is not a detailed estimate based on comprehensive survey and exploration drilling of Ireland&rsquo;s Atlantic offshore.  Actual reserve figures are likely to vary widely from these estimates and will not be known without a dramatic increase in the level of exploration activity.  In fact, Ireland&rsquo;s proven commercial reserves to date are estimated at 0.5 billion barrels and more than half of this has already been exploited.</P>
        <P>The only commercial discoveries of hydrocarbons made in the Irish offshore to date are the three producing gas fields in the Kinsale area, along with the Corrib gas field, which is currently being developed off the coast of Mayo.  There have been no commercial discoveries of oil.</P>
        <P>In relation to the onshore, my Department in February of this year granted Licensing Options to two companies over parts of the North West Carboniferous or Lough Allen Basin.  The Licensing Options are designed to allow the companies assess the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on desktop studies of existing seismic and well data.  This potential had been identified in earlier exploration, but was not considered to be commercially viable.  It is too early to conclude whether or not these authorisations will proceed to the exploration licence stage let alone to anticipate a commercial discovery that would potentially lead to a petroleum production project.</P>
        <P>In relation to royalties, Ireland followed the lead of other countries such as the UK and Norway and moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987.  Under a tax based system the return to the State is linked directly to the profitability of the oil or gas field compared to a royalty based system where payments are linked to the volume of production and take no account of differences in development cost or actual profitability.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive review of Ireland fiscal terms for oil and gas exploration and development was carried out in 2007.  The review, which was underpinned by independent economic analysis, considered the appropriateness of Ireland&rsquo;s licensing terms in comparison to other European countries that Ireland competes with for exploration investment.  The outcome of that review was the introduction of a profit resource rent tax, of between 5% and 15% that will apply in the case of more profitable fields.  The profit resource rent tax would be payable in addition to the standard petroleum corporate tax of 25%.</P>
        <P>Ireland competes with other countries, both in Europe and much further afield, to attract mobile international exploration investment.  To that end, it is important that Ireland maintains a licensing regime that appropriately reflects both the risks and rewards of investing in petroleum exploration in the Irish offshore, relative to investing in exploration in other jurisdictions.  Ireland&rsquo;s petroleum taxation rate is deliberately pitched at a level that is consistent <Col N="360"/>with countries such as France, Portugal and Spain, who, like Ireland, have limited petroleum production, rather than with major petroleum producers such as Norway or the UK.</P>

	<P>Smart meters facilitate energy efficiency by providing consumers with more detailed, accurate and timely information regarding their energy consumption and costs, thus helping consumers reduce any unnecessary energy usage and shift any discretionary electricity usage away from peak consumption times.</P>
        <P>The traditional electricity meter is not capable of operating in reverse and as a result is incapable of giving credit for electricity exported to the grid.  A smart meter can measure the consumption of energy, and can transmit data using a form of electronic communication.  A key feature of a smart meter is the ability to provide bidirectional communication between the consumer and the supplier/operator.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), is overseeing the national programme to develop smart meters working with my Department, ESB Networks and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  Pilot trials are under way and a comprehensive cost benefit analysis has been completed, which quantifies the benefits for consumers and the energy system.</P>
        <P>Micro-scale electricity generators seeking to export excess generation to the grid would require smart meters.  ESB has been operating a micro-generation feed-in-tariff scheme under certain conditions for the domestic sector for a number of years, with 387 signed up to date. The available tariff is 19c Kwh, made up of a 10cent Kwh tariff offered by ESB Networks and a 9cent Kwh tariff offered by ESB Customer Supply.  No other supply companies have chosen to introduce a tariff to date, although it is open to them to do so.</P>
        <P>A number of years ago, when the scheme was announced, ESB Networks announced that an import/export meter would be provided to the first 4000 micro-generation installations countrywide over 3 years.  To date, the take-up rate is under 10%.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government commits to the introduction of a microgeneration feed-in-tariff at a tariff rate that will not be significantly above single energy market (SEM) price for electricity.  The experience from the ESB tariff (at 19c Kwh) as well as from studies undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) are that a tariff not significantly above <Col N="361"/>the SEM price (currently around &euro;7.2 Kwh) would be unlikely to stimulate take-up of microgeneration.</P>
        <P>I will shortly be considering advice from SEAI and my Department on the costed options for encouraging microgeneration with a view to determining appropriate directions not least in the present budgetary circumstances.  In the meantime, with regard to smart meters, I understand that the CER is shortly due to issue a public consultation seeking views on smart metering and a potential national rollout.  There will be an opportunity for all those interested, including microgenerators, to make the case as part of that consultation as to their views on any future rollout programme.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government commits to the provision of a feed in tariff for micro-generators producing electricity for their own homes, farms and businesses and selling surplus electricity to the grid.  The programme also states that the tariff will not be significantly above the single energy market price for electricity.</P>
        <P>A number of activities in recent years have supported microgeneration.  These have been the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) pilot microgeneration programme instigated in 2009 and comprising 42 installations and the microgeneration feed-in-tariff programme introduced by ESB in 2009.</P>
        <P>The SEAI pilot microgeneration programme has now been operational for a number of years and I expect to shortly receive a report from SEAI on its findings.</P>
        <P>The ESB scheme has been operational for almost 3 years &mdash; it is a limited feed-in-tariff available under certain conditions to the domestic sector.  Under 400 microgenerators have set up under this scheme to date.  The scheme offers 10c Kwh from ESB networks and an additional 9c Kwh from ESB Electric Ireland (formerly ESB Customer Supply.)</P>
        <P>At the time ESB introduced the microgeneration scheme, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) wrote to all suppliers in the market inviting them to introduce microgeneration support schemes, however no other suppliers chose to enter the market.  The tariff offered by ESB, comprising a total of 19c Kwh, has had limited success with under 400 availing of it to date.</P>
        <P>The lack of interest of all suppliers in voluntarily introducing microgeneration schemes is indicative of market failure and the need to offer price supports in this area, should we wish to see it develop.  The experience with the ESB tariff would seem to indicate that a tariff not significantly above the market price for microgeneration, as stated in the Programme for Government would be unlikely to have much success.  This is backed up by research that SEAI has carried out in the area, which points to significant costs for relatively modest output, when compared with large scale generation.</P>
        <P>Should a scheme be introduced, if this is to be funded from the PSO levy, increased electricity costs would have to be borne by all consumers to fund it.  It is my intention to consider the options available on microgeneration with a view to a submission to Government in the matter.</P>

The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water.  The Programme for Government envisages that charges will apply to usage above a free allowance. My Department is currently preparing a strategy to implement these proposals, including consideration of support for low income households. Further details will be announced following the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the proposals. </P>
        <P>The Memorandum with the EU/IMF also commits the Government to the introduction of a property tax for 2012. This reflects the need, in the context of the State&rsquo;s overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.</P>
        <P>In light of the complex issues involved, a property tax, requiring a comprehensive property valuation system, would take time to introduce and accordingly, to meet the requirements in the EU/IMF Programme, the Government has decided to introduce a household charge in 2012. The household charge is an interim measure and proposals for a full property tax will be considered by the Government in due course. The legislation to underpin the household charge will contain the precise details of the charge and will be published and brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly.</P>

	<P>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 broadened the revenue base of local authorities through the introduction of the charge on non-principal private residences (NPPR).  The charge is set at &euro;200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities.

        <P>There is no obligation on local authorities to issue notifications or invoices regarding the charge.  Nationwide advertising took place in both 2009 and 2010, and again this year, to ensure general awareness of the charge and the liability dates.  In tandem, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally.  Some advertising on the charge was also placed in publications/newsletters circulating in areas in which large Irish populations are residing abroad.  Communications have also been issued to persons who paid the charge in respect of previous years reminding them of their possible liability for the charge.</P>
        <P>Significant efforts are being made to ensure that property owners are aware of the charge and the liability dates.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 134 together.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to amend the Building Control Act 2007 along the lines suggested and there is no question of non-registered persons being allowed to use the title of architect.  Section 22 of the Act makes specific provision for a category of practically trained persons who had already been providing architectural services in Ireland commensurate with those understood as being provided by Architects for the purpose of the Building Control Act 2007 for a period of ten years at the time the Act became law.  This provision is transitional in nature and enables this category of persons to become registered once they have been assessed as eligible for registration by the Technical Assessment Board in accordance with the practical experience assessment procedure.  Thus the Act does recognise and provide an exclusive route to registration for those persons in the circumstances described.</P>
        <P>The assertion referred to in the Question that an applicant would have to have sat a five year degree course in order to be successful under the technical assessment route is incorrect.  The technical assessment route is specifically provided for practitioners who are not academically qualified.  The Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland (RIAI) is designated as the registration body for the purposes of Part 3 of the Act and has advised my Department that eight applications for technical assessment have been received to date.  Of these, seven applications have been fully considered by the Technical Assessment Board with five applicants being deemed eligible for registration and two applicants being deemed unsuccessful.  A further application is currently being assessed.</P>

	<P>The issue of potential health effects of electromagnetic fields was the subject of an Expert Group Report published by Government in March 2007 entitled Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields.  This report is available for download on my Department&rsquo;s website (<i>www.environ.ie/en/publications</i>).  The Expert Group examined a wide range of issues in relation to the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields and their report answers many of the health risk questions raised by the public.  The report and its recommendations were accepted by the Government and form the basis for current policy in this area.</P>
        <P>In May this year the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) which is part of the World Health Organisation (WHO) published a report which stated that the electromagnetic fields generated by mobile phones were possibly carcinogenic to humans.  It is important to note that the new research did not establish a direct link between mobile phone use and cancer.  Rather, the IARC concluded that there could be some risk, and indicated that they therefore need to keep a close watch for a link between cell phones and cancer risk.</P>
        <P>This Department will continue to monitor this and other scientific evidence as it is made available, and will consider any policy implications in this context.</P>

	<P>The EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland commits the Government to the <Col N="366"/>introduction of a property tax for 2012.  The Programme reflects the need, in the context of the State&rsquo;s overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.  In light of the complex issues involved, a property tax, requiring a comprehensive property valuation system, would take time to introduce and accordingly, to meet the requirements in the EU/IMF Programme, the Government has decided to introduce a household charge in 2012. The household charge is an interim measure and proposals for a full property tax will be considered by the Government in due course.  The legislation to underpin the household charge will contain the precise details of the charge and will be published and brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly.  There are no proposals to provide an exemption in the legislation for residential property in respect of which management fees are payable.</P>

	<P>Affordable housing is privately owned housing and, as such, is subject to the fluctuations of the market. Affordable purchasers are therefore in the same position as other private purchasers in this regard.  The terms and conditions of the various affordable housing schemes and the regulations governing local authority loans do not prohibit an affordable home owner from renting a spare room in his/her home though a local authority is likely for good reason to attach conditions to the contract with the purchaser in relation to subletting of the entire unit and its use by the purchaser as his/her normal place of residence.  However, where a person is selling an affordable home and the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount of the clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result.  A range of supports are available where a household is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, whether from a local authority or private lender. It is important to make early contact with the lender when these difficulties emerge.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 138 together.</P>
        <P>Following an application by Dublin City Council, the High Court ordered that the unsafe development at Priory Hall be evacuated on 20 October 2011 and that the developer carry out an agreed schedule of necessary remedial works to be reviewed by the Court on a weekly basis.  In response to a report from Dublin City Council stating that the works were below acceptable <Col N="367"/>standards, the High Court ordered the developer to cease work on the site on 4 November 2011.  A motion by Dublin City Council to have an alternative contractor appointed by the Court was refused.  The developer has now vacated the site which has been secured by Dublin City Council at its own expense.  The case will again come before the High Court on, 11 November 2011.  Dublin City Council in bringing proceedings against the developer is fulfilling its statutory function as fire authority under the Fire Services Act 1981.</P>
        <P>My Department is being been kept informed by Dublin City Council of developments with regard to the resolution of issues at Priory Hall, including in respect of Court proceedings.  My Department has assisted the Council, in consultation with NAMA, in securing alternative housing for many of the residents. The overriding priority is to ensure the optimum outcome for the households concerned and to facilitate as early as possible a return to their homes.  In this respect it will be necessary to ensure that these homes are made fit for purpose and that the costs of so doing fall where they should.  I have asked Dublin City Council to do all within its powers to achieve this objective and have asked my Department to continue to liaise closely with Dublin City Council in this regard.</P>
        <P>The legal proceedings are continuing and it would be entirely inappropriate to anticipate their conclusion.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 141 together.</P>
        <P>There are no plans at the present time to change existing visa requirements for Chinese nationals seeking to visit Ireland for holiday purposes.  However, the Deputy may be aware of the Visa Waiver Programme for the holders of certain Short Stay UK Visas which commenced operation as recently as 1 July, 2011.  Under this programme, which was announced as part of the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative and is aimed at promoting tourism and other economic activity, the holders of the appropriate UK Visas who have first landed in the UK and have permission to be in the UK may also travel to Ireland without the need to also obtain an Irish visa.  The programme covers the citizens of a total of 16 countries in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia, including China.  In conjunction with the announcement of the Visa Waiver Programme and in order that nationals of the 16 countries in question who are permanently resident in the UK who may wish to visit Ireland are not placed at a disadvantage, my department has put arrangements in place for visas to be issued free of charge through the Visa Office in the Irish Embassy in London.</P>
        <P>Many Chinese nationals travelling to Ireland will be Approved Destination Status (ADS) tourists &mdash; the approval comes from the Chinese authorities.  As has been the case for several years now, ADS tourists who are in possession of a UK visa and who apply for an Irish visa are issued with that visa free of charge.  While is not possible at this time to state definitively how many additional Chinese tourists have arrived as a result of the Visa Waiver Programme, <Col N="369"/>the initial indications of the impact of the Programme are very positive.  I am committed also, as stated at the launch of the Programme, to carry out a formal review of the Programme and I hope to have this review completed as early as possible in 2012.  In this context, I will be seeking the input and cooperation of the tourism industry and carriers in order to assess the overall impact of the scheme.</P>

	<P>I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to my response to Question No. 93 on 26 October last in which I stated that under the law as it stands the giving of false evidence in any court proceedings, including family law proceedings, is an offence punishable by imprisonment.  I also indicated that while I have no specific proposals for reform at present, I will keep operation of the law in family cases under review.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service.  The Act provides that the Service is independent in performance of its functions, which includes the provision of statistics.  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that it does not compile statistics on allegations as such that are made in the course of any court proceedings.  But I am informed that where an allegation arises in the course of a custody or access case, a court may direct the health authorities to undertake an investigation of the matter.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that valid applications for a certificate of naturalisation were received from the persons referred to by the Deputy in October 2010.</P>
        <P>The applications are currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicants meet the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>
        <P>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without <Col N="371"/>the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed that the current average processing time for Garda vetting applications at the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) is 9 weeks.  This is a significant improvement on the average processing time of 12 weeks at the end of last year.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process. </P>
        <P>This processing time can, nevertheless, be affected by seasonal fluctuations or the necessity to seek further information on particular applications.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the above, I am very conscious of the need to keep the time required to obtain a vetting to the minimum possible. Since taking office I have taken a number of initiatives with a view to achieving this objective.  The sanction of the Department of Finance was obtained to retain the services of 10 temporary employees working in the GCVU.  Sanction was also obtained to engage an additional 10 temporary employees and these have recently commenced work in the GCVU.  A further initiative to provide internships through the National Internship Scheme, &ldquo;Job Bridge&rdquo;, under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection, is also currently under way.</P>
        <P>All of this should have a further positive impact on processing times.</P>
        <P>In relation to the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question I am advised that a vetting application was received by the GCVU on 11 July 2011 on behalf of the person concerned.  However, the application was incomplete and returned to the registered organisation for completion.  The completed application was resubmitted to the Vetting Unit on 5 October 2011 and a response issued to the registered organisation on 4 November 2011.</P>

	<P>Under the Bankruptcy Act 1988 the period of application to court for discharge of a bankruptcy was 12 years.  The conditions of discharge were full realisation of the estate of the bankrupt, payment of fees and expenses and of preferential debts.  There was no provision for automatic discharge of a bankruptcy and it meant that where liabilities were not discharged the bankruptcy could last indefinitely.  I made provision in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 for discharge of a bankruptcy after 5 years subject to the conditions for discharge specified in the Act of 1988.  I introduced for the first time provision for automatic discharge of a bankruptcy after 12 years have elapsed since the adjudication of bankruptcy.  The new provisions commenced on 10 October 2011.</P><Col N="372"/>
        <P>The question of further reductions in the period for discharge of a bankruptcy, including automatic discharge, is being considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s development of proposals for the Personal Insolvency Bill that is a commitment in the Government Legislation Programme and under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has an important role in ensuring that proper standards are maintained in all 3 of the children detention schools on the Oberstown campus, Lusk, Co Dublin.  These are Trinity House School, Oberstown Boys School and Oberstown Girls School.  There is one Board of Management on the Oberstown campus, which has responsibility for all 3 children detention schools.  The HIQA recommendation mentioned by the Deputy applies to the Board of Management of the Oberstown campus, and not Trinity House School.  The roles of the Minister, the Board, and the Director are set out in Part 10 the Children Act, 2001.</P>
        <P>The HIQA inspection report No. 393 on Trinity House School, published in November 2010, included a recommendation that the Board of Management should produce a statement in the terms outlined by the Deputy.  This recommendation was reviewed by HIQA in a further inspection report (No. 453) published in August 2011 which noted that a draft statement had been prepared, but this had yet to be provided to HIQA inspectors.  I understand that the Board has not, prior to its recent expiry, approved a statement which would implement this recommendation.  A new Board is due to be appointed shortly and responsibility for this matter will transfer to my colleague the Minster for Children and Youth Affairs.  I am advised that one of the its first priority tasks will be to draw up an implementation plan to address any outstanding recommendations made by HIQA. I expect that the recommendation outlined by the Deputy will be fully met at an early stage in the term of the new Board.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Military Star was inaugurated on 10 September 1998.  The Military Star is awarded posthumously to personnel of the Defence Forces who gave up their lives as a result of a hostile action or act in the course of service outside the State on approved military duties overseas. The Military Star was introduced 40 years after the first deployment overseas of Defence Forces personnel in 1958. Under the existing provisions of Defence Force Regulations, members of the Defence Forces who died in service in the course of service outside the State on approved military duties overseas on or after 28 June 1958 are eligible for the award of the medal.  In 2008 a Medals Review Group, comprising representatives of both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, was established to conduct a comprehensive review of medals awarded to members of the Defence Forces, at home and overseas. One of the recommendations of the Report of this Group was &ldquo;<i>that the award of the Military Star medal be extended to members who died in service at home as a direct result of hostile action or act perpetrated by an enemy, opposing armed force, hostile belligerent or other party involving the use of firepower or other lethal weapon, while on approved military duties.</i>&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Work is ongoing in both the Department and the Defence Forces to draft the necessary amendments to Defence Force Regulations to give effect to the recommendations of the Report of the Medals Review Group, including that relating to the Military Star. Work in this regard is at an advanced stage and once it is complete consideration can be given to the specific case referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Gormanston Camp is the principal recruit training camp in the Eastern Brigade region and is used throughout the year by personnel from both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force.  To date in 2011, the Defence Forces have organised 15 courses of different types and duration.  The Camp has also been used for five training camps, including three Reserve Defence Force training weekends.  This level of activity is in line with what happened in 2010.</P>
        <P>In more general terms, the Camp continues to be used extensively for weapons training by units of the Eastern Brigade as well as by the Air Corps and the Naval Service, whilst the Pistol Range is also used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its training purposes.  The Camp also facilitates the conduct of land to air, sea to air and air to sea firing practices and is the only such facility available to the Defence Forces for these purposes.  It also has a number of aircraft <Col N="397"/>hangers, one of which is used by the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</P>
        <P>The Camp also continues to be used as a base for one of the Defence Forces&rsquo; Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams.  Both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Civil Defence also use the Camp for courses, exercises and competitions.  To date in 2011, these bodies have used the camp on seven occasions.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the fisheries policy of the European Union which was first put in place in 1983 and has been subject to reviews every 10 years, the most recent was in 2002 and the next reform is scheduled for adoption in the latter half of 2012.</P>
        <P>The CFP is scheduled for adoption in the latter half of 2012.  This is an ambitious target and there is a strong possibility that the adoption of the new policy will be delayed and fall into 2013 during the Irish Presidency of the EU.</P>
        <P>A reformed CFP is a critical policy issue for Ireland as it will shape the strategic blueprint for the European fishing industry for the next decade.  The CFP impacts on the social, economic and environmental pillars of the wider seafood industry and the proposals will hold both opportunities and risks for Ireland.</P>
        <P>My overarching goal for the new CFP is for a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to deliver a sustainable and eco-centred fisheries landscape for future generations.  I am pursuing initiatives that will deliver and sustain jobs in coastal communities rather than those that promote the concentration of wealth and delivery of excessive profits for a few big international businesses.</P>
        <P>I broadly support the general thrust of the proposals put forward by the Commission in its proposal of 13th July on such key issues as enhanced conservation, rebuilding fish stocks, reducing discarding of fish, introducing more selective fishing gears to allow small fish and unwanted by catches to escape and the use of multi-annual plans as a primary tool to rebuild and manage fish stocks.</P>
        <P>However I have differing views on some key points from an Irish perspective.  Subject to further negotiation on important details in respect of those issues I would expect that by the conclusion of the negotiations, I would hope to be in a position to support these important elements of the Reform proposals.  Within the package there are specific issues that are of critical importance to Ireland which I will address in more detail.</P>
        <P>I have serious concerns about the implications of the Commissions intention to impose the mandatory introduction of individually transferable concessions (quotas).  Under this system, fish quotas would be allocated as tradeable commodities to private individuals and companies for at least 15 years and those individuals would be permitted to sell on the quotas.</P>
        <P>There is serious concern in Ireland that under the current set of proposals, which the Commission has published, there is a real risk that the economic benefit from our quotas will be <Col N="400"/>increasingly lost to Ireland, despite the Commissions assurances.  At this point, I can see no safeguards that could be built into the proposals which would prevent this happening.</P>
        <P>In relation to discards, I fully support the objectives on addressing the unacceptable and wasteful practice of discarding as set in this proposal.  The Commission proposal involves the introduction of a blanket ban on discarding of fish which would be applied incrementally over the period 2014 to 2016.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been to the forefront in the debate on discards and as recently as Tuesday the 8th November published an Irish &ldquo;atlas of discards&rdquo; which details the level of discards by the Irish fleet and proposes potential solutions.</P>
        <P>I believe that we need radical action to bring an end to this wasteful practice which is as abhorrent to fishermen as it is to the general public.  In my opinion, the Commission proposal for a ban is too simplistic and is more likely to result in the concealment of the practice than a change in the behaviour.  I am absolutely committed to addressing the problem in a practical and progressive manner working directly with fishermen and scientists.</P>
        <P>The retention of the Hague Preferences is a key issue for Ireland as it gives Irish Fishermen a safety net of additional quotas when stock levels go below a certain point.  In the Commission proposal, the Hague Preferences  are recognised in the same manner as here to fore.  Ireland sought their full integration into the CFP to avoid the current situation where there application each year is a matter for decision by the EU Fisheries Council.  I will continue to pursue this approach but I am fully aware that we may face opposition for their inclusion, in any form, from those Member States who lose quota when they are invoked.</P>
        <P>In terms of the process, there is a long road to take before the reform of the CFP is finalised, many Member States will have conflicting agendas on certain issues.  Commissioner Damanaki has visited Ireland and I had a good opportunity to set out Ireland&rsquo;s priorities and to give her a full understanding of the situation of the sector in Ireland and the likely impacts of her proposals, both positive and negative.</P>
        <P>I have been actively building alliances with like minded colleagues in Europe.  I met with my French Counterpart Minister Le Maire on the 30th September and issued a joint communiqu&eacute; which included a commitment to work closely on sustainability measures including discards, regionalisation and importantly on our opposition to the proposals on ITQs as they currently stand.</P>
        <P>I also met my British and Scottish counterparts at the November Fisheries Council where we had a broad discussion on fisheries related issues including the reform of the CFP.</P>
        <P>In addition I am working very closely with the Irish industry to ensure an orchestrated and focussed message on Ireland&rsquo;s priorities for the reformed CFP is brought to as many fora as possible in Brussels.</P>
        <P>I intend to continue this process and will take every opportunity to explain Ireland&rsquo;s priorities and seek support for our stance, in order to strengthen our negotiating position and deliver the best possible outcome for Ireland.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed ban on the sale of raw milk for direct human consumption is not new. Sale of raw cows&rsquo; milk was banned for many years (from 1997 till 2006) by my Department; and previously by most local authorities.  The ban lapsed due to a change in EU legislation in 2006.  In effect renewal of the ban will constitute a return to the status quo.</P>
        <P>A public consultation process was held in 2008 in relation to the proposed extension of the ban to goats&rsquo; and sheep milk.  Seventeen submissions were received.  The submissions were wide ranging and included requests to allow restricted sale of raw milk as well as a number of claims of perceived health benefits of drinking raw milk.  All the submissions were carefully reviewed by my Department&rsquo;s experts in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. They were satisfied that the claimed benefits from drinking raw milk did not outweigh strong advice concerning the known health risks associated with drinking raw milk.  These include diseases such as TB, Brucellosis, E. coli O157, Campylobacter and Salmonella.  Illness associated with consumption of raw milk is thankfully rare, but this is precisely because of the fact that the vast bulk of liquid milk consumed in Ireland is pasteurised, partly due to the existence of the previous longstanding ban.  International data show that outbreaks increase when the numbers consuming raw milk are allowed to increase.</P>
        <P>The FSAI has therefore recommended that the sale of unpasteurised milk from all farm animals which is intended for direct human consumption should be prohibited; and advises that the most effective way to protect public health is to ensure that such milk is pasteurised.  Pasteurisation is universally recognised as having been one of the greatest advances in public health and it is important that we do not create conditions in this country, by effectively opening up a new outlet for raw milk, which could undo some of that good.</P>
        <P>The proposed ban will not apply to the consumption of raw milk &mdash; e.g. a dairy farmer drinking milk from his/her own cows.  Such a ban is not possible under the law and in any event would be unenforceable.  However, it is recommended to avoid this practice for health reasons.  Home pasteurisation units are commercially available.</P>
        <P>The proposed ban will not apply either to the use of raw milk to make cheese. The cheese making process takes time and this provides an opportunity (which does not exist with raw milk per se) to withdraw product from sale in the event of a problem arising with the source milk.  The cheese making process also prevents growth of pathogens and in some cases encourages slow decline in numbers of some pathogens.</P>
        <P>With regard to business opportunities, a number of artisan food producers are pasteurising raw whole milk and are licensed by my Department in this regard. These artisans are very successfully marketing liquid whole milk, ice cream, different flavoured yoghurts and artisan farmhouse cheeses.  I am advised by the FSAI that meaningful differences in nutritional value between pasteurised and unpasteurised milk have not been demonstrated and these artisans <Col N="402"/>clearly show that pasteurised whole milk can be used in the manufacture of safe and quality dairy products.</P>
        <P>Any food scare associated with the sale of raw Irish milk for direct human consumption could have major implications for our dairy industry.  Ireland exports over &euro;2bn worth of dairy products each year; and is the leading producer of infant formula with about 15% of the world market.  The recent E. coli outbreak in Germany, resulting in 46 deaths, 782 cases of HUS (haemolytic uraemic syndrome, a serious kidney condition) and 3,128 known cases of VTEC, indicates the scale of possible risks associated with raw food.</P>
        <P>The prevalence of TB in herds in Ireland also puts us in a different position to most other Member States in the EU where the disease has been eradicated.  It is inappropriate that Ireland should adopt the same approach to the consumption of raw milk as countries that do not have the same difficulty with TB and therefore have no associated risk.</P>
        <P>Regulation allowing sale of raw milk for direct human consumption, on a restricted basis, would be difficult and costly to implement.  Most important however such regulation would still not eliminate the serious health risks.  Even under the best conditions, raw milk can contain low levels of human pathogens that can cause serious illness or rapidly increase to harmful levels.  Labelling as a precaution would be least effective with some of the most at-risk groups i.e. the young and the elderly.</P>
        <P>Other EU countries which ban the sale of raw milk for human consumption are Scotland, Denmark and Spain.  Austria and Italy require that labels advise boiling before consumption.  Further afield a number of countries ban the sale of raw milk, as do many of the States in the USA.</P>
        <P>In all the circumstances I am satisfied that a renewal of the ban on the sale of raw milk for direct human consumption is justified.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s legislative responsibility in the area of animal welfare extends to farmed animals only, including animals normally bred or kept for the production of food.  Accordingly, matters relating to feral cats do not come within the scope of my Department.  Nevertheless, my Department provides in excess of &euro;1million annually to animal welfare organisations involved in the provision of animal care.  In awarding the funding, we remind organisations involved in the rehoming of cats of the absolute necessity to ensure that all such animals are neutered before rehoming as this will assist in controlling numbers. </P>
        <P>With regard to cat welfare, the position is that my Department is drafting an Animal Health and Welfare Bill which aims to update existing legislation in the area of health and welfare to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals, is properly protected.  Drafting of the Bill is ongoing with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it is my intention to publish the Bill at an early date.</P>

	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government announced on 12 October 2011 an extension to the period during which slurry may be spread, up to 31 October 2011.  I had sought this extension, as an exceptional once off measure, because of the abnormally high rainfall during the month of September in particular, which caused significant hardship for farmers and made it extremely difficult to carry out regular farming activity.</P>
        <P>The Nitrates Regulations were reviewed in 2010 and amongst the wide range of submissions considered by an Expert Advisory Group established by my Department and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, were a number seeking increased flexibility with regard to the commencement of the closed period for spreading organic fertiliser. <Col N="404"/> The Expert Advisory Group concluded that the scientific evidence showed the application of organic fertiliser at this time of the year represents an unacceptable risk to the environment as well as a loss of a valuable fertiliser product as there is little or no take-up of nutrient by grass or other plants during the dormant season.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has stated that he is not prepared to consider a further extension to the period for spreading slurry.</P>

	<P>Under EU telecoms rules agreed in 2009, the 116000 number is reserved in all EU member states for a missing children hotline. In a recent debate on this issue in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, on 12 October last, I gave a commitment to work with relevant Departments and agencies to establish this Hotline in Ireland in 2012. I also announced my intention to establish a cross-sectoral Project Team to include representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The final nominee to the project team has just been received and the team is now in a position to commence its work.</P>
        <P>This team will examine how best to operate the Hotline, in the context of  the demand for the service, and to establish the extent to which services, including Garda and victim support services, which are already in existence and receiving Government funding, can be mobilised to meet Ireland&rsquo;s commitments in relation to the Hotline.</P>
        <P>In seeking to make progress on this issue, my Department has already had discussions with the Departments of Justice and Equality and of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and with ComReg.  Further discussions will be held in the context of the meetings of the Project Team.</P>
        <P>I want to emphasise that the investigation of a child&rsquo;s disappearance is the responsibility of the Garda&iacute;.  Their structures in this regard include not only the local Garda&iacute;, who will have primary responsibility for the investigation, but also the Missing Persons Bureau.</P>
        <P>It is of paramount importance that any arrangements which are put in place to establish the 116000 Hotline in Ireland do not compromise the requirement that the first and most important contact to be made, is to notify the Garda&iacute; of the fact that a child is missing, so the investigation can commence without delay.</P>
        <P>However the implementation of a dedicated missing children hotline is intended to provide a further level of support in such situations.</P>

	<P>The free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 with the objective of providing a free pre-school year to all eligible children. Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less <Col N="405"/>than 4 years 7 months on 1 September in the relevant year.  This means that children born between 2 February 2007 and 30 June 2008 qualified for the free pre-school year in September 2011.   There is no provision under the programme to enrol children who are below the qualifying age.</P>
        <P>The objective of the ECCE programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the pre-school year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  For this reason, it is appropriate to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will qualify.</P>
        <P>A number of parents have asked for the lower age range to be reduced on the grounds that they wish to send their children to school when they are 4 years and 2 months of age or less.  The issue was referred by some of these parents to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  That Office found no reason to remove or amend the lower age range, accepting it as reasonable having regard to the various factors which apply.</P>
        <P>The new Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme was introduced in September 2010 and is being implemented by my Department.  The CETS programme replaces the previous childcare support schemes implemented by F&Aacute;S and the VECs under which qualifying students and trainees were given a weekly Childcare Allowance of up to &euro;63.50 per child as a contribution to their childcare costs.  Under the CETS programme, qualifying students and trainees can avail of childcare places free of charge.  The eligibility criteria are unchanged and continue to be determined by F&Aacute;S and the VECs.  Parents who consider that they are eligible under this programme should contact their local City and County Childcare Committee to establish if there are vacant CETS places available in their area.</P>
        <P>I also have responsibility for implementing the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme which provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to disadvantaged and low income families.  Parents can qualify for support with their childcare costs through the CCS programme which is provided through community not for profit childcare services.  Some 950 services throughout the State are participating in the CCS programme and receive funding which is passed on to qualifying parents in the form of reduced childcare fees.</P>
        <P>Parents who consider that they qualify for support under the CCS programme should also contact their local City and County Childcare Committee to establish  what participating community childcare facilities are available in their area.</P>

	<P>I have responsibility for the implementation of the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) which included a capital grant programme to develop childcare facilities.  </P>
        <P>Under the NCIP capital funding was made available to community and commercial childcare providers for the development and refurbishment of childcare facilities.  Due to the economic downturn, and following a review of capital expenditure, the previous Government decided to close the programme to new grant applications. There is therefore no capital funding currently available to my Department.</P><Col N="406"/>
        <P>Commercial and community childcare providers, who fulfil certain criteria, can apply to participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which was introduced in January 2010.  This programme provides a free pre-school year to all qualifying children. A standard capitation payment of &euro;2,450 per annum, and a higher capitation payment of &euro;2,850 per annum for services with more highly qualified staff, is payable for each eligible child enrolled under this programme.</P>
        <P>Services can also apply to participate in the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which was introduced in September 2010.  The CETS programme provides for payments of up to &euro;170 per week for each child enrolled in participating services to cover the childcare costs for VEC students or F&Aacute;S trainees qualifying under the programme.  Details of the ECCE and CETS  programmes are available from the local City or County Childcare Committee.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the joint statement issued yesterday, (Wednesday, 9 November, 2011) by the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Michael Jackson (President of Tallaght Hospital), the Board of Tallaght Hospital and I.  In this statement we announced a framework to implement a series of new initiatives to reform and modernise the governance structures of the Hospital. This announcement follows an intensive and positive series of discussions involving the Hospital Board and President, my officials, the HSE and myself.</P>
        <P>The discussions took place against the challenging backdrop faced by the Hospital in the context of a significant budgetary overrun at the Hospital and the commencement of a HIQA investigation into practices in its Emergency Department.</P>
        <P>I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge  publicly the success achieved by the current management and Board of Tallaght Hospital in bringing the budgetary overrun under strict control within agreed parameters, agreeing a further cost saving plan for 2012 and for voluntarily commencing the process of reforming the governance structure of the Hospital &mdash; all of which has been achieved since August 2011.</P>
        <P>The unique history of Tallaght Hospital, combining as it does (in the form of a Charter) the identity of three separate foundations (the Meath Foundation, the Adelaide Hospital Society and the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital) has resulted in a governance structure which is ultimately no longer properly suited to the modern complexities of running an academic teaching hospital of such a scale.</P>
        <P>It has been agreed to implement the reform of the governance structure over two phases with a further reduction in the size of the Hospital Board occurring imminently by the appointment of an interim board while in the longer term the Charter will be replaced by new legislation.  The voluntary status of the Hospital will remain and the pluralist core values of the Hospital are assured and will be carried over into the replacement legislation. The values and principles of openness and inclusiveness in all aspects of health care provision, relating to <Col N="407"/>medicine, nursing and research, shall be maintained by the President of the hospital as  will  the principles of pluralism, freedom of conscience and freedom to practise religion in the Hospital.</P>
        <P>These changes, with the support of the foundations, the President and Board of the Hospital, and myself are considered essential for ongoing progress to be assured in the prudent and effective management of the Hospital in a manner that gives the greatest assurance that  patients get the best possible service from the available resources.</P>
        <P>I remain in close contact with the HSE and Tallaght Hospital in order to resolve this matter as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware I commissioned an independent Review around a number of issues relating to the location of the new hospital on the Mater Campus. </P>
        <P>I announced the outcome of the Review on 6 July 2011.  The independent experts who formed the Review Team, having examined all the issues in accordance with the Terms of Reference set by myself, came to the unanimous and unequivocal recommendation that the development of the new hospital should proceed on the Mater Campus.</P>
        <P>I confirmed the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of the recommendation of the Review Team and requested the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) to proceed with a planning application to an Bord Plean&aacute;la. Planning permission has just completed the oral hearing stage but is unlikely to be ruled on before 2012.   Today, I am delighted to welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to maintain the existing levels of health capital investment. This confirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering quality services in modern facilities for the children of Ireland through the provision of the necessary funding for the delivery of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, and the associated ambulatory and urgent care centre in Tallaght.</P>

The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.</P><Col N="408"/>

	<P>The HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS) employs in excess of 1,400 staff who are practitioners registered with the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC), the professional regulator for Pre Hospital Emergency Care with the National Qualification in Emergency Medical Technology (NQEMT) at the level of competence of emergency medical technician, paramedic or advanced paramedic. </P>
        <P>A number of grades of staff within the NAS, including Operational, Control, Education and Management personnel hold either Paramedic or Advanced Paramedic registration with PHECC. Registration as a Paramedic is not unique to any one grade and consequently the term represents a clinical level rather than an employment grade.</P>
        <P>The principal current employment grades for operational staff in the National Ambulance Service are Emergency Medical Technician and Leading Emergency Medical Technician. The vast majority of those employed in these grades are qualified to at least Paramedic level. However, it remains the case that for a number of staff with long service, registration as a Paramedic remains a voluntary process.  The Action Plan for the National Ambulance Service under the Public Service Agreement sets out a comprehensive reform agenda for this essential part of the health service. The Action Plan provides for the introduction of mandatory registration at PHECC Paramedic level or above for all staff working at EMT/LEMT grades. The possible re-titling of the employment grade to Paramedic will be considered by the HSE in that context.</P>

	<P>I would like to reassure the Deputy that patients in Tallaght Hospital (or any other Acute Hospital) who require long term residential care can continue to apply for financial support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  Once a person receives approval for financial support they can choose to enter any nursing home that is participating in the scheme in any part of the country, subject to the nursing home having an available bed and being able to cater for the person&rsquo;s particular needs. This applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes alike.  </P>
        <P>Patients at Tallaght Hospital requiring residential care will be able to avail of beds at the new purpose built Community Nursing Unit in Inchicore if and when they become available.  They will also be able to avail of options from public beds that are reopened in other facilities or they may choose a bed in a private nursing home.    If the Board of Tallaght Hospital wish to discuss this issue with Minister Reilly a representative should contact his Office directly and officials will be able to assist with such a request.   In addition requests to meet my colleague can be made electronically to <i>ministersoffice@health.gov.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>In the context of ensuring that service levels are managed within existing resources, the HSE has sought cost reductions in the Dublin Mid Leinster region across all hospital and community services for the remainder of the year, through in the first instance, additional efficiency measures.  The specific effect of this in relation to the nine drugs projects in Tallaght is a reduction of 5% in funding for the 4th Quarter of 2011 totalling &euro;11,536. </P>
        <P>I recently met with the Tallaght Drugs Task Force to discuss this issue. I subsequently raised the issue with the HSE, and registered my dissatisfaction that my office was not consulted prior to cut-backs being imposed. I have also asked the HSE to examine alternative cost-saving measures as put forward by the Tallaght Drugs Task Force.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 188 together.</P>
        <P>I have made it a priority to unblock access to acute services in our hospitals by improving the patient flow through the system. Access to services is not about bed numbers per se, it is about how the bed capacity in a hospital is managed to maximise throughput and provide safe and quality care to patients.</P>
        <P>The Special Delivery Unit, which I established in June this year, is focussing on these issues. The SDU is establishing an infrastructure based on information collection and analysis, hospital by hospital, so that we will know what is actually happening in real time. It is providing information tools for hospital managers, including clinical managers, to map and measure bed capacity in their hospital depending on variations in for example the average length of stay of patients. This will allow us to begin to embed performance management in the system, to manage bed capacity and to sustain shorter waiting times.</P>
        <P>As part of the process of forming the overall picture of the emergency departments situation nationally, the SDU has identified fifteen hospitals which between them account for 80% of the trolley wait problem in the hospital system. Eight Hospitals have been identified for very high support including Our Lady of Lourdes Drogheda. Liaison Officers from the SDU are working pro-actively to support these sites.</P>
        <P>I have also agreed that some additional funding may be provided, on a strictly once off basis, based on specific proposals from the hospitals to reduce waiting times between now and the end of the year. Adherence to the agreed criteria will be closely monitored by the SDU.</P>
        <P>In the case of Our Lady of Lourdes Drogheda, the hospital has requested a range of supports and the SDU has agreed to a set of proposals which will cost over &euro;700,000 between now and the end of this year. The measures planned include extending the opening of the Medical Assessment Unit and the opening of eight medical beds at Our Lady of Lourdes. Other measures include facilitating early assisted discharge for medically fit patients and the provision <Col N="412"/>of early access to intermediate care for prospective long term care discharges, as well as the opening of 28 low acuity beds in the Louth/Navan hospitals to provide an intermediate care discharge area.</P>
        <P>The conditions and performance measures which Our Lady of Lourdes and other  hospitals will have to meet are as follows; for the remainder of the year and throughout January 2012 no patient will wait more than 23 hours in the hospital&rsquo;s Emergency Department.  In addition the trolley wait target must be maintained at least 70% below the maximum daily trolley count since January 2010.  Other conditions/performance measures include: seven day ward/discharge rounds; achievement of all Acute Medicine Programme milestones; and implementation of approved measures to effectively stream elderly patients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2010, the life expectancy at birth for men in Ireland was 78.7 years, and for women was 83.2 years. The corresponding figures for 1997 are 73.4 years for men and 78.7 years for women.  This represents an increase of 5.3 years for men and 4.5 years for women.  For the period 1997 to 2008 (the latest year comparable data is available) Ireland has gone from a position of nearly 1 year below average EU life expectancy to almost 1 year above during which time average EU life expectancy has also been increasing. </P>
        <P>The most marked improvements in life expectancy in Ireland have occurred at ages 65 and over.  In 2010, those aged 65 could expect to live almost 4 years longer than those aged 65 in 1997.  This represents a significant change from earlier decades where gains in overall life expectancy were principally achieved through reduction in deaths from infectious diseases and in infant mortality.  The recent improvements have resulted from improved health into older <Col N="413"/>age and improved survival from conditions affecting older age groups such as heart disease and cancer.  Advances in health care have contributed significantly to this achievement.</P>

	<P>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads, in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993. Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.My Department received an application from Kildare County Council in November 2008 for 100% funding of the Athy Southern Distributor Road at an estimated cost of &euro;42 million.  A grant of &euro;150,000 was allocated to the Council in 2011 to allow certain design and planning work on this project to be undertaken. </P>
        <P>I have not had any requests for a meeting from the National Roads Authority or Kildare County Council in relation to this project and no meetings have taken place.</P>

        <Quest> if an individual or company that acts as an agent or representative is exempt from the obligation of having a road haulage licence; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>In general, a Road Haulage Operator&rsquo;s Licence is required if a firm is itself actually carrying goods for hire or reward in large heavy goods vehicles belonging to that firm.</P><Col N="416"/>
        <P> If an Individual or company is acting as an agent or representative, but are not themselves in the business of carrying goods for hire or reward in their own vehicles, then they are not obliged to have a licence.  There are many such companies, usually known as freight forwarders, and they do not require a haulage licence for that work.</P>
        <P>It is, however, illegal under the Road Transport Acts for any person to engage or use the services of a haulier unless that haulier has a road transport operator&rsquo;s licence.  Freight forwarders are therefore obliged to only use properly licensed haulage operators, where the work requires that.</P>
