      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter, who is unable to take questions today.  He is attending a European Council meeting on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 to 51, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="462"/>
        <P>The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme and has been recommended in many reports in recent years.  This was a key consideration of Government in addressing this issue as releasing personnel from security and support functions enables the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to be maintained notwithstanding the fall in strength.</P>
        <P>The savings that will arise in respect of utilities, security duty allowance and maintenance will be approximately &euro;0.4 million in respect of Mullingar, &euro;0.4 million in respect of Clonmel, &euro;0.35 million in respect of Cavan and &euro;0.1 million in respect of Castlebar.  In addition to the cost of utilities each barracks requires a security detail and additional further personnel are tied up on purely administrative duties connected to the management of the particular barracks.  In addition, because maintaining barrack security can require around the clock cover a much larger pool of personnel is required.  Consequently, several hundred additional man years will become available for operational duties.  At a minimum, the value of this efficiency gain across the four locations will exceed &euro;5 million per year.</P>
        <P>Expenditure at the receiving barracks is an estimated &euro;1 million to provide immediate accommodation, including some temporary measures.  A further &euro;3 million to &euro;4 million will be required for permanent works in the next two to three years.  In Custume Barracks in Athlone there is sufficient accommodation to provide for personnel relocating from the barracks in Cavan and Mullingar who choose to live in barracks on a single living-in basis.  Mess, dining and other welfare facilities will also be available to these personnel from existing facilities at Custume Barracks.  Work-related accommodation will also be put in place before personnel relocate.  There are no plans for providing extra accommodation in Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick.  However, it is expected there will be a requirement for the provision of additional locker facilities at an estimated cost of &euro;50,000.  There will be no requirement for expenditure in Stephens Barracks, Kilkenny, as personnel relocating there will be filling existing vacancies.  Alternative arrangements for Reserve Defence Force units located at the closing barracks has not yet been finalised but will be put in place before 30 March 2012.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Defence Forces regulations provide for the payment of certain allowances to qualifying personnel on change of station.  The allowances payable depend on the individual circumstances of each applicant.  In general, prescribed travel allowances may be paid for up to nine months.  There is also provision in the regulations to cover certain costs, such as auctioneers&rsquo; and legal fees incurred by qualifying personnel who purchase a house at their new station.  As the allowances payable will be based on individual circumstances it is not possible to say what the final costs will be.  However, based on the 2009 barracks closures 326 qualifying personnel in the four locations that closed received some &euro;677,000 in total in change of station allowances, an average of &euro;2,077 per person.  It is likely that the average change of station allowance payment per qualifying person will be of the same order on this occasion.</P>
        <P>The Department of Defence is arranging for the briefing of personnel in respect of change of station allowance in the coming weeks.  The purpose of these briefings is to give an outline of the change of station allowance scheme to the relevant personnel and to address, in so far as possible, any issues of concern that may arise.</P>
        <P>Once they become vacant the four barracks being closed will be administered by the Department which will be responsible for security pending disposal.    An assessment of the security requirement will be carried out in advance of the closures and appropriate measures put in place.  The Deputy will appreciate that I should not go into details at this stage.</P>
        <P>Based on the experience of previous closures, it is anticipated the impact on local communities will be negligible.  This is based on the experience that most of the personnel serving in these installations live in the areas and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="463"/>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>These closures will have potential savings of just over &euro;1 million in direct costs and what the Minister of State defined as an efficiency gain, for which there is no way of quantifying, of &euro;5 million.  The costs of moving the barracks and personnel, on the other hand, will involve &euro;4 million in capital costs required in the other barracks.  An allowance for soldiers to move will come to &euro;700,000.  This does not include the security costs which I appreciate the Minister of State cannot give in his reply.  In the long term, this will come to more than the so-called anticipated efficiencies.</P>
        <P>Have any other potential uses for the properties in Cavan, Mullingar, Clonmel and Castlebar been identified?  Has the Department been in touch with local authorities in identifying the sites for, say, community uses or as enterprise centres?</P>
        <P>What is the timeline for the closure of the barracks in question?  D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill in Cavan, Columb in Mullingar and Kickham in Clonmel were worth &euro;22 million combined to their three towns.  Of this amount, how much does the Department estimate will be lost to the three towns in question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The potential savings are &euro;5 million per year.  This is not just about money savings but making the Defence Forces more professional.  The number of full-time personnel in the Defence Forces has dropped considerably over the past several years.  The Government made a commitment in the programme for Government and in last week&rsquo;s budget that personnel levels will be maintained at 9,500.  The closure of these barracks will release some personnel from other duties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I stated in my reply, if one wants 24-7 barrack security, it can tie up quite a number of soldiers to perform it in rotation.  The redeployment to other barracks will release more man hours and allow for these duties to be performed more efficiently.  When personnel levels were at 14,000, it was easy to keep these barracks open.  The Government had to make a decision on this and did so.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Defence met several delegations prior to the closures, often for up to two hours, on future potential uses of the barrack sites in question.  The Minister&rsquo;s priority is not to have these sites left idle.  As I said in my reply, most personnel stayed in their existing accommodation when barracks were closed by the Deputy&rsquo;s party in government.  I do not believe the closures will result in a huge revenue loss to any town.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State referred to the potential loss to local communities and I take on board his comment that the previous closure of barracks did not result in significant numbers of personnel moving.  Regardless of that, the closures will result in additional costs to them and that will have a knock-on effect on local communities.  I asked in my question whether a cost benefit analysis had been conducted on the impact of the closures rather than the Government presuming there would not be an impact.  Was such an analysis done on the potential losses, for example, to local businesses that supply barracks or to local authorities through lost commercial rates, etc., when local businesses close or following an increase in social welfare claims? Was a document produced that outlined step by step the potential losses to local economies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be no direct job losses in any barracks; everyone will be relocated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about the local economies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>No Defence Forces personnel will lose jobs because of the barracks closures.  I presume people who deliver to a barracks supply other barracks and I presume, for <Col N="464"/>example, food companies do business with other barracks.  A barracks cannot be kept open just because there might be a few euro less in the community.  I empathise with the business people in each of the towns where barracks closures will happen but none of the barracks closures in recent years led to the closure of local businesses.  I do not believe that any business will go to the wall because of a barracks closure.</P>
        <P>I stated clearly in my reply that compensation is available for Defence Forces personnel who have to move house and so on.  During previous closures, a minimal number of people moved out of the towns in which they lived when they were reassigned to another barracks.  They were able to commute on a daily basis to their new posting and they remained where they were.  The new postings are within daily commuting distance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I did not get a satisfactory reply to my questions.  The Minister of State is being disingenuous when he says there will be no job losses because many people in Clonmel have chosen to pull out and give up their chosen career, which is valuable to them and to the State.  Why was a decision taken to close Clonmel barracks?  It is 83 km from Sarsfield Barracks, with no motorway access, whereas St. Stephen&rsquo;s Barracks in Kilkenny is 81 km from the Curragh and 67 km of the journey can be covered by motorway.  The Minister of State contradicted himself by saying personnel can travel easily to their new barracks.  There is a motorway between Kilkenny and the Curragh but there is 81 km of bad road, the N24, between Clonmel and Limerick.</P>
        <P>My question also referred to the Defence Forces Reserve, which has a proud tradition of service all over the country, including in Clonmel and the surrounding district.  Members of the reserve want reassurance that if they give up their time to serve the State, they will retain an operational area in Clonmel barracks where they can continue to train.  The Minister of State might say it will not affect business.  Of course it will affect business.  This is a huge body blow to the spirit of the town of Clonmel.  The barracks is part of the fabric of the town and has been there since the time Cromwell failed to close it down.  It has resisted at all times.  It is very involved in the community and throws its doors open to many community services, not to mention all the good work that is done during floods, snow storms, search and rescue operations and everything else.  It is a huge psychological blow to the town and it is being resisted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can be assured that the Minister met PDFORRA as recently as yesterday.  He stated that if there are personnel in Clonmel barracks who, for personal reasons or otherwise, want to move to Kilkenny or elsewhere, there are negotiations which can be availed of.  The Minister, the Department and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces are very open to ensuring, in so far as possible, that all personnel will be accommodated in every way.</P>
        <P>With regard to the loss of revenue, I did not say businesses would not be affected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>He said they would not be closed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I said they would not go to the wall because of the barracks closing.  The Deputy was part of the Government when other barracks closed.  I do not believe any business in any of those towns went to the wall because a particular barracks closed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Different times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy referred to the reserve forces, which is an issue we are taking into account.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, is very much aware of this matter and of <Col N="465"/>the importance of the work the reserve forces carry out.  They will be accommodated when planning is being carried out on the future of the barracks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy said it is a huge psychological blow to Clonmel, and there is no doubt that it is, as it is for Cavan and Mullingar and in the case of the other barracks that closed in recent years.  However, just because the barracks in Clonmel has closed does not mean the Defence Forces will not be available in emergency cases, such as the flooding Clonmel has been prone to over many years.  I assure the Deputy that the Defence Forces are still there to serve on behalf of the community and for the community, and that will continue, not alone in Clonmel but right across the country.  During the recent inclement weather in December and January last, although there is only a very small barracks in County Wexford with just ten or 15 personnel, we still got the very same support from the Defence Forces as towns like Clonmel, Mullingar or Cavan, where there were full-time barracks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the compensation the Minister of State said may be available, will this be on an individual basis and depend on each individual&rsquo;s circumstances or will there be a set rate per person?  What are the timelines for the closures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked why the decision was taken to close Clonmel rather than Kilkenny given that they have the same significance, as is acknowledged by the Army itself, and the distances involved were not huge.  Why was Clonmel picked out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I want to repeat my question on the timelines.  Second, will the Minister of State provide me with the figure in regard to the family income supplement that may be payable because of reductions in pay and the extra burden being put on people travelling?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not have the figure to hand on income supplement, I can have my officials come back to Deputy Calleary on that.  I believe the timeline will be the first half of next year, although I do not have a specific date.  In response to Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, cases will be dealt with on an individual basis because everyone&rsquo;s needs will be different.</P>
        <P>Deputy McGrath asked why Clonmel barracks was chosen.  Different Defence Forces barracks have totally different operational duties, for example, the Curragh camp is more of a training camp than a barracks.  Within the Defence Forces, there were specific reasons different barracks were closed.</P>
        <P>I want to highlight a particular point.  Everybody will be accommodated in so far as possible.  If a person from Clonmel wants to go to the barracks in Kilkenny because of his or her personal circumstances, or if he or she wants to go to Limerick or Athlone, he or she will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  I can assure the House that no one will be left out in the cold.</P>
        <P>I understand this can be a sensitive time for members of the Defence Forces and, more importantly, for their families.  It puts an extra strain on the families.  We are in a space here where we must look after the professionalism of the Defence Forces which we want to keep to a maximum.  It is important to us that we do this on a professional basis, and I think that we have.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s comprehensive review of expenditure formed the basis for the budgetary decisions necessary to achieve the targets for fiscal consolidation over the period to the end of 2014.</P>
        <P>A detailed submission by the Department of Defence formed part of the review process.  The submission highlighted the significant reform that has been undertaken in recent years in Defence.  It also set out options for Government consideration and highlighted the consequences of alternative courses of action.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to say that the Government decided to maintain the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel.  This recognises the significant modernisation that has been achieved to date and reflects the Government&rsquo;s intention that the Defence Forces retain the capacity to operate effectively across all of the assigned roles within the restricted financial allocation.</P>
        <P>In response to this revised strength ceiling of 9,500, there will be a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces encompassing a reduction in the number of Army brigades from three to two.  The Chief of Staff was consulted in this regard.  I have asked the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence to bring forward detailed proposals for the Minister&rsquo;s consideration.  This will include proposals regarding territorial areas of responsibility.  Further barrack closures are not envisaged as part of this process.  The Deputies will appreciate that in advance of receipt of these proposals I will not be in a position to answer detailed questions.</P>
        <P>The reduction in the strength of the PDF to 9,500 personnel will deliver sustainable savings.  The re-organisation is a response to this reduction and is not intended as a cost saving measure in its own right.  The primary focus is to free up the maximum number of military personnel from administrative and support tasks.  In short, the re-organisation is about maintaining operational outputs and capabilities to best effect, within a reduced strength.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Croke Park agreement, the representative associations will be fully consulted on all aspects of implementation that fall within the scope of representation.  Across Departments, a similar approach is generally taken to implementing high level policy decisions as a result of the CRE.</P>
        <P>The Defence organisation has an enviable track record of modernisation and reform.  This remains a work in progress.  I look forward to working closely with the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General in furthering the reform agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, is not here because my question goes to the very heart of his style of ministry.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, spoke of consultation in terms of the Croke Park agreement, but this was announced before anybody in PDFORRA or RACO was told about it and before any Members were told about it.</P>
        <P>There are no savings to be made, as Deputy Kehoe stated in his response.  I struggle to see where reducing from three brigades to two will result in efficiencies or a better and more <Col N="467"/>efficiently managed Army.  It is not as if we had a huge force that would be managed better in two rather than in three brigades.</P>
        <P>It would have been far better to have gone into detail with PDFORRA and RACO and, I suspect, with Army management in terms of the ramifications of this decision before announcing it in such a manner.</P>
        <P>I will proudly speak in favour of retaining the Western Brigade.  It has performed a significant service, at home and abroad, for many years and many of its members are serving as we speak in the Lebanon.  Deputy Kehoe saw them off a few weeks ago.</P>
        <P>There is no efficiency immediately apparent in this decision.  Deputy Kehoe stated it is not a cost decision.  It is a bad day&rsquo;s work on the part of the Minister to undermine the morale of the Army and of the brigades in question by making this decision in the manner in which it was made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that the Minister met representatives of both PDFORRA and RACO yesterday on this issue.  In response to the previous question, I stated the number of personnel in the Defence Forces is 9,500.  In recent years, the number was as high as 12,000 to 14,000.  Unfortunately, we do not have enough personnel in the Defence Forces at present to maintain and sustain three brigades.</P>
        <P>The Minister consulted the Chief of Staff on this issue.  There will be full consultation between the Department and the Defence Forces.  Thereafter, a proposal will be made to the Minister.  It is a question of consultation, and full consultation will take place over the next while on where the brigades will be placed.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, will make his decision in the not-too-distant future.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that it is because of the personnel number in the Defence Forces that we have had to make this decision.  From having examined the funding available and the personnel figures, I note the previous Minister for Defence believed the budget would be sufficient to sustain a force of over 9,500, but if he had remained in office there would be a personnel number of 8,000 because there would not be sufficient finances to pay any more.  This does not reflect on Deputy Calleary but on the previous Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State referred to consultation and he just confirmed that PDFORRA and RACO were not consulted prior to the decision being announced.  Is it putting the cart before the horse to announce reorganisation involving a reduction from three brigades to two before asking the Chief of Staff and Secretary General to bring forward fitting proposals?  Surely a consultation process should be about whether a decision is feasible.  Will the Minister of State clarify the position on this?</P>
        <P>Who actually made the decision?  Was it a recommendation that came to the Minister or did the Minister himself decide, based on the figures, budgets and efficiencies, whether it was best to have three or two brigades?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is a ministerial decision for the Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter.  He will ask the Department to come up with a proposal.  Both the defence and departmental sides would work together and return to the Minister with a proposal for him to make a decision.</P>
        <P>There was very little consultation on the decentralisation of the Department of Defence.  This is a decision the Minister must make himself.  He will consult the Department and Defence Forces before he makes his decision.  As the Deputy will understand, the Defence Forces have the knowledge on the ground.  The Minister will be open to hearing the views of all parties and none if they have proposals to make.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="468"/>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is saying the Minister decided to reduce the number from three to two.  Having made that decision, did he then consult the Chief of Staff and Secretary General?  Alternatively, did the consultation take place prior to the announcement?  That is what I am trying to ascertain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a ministerial decision.  The Minister has asked the Department and Chief of Staff to make proposals in this regard.  They were consulted on this by the Minister.</P>

	<P>The only UN-led mission in which the Defence Forces are currently participating is the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.</P>
        <P>The total amount owing to the Department of Defence by the United Nations as of 30 November 2011 in respect of contributions towards troop and other costs associated with the participation of Defence Forces personnel in UN missions is approximately &euro;11.66 million, including deployment, rotation, troop and equipment costs.  The amount owed in respect of the current UNIFIL mission is &euro;4.68 million.  Repatriation costs of personnel and equipment from the MINURCAT mission in Chad amount to approximately &euro;6.7 million, subject to ongoing negotiations with the UN.  Costs associated with the participation in the UNIFIL mission in 2006-07 amounts to &euro;280,000 and payment from the UN is still awaited.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied with the arrangements in place for reimbursement of moneys owed to Ireland by the United Nations.  The recovery from the UN of the moneys owed is  pursued on an ongoing basis by the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs and Trade in conjunction with the permanent mission of Ireland to the UN in New York.  To date in 2011 the UN has reimbursed Ireland &euro;1.12 million, mainly in respect of the UNIFIL mission.  Following last week&rsquo;s signing of a memorandum of understanding with the UN for Ireland&rsquo;s contribution of Defence Forces personnel and equipment to UNIFIL it is anticipated that an additional &euro;1.8 million will be received from the UN by the end of this month.</P>

	<P>I wish our Defence Forces personnel, and particularly those who are serving overseas in UN missions, best wishes for the season and a safe and happy 2012.  In the context of our financial circumstances and the need to make every penny count, is there a way of avoiding the situation whereby debts incurred in 2006 are still outstanding so that the moneys owed to us by the UN are paid to us in a timely manner?  The Minister of State noted that part of the money owned on one mission is subject to an ongoing dispute.  Are these payment issues not agreed prior to the deployment of personnel?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>In any case where money is owed, there will always be negotiations.  That is what is happening at present in respect of the mission to Chad.  I assure the Deputy that all debts will be collected and the Department is working vigorously to this end.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Defence,</askee>
        <Quest>  further to Parliamentary Question No. 10 of 21 September 2011, the further progress that has been made with the value for money review of the Defence Forces; when he expects this review to be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[38673/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>A value for money review, VFM, of the Reserve Defence Force commenced in February 2010.  In the interim period the EU-IMF deal was signed.  The requisite fiscal consolidation which was a part of this deal has a direct bearing on the level of resourcing available for the Defence Forces.  This in turn is linked to the framing of future plans for the organisation of the Defence Forces, including the Reserve Defence Force.  In response to the economic difficulties, the level of resourcing available for the Defence Forces has decreased, which has impacted the broader organisation, including the resources available for the Reserve Defence Force.  There have been significant reductions in paid training and recruitment has been curtailed in line with these reductions.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s comprehensive review of expenditure, CRE, was the mechanism for determining the resource envelope for the Defence Forces over the coming years.  The CRE process has presented two challenges to the progression of the VFM review of the Reserve Defence Force.  First, members of the team undertaking the VFM review were asked to prioritise the CRE.  Second, it was not feasible to isolate proposals for the Reserve Defence Force until the resource envelope for the Defence Forces for the coming years was made known in budget 2012 following the completion of the CRE.  Accordingly, while work has been ongoing, it was not feasible to identify options for the future development of the Reserve pending clarity on the broader resource envelope.</P>
        <P>Significant challenges lie ahead within the reduced resource envelope.  As part of the response to the downsizing of the PDF to 9,500 personnel, a major reorganisation of the Defence Forces, encompassing a reduction from three to two Army brigades, will be undertaken.  This will also affect the Reserve Defence Force.  The Chief of Staff and Secretary General are to provide detailed proposals in this regard for consideration.  In effect, the work on the VFM review of the RDF has been overtaken by broader events.  The VFM steering committee will now consider the way ahead in light of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces and the budgetary provision.  Clearly, the future plans for the Reserve must dovetail with those for the overall defence organisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response and note his statement that the value for money review has been overtaken by budgetary and economic constraints.  Could he give any indication of when the Green Paper on defence might be published?  This is linked to the future of the Reserve Defence Force.  In addition, can he tell us when the new role of the value for money review might be made available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I will find out when the Green Paper will be available and pass the information on to the Deputy.  As the Deputy understands, when the funding envelope of the Permanent Defence Force is reduced, this must be mirrored in the Reserve Defence Force.  The Deputy asked about the funding available.  The envelope available to the Defence Forces for 2012 was reported in last week&rsquo;s budget.  There will be changes; I am not able to say what they will be, but they will involve consultation with the Reserve Defence Force.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad there will be consultation with the Reserve Defence Force.  Can the Minister of State assure the House that the future of the Reserve Defence Force will <Col N="470"/>be guaranteed in some form?  There were reports that it might be abolished or done away with completely.  Can he assure the House this is not the case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the Deputy there are no plans to abolish the Reserve Defence Force.  The proposals regarding the future development of the Reserve Defence Force arising from the value for money review and the wider reorganisation proposals for the Defence Forces as a whole will be introduced in due course.  I assure the Deputy there will be consultation with everybody involved, but there are no plans to abolish the Reserve Defence Force.  As the Deputy knows, the Reserve plays an important role within our community and within the Defence Forces, as many of the new recruits go on to be full-time Defence Forces personnel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the value for money review, we must consider the whole portfolio of buildings, including the barracks that have been closed, and their value to communities, especially when they are in prime locations in the middle of towns.  I see them as having a multi-functional purpose for the benefit of communities.  When Longford barracks closed back in 2008, I made a commitment to the people of Longford that I would do everything in my power to ensure that an alternative use was found for the building.  The town council and the county council asked the Midland Regional Authority to prepare a comprehensive feasibility study and an action group was set up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should table a separate question on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We came up with a multi-functional purpose for the building.  I am glad the Minister has agreed to sell it to both local authorities.  We cannot lose sight of the value of these structures to the community.  They are mainly located in the centre of towns.  I am anxious to ensure that any of the barracks that have been closed will not be sold to a developer who will sit on it for 20 years and allow the site in the centre of the town to become derelict.  There should be time constraints for the development of sites.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a separate issue and the Deputy should put down a separate question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Reserve Defence Forces, will the proposed reorganisation of the Defence Forces from three to two brigades include recommendations relating to a similar reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Forces?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>To reply to Deputy O&rsquo;Brien first, when there are changes in the Permanent Defence Force, there are generally changes within the Reserve Defence Force.  No proposals have been brought forward and the Minister has not made a formal proposal on that.  Realistically, however, if there are changes to the Permanent Defence Force, there will be other changes.  I am not saying what the changes will be and I hope the Deputy will not say outside the Chamber that the Minister said X, Y and Z, but one must mirror the changes.  I am not aware of what the changes will be but perhaps the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it form part of the Chief of Staff&rsquo;s report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Minister will take that into consideration when he is making a decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On Deputy Bannon&rsquo;s point about the value for money review, I can assure him that the Minister is very aware of the important role the buildings and structures play in the community. <Col N="471"/> Every alternative use will be examined and the Minister will take account of any proposal when considering the future of the closed barracks.  Deputy Bannon was affected by the barracks closure in Mullingar.  If there are any proposals for the Longford barracks which the Deputy might wish to bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention, I am sure he will be open to considering them.  All security arrangements will be fulfilled, and the barracks in Cavan, Mullingar and Clonmel will be secured by the Department and the Defence Forces in a very professional way.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest>  his views regarding the threat that the Defence Forces would be used to carry out the work of firefighters in County Roscommon who are in dispute with management regarding changes to their working conditions; and if he will ensure that the army is not used in any industrial dispute.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[38610/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Last month, in the context of an ongoing dispute between the local authority fire service and a number of its retained fire fighters, a request was received by my Department, in accordance with procedures in place, from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for the Defence Forces to provide assistance to Roscommon County Council in the maintenance of essential fire services.  While Defence Forces personnel were made available for deployment, they were not called upon as the Roscommon County Council fire service was able to deal with all call-outs from within its own available resources.  The Defence Forces operation was stood down following settlement of the dispute on 2 December last.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Defence provides for a role for the Defence Forces in assisting the civil authorities in the maintenance of essential services.  As the local authority concerned was in dispute with personnel who provide what is clearly an essential service, I can confirm absolutely that the Defence Forces, if called upon, would have responded to all requests for assistance from the local authority fire service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>This question should have arisen last week; the dispute has been resolved since then.  There is no doubt that the Defence Forces were used, actively and consciously, in an effort to undermine the fire fighters in the course of their legitimate dispute with the local authority.  Does the Minister think it appropriate that the Defence Forces should be used in this manner?  What are the criteria for such intervention and in what other circumstances have they been called on to intervene in this way?  The issue centred on retraining and the staff involved are very professional.  They had an arrangement with their employer and they were engaged in a legitimate dispute.  Undoubtedly, using the State forces gave the local authority an advantage.  It is akin to bully boy tactics and I am not happy that my tax revenue is being used to undermine a group of workers. </P>
        <P>I would imagine that Defence Forces staff have also been at the receiving end of a lot of bad Government decisions and would not like to be used in that way against other workers.  I ask the Minister of State to address whether he thinks it is appropriate and what specific criteria are involved when the Defence Forces are called in to act in that regard.  In how many other similar instances have they been called upon?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the Deputy that the Defence Forces undermined nobody&rsquo;s authority.  They were called upon on an emergency basis, which I very much welcome.  That is their role.  I have no doubt that if firefighters in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency were on strike and her house went on fire she would very much welcome, in the event of the county council not being available to put out the fire, the Defence Forces being able to do so. </P><Col N="472"/>
        <P>The Defence Forces are there to be called upon in such circumstances.  It has happened on other occasions.  The most recent instances in which they have provided assistance or have been on standby to assist in maintaining essential services during industrial disputes was in 2002 when assistance was provided to Dublin City Council during the Ballymun lifts dispute.  In 2003 assistance was provided to Donegal County Council during threatened industrial action by the Northern Ireland fire services.  In 2002 they were on standby for a threatened national strike involving retained firefighters.  In 2002 and 2003 assistance was provided to the midlands and south-eastern health boards during ambulance disputes.  In 2004 defence forces medical doctors provided assistance to the Irish Prison Service during a medical doctors strike.  In 2005 it was on standby to provide assistance to the Irish Prison Service in the event of a strike by prison officers.  In 2007 it was on standby for a threatened strike by retained firefighters in Ennis, County Clare.  In 2010 assistance was provided to Dublin City Council during the Ballymun lift dispute.</P>
        <P>It is a civic duty of the Defence Forces that if such disputes arise they come into play.  They will respond to all requests for assistance from any local authority, fire service or health service.  They carry out their training in a very professional manner to be ready and able to assist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all aware of how capable the Defence Forces are, but so is the fire service.  The fact that the Minister of State could recount seven incidents in the course of almost ten years demonstrates that this is an unusual situation.  Firefighters were in dispute in my constituency last year, and I would support them as I do the people in Roscommon.  The workers made arrangements. </P>
        <P>The fact that the armed forces were not called upon to intervene in the dispute is confirmation of the fact that workers had sorted out the situation.  They were being treated unfairly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other groups of workers by the State being actively used in order to undermine their legitimate dispute.  I take it, based on the comments of the Minister of State, that he intends to carry on in that regard.  Can any other agencies, apart from local authorities, invoke this procedure or is it only at their behest?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Deputy&rsquo;s stance on the issue.  It is about saving lives if they are requested to do so, as well as safety and emergencies.  The Deputy is entitled to her opinion but it would not be the opinion of many outside the House.  They want emergency services available to them, whether it is the Defence Forces or others. </P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that nobody&rsquo;s authority was undermined.  The Defence Forces were asked to provide cover for firefighters in Roscommon.  They do not get involved in the technical end of any dispute.  They simply carry out duties.  I mentioned a number of areas where the Defences Forces were used since 2002.  I can assure the Deputy that they will continue to be available if the circumstances arise.</P>

	<P>The contract price for the provision of two new offshore patrol vessels for the Naval Service is &euro;99 million, exclusive of VAT, and subject to contract terms and final <Col N="473"/>agreed costs.  In addition, the cost of providing a weapons system for the ships, similar to the systems on <i>LE Roisin</i> and <i>LE Niamh</i>, will be &euro;7.8 million, exclusive of VAT.  The contract for the two ships was placed with Babcock Marine UK in October 2010.  Payments on the contract are scheduled over a period of eight years, 2010-17, and are being funded from within the annual defence budget.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;38.7 million has been paid over to date on the contract, including VAT payments to the Revenue Commissioners.  The next stage payment of &euro;12 million is scheduled before the end of March 2012 with an accompanying VAT liability of &euro;2.7 million falling payable.</P>
        <P>Preparations for the construction of the ships have commenced in Appledore, UK, and the first cutting of steel took place in November.  The first ship is scheduled for delivery in early 2014.  The second ship will follow one year later.  I am advised that the production schedule is on time and in accordance with the contract and that to date there are no difficulties foreseen.</P>
        <P>The acquisition of these modern new vessels is a priority for the Defence Forces.  The Deputy should note that Naval Service vessels are replaced when they have come to the end of their useful life, which is normally around 30 years.  These acquisitions, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair, will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level in the coming years.</P>

	<P>The two new ships are set to replace the <i>LE Roisin</i> and the <i>LE Niamh</i>.  The first one is due in early 2014.  Are there any other outstanding requests from the navy for equipment which we are unable to meet because of the new economic situation in which we find ourselves?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of any outstanding equipment for which the Naval Service is waiting.  I am not sure if the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has been made aware of any such request.  I can assure the Deputy that the two new ships will be put to very good use.  They are needed within the Naval Service.  We are all aware of the excellent work it carries out on a daily basis in very difficult and dangerous circumstances, for which it has to be commended.  The first ship is scheduled for delivery in early 2014 and the second will follow in early 2015.  I can assure the Deputy that any moneys spent have been spent very wisely by the Naval Service.</P>

	<P>The <i>LE Eithne</i> and <i>LE Deirdre</i> are being replaced, not the <i>LE Roisin</i> and <i>LE Niamh</i>.  They are the new ships.  Conditions in the Atlantic have become harsher and more difficult over the past number of years.  The Naval Service provides a very important function in terms of fishery protection, drug detection, rescue and combatting human trafficking, among other functions.  Its work often takes place over the horizon and is not seen.</P>
        <P>Its work is essential and must be supported 100%.  Will the Minister of State indicate when the next two ships are planned to be replaced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not certain when the next two ships are planned for replacement.  However, as a person from a coastal county myself, I assure the Deputy that I am mindful of the very important job carried out by the Naval Service.  The Taoiseach recently travelled on one of the naval vessels and was greatly impressed by the extensive work carried out and the important nature of that work, whether in fisheries, drug interceptions or otherwise.  The <Col N="474"/>general public is probably not aware of the extent of the work carried out by the Naval Service.  On a recent visit to Haulbowline, at which Deputy Stanton was in attendance, I was very impressed by the duty and dedication to their work of the staff, who conduct themselves in a very professional manner in sometimes difficult and dangerous circumstances at sea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse everything the Minister of State and Deputy Stanton said in regard to the Naval Service.  I commend Commander Mark Mellet and everybody involved.  Given the role the Naval Service plays in fisheries protection and in drug seizures on an EU basis, is any contribution being made from the EU to the cost of these ships?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>A sum of &euro;900,000 was recently approved for that purpose and paid by the Commission.  It is unlikely that further funding will be available from the EU, but this will not deter the Department or the Naval Service from seeking further moneys.  I assure the Deputy that we will seek to maximise any funding possibilities that arise.  When buying ships or other equipment, we will always investigate any financial assistance that might be available.  I join Deputy Calleary in commending his fellow countyman, Commander Mellet, on his work at Haulbowline.</P>

	<P>The gross capital provision for my Department and the Defence Forces for the coming year, as set out in the recently published Estimates for Public Services 2012, is &euro;9 million.  The Estimates also provide for a carryover from 2011 of &euro;500,000.  Some &euro;2.8 million of the capital budget has been allocated to provide for the upgrade and replacement of existing information technology hardware and associated licensing support costs.  The balance of the provision, amounting to some &euro;6.7 million, has been allocated to the building programme for the Defence Forces.  One of the key objectives of the building programme is the modernisation and enhancement of the training, operational and accommodation facilities available to members of the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Approximately &euro;2.1 million of the allocation for 2012 will be expended on building projects already under way, with the balance available for new building projects in 2012, including any works that may be necessary arising from the recent decision to close a number of barracks.  Projects already under way include the provision of an automated firing range at Kilworth Camp, County Cork, and of additional facilities for Defence Forces personnel at Aiken Barracks, Dundalk.</P>
        <P>Proposed construction projects under the building programme for 2012 are currently being assessed.  My Department maintains a master list of projects for development.  This is reviewed periodically based on current needs and priority projects are identified.  Projects to be undertaken are approved based on the outcome of a capital appraisal exercise in each case.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that in 2012 new-start construction projects will include a new aircraft hangar in Casement Aerodrome, phase one of the replacement of buildings at the ammunition depot in the Defence Forces training centre and the provision of a further automated firing range.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 345 together.</P>
        <P>During each EU Presidency both formal and informal meetings of Defence Ministers are held.  Last month the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, attended the formal Defence Ministers&rsquo; meeting under the auspices of the Foreign Affairs Council.  The operation commanders from the current EU-led missions were also in attendance.  Discussions were focused on these current operations and future proposed developments.  Ministers also received an update on ongoing work regarding the EU&rsquo;s relationship with other organisations, including the United Nations and NATO.  Regarding the relationship with the UN, Ministers discussed how to enhance EU support to UN peacekeeping operations.</P>
        <P>In this regard, Ireland last year produced a food for thought paper on enhancing EU-UN co-operation in crisis management, which was circulated to EU member states and discussed in various fora.  The paper highlights several options as to how the EU, as part of its ongoing Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, capability development process, might identify niche or modular capabilities developed for CSDP crisis management operations, which could be made available and fully integrated into UN-led &ldquo;blue hat&rdquo; crisis management operations.  The EU&rsquo;s Crisis Management and Planning Directorate, CMPD, has further elaborated on Ireland&rsquo;s initiative.  Consultations have been ongoing between the EU and the UN regarding possibilities for enhancing EU CSDP support to UN peacekeeping.</P>
        <P>Following on from this consultation process, the EU has set out in a paper several possible actions which could enhance EU-UN cooperation.  These include the EU facilitating co-ordinated member state contributions to the UN; the EU providing a component to a UN <Col N="476"/>operation, civilian or military; an EU autonomous civilian deployment in support of UN operations; and an EU autonomous military deployment in support of UN operations.  Further analysis of these concepts will be undertaken by the various committees in the EU early next year.</P>
        <P>In regard to rapid response, the EU has the capability to deploy forces at high readiness, broadly based on the battle groups concept.  The purpose of these battle groups is to provide a rapid level of response to developing international crises, allowing the EU to intervene during the critical early stages.  To date, no particular location has been identified as suitable for the deployment of a battle group.</P>
        <P>Participation in battle groups is just one of a number of ways in which Ireland contributes to the EU&rsquo;s CSDP.  We have participated in the Nordic battle group, which was on standby until 30 June 2011.  In 2010 the Government approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Austro-German battle group, which will be on standby for the second six months of 2012.  The other members of the Austro-German battle group are Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  Within the EU itself, several committees, including the Political and Security Committee and the EU Military Committee, keep the issue of troop deployments, including rapid response, under constant review, in consultation with all member states.</P>

	<P>PA Consultants recommended a programme of major change in relation to Defence Forces medical services.  As recommended by the consultants, a number of working groups were set up to progress the various change projects identified.  The working groups were tasked with identifying the practical steps which needed to be taken to achieve implementation of the PA vision for the future medical service.  The work of these working groups has been completed and a time-bound implementation plan has been drawn up by the officer commanding the new central medical unit to implement the recommendations of the working groups.</P>
        <P>A number of the recommendations of the working groups which the plan will implement include a training and development programme for medical personnel, information technology developments, clinical care developments and financial re-organisation.</P>
        <P>The central medical unit will be formally established in early 2012.  Its establishment will enable the detailed structures, processes and personnel to be put in place within the central medical unit to provide for the support, management and delivery of modern medical services.  This new central medical unit will bring all medical personnel under one central command.  It will have responsibility for the management and delivery of medical services, including the <Col N="477"/>allocation of medical resources across the system based on operational requirements and demands.</P>
        <P>The central medical unit implementation plan has four high level goals.  These are to maximise the medical readiness, health and fitness of Defence Forces personnel; to manage and deliver high quality, efficient, effective health care; to maintain a medical capability that can be deployed with flexibility and inter-operability; and to provide expert advice on the provision of medical care and support in a military setting to the general staff.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P>While it is at the very early stages of implementation, progress has been made on a number of recommendations, such as the provision of a single annual medical to cover all home and overseas requirements, a recruitment campaign for the appointment of medical doctors to deliver the recommended doctor centred medical service, scoping in relation to the development of the patient medical information system, the appointment of the officer commanding the central medical unit, a study into the potential for external medical services provision, the review of conventional military medical requirement, the establishment of a high level implementation group and the preparation of an implementation plan.</P>
        <P>While I have already stated implementation is at an early stage, the detailed implementation plan provides a road map for further progress to be made with many of the other recommendations, such as those relating to the delivery of clinical services, the organisation and establishment of the future medical service, the separation of administration and clinical functions, financial and outsourcing arrangements and training and development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy with that answer.  We were waiting for one working group to complete its recommendations and now that this is completed I welcome the establishment of the central medical unit in early 2012.  It will be of great benefit to the Defence Forces.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The devil was truly in the detail of the budget last week.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, boasted that there would be no cuts to primary <Col N="478"/>weekly social welfare payments.  However, the deeper one examines this budget, the more devastating and sinister the cuts become.  Despite stating that payments to families at risk of poverty will remain unchanged, it is clear that as a result of changes to the main means testing arrangements, families in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance now find that their family income supplement will be cut savagely.  Before this callous budget, vulnerable citizens never regarded the carer&rsquo;s allowance as income when applying for family income supplement.  Like many Members, I have been contacted by many low-income families who find themselves far worse-off now than before the budget.  One woman has four children all under the age of eleven.  One of her children has autism and another is being assessed for autism.  Her husband is the sole income earner in the family.  They depended on family income supplement but as a result of this budget their income will be cut by an incredible &euro;139.  This represents a savage cut for a family of six on one income.  We have received other similar e-mails.  A gentleman with three children aged three, seven and a ten week old baby contacted me.  One of the children has Down&rsquo;s syndrome and is cared for at home by his mother while the father holds down a low-income job.  This family is facing a cut of &euro;140 to their income.  This money is not spent on luxuries but rather on the bare necessities of life.  There were no headlines on budget day about these cuts or the impact of these cuts but instead they were sneaked in with the approach of wait and see.  Changing eligibility criteria like this is having a devastating impact on low-income families.  Despite what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, said when he described the cuts to social welfare as unpalatable but necessary, there can be no justification for cuts of this scale.  Will the Taoiseach agree to reverse these savagely unfair cuts to the income of people on family income supplement who care for loved ones with special needs within the family?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The decisions taken by Government in drafting the budget are all unpalatable.  As Deputy Martin is well aware, there were adjustments of &euro;3.8 billion in the budget for 2012, comprising of &euro;2.2 billion current spending and &euro;1.6 billion in taxation.  No matter what way one looks at it, in order to comply with conditions this country has signed up to, it is never an easy choice to decide what is in the best interests of everybody.  I made it perfectly clear in speaking before the budget that no single citizen would be left untouched by this.</P>

	<P>The Fine Gael supporters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>However, we reversed the situation concerning the minimum wage by changing the universal social charge threshold from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036.  This brought 330,000 people out of the universal social charge.  In the case of carers and others who are vulnerable, individual circumstances vary from family to family.  I come across many individual and personal cases.</P>
        <P>The fact of the matter is that we must deal with this issue ourselves because nobody will deal with it for us.  From that perspective, starting at the top, the situation was changed in respect of residency and citizenship for those who are exceptionally wealthy, with increased charges and payments to be made through capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, DIRT and so on.  All of these things, right down the line, impact in one way or another on everybody.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the choices are never easy and all of them are unpalatable.  We warned about this and in so far as the protection of the vulnerable and those who are under pressure is concerned, be it from mortgage distress or the ravages of unemployment, one tries to balance it out in as fair a way as possible.  Any individual circumstance, such as the one the Deputy raised in respect of a family of four, needs to be looked at from an individual perspective and what can be done to help this family in their difficulty.  Obviously, until we get to a point where <Col N="479"/>our finances are under control and we can focus on jobs, growth and getting people off the live register and back into the world of work, people will never be fully satisfied.  They cannot be fully satisfied in circumstances in which one has to make changes that impact on people&rsquo;s lives in this way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to maintain the anonymity of the people who wrote to us.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer does not give any sense of understanding the enormity of the impact of this premeditated budgetary change to means test those on family income supplement who are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  People are saying they know we have a great deal on our plates but please stand up for them and their families.  The writer of the e-mail states the family currently receives &euro;190 in family income supplement &mdash; I am skipping paragraphs &mdash; but if the carer&rsquo;s allowance is included as income and means tested, this figure will be reduced to only &euro;50 per week.  This is not a misprint.  The decline in income, from &euro;190 to &euro;50 per week, is unacceptable and cannot be justified.</P>
        <P>I received a telephone call from a constituent who indicated that staff in the same company who are earning &euro;90,000 &mdash; this did not include the caller &mdash; had said the budget is all right because it does not affect them.  How in the name of God can anyone in this House claim that this is a fair budget if those who, by definition, are on the lowest tier of the income ladder given that they receive family income supplement are hit to the tune of &euro;140, &euro;100 or &euro;50 per week?  While the amounts vary, these are not isolated cases.  The common denominator is that people on family income supplement are caring for somebody who needs care.  They would not receive the carer&rsquo;s allowance otherwise.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has expired.  He should ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has been aware of this since September yet it took a decision which is having an enormous, devastating and incredibly damaging impact.  The e-mails we are receiving on the budget describe it in language such as being &ldquo;driven to despair&rdquo; and &ldquo;over the brink&rdquo; or being &ldquo;unable to deal with it&rdquo;.  Some of those affected have mortgages while others do not.  I cannot get over that any budget would impose income reductions of this size on families on very low incomes.  I highlight this cut because it demonstrates the fundamental dishonesty and unfairness of the budget.  The decisions and choices the Government made were wrong and it pursued the wrong strategy to fulfil certain election commitments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

This new effort to regain our sovereignty contains a clear commitment, in clause 4, to introduce what is referred to as a &ldquo;golden rule&rdquo; on austerity at constitutional or equivalent level in the Irish legal system.  Does the Government intend to place the proposed 0.5% deficit ceiling into the Constitution as required by the agreement?  Will the Taoiseach state clearly that such a move will require a referendum?  Does he accept that adopting such a policy will have a devastating effect on an already distressed economy?  The Government has given a commitment to introduce austerity budgets until 2015.  The new proposal would result in austerity budgets in perpetuity.  How many more years of austerity will be required after 2015 to bring the deficit to 0.5% of GDP?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Adams is aware that the country&rsquo;s participation in a programme supersedes the figures mentioned in the political agreement reached in the early hours of last Saturday morning.  As he is aware, this political agreement does not yet have legal standing.  A great deal of technical work must be done before a text can be presented which will be ratified in various ways by individual countries.  The fact that Ireland is in a programme supersedes all of this.</P>
        <P>Deputy Adams&rsquo;s statement that I want to be the Taoiseach to retrieve Ireland&rsquo;s sovereignty is true.  We do not have our economic sovereignty in the way the Deputy and I would wish because we cannot propose programmes at Government level without securing approval from the paymaster general, if one likes, the troika.  From that point of view, I have announced that the Government will introduce a fiscal Bill next spring in respect of most of what is contained in the agreement and the ongoing work in the country.</P>
        <P>There is nothing new here.  It is in everybody&rsquo;s interests that fiscal discipline and control are exercised by countries in drafting their budgets.  Deputy Adams should not have the impression that our philosophy is that a generation of austerity is before us.  If we do not fix the engine of our economy, we will not have a country.  The fact of the matter is that the rate of borrowing on a daily basis needs to change and it will change.  When we make the changes that are needed, they will have an impact on growth, development, investment in jobs and job creation.  Until that happens, we will not have the kind of country where we can stand with our own sovereignty, which is what I and &mdash; I assume &mdash; the Deputy would like.  The political agreement that was reached last Friday will be the subject of detailed analysis and consideration by officials in all the countries before a text is presented.  That text will have to be assessed to ascertain whether it conforms with the Constitution.  If it conforms with the Constitution, the advice of the Attorney General obviously will be clear.  If it does not and a referendum must be held, then a referendum will be held.  Let us be quite clear on that.  I want the Deputy to understand that we cannot have the necessary growth, development, job creation and career opportunities for the young people in the Gallery, and their peers around Ireland, until the engine of our economy is fixed.  Our economy is in a poor state at the moment because of the state of our public finances.  In such circumstances, we have to move forward and rectify these problems.</P>

	<P>I do not believe the Taoiseach does not see the huge contradiction between his assertion about restoring our economic sovereignty and his decision to sign up to giving away even more of our economic sovereignty as part of the fiscal compact.  This morning, he shared with us a fine letter he wrote to President van Rompuy.  The letter states, among other things, that the Taoiseach intended to raise the question of reducing Ireland&rsquo;s debt during the European Council meeting.  It is set out in some detail in the letter.  The Taoiseach planned to raise the matter and to explain to his colleagues the cost to Ireland of capitalising the banks in a manner that protected European and Irish citizens.  The Taoiseach told us at this morning&rsquo;s briefing that he did not raise the matter.  I wonder if he forgot to do so.  Did he leave the letter behind?  Was he tired?  Why did he not raise the matter?  He has failed to put it on the agenda <Col N="482"/>at any of the umpteen summits that have taken place since he took office.  Can he explain to the D&aacute;il the rationale for not raising the most pressing issue that faces the people?  It seems we will keep paying huge amounts of money to Anglo Irish Bank and other criminal banks.  The Taoiseach did not raise that at the weekend, which is bad enough, even though he had written to them to tell them he would raise it.</P>

	<P>This morning, Deputy Adams attended a private briefing for the leaders of Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Technical Group.  What he is now saying is not what he was told.  It is not a case of me forgetting, or a case of me not wanting to say something.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say the Taoiseach forgot.  I asked what happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a case of Deputy Adams deliberately misinterpreting what I said this morning.  I said I raised it at the Council meeting.  I presented our case on the basis of the challenge that now faces the Irish people.  Before the bailout, this country borrowed &euro;63 billion at excessive interest rates in order to recapitalise the banks.  It was the equivalent of 50% of our GDP.  I made the point, as an example to other countries of what we face here, that we should be able to use the current facilities that are available under the EFSF and will be available under the ESM to get into a position where we can pay that off at lower interest rates over a longer period, with a very substantial saving for the Irish taxpayer.</P>

	<P>It is amazing that Deputy Adams has shown the audacity to come in here and say what he has said.  As one of his peers in Northern Ireland from a different party used to say, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t put words in my mouth&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of cuts in disability and mental health services were outlined during the speeches in the D&aacute;il on last week&rsquo;s budget.  There was a lot of talk about protecting the vulnerable.  A figure of 2% was mentioned on page 13 of the address that was made by the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  I was aware that the service providers were in the middle of talks at the time.  They said they were prepared to meet the Government half way by accepting a cut of 1.8% and making a small reduction in their services.  The Taoiseach can imagine my shock and horror yesterday when I was told the Government and the HSE are demanding cuts of between 5.5% and 7% in disability services.  Is the Taoiseach aware of this information?  Is it correct?  Can he use his authority to bring this to an end?  Is the Government demanding cuts of up to 7% in day care, respite and residential services?  Does it not know that disability services are already in crisis?  They are suffering enough without sticking the knife in further and cutting more.  Did the Taoiseach not learn from last week&rsquo;s row about the disability allowance that it is wrong to cut and damage our disability services?  Of course he will mention the economic crisis, but I remind him that a 1% wealth tax would raise more than &euro;800 million.  I ask the Taoiseach to end the cuts to disability services.  How does he justify taking 250 teachers from the most disadvantaged communities in the State and increasing class ratios from 15:1 to 22:1?  I ask the Taoiseach not to wreck our disability services, which are already in crisis and in need our support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has covered a range of subjects.  Money has been ring-fenced for the provision of mental health services.  The Government made it perfectly clear that rather than mental health services being sidelined as they were for years, they are being brought to the centre of the delivery of normal health services.  That is the way it should be and that is the way it will be.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is dealing with that area competently.  The disability allowance issue, which was dealt with last week, is under review by the chairperson of the advisory group on the integration of taxation and social welfare.  She will report to the Minister for Social Protection in due course.  The Deputy also asked about teachers in disadvantaged schools.  The DEIS schools have been protected.</P>

	<P>I remind Deputy Finian McGrath that the relevant Standing Order allows for a brief question on one topic.  I ask him to confine his supplementary questions to a single topic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to give the Taoiseach some facts on the disability issue.  Is he aware that St. Michael&rsquo;s House disability services have been told to accept a cut of 5.5%, increasing to 7%?  Services for the blind have been told to take a cut of 5.5%.  As a result, St. Joseph&rsquo;s Centre for the Visually Impaired on Grace Park Road on the north side of Dublin will lose &euro;350,000.  Jobs will be lost even though the staff of the centre took a voluntary 10% pay cut last year.  The Disability Federation of Ireland has been contacted by its members who have been told to take a cut of 4.7%.  This is the real front line world for the families of children and adults with disabilities.  I was told by people from one of the services yesterday that they had not seen the like of such cuts for more than 30 years.  They want to know what the hell is going on here.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach realise that if residential places and services for adults with intellectual disabilities are closed down, in cases where parents die or there is a family crisis, in addition to the consequent humiliation, sadness, grief and trauma involved, the service provider will be forced to outsource to a private service which will cost taxpayers more money?  From a humane perspective this is madness but even the economics are crazy.</P>
        <P>In regard to mental health, does the Taoiseach find it acceptable in this day and age that five mentally ill women should be locked up over Christmas in St. Brendan&rsquo;s centre in Grangegorman because of lack of funding?  I ask the Taoiseach to use the so-called &euro;35 million promised in the budget so that these women can be respected and there be a compatible solution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a subject matter for a Topical Issue debate, to be discussed later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the information Deputy McGrath has in regard to the person who spoke to him about a situation applying at Christmas.  That time has not yet arrived but if the Deputy wishes to supply details to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, I am sure she will be prepared to look at the situation.</P>
        <P>I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about having to revert to private services.  One of the great problems experienced by many families in both urban and rural Ireland is getting people to call to houses or to stay overnight to provide assistance and support where necessary.  As Deputy McGrath is aware, there is a whole range of such cases.  Yesterday I met a group from <Col N="485"/>Roscommon who provide a not-for-profit service which costs approximately &euro;15 per hour.  This complements the HSE home help service although most private agencies charge a minimum of &euro;20 per hour for similar services.  The group already has some 200 people involved who, in many cases, will stay overnight in a household where that is necessary and appropriate.  They are all vetted and their PRSI is paid.  The savings to the Department of Health would be considerable if that model were to be adopted on a much broader scale.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>They do not have an accident and emergency department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the dearer private services which the Deputy mentioned, I have only just been made aware of the capacity of this model to provide a first-class, additional or complementary service on a non-profit basis, at a big saving to the taxpayer.  I will bring this to the attention of the Minister of Health for his consideration.  If the model were to be applied and if it worked credibly and effectively in people&rsquo;s interest, it would be preferable to paying huge moneys to other organisation which charge far more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a considerable crisis over the Christmas period.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Government Economic Managment Council has been established with the status of a Cabinet committee.  It has four members: myself, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  A second Secretary General has been appointed in my Department whose responsibilites included managing support for the council and reporting to the T&aacute;naiste on matters relating to the council.  Additional support for the council is provided from within the existing resources of my Department, working in close conjunction with staff from the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Foreign Affairs and Trade.</P>
        <P>It is a Cabinet committee and therefore confidentiality of discussions at the Economic Management Council is protected by the Constitution.  In line with longstanding practice, it is not appropriate to answer questions about proceedings at the council and the agendas of future meetings.</P>
        <P>The council normally meets every week and has met 14 times since the summer recess.  In addition, on 9 November, the members of the council met with representatives of the three largest banks to discuss the issue of lending to small and medium enterprises.  We also took the opportunity to make the banks aware of the Government&rsquo;s view on the passing on of ECB interest rate reductions to their customers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled seven of the questions so perhaps I might be allowed some extra time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I refer to the cut in the ECB interest rates which last week showed a reduction of 0.25%.  The Bank of Ireland has passed on the cut only partially and Allied Irish Banks has refused to do so.  Although the Taoiseach called in the banks to meet with the economic management council they still continue to defy the Government.  Given they are supposed to be owned by the taxpayers and that billions of euro of the people&rsquo;s money has been ploughed into them, what will the Taoiseach do about this?  Will he act in the interests of the people and introduce legislation?</P>
        <P>I am particularly vexed by the public interest directors who are paid enormous salaries and are also paid &euro;3,000 for attending a meeting.  Has the Taoiseach confidence in them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We called in the banks and had a discussion with them about lending policy in general and whether AIB and Bank of Ireland would be in a position to meet the 2011 target of lending &euro;3 billion apiece, &euro;3.5 billion next year and &euro;4 billion in 2013.  We also called in Ulster Bank so there were three banks together at the end of that meeting for a discussion on the passing on of the interest rate reduction as confirmed by the ECB.  The ECB passed on reductions in interest rate to help people who are under pressure, to prevent banks making a profit on such cases and because it is in the interest of stimulating investment and growth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Allied Irish Banks passed on the interest rate reduction; the other two did not.  Since then there has been a further reduction.  The point made at the meeting was that the Government <Col N="487"/>was in full agreement with the regulator that we do not want to see unfair increases put upon mortgage holders who are under pressure.  Obviously, this is in everybody&rsquo;s interest.  One does not want a situation whereby mortgage holders are severely put upon by the very banks that made serious mistakes in the past.</P>
        <P>Following that meeting we contacted the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator to request their opinion on recent developments in regard to mortgage interest rates and the possible policy of the Central Bank in the matter.  The Financial Regulator responded to me and indicated it would step up an intensive engagement with the banks on the issue of setting variable interest rates disproportionate to the cost of their funds.  This is in addition to the Central Bank ensuring the banks treat their customers fairly.</P>
        <P>I also made it clear to the banks that we would call them back in January to discuss an agenda of items in regard to access to credit, lending policy and difficulties being experienced by a whole range of would-be borrowers in business and in SMEs throughout the country.  I had indicated that if the Financial Regulator sought change in his powers of authority the Government would respond to that.  The regulator replied by way of clarification, stating that the power to exercise close regulatory control over retail interests is not being sought by the Central Bank at this time.</P>
        <P>In regard to further ECB interest rate cuts announced on 8 December, the same applies.  I welcome the decision of EBS, Permanent TSB and the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation to pass on a further reduction to variable rate customers and would encourage the other banks to follow suit.  I reiterate, the reason the ECB announced interest rate reductions was to relieve pressure on hard-pressed mortgage payers, to stimulate growth and investment and that banks would not make a financial killing as a consequence of bad decisions they made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is all fair enough.  The Taoiseach is appealing to the banks&rsquo; better feelings.  However, that has not worked, certainly not with some of the banks in question.  Will he introduce legislation to ensure cuts in interest rates by the European Central Bank are passed on to customers in Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and so on?</P>
        <P>With the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s indulgence, I wish to raise another issue.  I have my notes from this morning&rsquo;s meeting with the Taoiseach.  He has accused me of misrepresenting what he said which I believe is a serious charge.  I did not misrepresent what the Taoiseach said.  I actually noted what he said.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is not making any statements here now.  He is out of order as we are on Question Time.  On any other issues, he can come to my office and we will see what arrangements can be made to correct records.

        <P>I will restate my questions.  Will the Taoiseach introduce legislation to ensure cuts in interest rates by the European Central Bank are passed on to customers here?  The banks, into which we have put billions of the people&rsquo;s money are under the taxpayers&rsquo; control.</P><Col N="488"/>
        <P>Those directors appointed to the banks to look after the public interest are paid enormous amounts of money for doing so.  They include former leaders of all the other political parties and are paid &euro;3,000 just to go to a meeting.  Does the Taoiseach still have confidence in them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Adams can check his notes again.  I am not responsible for what he writes down.  I am responsible for what I say.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to see what he wrote down.  The next time we have a private meeting, I will record it officially if he is going to broadcast it like this afterwards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, how is the Taoiseach allowed to respond to that matter when it was already ruled out of order?  Can there be a bit of consistency in the application of the rules?  It is an outrage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The passing on of the ECB interest rate reduction is a matter for the Financial Regulator.  I wrote to him on behalf of the Government stating if he required further assistance or a change in his regulatory powers, the Government would respond favourably to such a request.  I have already read out his reply in which he clarified that at this time he did not seek any change in his regulatory authority.  This is not just a case of the Government introducing legislation.  It is important it is regulated by the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>Deputy Adams will be aware that tracker mortgages receive the reduction automatically.  The Government introduced a 30% mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers who bought between 2004 and 2008, a commitment in the programme for Government.  The Minister for Finance will make further changes arising from the recommendations contained in the Keane report and other matters raised with the Department of Finance since then.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interest that, in so far as the Government can assist, the serious pressure some have with their mortgages is reduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>For the record, my notes from this morning&rsquo;s meeting say the Taoiseach said this is the wrong meeting to put the Irish case as the focus is on the euro.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are questions down about the European issue for later.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach said he would insist on the passing on of ECB interest rate reductions.  It was, in fact, the programme for Government that made that commitment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, we are on questions on the Economic Management Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, we have been on these questions for the past 15 minutes.  A recent ISME report on credit made it clear the banks are not doing their job in lending to business.  Regarding mortgage holders, it is high time the banks were told they have an obligation to the taxpayer, not just to their shareholders alone.  The Bank of Ireland stance is arrogant and thumbing its nose at the Government and the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>When the Economic Management Council was established, every journalist in town was told it would be a new and radical way of managing economic decision-making in Cabinet.  Last month, we were told it was the driving core of the budget process.  Given the number of meetings it has had and that it cleared the budget line by line, does the Taoiseach agree it has <Col N="489"/>failed its first major test?  It produced a budget in which all the tough cuts in tax, welfare, education and health were targeted to fall on the poorest sections of society.</P>
        <P>Departmental documents on the comprehensive spending review show the Taoiseach and other members of the council were aware of the details of cuts to disadvantaged schools, career guidance and language teaching from 9 September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we stick to Question Time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is extraordinary that in that time no member of the Economic Management Council shouted, &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin, this is Question Time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It suggests the workings of the Economic Management Council are seriously flawed if it allowed budget decisions through, one of which had to be immediately reversed because of its impact on people with disabilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
<TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We all agree ECB interest rate reductions should be passed on by the banks.  We made that crystal clear to the banks when they attended a meeting in November on this issue.  It must be borne in mind the Government has just a 15% stake in Bank of Ireland.  Ulster Bank made its position clear in so far as the number of mortgages it has here are concerned.  Nonetheless, there was a full and a frank discussion about passing on the interest rate reduction.  I intend to call the banks back in again in mid-January.  This time there will be a specific list of agenda items to which they will respond in writing before the meeting to ensure a more comprehensive discussion later.</P>
        <P>The Economic Management Council is not the Cabinet and was never intended to be.  It is, however, a Cabinet sub-committee that is able to deal with a range of issues which can then be presented to the Cabinet for its perusal and decision, if required.  If one has to take &euro;3.8 billion out of the economy in 2012 &mdash; &euro;2.2 billion in current spending and &euro;1.6 billion in taxation measures &mdash; the larger Departments of Health and Social Protection will be the two front-runners in cuts. How many times has Deputy Martin been told of a scandalous waste of money in a section or scheme in a Department which should be abolished or made more effective?</P>
        <P>A revolution is happening in the social protection area.  For years immemorial, one was paid one&rsquo;s allowance and told to go away.  All social protection moneys come from the taxpayer or, as is the case now, borrowed to keep services running.  To ensure best value, people&rsquo;s work experience and competencies, along with the job they are seeking, are discussed with them.  Jobseekers are encouraged to state what job they want and what contribution they can make instead of simply being given their payment.</P>
        <P>Were we not able to deal with the major spending Departments, one would not be able to achieve the savings target I referred to earlier.  If one abolished all the smaller Departments, such as Defence, one would not even make up the &euro;3.8 billion required.  Savings of up to &euro;600 million in the Department of Social Protection, along with serious reductions in the expenditure by the Department of Health will bring about leaner, more efficient and effective Departments and benefit those availing of their services, be they health service users or jobseekers.</P>
        <P>The unemployment rate in this country is entirely unsatisfactory at 14.4% and that is the big challenge for Government in the time ahead.  That is where the focus of Government will be with labour activation measures and the Government jobs agenda being announced in January.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach would need to be careful with language and restrain himself.  There has been no revolution in social protection.</P>

	<P>Labour activation measures have been a feature of the social welfare system for the past two decades.  It has never been the case that people just sign on.  That has not been the case for many years.  What has happened in this budget highlights the flaw in the economic management council.  We were told it went through things line by line.

	<P>I have, and I have been extremely fair and reasonable in so doing.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the economic management council has undermined the ability of the Cabinet to work together on the budget?  The statements of the Ministers for Finance, Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources basically sent shots across the bow of other Cabinet colleagues.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport said Labour Party Ministers decided the welfare cuts.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that this is a direct breach of collective Cabinet responsibility?  What, if anything, will he do about that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that the decisions taken in the budget are the collective responsibility of the Cabinet.  The economic management council is not the Cabinet.  The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced a comprehensive expenditure review across all Departments very early on in the summer with Ministers to respond to him by the end of September.  The submissions were further analysed and dealt with.  The decisions taken are Cabinet decisions taken collectively and they affect every single Department right down the line.  No section of any Department, with very few exceptions, has been left untouched in respect of the expenditure review assessment.</P>
        <P>The economic management council is not the Cabinet.  It can deal with issues and bring them before Cabinet for it to decide to accept or whatever but the decisions taken are the collective responsibility of all the members around the table.  That has not changed and will not change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport&rsquo;s comments?</P>

	<P>But he said the Labour Party did the welfare cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the reductions in any individual Department are all collectively accepted by the Government and there is no Department that did not have reductions applied to them in some area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Could I ask the Taoiseach to be forthcoming on the real agenda and purpose of the economic management council?  The membership is the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, who are the leaders of the Fine Gael and Labour parties, respectively, the Minister for Finance from the Fine Gael Party and the alternate Minister for Finance from the Labour Party.  Is this not really a kind of Stalinist politburo inside the Cabinet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to dictate to the Cabinet the diktats from the IMF-EU, particularly in regard to austerity, to maintain the bondholders and bankers of Europe, which, in turn, are dictated to the hapless backbenchers of both parties?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>I am sorry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps this is an Irish version of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse doling out not so much war and pestilence, but savage austerity for our people.</P>
        <P>I refer to Cabinet confidentiality as it applies to the economic management council.  The original four horsemen of mythology came out of a book of scrolls sealed with seven seals, perhaps in anticipation of Cabinet confidentiality.  How can there be Cabinet confidentiality when the Taoiseach meets a group of bankers?  Does that not cease to be a Government meeting bound by confidentiality, especially when the Taoiseach is meeting agents of the organisations that were up to their necks in bringing about the collapse of this economy along with others?  Is it not, therefore, a nonsense to insist on Cabinet confidentiality to deny the D&aacute;il a full account of what happens at the economic management council in regard to strategy for the economy going into the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>The economic management council, as I said in reply to Deputy Martin, is not the Cabinet but it is entitled, as a committee, to meet the chief executive officers of the banks, either collectively or individually, because it is in the interest of the consumer that the council should make Government policy clearly and plainly known to people in those positions and it has done so.  For instance, the council might meet the Financial Regulator or the Governor of the Central Bank in regard to issues that are clearly of national importance.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
        <P>The functions relating to the Freedom of Information Act are carried out in my Department by statutorily designated officials, as envisaged in the Act.  These officials follow the guidelines set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s decision makers manual and there are no plans to change this process.  As I have stated previously in the House, the statutory framework relating to freedom of information is constructed in such a way as to keep the decision making process at arm&rsquo;s length from the political head of the Department.  Accordingly, I have no role in regard to the processing of freedom of information requests.</P>
        <P>My Department received a total of 19 freedom of information requests since the matter was last discussed in the D&aacute;il in September.  Twelve requests were granted or part-granted, in three cases the Department held no records and four requests are being processed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I asked this question is that the Taoiseach came to office promising a more open freedom of information system but, from my experience, he has done the opposite.  Last March the Taoiseach said after a meeting in Brussels that he had fought hard to counter a proposal to destroy our corporation tax and he talked about how tough he <Col N="495"/>had been defending the nation.  At the time, we asked to see the proposal he was speaking of and he refused to publish it.  He may recall that President Van Rompuy produced a compromise.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach admitted in the House that there was documentation about this but he said his account of it was all we could get.  We then made the freedom of information request.  The Taoiseach invoked a series of extreme defences to withhold it, and he has done the same on appeal.  One of the major issues arising is the absurd situation that the Taoiseach has now claimed that European rules prevent him from releasing the documentation and that its release would damage the Government&rsquo;s international relations.  We checked this with the European Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and it said it was up to the national Government to release the document and that it would encourage the national Government to do so.</P>
        <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that this is a ridiculous situation.  His position seems to be that he describes the document as okay but that having people see it would destroy our relations with other states.  That is the response we got and it is why I tabled the question, &ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach if he has reviewed the policy implications of decisions by him on freedom of information requests since the matter was last discussed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.&rdquo;  It should be changed and I ask the Taoiseach whether he will change it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin submitted an FOI request relating to briefing material prepared in advance of the European Council meeting in March.  That request was part-granted, as I understand it, by the freedom of information officer.  On appeal by Deputy Martin, the request was considered by somebody of high rank in the Department, as provided for in the Freedom of Information Act.  I understand that two further documents were released, with minor redactions.  The Deputy has since appealed that request to the Information Commissioner, again as is provided for in the Freedom of Information Act, in respect of which I have no connection whatsoever.  That appeal is currently being processed by her.</P>
        <P>Two other requests were received from the Fianna F&aacute;il research office.  The first, some time ago, related to the pensions levy.  The second, in July, related to contacts with the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office regarding the disallowance or transfer of parliamentary questions.  Both were part-granted and were answered within the freedom of information timeframe, as set out.</P>
        <P>I am aware a number of Departments have released the replies to freedom of information requests on their websites, although it is also clear that most complaints in regard to freedom of information relate not to the process of obtaining information but to the restrictions which apply to the information that can be released.  This is why it is a commitment in the programme for Government to restore the Freedom of Information Acts to what they were prior to 2003 and to extend their remit to additional public bodies.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is working on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>On a supplementary question, this relates to the offer that President Van Rompuy made at that March meeting.  The situation is that the European Council has said it would encourage the Government, as a national Government, to release that document.  The Taoiseach has admitted the document is in existence yet he is refusing to release it.  Any claim to transform freedom of information and make it better lacks credibility if the Taoiseach is not prepared, nine months on, to release that document and give the truth of what happened.  All I am asking for is the document, the existence of which the Taoiseach has admitted.  We have <Col N="496"/>gone all over the houses to try to get a copy of it and many journalists have tried to get a copy of it.  The Taoiseach has been very reticent and has been, if one likes, protecting the document from publication.</P>
        <P>It is a ridiculous situation.  The Taoiseach has not answered the question I have tabled.  In the light of our experience, does the Taoiseach not agree that a document like that should be released to the public?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I said, Deputy Martin has appealed this to Information Commissioner and that office has completely independent authority in this regard.  I have no function at all in regard to interfering in any way with the Freedom of Information Acts, as they are set down.  There is a Government commitment to change the Act back to what it was prior to 2003, which would make it far more flexible and open, and also to extend its remit to other public bodies.  We will do that and the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, is working on it.  It is for the Information Commissioner to make her decision.  I have no hand, act or part in influencing that in any way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is committed, or at least it stated a commitment, to restore the Act to its status before 2003 and to extend its remit to other public bodies, and the Taoiseach has just repeated that commitment.  Will he update us on the progress that has been made thus far in introducing legislation to broaden the remit of the Act?  Will he tell us the bodies to which the remit of the Act will apply?  When does he expect legislation to come forward?  Is the progress of this legislation being delayed because of the relationship with the demands and requirements of the EU-IMF?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a commitment of Government to restore the Act to what it was prior to 2003 and to extend its remit further than it is at present.  I understand from the Minister, Deputy Howlin, that he would expect to be able to bring a legislative measure to the House in the new year.  Clearly, we have had discussions about the legislative programme from September until the end of this year, which was very packed because of the timeline requirements on a number of pieces of legislation, as demanded under the troika agreement.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government provides that the Government will legislate to restore the Act to what it was before 2003 and to extend its remit to other public bodies, including the administrative side of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, subject to security exceptions.  It also proposes to extend freedom of information and the Ombudsman Act to ensure that all statutory bodies, and all bodies significantly funded from the public purse, are covered.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has embarked on preparatory work to implement the commitments contained in the programme.  When this is completed, the Minister will bring his proposals before Government.  These proposals will include consideration of the position in regard to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority, NAMA and the NTMA.  There are no proposals at present to bring the nationalised or partly nationalised banking sector within the Freedom of Information Act.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, a new programme for Government office has been established in my Department.  Two whole-time staff have been assigned to the office from within existing Department resources.  This staff, comprising an assistant principal officer and a higher executive officer, has a total annual salary cost of &euro;144,266.27, including employers&rsquo; PRSI.  The office is currently in the process of developing structures which will allow it to monitor programme implementation and to report to me and to the Cabinet on progress across all Departments.</P>
        <P>As part of that structure, my Department will ensure that departmental strategy statements for the period 2011-14 fully reflect commitments in the programme for Government, together with the EU-IMF programme and the comprehensive expenditure review.  Departments will, as part of the strategy statement process, publish annual output statements, which will quantify and report on progress in implementing the programme and outline the commitments for the Department for the year ahead.  I also envisage that the Government&rsquo;s first annual progress report on the programme for Government will be made available on my Department&rsquo;s website in March of next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is saying that publication of the first report on the programme for Government that will be compiled by the staff will be in March next.  Given that there have been fairly substantial breaches of commitments made in the programme for Government, on disability, health, education, lone parents and schools with disadvantage, is it only fair and reasonable to have an earlier reiteration of the programme for Government and perhaps a report card before the close of this year?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated in an appearance earlier in the year on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; that there would be a report card for every Minister which he would publish.  He kind of resiled from that subsequently.  The Taoiseach is smiling now but I actually went back over it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say I would publish them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach did.  I went over the interview.  The Taoiseach was very serious in his interview on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  He stated there would be a report card on every Minister and given his commitment to transparency, that would seem to suggest that he would publish it.  Anything short of that would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe Deputy Martin could FOI it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;not in keeping with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment to transparency.</P>
        <P>In terms of the programme for Government, there have been many decisions taken in the budget and prior to the budget, both on economic issues and on education, welfare and health, where there have been clear breaches.  Of course, the most immediate one is that on upward-only rent reviews, which is a clear commitment in the programme for Government and which the Minister for Finance has buried in the budget and stated will not happen, much to the disgust and anger of many retailers across the country.  There is a need to review and update the programme for Government in the light of the commitments that cannot and will not be delivered.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="498"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have here a list of issues that have been dealt with under the programme for Government.  It is too long to read out to Deputy Martin.  I will send Deputy Martin a copy.</P>
        <P>There are 26 elements of the programme for Government covered under the most recent budget.  They range from the highest transparency in respect of NAMA with the Minister for Finance to establish the advisory group to advise him on NAMA strategy and his capacity to deliver on that strategy, to the commitment to allow a rebate in respect of farm diesel in regard to carbon tax, with a double income tax deduction for that.  There are 26 elements of the programme for Government dealt with in the most recent budget.</P>
        <P>It is not only about having a budget to implement issues in the programme for Government.  The programme for Government is something on which we will deliver to the maximum extent possible.</P>
        <P>I must state quite openly that we genuinely believed it would be possible to legislate in respect of upward-only rent reviews but the clear evidence in respect of this being constitutionally impossible was there from the legal advice of the former Attorney General and other senior counsel opinion besides, to the effect one would end up having to compensate landlords if one was to introduce such legislation.  Following discussions with the Minister for Finance, NAMA has responded by indicating it will deal with the properties in its portfolio in respect of upward-only rent reviews.</P>
        <P>This is an issue of considerable concern to retailers.  I spoke to somebody yesterday who is paying three times the rent of the next-door tenant &mdash; this is always difficult.  The <i>de facto</i> position on the ground in many cases is that rents have been reviewed downward by virtue of circumstance.  Clearly, with retailers under pressure from rates and a flat indigenous economy, the position has become very much more difficult.  From that point of view, quite a sizeable number of rents have been renegotiated downwards where the other situation applied.</P>
        <P>I say to Deputy Martin quite openly that it has been impossible to deliver on the commitment that we thought genuinely we could do by putting it into the programme for Government.  There is a constitutional barrier we could not cross but we are making other arrangements in respect of some retail outlets &mdash; those in NAMA &mdash; and the Minister is considering what else can be done.  However, there are 26 elements in the recent budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a clear commitment that the Taoiseach is now saying cannot be fulfilled because of the constitutional barrier.  He would have been told that in advance of the formation of the Government.  He was told there was a constitutional barrier.  Everybody in the House was told there was a constitutional barrier as per the legal advice of the former Attorney General, and yet the Taoiseach decided to go ahead and put it into the programme for Government and make all sorts of election commitments promising people this would happen.  There were Bills brought to the House etc.</P>
        <P>There is no excuse for putting something in when the Taoiseach knew full well what the answer would be ultimately.  He really raised the hopes of people and paralysed the situation for a good nine months, and then was forced in the budget to admit the position.</P>
        <P>What are the implications of that in terms of other commitments in the programme for Government?  That is what I am getting at.  We need an honest review of the programme for Government in terms of what is possible and when.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation is not exactly as Deputy Martin describes it.  Obviously, my party was not in government before the election and therefore did not have at its disposal the formal legal advice from the Attorney General.  Deputy Martin did though, if he requested it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We did.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="499"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, he could have said what was the legal advice available.</P>
        <P>March next will be an appropriate time to have an annual review of the performance of Government in so far as the commitments in the programme for Government being fulfilled are concerned.  It is quite sizeable, more sizeable than I had considered.</P>
        <P>As I stated, there are 26 clear commitments in the programme that are now delivered on in this budget.  This programme is for a full Government term.  Deputy Martin can take it from me that one of my clear priorities is that Ministers deliver in so far as politically and constitutionally possible on the commitments that are in the programme for Government.  I hope to drive Ministers on to that.  We have set the ceilings for Departments for the times ahead.  Clearly, there has been a great deal of work done in respect of MOUs and troika legislation for this session.  Next year we must focus, obviously, on the question of Europe, but also on the clear challenge to the country in the context of employment, job creation, labour activation measures, investment opportunities etc.  Those will be our clear priorities to provide work.</P>
        <P>All of these matters have a bearing on the commitments in the programme for Government.  I look forward to saying to Ministers that they have a big challenge between now and March, I want to see X, X and X delivered in their Departments and to get on with it, and if there is a reason they cannot deliver it, then to tell me why.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>On a number of occasions the Taoiseach has spoken about the need for open government.  Years before he became leader of his party, I remember him speaking and writing about the reform of this institution and I listened and read intently what he was saying.</P>
        <P>On this issue of the programme for Government, the two parties in government stood on separate manifestos which made clear commitments and they were elected on those very clear commitments.  They then put forward the programme for Government.  I think the Taoiseach should consider, well in advance of March, publishing how he sees the implementation of that programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our job is to scrutinise the Government.  I do not believe in opposition for the sake of opposition.  We should be constructive in how we go about it.  We are able to read the programme for Government and then to state the Government promised this but it did that, and it gets into that sort of ping-pong across this Chamber.</P>
        <P>Maybe there are reasons the Taoiseach did that.  Maybe there are reasons the Taoiseach could not do some of the things he committed to doing.  It would be useful and constructive if the Taoiseach said that.  On welfare, health and education, he did not do what he promised to do.  On his 100th day in government, he said the Government would not raise taxes or cut welfare, but it did so.  The political choices of the Government, as opposed to those that might not be possible, are what are marking it out.  The poorest, most vulnerable and disadvantaged are bearing the brunt of the austerity measures.</P>
        <P>I listened to what the Taoiseach said about bringing this measure forward in March.  I appeal to him to do so.  A good way to mark the new year may be to come forward with some sort of review of how the programme for Government has been implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No doubt the Deputy will keep me focused on this.  This morning I gave a briefing on the meeting at the weekend, yet the Deputy tells me I did not raise something I did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I reported to the D&aacute;il what the Taoiseach spoke about this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the third time the Taoiseach has raised this argument.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="500"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>He writes down his own notes, which he is perfectly entitled to do and for which I am not responsible.  I said to Deputy Martin that the budget dealt with 26 issues, ranging from NAMA to carbon taxation on diesel for the agricultural sector.  In the labour market policy in regard to access to higher education for the unemployed and the 30,000 additional training places across education and training systems, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has announced that, as a consequence of the budget, places, including in the education and training sector and especially for those on the live register for 12 months or more, will be prioritised in 2012.  He also announced an allocation of &euro;20 million for a new labour market activation fund, which we will deal with in January.</P>
        <P>In preparation for 2013, we said we would review progress on deficit reduction and draw up a plan that would achieve the objective of reaching the 3% of GDP target by 2015.  As part of its fiscal strategy, the Government will keep the corporate tax rate at 12.5%.  That has been set out clearly again in the budget.  We said we would maintain the rates of income tax, together with bands and credits.  That has been delivered on.  There is no increase in the standard rate of 10.75% in respect of employer&rsquo;s PRSI.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, made that perfectly clear in his speech.</P>
        <P>We said we would reduce, cap or abolish property tax reliefs and other tax shelters which benefit very high income earners.  Reliefs in section 23-type investments will not be terminated or otherwise restricted for investors with an annual gross income under &euro;100,000.  I refer to the teachers, garda&iacute; or public servants who invested in bits and pieces of property, collectively or individually.  They are at the greatest risk of insolvency.  We dealt with that.</P>
        <P>We said we would implement a minimum effective tax rate of 30% for very high earners.  The Minister for Finance dealt with that.  We said we would limit the top rate of VAT to 23%.  We said we would review the universal social charge, exempting 330,000 people, thereby assisting more people to move into the labour market.  We said we would ensure tax exiles would make a fair contribution to the Exchequer.  As Deputy Adams is aware, the Minister announced the abolition of the citizenship element of the condition for payment of the domicile levy to ensure tax exiles cannot avoid the levy by renouncing their citizenship.</P>
        <P>There was a range of other measures.  We announced that access to primary care without fees would be extended in the second year to claimants of free drugs under the high-tech drugs scheme, at a cost of &euro;15 million.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, announced that &euro;15 million will fund access to primary care without fees to claimants of free drugs under the long-term illness scheme.</P>
        <P>We ring-fenced &euro;35 million annually from the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services with a view to implementing A Vision for Change.  We also said we would increase mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers who bought between 2004 and 2008 to 30% from the current sliding scale of 20% to 25%.  The Minister for Finance announced that in the budget.</P>
        <P>These are commitments entered into in the programme for Government and reflected in Government decisions.  They are all in the interest of balance and fairness in protecting those who are vulnerable and making those on higher incomes pay more.  In all other areas, they are to improve the efficiency of governance so people can focus on job opportunities, careers and getting back to work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 41, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I attended the European Council in Brussels on 8 and 9 December.  As I will be making a statement to the House tomorrow, I will confine myself to some brief remarks about the meetings.</P>
        <P>Discussions at the Council were dominated by the overall economic circumstances in Europe with a particular view to overcoming the crisis currently facing the euro area, including President Van Rompuy&rsquo;s interim report on strengthened economic governance in the euro area, including the possibility of limited treaty change.  We made important progress, both on firewalls and budget discipline, two key elements of the package for Ireland that I had highlighted ahead of the meeting.  We agreed to bring forward the entry into force of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, to July 2012 and to reassess the overall ceiling of the EFSF and ESM of &euro;500 billion in March 2012.</P>
        <P>The Council agreed that the requirement for private sector involvement, PSI, be removed from the draft ESM treaty.  This was one of the specific issues I raised with President Van Rompuy and Chancellor Merkel in advance of last week&rsquo;s meeting, and I am pleased that it has now been agreed.  This is very good news for countries such as Ireland, which are trying to get back to the financial markets at as early a stage as possible.</P>
        <P>To further increase the economic firepower available, euro area member states are to consider, and confirm within ten days, that they will provide up to &euro;200 billion in bilateral loans to the IMF.  We are also looking forward to contributions from the international community.</P><Col N="503"/>
        <P>While the question of the ECB&rsquo;s mandate did not arise, I very much welcome its recent decision to make unlimited three-year loans to Europe&rsquo;s banks at low interest rates.  This should have a real impact in moving us beyond the current crisis phase.</P>
        <P>On economic governance, we reached a political agreement to strengthen our rules to ensure greater stability in the eurozone, building on the Stability and Growth Pact.  Euro area member states are now committed, as a rule, not to run structural deficits above 0.5% of GDP, and will write such a provision into their national laws.  A member state in breach, in partnership with the Commission, will have to engage in a process to get back on track within a given timeframe.  The significant progress being made by Ireland through implementation of its programme was again recognised by partners.</P>
        <P>In my contribution, I set out for colleagues the uniquely onerous burden the Irish people are carrying as a result of the steps we have taken to recapitalise our banks.  Specifically, I asked at the Council meeting that facilities that now exist &mdash; for example, through the EFSF &mdash; be made available to assist in making this burden more manageable.  Colleagues gave me a receptive hearing and, together with the Minister for Finance, I will be pursuing the issue in the period ahead.  I am confident we will be able to make positive progress in a way that makes a real difference for Ireland.</P>
        <P>What we achieved last week was a political agreement.  Work will now be taken forward on how to give it legal effect.  I am, of course, disappointed that it did not prove possible to reach agreement on a way forward for all 27 parties.  I regret that certain member states will be outside the new arrangements and that we must now proceed by way of an intergovernmental treaty outside the EU treaties.</P>
        <P>There is a great deal of complex legal and technical detail to be filled out by March, when we will return to the matter.  We will study the legal implications of what has been agreed very carefully, including whether a referendum will be necessary in Ireland.  For now, it is simply too soon to say.  However, the House can be assured we will do whatever is required to ensure that Ireland can ratify the new agreement.</P>
        <P>For the reassurance of the House, I can confirm that last week&rsquo;s political agreement does not include any provision on corporation tax.  The position in that regard and the Government&rsquo;s firm position remain unchanged.</P>
        <P>The European Council tracked progress under the Euro Plus Pact in which 23 member states, including Ireland, participate.  The meeting also followed-up on the issue of energy, last discussed by the European Council in February of this year.  In addition, enlargement issues featured, and the signature of the Croatian accession treaty took place in the margins of the meeting.  The European Council also agreed conclusions on Iran, Syria and Afghanistan.</P>
        <P>I have on several occasions outlined for the House how these meetings are prepared.  President Van Rompuy circulates the proposed agenda and draft conclusions are prepared.  These are generally discussed in several fora, both political and official, ahead of the meeting proper, and Ireland engages very actively as part of the process, sometimes orally at meetings and sometimes by way of written comments circulated to all member states.  Ireland is well represented at these preparatory meetings and our views are known and understood.</P>
        <P>In addition, ahead of last week&rsquo;s meeting I wrote to President Van Rompuy to outline a number of concerns for this country.  I developed those points during my interventions at the European Council meeting.  I also spoke to him and to the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, prior to leaving for Brussels.  As the House will be aware, I also met Chancellor Merkel on 16 November, ahead of last week&rsquo;s meeting.  I also ensured that the President of the Commission, Mr. Barroso, was fully briefed.</P><Col N="504"/>
        <P>With regard to my future travel plans, I will attend the European Council meetings in March, June, October and December of next year and any other meetings arranged in the interim.  Work is ongoing between my officials and those of French President Sarkozy to arrange a mutually convenient date on which to meet in the new year.</P>
        <P>I had an opportunity to meet the Prime Minister-elect of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, at the EPP meeting which took place last week in Marseilles ahead of the European Council.  I congratulated him on his election and indicated that I look forward to working with him in the future.  On the basis of substantive business interests, I will also evaluate carefully the need for any further travel plans as we begin our work in 2012.</P>
        <P>Finally, Iceland is not a member of the euro or the European Union and, therefore, its economic situation did not arise at the recent meeting.</P>

	<P>I ask the Taoiseach, in any upcoming meetings with the Spanish Prime Minister, to raise the issue of the fledgling peace process in the Basque country and request that he follow the example of dialogue set here in order to bring a resolution to the issues inherent in that conflict.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have some chance tomorrow.  I ask the Taoiseach to explain clearly to the House why he signed up for a deal, the full implications of which he had not studied.  Did he raise the issue of Irish bank debt?  I understand he sought a commitment from European Heads of State to the effect that there would be no private sector restructuring of sovereign debt but the proposal appears to involve all debt, including Irish bank debt.  The letter he sent to Mr. Van Rompuy asks that Irish debt be re-engineered, with the objective of reducing interest rates and lengthening the timeframe for repayment.  Has the Taoiseach given any consideration to having elements of that debt waived or put to one side given the extraordinary steps the ECB and EU institutions have asked Ireland to take to protect the eurozone in advance of the establishment of the European facilities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is sovereign debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did he agree to push ahead without the British Government on board?  Did he not see an opportunity to support the British in terms of not needing another treaty?  That was our position before the summit.  He stated in the D&aacute;il on numerous occasions that he did not think a new treaty was needed because we could do a lot within existing treaties. <Col N="506"/> The fiscal rules do not go to the core of solving the eurozone crisis.  Re-financing sovereign debt is the real question and the summit has failed to deal with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach rightly condemned Fianna F&aacute;il for crashing our economy and forcing us into the hands of the EU-IMF troika but does he not agree that the proposed deal will institutionalise what he rightly describes as the loss of our economic sovereignty?  We will lose democratic control over our economic affairs for perpetuity.  There will be centralised, Stalinist control by the European Commission and the ECB over national economies and ordinary people will be disenfranchised.</P>
        <P>Was there any discussion about the summit being the umpteenth attempt to come up with some sort of crisis resolution mechanism?  Days, if not hours, after the conclusion of every previous summit the solutions began to unravel because the beloved markets decided they would not work.  The bottom line problem underlying this pattern is that the austerity programme is crippling growth and even the markets realise a solution will not be found while the European economy is contracting.  This proposal will set in stone an economic austerity agenda which will have the same effect.</P>
        <P>Was any mention made of the contrasting fate of Iceland?  I do not suggest that Iceland is perfect but it took a different response to the crisis and even the IMF praised its decision to allow its banks to fail.  It did not reduce expenditure on the welfare state&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and it imposed capital controls to prevent money from fleeing the country.  As a result, its economy is now recovering.  It is on the path to recovery after doing the exact opposite of what Europe is demanding from Ireland.  Was there any discussion on the need to find a radically different way of dealing with this crisis?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the new Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, who is to take up office on 20 December.  As I do not speak Spanish and he does not speak English we did not get an opportunity to discuss the fledgling peace process in the Basque country but I will be happy to raise the issue with him.  When I next have an opportunity to meet him he will have been duly appointed as Spanish Prime Minister.</P>
        <P>In respect of PSI, the issue is to remove PSI from the draft ESM facility.  We take the view that such a provision would be counterproductive for a country such as Ireland, which will emerge from a programme, as it would display a lack of confidence by would-be investors in the country.  What I was talking about here was not a write-down of sovereign debt but a reconstruction of the bank situation with regard to the recapitalisation, which had taken place at very high interest rates, and an attempt to get that level of bank debt into the facilities that now exist with lower interest rates and longer repayment periods, which would be of great benefit to the Irish taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I did suggest at the meeting, if the truth be known, when Prime Minister Cameron made his comments about a specific protocol for the protection of financial services in London, that perhaps the politicians should pause and discuss whether a compromise could be reached in that political impasse.  Essentially, what the British Prime Minister seemed to be saying was that he would give consent to changes in the eurozone in exchange for a return to unanimity <Col N="507"/>in respect of certain matters to do with financial services in London.  Obviously, that was not achieved, and the 26 countries will move on.</P>
        <P>I am due to speak to the Prime Minister this evening.  As I said before, after and during the meeting, it is important from the point of view of this country that our nearest neighbour and largest trading partner, which came to our assistance with regard to bailout moneys&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>With regard to the question asked by Deputy Boyd Barrett, there was no discussion about Iceland, which is not in the European Union nor in the eurozone.</P>

	<P>Not according to Nicolas Sarkozy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There was no discussion about it.  It was not the treaty that caused the problem here.  It was caused by reckless government and reckless banks, and until we achieve a situation in which that can never happen again and order is restored to our public finances, we are not going to have the engine of growth and development that we all want, whereby jobs can be created.  It was a number of summits ago that decisions were taken, in respect of Greece in particular, about bailout funds and increased leveraging of the EFSF, which did not actually happen.  The Deputy is right in stating that markets have no confidence in that.  That is why, in this case, the focus was entirely on the crisis within the eurozone.  I am glad, at least, that the decisions taken by the heads of Government are reflected in the introduction of the ESM, minus the private sector involvement, the firewalls in respect of the ESF, the ESM and bilateral loans to the IMF, and the extra unlimited facilities available to banks from the ECB at a low interest rate.  When I rang the former president of the ECB, Mr. Trichet, about this in March or April, his view was that the ECB would not extend loans to banks or countries at low interest rates but that they would continue at an emergency level only.  That has now changed.  The signals from Mr. Draghi are that if the political process achieves clarity and decisiveness about what it wants to do about the eurozone and the euro, the ECB, in respect of its independence and its integrity, will consider that from the point of view of whatever decision it wants to make.</P>
        <P>Until we get to a point at which the engine of our own economy is revamped, we will not be able to provide the growth in our economy &mdash; and therefore the job opportunities &mdash; that we want to.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to see pension funds and others invest here.  We are told there are walls of money for investment, under proper conditions, in infrastructure and job opportunities in Ireland.  That is why we have renegotiated with the troika elements of what we can do for investment.  For example, in respect of the sale of State assets, the troika wanted all of that money to be used for debt reduction only, but they are now prepared to talk on a case-by-case basis about investment in jobs, growth and job opportunities in the event that the Government decides to sell a State asset or a portion of one, or takes equity in a State asset.  I am living in the land of reality and considering practical outcomes.  I am focusing on sorting <Col N="508"/>out our own problems, which will not go away and which will only get worse if we leave them alone.</P>

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 9 p.m. and shall adjourn not later than 10.30 p.m.; and that Private Members&rsquo; business, which shall be No. 43, motion re policies affecting rural areas, shall be taken at 8 p.m. and shall adjourn after 90 minutes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>One thing we all agreed this morning was that the Taoiseach would take questions after tomorrow&rsquo;s statements on the European Council.  I ask him to confirm to the House that he will take questions afterwards, because this is a momentous summit with far-reaching implications for the country and for Europe.  I take it that the format will be statements followed by questions to the Taoiseach from leaders.</P>
        <P>With regard to forthcoming legislation, in the context of the Education Act 1998 and circulars emanating from this Act, my question is about the decision to devastate the guidance counselling service by bringing it within quota in terms of the pupil-teacher ratio at second level.  Up to 800 posts will be suppressed in second-level schools as a result.  Even more worryingly, however, an entire edifice that provides counselling and career guidance to thousands and thousands of students across the country will be damaged.  Given the obligation in the Education Act that such a service must be provided, when will secondary legislation giving guidance to second-level principals be issued by the Department of Education and Skills to ensure this recent decision is implemented while maintaining the primary obligation in the Education Act?  New circulars will have to issue because of the budgetary decision about career guidance and counselling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I would be happy to answer questions after the debate tomorrow.  If the Deputy wants extra time to discuss that and have a longer debate, I am quite amenable to that.  This is a matter of consideration for every person in the country and I do not want to be constrained by a format that specifies four 15-minute speeches followed by 20 minutes of questions.  If the Opposition looks for extra time, we will change the rules.  We will come back here next week anyway, and we can have a longer period for discussion.  I would be happy to answer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s other question, the Minister for Education and Skills set out clearly in his response to the budget with regard to guidance counselling that what is involved is a transfer of responsibility to principals in secondary schools.

It is a matter for the principal of each school to decide whether to have a guidance counsellor who also teaches something else or one who is solely devoted to guidance counselling.

	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise a couple of matters under Riar na hOibre and a question under reachta&iacute;ocht at&aacute; geallta.  We wondered whether the Taoiseach would be available to take questions and I am pleased he has committed himself to doing that.  I will be even more pleased if he answers the questions.  Second, a total of 24 parliamentary questions were taken together by the Taoiseach; 13 of the questions were from me.  They were taken at the end of Question Time so we did not get time to deal with them.  Sometimes one cannot govern what happens but this issue arises all the time.  It is not within your authority, a Cheann Comhairle, but is a matter for the Taoiseach.  It is ridiculous.  We spend time putting down what we consider to be thoughtful questions in an effort to scrutinise, get information and have debate and discussion, but we are not given an opportunity to deal with them.</P>
        <P>Under promised legislation, when will the Government publish the fiscal responsibility Bill?  Is it intended to include in the Bill elements of the agreement reached at the EU summit last week and when will it be debated in the D&aacute;il?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The time in which we answer questions runs out; I used to encounter this problem too.  Two minutes are left and there is a series of questions to be answered so what does one do?</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Talk down the clock.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am prepared to give the House extra time tomorrow because these questions were not dealt with today as we did not have time.  I accept that.  It is not the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s fault as the Standing Order sets down the time.  There will be a longer period for discussion tomorrow and there will be questions and answers, when the Deputy can deal with his questions.</P>
        <P>The questions that were put down are all linked.  Deputy Adams had one about the Basque peace process.  That is an issue of European importance but most of the questions are about the EU summit and its implications.  The Deputy also asked if I met the incoming Prime Minister of Spain.  I did, and if one talks to him, through an interpreter, about how things are in Spain, does one go on from there to the linked issue of the part of his country where the Basque peace process is now under way?  One could deal with each of the questions individually but one would find that, for example, question No. 5 is already answered in question No. 9 and so forth.</P>
        <P>In respect of today&rsquo;s business, which was also raised by Deputy Martin, I am prepared to extend the time allocated for the debate tomorrow and to extend the time for questions at the end of it.  We will have to return to this issue, and probably on a number of occasions.  Everybody will have an opportunity to have their say about what is of interest to all of us, that is, getting our country out of this mess while at the same time playing our part as a member of the European Union, which will be central to the growth and development of our economy and job opportunities for our people.</P><Col N="511"/>

	<P>Against the backdrop of the position articulated by Deputy Kelleher, I am a member of the all-party group on mental health, and the representatives of all parties and groups in this Chamber met this afternoon.  There is unanimous concern, which I wish to reflect to the Taoiseach in asking my question on promised legislation, about the five women being placed in lock-up to facilitate staff scheduling difficulties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter will be dealt with in the next item on the agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;over the Christmas period.  I am simply reflecting that, as I will not get the chance to participate in that debate.  I must attend another meeting on mental health so I ask the Taoiseach to take this issue on board and to intervene.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kelleher mentioned other Bills but it comes down to the eligibility for health and personal social services legislation.  That key legislative measure has been repeatedly deferred.  The Mental Health (Amendment) Bill will only correct drafting errors and create clarity.  It will not make any substantive changes in mental health legislation but the eligibility Bill is hugely important.  Hopefully, it would ensure that women or men in a comparable situation would never be placed in a lock-up area for several weeks, other than for their personal protection and for their care regime.</P>

      <sTitle>Medical Cards</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to raise this matter.  There has been a great deal of talk in recent weeks, both in this House and outside it, regarding changes in social welfare provision and how they affect older and vulnerable people.  The issue I wish to raise is related to that debate but not directly relevant to the budgetary provisions, namely, the delays being experienced by applicants throughout the State regarding the granting and renewal of medical cards.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred in the Chamber last week to the huge increase in the number of medical cards issued in recent years as a consequence of the changed economic climate.  I do not mean it as a criticism of anybody working in the medical card processing system in observing that the service seems to be overwhelmed.  This is causing additional trauma for applicants, particularly elderly people and those with ongoing medical issues.  The application and processing system was centralised during the summer, which we were told would offer enhanced efficiency and quicker processing times.  That does not seem to be happening.  Instead we seem to be facing a situation similar to that which arose at the Passport Office.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to address this issue as quickly as possible.  Members on all sides of the House are being contacted by constituents experiencing delays in the granting and renewal of medical cards.  People come to us because they find it difficult to get information directly in regard to their applications.  We are often the first port of call for distressed constituents.  We would all like to see a system that works well and would not require our intervention.  I have spoken to people who, having sent in information that was requested following an application, are told when they contact the central processing centre some weeks later that there is no record of the information being received.  Other constituents who have appealed a decision to the appeals office in Donegal are told by staff there that the relevant file is in Dublin, only then to be told by staff in Dublin that it has been sent to Donegal.</P>
        <P>I was prompted to raise this issue by a case of which I became aware five or six weeks ago which serves as an example of how the system is failing to respond in a timely manner.  The person who contacted me had a family member who had been diagnosed with cancer and was deteriorating rapidly.  Under the previous system, local knowledge would have ensured that a medical card was granted quickly.  Under the new system, however, that did not happen, and the card was only finally issued a week after the person was buried.  In another case I spoke to a couple who had been granted a medical card at the beginning of 2011.  However, when they tried to fill a prescription some weeks ago, the pharmacist told them the card was invalid, a development of which they were not informed.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will address these issues in her response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding to this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  I thank the Deputy for raising it as it provides me with an opportunity to set out the progress made by <Col N="518"/>the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s initiative to standardise the processing of medical cards throughout the country.  Medical cards are provided to persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  While income guidelines are the principal benchmark used for deciding medical card eligibility, the HSE also has regard to other matters considered appropriate in assessing a person for a medical card.</P>
        <P>The HSE implemented its decision to centralise the processing of all new applications and renewals of medical cards at the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in Finglas, Dublin, on 1 July 2011.  Following the centralisation of the service, the PCRS reported that it was receiving approximately 20,000 applications per week.  The PCRS estimates that in excess of 80% of complete applications are processed within 15 working days.  Delays can occur where applications are submitted without the correct supporting documentation necessary to complete the processing of the application.</P>
        <P>All applications are given a unique application number by the PCRS, which is immediately notified to applicants.  Applicants are advised of the importance of quoting this unique application number on all correspondence with the PCRS because it is used to track all correspondence as well as the current status of the application.  In cases where an application is not complete, the PCRS writes to the applicant requesting the missing documentation.</P>
        <P>In cases where a decision is made not to grant a medical card, the applicant is informed of the decision, notified of his or her right to appeal this decision and contact details for the appeals office are provided.  Where appellants submit an appeal within 21 days of a decision, they retain their medical card or GP visit card until the appeal is decided.  The appeals officer notifies the appellant of the final decision in the case.</P>
        <P>In 2010, as part of the centralisation project, the HSE introduced a new website, <i>www.medicalcard.ie</i>, which enables people anywhere in the country to apply for or renew a medical card through a simple and efficient application process.  Thousands of applications are now submitted online every month.  Applying online also gives applicants access to up-to-date information on the progress of their medical card renewal or application.</P>
        <P>Following centralisation, staff in local health offices continue to provide information and assistance to individuals in regard to their applications for medical cards.  They also provide information on the current status of a person&rsquo;s application or review by tracking the application on the PCRS system.  The centralisation project is part of the HSE&rsquo;s effort to deliver efficiencies and reduce overhead costs in a manner that minimises the impact on front line services.  The administration costs of the PCRS represent less than 1% of the value of the payments processed by it.</P>
        <P>The progress of the centralisation project is being continuously monitored and,  if required, modifications will be made to address any issues arising.  Centralisation delivers consistent and equitable application of eligibility and service provision.  It also facilitates clearer governance and accountability, as well as improved management information.  Nevertheless, I very much take on board the Deputy&rsquo;s point that for people who are not computer literate, particularly elderly people, it can be a daunting process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  However, what she described is how the process should work; my contention is that it is not working as it should.  The Minister of State mentioned the extra thousands of applications being submitted.  Have additional staff been allocated to the centralised processing service to meet this demand?  Some applicants are giving up in despair when they cannot get through to the call centre.  Others are told to contact their local office only to find the latter knows nothing about the matter and <Col N="519"/>must then contact the central office on the applicant&rsquo;s behalf.  Has that part of the service been outsourced?  As the Minister of State observed, the online facility is of little use to older people who may not be computer literate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is often that people do not apply for a medical card as soon as they experience a reduction in income.  Instead, they wait until they must attend a doctor before applying, at which stage a delay is inevitable because the process must take its course.  The positive aspect of the scheme is its equitability.  On the other hand, it was great for us, under the old process, to be able to contact the local health manager and explain a constituent&rsquo;s case in detail.  The downside of the process is that we and the individual applicant can no longer do so.  The GP card or the medical card may be retained until the appeal process is completed and this gives wriggle-room or time to collect additional information as sometimes this may be the difficulty.  I acknowledge there are kinks in the system which need to be ironed out and one of the significant kinks in the system is that the local offices do not have sufficient staff to process the files at local level.  This will need to be dealt with.  </P>
        <P>The medical card system works well in the case of the over-70s and this is because it has been in place for longer, but the kinks in the system remain in terms of the overall country-wide application.</P>

	<P>I hope the Acting Chairman will be flexible as regards the time.</P>
        <P>The concerns of relatives and staff in Grangegorman are now public as a result of media attention such as on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;.  Five women are being transferred from an open unit in Grangegorman to a closed, secure unit.  Voluntary patients are moving to a ward for involuntary patients.  This is contrary to all best medical practice.  These are low risk patients who are being moved into what would have been regarded as a medium to high risk unit.  A number of these patients have been in the unit for a considerable period of time. They are familiar with their surroundings and have formed friendships and have decorated the unit for Christmas.</P>
        <P>The reason for this significant change in their situation is because of a shortage of staff.  This is a peak holiday time and there is an embargo on recruitment in the public sector.  The staff are very committed and are to be commended, and a new, state-of-the-art unit will be built next year.  However, a current significant bottleneck needs to be addressed.  The solution is to provide the staff cover through the use of overtime or agency staff.  Another seven patients in the unit were transferred to hostel accommodation on the North Circular Road and in Fairview or to other units.  This could be an alternative for the remaining five patients or else the embargo on staff should be lifted to allow for the provision of ten extra staff required over that period.  I ask the Minister of State to address the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekKeating"><NameTxt>Deputy Derek Keating</NameTxt>
	<P>I am absolutely furious at the way this matter is being handled by the HSE and its treatment of these patients.  I am of the view that this is possibly illegal and it is certainly immoral.  It is completely unprofessional to lump five women into a unit which already caters for six patients.  During the period of their incarceration they will have the use of a single toilet.  Part of the difficulty is that Unit O, where these patients are being incarcerated, is a locked unit and the Mental Health Commission previously deemed this unit to be unsuitable and not fit for purpose.  These five patients are being told they cannot use their mobile telephones during the Christmas period.  I wonder who made this decision.  Are these women five patients or five prisoners?  From my voluntary work over the years I know how <Col N="520"/>important matters such as a routine, consistency and familiarity are for patients undergoing treatment and in particular for those undergoing mental health treatment.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Act 2001 has two main features, the promotion and maintenance of quality standards of care and treatment which are regularly inspected and properly regulated.  The primary function of the Mental Health Tribunals established under the Act is to ensure the protection of the rights of patients detained involuntarily.  These five patients, in my view, are being detained involuntarily.  If a person is detained and treated in a hospital against his or her will, this is not complying with human rights.  If this is the case, the Mental Health Act must be urgently updated and amended.  The information that patients are being moved from their home, Unit 3B, to a locked unit is completely unacceptable.  I ask whether this action contravenes the Mental Health Act.</P>
        <P>In advance of any D&aacute;il question I will table, I ask who made the decision and on what basis.  Was a consultant involved in the decision?  Could this action result in a complaint to the Medical Council if this decision was endorsed by a consultant?  For the sake of a paltry few bob, I ask the Minister of State to direct the HSE to provide staff for the welfare and comfort of these patients in their own unit during the Christmas festivities.  I am very conscious that we have a caring a Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and disability who has inherited the restricted circumstances from a previous Administration.  I ask her in the few days leading up to Christmas to ask the HSE to exercise some flexibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I too am appalled at the situation in Grangegorman for very vulnerable people and their loved ones.  Eleven long-term patients from Unit 3B have been moved.  The most focus has been on those who have been moved into Unit O but others have been moved to hostels and other accommodation.  The bottom line is the moving of these patients.  They are used to their familiar environment and the move is very distressing and disturbing for them.  They have mental health issues and I am aware of the Minister of State&rsquo;s interest in that area.</P>
        <P>There are issues for those already in Unit O whose space is being taken over by the new residents and also issues for the residents of Unit 3B.  A health and safety issue arises in both areas for both patients and staff and it is also a human rights issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very disquieting situation.  As well as having been contacted by concerned family members, I have also had an opportunity to speak to some of the professional staff involved.  Deputy Keating has raised this issue briefly but from my knowledge of their views they are just as appalled and dissatisfied at this decision and its implications.  As Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan has said, it runs the risk of seriously compounding the anxiety suffered by these five women at the best of times.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to this area and I do not doubt it for one minute.  This is clearly an issue of resources and if the decision is to be reversed on 16 January 2012, it means a solution will exist on 16 January.  It may be naive of me to ask the Minister of State but I ask if it is possible to bring forward what will be done on 16 January to 13 December, considering the <i>status quo</i> will be reversed in the middle of January.  Surely there is some possibility of this being addressed in a way that can solve it for this short period of four weeks.  I ask the Minister of State, knowing her commitment to this entire area, to consider this option.  The decision to use a locked or a semi-locked ward is completely the opposite direction we should go.  It is completely unacceptable that we should have to take that step at this stage of our development.  We should be going in the opposite direction and I know this is the long-<Col N="521"/>term commitment of the Minister of State.  This is a bad and a retrograde step and I hope the Minister of State can do something to have it reversed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman.  The extra time is much appreciated as this is a very difficult issue to deal with in a short timeframe for a reply.  To respond to Deputy White&rsquo;s final question on why a solution could not be found immediately if one will be found by 16 January of next year, the difficulty is that the staff needed will not return from annual leave until 16 January.  There is little we can do in the circumstances.  At present, 37 staff are absent in the units in question as a result of maternity leave and sick leave and because a number of those who will retire in February will avail of the accumulated leave to which they are entitled.  We must accept this is the case, especially given the extraordinary job performed by the staff in question.  I am not sure any of us would do their job. </P>
        <P>I am pleased the House is discussing locked units, an issue that was well ventilated recently when we discussed a Private Members&rsquo; motion tabled by Technical Group.  Locked units are from a bygone era, although in some cases people who have emotional episodes need to be protected from themselves and, in rare cases, members of the public need to be protected from individuals.  Specific units are in place to deal with such cases.  The use of locked units, especially dormitory style units, flies in the face of our mental health strategy, A Vision for Change, and everything that most Members believe in.</P>
        <P>It is highly regrettable that the action being taken has become necessary, particularly at this time of year, and I completely understand the distress the decision has caused patients &mdash; if that is the correct term &mdash; their families and the general community.  The Health Service Executive informs me that the measures are necessary given the shortage of nursing staff in Dublin north west mental health services.  Dublin will not be the only area that will experience shortages in future.  There was a large number of retirements this year among nursing staff in St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital and vacant posts were not filled due to the recruitment pause in place in the HSE.  Unfortunately, therefore, the executive has been left with no option but to devise a contingency arrangement to ensure both patient safety and continuity of services over the Christmas period.  It is not the case that I have only recently become involved in this matter.  I have been making inquiries about since before last weekend and the issue must be dealt with in future.</P>
        <P>To address Deputy Keating&rsquo;s concerns, the Mental Health Commission has responsibility under the Mental Act 2001 to take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of detained patients.  I understand the Health Service Executive has notified the commission of the measures proposed.  The Mental Health Commission has responsibility for ensuring the units in question have sufficient staff to provide a safe environment for those who are detained at St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital and its staff.  Despite our efforts to have people receive mental health services in the community, an approach that keeps them well and prevents them from being admitted to hospital, some of them are being called into acute units.  It is perverse that people in the community are becoming unwell and require readmission to hospital.  This issue will form part of the review of the Mental Health Act.</P>
        <P>The position is that, following clinical assessment, it has been decided to transfer the 12 long-stay patients from Unit 3B.  Five have been transferred to Unit O, four to community hostels and the remaining three to other facilities.  However, I have been assured that this is purely a temporary measure and Unit 3B will reopen on 16 January next, if not earlier.  Concerns in the <Col N="522"/>media largely centre on the transfer of five women to Unit O, which is a low secure ward that has a locked door policy in place.  I have received an assurance from the Health Service Executive that patients from Unit 3B who previously could move in and out freely will still be able to do so.  This is fully in line with our national mental health policy which seeks to ensure patients are held in the least restrictive environment possible.</P>
        <P>Concerns have also been expressed that patients in Unit O have access to only one shower.  Again, I am assured that there are two showers available to patients.  While I know this is far from ideal and I am acutely aware of the infrastructural deficits at St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital, the closure of the hospital is foreseen in the context of the implementation of A Vision for Change.  Those who are familiar with the facility will be aware that the reduction in its patient population is proceeding at a steady pace.  Acute admissions have ceased and the hospital now provides only continuing care to long-stay patients who are the women affected by the recent decision.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the House that construction is under way on a 54 bed replacement long-stay facility as part of the Grangegorman redevelopment project.  Building is expected to be completed in 2012 and the new facility will provide patients with their own single bedrooms, <i>en suite</i> facilities, therapy and rehabilitation spaces, in other words, the types of facilities we should have been providing years ago.  I am confident patients will have moved into the new facility before next Christmas, although I accept this will be cold comfort to patients in Unit O.  Again, I express my regret that these measures were necessary.</P>
        <P>Budget 2012 provided an additional &euro;35 million for mental health services which will be used to provide additional posts in the community.  I hope people will never again be locked up for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years.  I visited a locked unit in which one person who clearly did not present a danger to anyone had resided for 60 years.  The additional funding will enable the HSE to enhance the multidisciplinary composition of community mental health teams and focus on key priorities in mental health.  There is, however, a need to explore more fully how mental health services, owing to the age profile of staff within the service, have been impacted disproportionately by the staff moratorium.  This issue is already the subject of discussions between officials of my Department and the HSE and I intend to pursue it further to achieve an appropriate result which ensures the quality and safety of our mental health services in the future.  The blunt instrument of the moratorium will not serve us well in mental health.  For this reason, we must closely examine the areas in which we most need staff and how they can best be provided.  Discussions will have to take place on this issue because staff will be lost in areas in which they are needed and retained in areas where we could do without them.  I appreciate that the Acting Chairman, Deputy Broughan, has allowed me considerable latitude.</P>

We may find, as a result of the recruitment embargo and forthcoming retirements in February, that we still have staffing shortages on 16 January.  While this matter is being addressed, will the Minister of State make arrangements to allow the Deputies who have raised this issue to visit the unit in order that we can see where the women in question are being placed?  I know such a facility resides with the inspector and ask the Minister of State to make the appropriate arrangements.</P>

If we accept that the response we have been given &mdash; the posts lie vacant and cannot be replaced &mdash; is accurate, does the HSE not have some flexibility to hire staff for four weeks?</P>

	<P>I appreciate the Chair&rsquo;s patience.  I can inform Deputy Costello that I have already made a request to be allowed to visit the unit.  I have been told it is not a difficulty.  I did not make a similar request on behalf of other Deputies.  I will make such a request and revert to all the Deputies in question.  I assure Deputies O&rsquo;Sullivan and Keating that people on overtime and agency staff are already working in the unit.  I have been informed by the HSE that the difficulty is that it is better to have staff with whom the residents of the unit are familiar, rather than people who are not known to them.  It is very easy to understand that point.  The HSE has assured me that it has asked people to do a little extra work over Christmas.  It is natural and understandable that people are reluctant to work during the Christmas holidays.  I am in regular contact with the HSE.  If it agrees to a visit by the Deputies when I contact it again, I will contact them.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Quinn, for coming to the House to deal with it.  Piper&rsquo;s Hill is a new all-embracing educational campus just outside Naas in County Kildare.  It is organised and operated by Kildare VEC, or more accurately by the chief executive of the VEC, Mr. Se&aacute;n Ashe.  There are many opinions among educationalists and sociologists about the desirability of shoe-horning the wide spectrum of educational provision onto one site.  Time will tell if this experiment works well or otherwise.  However, I do not want to raise that aspect of the Piper&rsquo;s Hill campus today.  Instead, I wish to focus on the extraordinary and unorthodox methods used to raise the funding for the campus.</P>
        <P>In his response, perhaps the Minister will give the House details of the sequence of events that led to him being forced last summer to meet a shortfall of over &euro;20 million for this project from funds that had been earmarked for the school summer projects and other schemes.  It seems that the chief executive of the VEC, Mr. Ashe, who was the driving force behind the project and the novel model for funding it, decided to sell the old second level VEC school in Naas to Superquinn for &euro;23 million.  Superquinn paid a deposit of &euro;2.3 million and was supposed to pay the balance of &euro;21.7 million in February 2010.  The chief executive then made the extraordinary and dangerous decision to raise a loan of &euro;21.7 million with Bank of Ireland on the <Col N="524"/>back of the Superquinn deal, which was ultimately not concluded.  He did that with the sanction of the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Education and Skills, with whom he was closely associated.</P>
        <P>When Superquinn failed to come up with the balance of &euro;21.7 million in February 2010, it sought additional time and agreed to pay the interest on the VEC loan.  The wheels were now seriously coming off the wagon.  The deal was falling asunder.  The VEC, the Department and the taxpayer were exposed.  The chickens were coming home to roost on an extraordinarily risky venture that was pursued at the end of the madness that was the building boom.  By mid-2010, Superquinn was in receivership and the VEC was stuck with a loan which it could not pay and should never have raised in the circumstances.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Department of Education and Skills and the taxpayer were obliged to pick up the tab for the total of &euro;21.7 million that was due.  It appears that this year&rsquo;s school summer projects and other schemes were jeopardised as a result.  Can the Minister give the House an assurance that the type of risk-taking and venture activity that was at the core of this case will no longer be sanctioned by him?  Will he introduce the necessary checks and balances on how VECs raise funds for school buildings to ensure the type of fiasco that occurred at Piper&rsquo;s Hill does not happen again?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to outline to the House the current position in regard to the funding of the Piper&rsquo;s Hill Educational Campus in Naas, County Kildare.  As the Deputy is aware, there has been a significant increase in the number of schoolgoing children in the country in recent years.  My Department is forecasting that this will increase further in the coming years.  Naas is one of the areas identified by the Department as experiencing a rapid growth in demand for new school accommodation.  In this context, Kildare VEC took the initiative and developed a new educational campus at Piper&rsquo;s Hill, including a new 1,000-pupil post-primary school building, a physical education hall, a building for Gaelscoil N&aacute;s na R&iacute;ogh and a headquarters building for the Irish Vocational Education Association.  In time, it will be the site of permanent buildings for Naas community national school and St. David&rsquo;s Church of Ireland national school.  As the Deputy will be aware, the development of the campus has been highly successful to date.  The development of the campus and the provision of additional post-primary school places ensured there was no accommodation crisis in Naas in recent years and all children in the catchment area had a place to go to school.</P>
        <P>The development of the Piper&rsquo;s Hill educational campus did not follow the usual model of upfront Exchequer funding from the Department.  Instead, the VEC funded the development of the post-primary school, the sports hall and the site infrastructure such as roads, etc.  The Department funded the construction of the gaelscoil and the Irish Vocational Education Association headquarters.  Kildare VEC funded its element of the project by entering into a contract for the disposal of an existing asset to the Superquinn group.  This was done with the approval of the Department and my predecessors as Minister.  Under the terms of the arrangement, Superquinn was supposed to acquire the site of the old vocational school on the Limerick Road in Naas, which was not large enough to accommodate a 1,000 pupil school.  The VEC borrowed the funds to develop the new school, sports hall and site infrastructure on the strength of this contract for sale.</P>
        <P>When the Superquinn group went into receivership last year, it became clear that the contract with the VEC would not be honoured.  The VEC was left without the means to pay off its debt with the bank.  Rather than allowing the VEC to continue to incur interest on this debt, I decided to make funds available to the VEC to settle the debt with the bank.</P><Col N="525"/>
        <P>The VEC continues to retain the freehold on the old vocational school in Naas that was the subject of the contract for sale.  It is being used as a permanent location for Gaelchol&aacute;iste Chill Dara, which has been able to vacate its previous rented premises to relocate in Naas, thus eliminating the previous rental bill on that premises and avoiding the need to acquire a greenfield site and develop a new school building for the gaelchol&aacute;iste.  The VEC also retained the original deposit of 10% that was paid by Superquinn when the contract was signed.  This was used as part of the Piper&rsquo;s Hill campus development.  While it is regrettable that the original transaction was not completed, the fact remains that two post-primary schools are now located in permanent accommodation, while the Piper&rsquo;s Hill campus is an asset to the town of Naas and a key part of the educational infrastructure of the area.</P>

Will he put systems in place to ensure this sort of capitalist venture, whereby money is raised in this way for public schools, is ended?  Certain programmes in the Department of Education and Skills were put at serious risk as a result of the collapse of this venture.</P>

In the circumstances in which we now find ourselves, we have to learn from the experience of this case and make sure similar situations do not recur in the future.</P>

        <P>I do not know when the Minister, Deputy Quinn, last visited a DEIS school, or whether he did so recently.  The work DEIS schools do in disadvantaged communities is very obvious.  I know this at first hand because I have two children who attend schools within DEIS areas.  I know the kind of work the schools do, the time teachers spend with students, the ability of teachers to build up students&rsquo; confidence and ability, how they teach them to read and write, and all the other practical measures involved.  The schools play a vital role not only in children&rsquo;s education, but in the greater scheme of things in the community.  They help hold together the social fabric and they have been very successful.</P>
        <P>I spent the weekend speaking to a number of school principals who were really angry and bewildered by the decision of the Minister in respect of pupil-teacher ratios in DEIS schools.  This will have a significant impact not only on the educational needs of the children.  Many of the children in question come from very disadvantaged backgrounds.  Many have behavioural issues.  There is a scheme in place in DEIS schools in regard to school attendance records concerning which I spoke to one principal.  In the past five years an additional 1,500 days have been supplied to pupils as a result of the work and extra support put in by the schools.  Withdrawing staff will have an enormous effect.</P>
        <P>I am trying to get a grip on how many teacher posts will be lost in Cork North-Central.  The figures are coming in bit by bit as we talk to the schools.  In the 12 schools I spoke with so far, 41 staff will be lost.  That is a huge number not only for the staff, but for the children within the schools and in regard to the additional supports the schools provide to the communities.</P>

My colleague has set out in very real terms the kind of devastation which will be caused by the withdrawal of what I calculate to be approximately 400 posts.  Perhaps the Minister will give the exact figure today.  That will be a devastating blow to schools, children and communities and will damage not only children&rsquo;s education, but their social and life opportunities.</P>
        <P>I note when the Minister deals with this matter it is referred to as a &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; issue.  He knows as well as I do that in the communities where DEIS schools are located there are legacies of poverty, need and underachievement in education.  Previously, a Labour Party Government vowed to break the cycle and give every child the chance he or she deserves.  These actions will undo very much of that work.  It is ironic that one Labour Party Minister would sabotage the good work of a previous Labour Party Minister.</P>
        <P>At some stage today the Minister met with a group of teachers from the north inner city of Dublin.  I am sure they set out for him in concrete terms what it means in a school to lose three, four, five or, in some cases, as many as eight teachers, and how damaging this will be for the children concerned.  I am very sure they told the Minister he must stop these cuts.  I take this opportunity again to ask the Minister to stop these cuts which will do untold damage.  If his Administration claims to have a commitment to education, early childhood intervention, equality of opportunity and the protection not only of children&rsquo;s education, but of their life chances, the Minister has no option other than to stop these cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to reinforce what the other Deputies stated.  This is an attack on disadvantaged areas.  For many years we made enormous strides in trying to provide education and give people hope and opportunity in areas of disadvantage.  The DEIS programme, Breaking the Cycle and Even Breaks were put in place by successive Governments and supported with the necessary resources.</P>
        <P>I sat on the Minister&rsquo;s side of the House and defended unpopular decisions but this cut will have devastating impacts in areas of disadvantage not only for the individuals concerned, but collectively within those communities.  I urge the Minister to reconsider.  As Deputy O&rsquo; Brien pointed out, more than 40 teachers will be lost on the north side of Cork city, an already disadvantaged area.  That is the equivalent of closing three schools in the area.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to step back and look at the areas supported by the DEIS programme, Breaking the Cycle and Even Breaks and see if he can come up with any imaginative solutions.  If we look at the budget we can see that some schools are getting extra allocations without being in areas of disadvantage.  They are increasing their teacher numbers while elsewhere there are areas that have had legacy issues for many years.  These are unemployment, neglect <Col N="527"/>by the State, local authorities and society at large.  There is one opportunity to give people a break.</P>
        <P>I offer an interesting figure.  Seven per cent of the people who attend these schools on the north side of Cork go on to third level education.  That is a move in the right direction but it is only 7%.  This is not about third level fees and does not involve any grand debate in the broader sense.  This is about the nuts and bolts of people being able to read or write.  I urge the Minister to look at the area of disadvantage, Breaking the Cycle and the DEIS programmes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with my fellow Deputies in asking the Minister to reconsider this very cruel cut to rural and urban disadvantaged schools.  If we look at the recent budget a clear trend was that families who are lower paid or on social welfare got hit and hurt more badly and in a more blatant way than people on high pay.  It is the same with the education cuts.  The headline that emerged from the budget was that there would be no change to teacher-pupil ratios.  However, when we delve down into this issue we see there are changes to those ratios and they are taking place in the most disadvantaged schools which most need support.</P>
        <P>I offer the Minister two examples of the many schools that will be affected in County Donegal when this cut takes place after next September.  Glengad national school currently has five teachers but this measure will bring the number down to three.  In Carndonagh girls&rsquo; national school there are currently nine teachers but this cut will bring the number down to seven and probably to six the following year.  These types of cuts are unsustainable but in one fell swoop this is what will be experienced.</P>
        <P>Last week, the Government wisely rowed back on the cut to disability benefit, recognising it was the wrong thing to do.  Likewise this cut is the wrong thing to do.  It is totally unfair for those families, in particular the children, to be hit by reductions in teacher numbers next September.  I urge the Minister to withdraw this decision and change his mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>A key priority for my Department is to continue to prioritise and target funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.  However, in order to ensure fairness in the distribution of resources available under the DEIS plan, it is no longer possible to allow some schools to retain legacy posts on a concessionary basis that pre-date the introduction of the DEIS scheme.  Accordingly, a decision has been taken to withdraw 428 posts from earlier disadvantage programmes in 270 primary schools and 163 post-primary schools that exceed what equivalent schools are entitled to under DEIS or to which non-DEIS schools are not entitled.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The following are some important elements to this measure which should address some of the concerns raised about the schools in question.  My Department will hold several teaching posts in reserve to reduce the impact of changes to schools most acutely affected.  All schools will be notified in January 2012 of their staffing entitlements under the new arrangement, including any alleviation measures that may apply.</P>
        <P>The majority of DEIS band 1 schools will benefit from the new dedicated pupil teacher ratio of 22:1.  The new staffing schedule for DEIS band 1 primary schools now gives greater autonomy to schools and simplifies the existing system whereby schools are given a top-up allocation to support lower class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes.</P>
        <P>DEIS post-primary schools will be targeted for additional support through an improved staffing schedule of 18.25:1, which is a 0.75 point improvement compared to the existing standard, 19:1, that applies in post-primary schools that do not charge fees or compared to the 21:1 ratio that will apply in fee-charging schools.</P><Col N="528"/>
        <P>Phasing out of the legacy posts will commence in the 2012-13 school year.  The phasing of this measure will allow schools time to prepare for this gradual change.  In the meantime, the new pupil teacher ratio of 22:1 will take effect from September 2012 for all DEIS band 1 schools.</P>
        <P>In addition, the changes announced to the general allocation model and the way in which resource teachers are allocated to all 3,200 primary schools will take effect from next September.  My Department will, by necessity, carefully examine each DEIS school&rsquo;s staffing arrangements on a case-by-case basis to ensure the impact of changes will be minimised as much as possible.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s protection of schools serving disadvantaged areas is further underlined by the maintenance of &euro;13 million in enhanced funding for DEIS schools, &euro;2 million in school book funding for DEIS schools, as well as a &euro;26 million investment in the home school community liaison scheme.  All these areas have been protected from reductions in expenditure for 2012.  The school completion programme, which transferred to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs earlier this year, remains a major component of DEIS and has seen only a marginal deduction of &euro;2 million in its overall budget equating to approximately 6.5%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>How can the Minister claim the change in pupil-teacher ratios will benefit some schools?  It beggars belief.  I asked him when was the last time he visited one of these schools.  Deputy Kelleher pointed out how currently 7% of school leavers in the north side of Cork city go on to third level education.  Before these schemes were introduced 20 years ago, that figure was only 1%.  We will be heading back to that 1% if these cuts go ahead.  These cuts cannot proceed.  This is not about money but about people&rsquo;s opportunity to further their education, better themselves and get a real job.  These schemes are vital to that.  If these are withdrawn, it is those children who could benefit who will be worse off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s response that he is not going to change his mind on these cuts.  To suggest that withdrawing 420 posts would enhance a child&rsquo;s educational opportunity is utterly perverse.  The Minister described this as a legacy issue.  What will the Minister&rsquo;s legacy be?  It will be that he dismantled the invaluable work done in communities with DEIS schools.</P>
        <P>The Minister may not be for changing his mind now but he should be on notice that in the communities and constituencies in which these schools will be hammered by him, he will face a battle not just from the teachers but from the parents and community at large.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>It baffles me that he will persist with these cuts.  He does not need anyone on this side of the House to tell him just how damaging this decision will prove.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>In the foreword to the national literacy and numeracy strategy, the Minister stated his aspiration is to achieve world-class literacy and numeracy skills among our children and young people.  If the Minister does not reverse these cuts in disadvantaged areas, he will consign that aspiration to the bin and might as well tear up the strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>One teacher in a school in my area told me that since DEIS was introduced the school&rsquo;s standardised test results in numeracy and literacy have improved.  Her students have flourished emotionally, socially and academically, attendance has vastly improved and parents are very much involved in their children&rsquo;s education.  The Minister, through these cuts, will remove 428 teachers from the system.  It is a crude cut attacking the <Col N="529"/>most vulnerable students.  The Minister should row back on this.  The Minister will know what is coming to him when these cuts feed through to the different schools.  Parents and children will be hurt by these cuts.  It is crucial the Minister goes back to the drawing board, looks again at this and changes his mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I have visited DEIS band 1 and band 2 schools.  There are some in my constituency which is an inner city one and not just all Dublin 4.  There have been inequalities between various DEIS schools with some getting fewer resources than others that were previously identified as having a disadvantage and subsequently re-branded as DEIS schools.  The question is about the equal treatment of pupils in those categories.</P>
        <P>I accept there are areas of compounded social disadvantage where conditions outside the school affect the classroom.  I think of some of the schools in my inner city constituency.  These measures will be introduced over time and their impact reviewed. An equalisation will be in place as to how they will be implemented.  The schools affected will be negotiated with on these measures much earlier than was previously the case.</P>
        <P>At the end of the day, we must realise we are not in control of our economic destiny.</P>

        <P>I will examine carefully how these measures are implemented.  I will discuss with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, how we can combine the home school liaison and school completion programmes.  Teachers have informed me that many of the problems they face originate outside the classroom.  The solution is not necessarily more teachers but much more home support&mdash;&mdash;</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Local Government (Household Charge)" RHead="Bill 2011 [Seanad]: Second Stage."> 
    <Title>Local Government (Household Charge) Bill 2011 [Seanad]: Second Stage</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to give effect to the EU-IMF programme of financial support commitment to introduce a property tax for 2012.  The programme reflects the need, in the context of the State&rsquo;s overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.</P>
        <P>However, in light of the complex issues involved, a property tax requiring a comprehensive property valuation system would take time to introduce and, accordingly, to meet the requirements in the EU-IMF programme, the Government decided to introduce a household charge in 2012.  The household charge is an interim measure and proposals for a full property tax will be a matter for consideration by the Government in due course.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a relatively short and straightforward legislative instrument.  Essentially, the majority of residential property owners in the State will be liable to pay an annual charge of &euro;100.  Liability arises each year on a point in time basis.  It is expected to raise some &euro;160 million on full collection and the revenues from the charge will support the provision of vital services provided by local authorities in our communities.  Internationally, local services are administered by local authorities and financed by local service charges.  In Ireland, local authorities are responsible for, among other services, fire and emergency services, maintenance and cleaning of streets, street lighting, planning and development services, public parks, libraries, open spaces and leisure facilities, etc.  These essential local services benefit all members of the public, including business.</P>
        <P>In common with all levels of government, the financial position of local authorities remains under significant pressure.  At the same time, as part of the efforts to close the gap between income and expenditure in the public finances, Exchequer funding of the day-to-day activities of local authorities cannot be immune and, accordingly, the 2012 Exchequer allocation to local government has been reduced by &euro;164 million compared to 2011.  The introduction of the household charge in 2012 is, therefore, critical to ensuring that local authorities have the necessary resources to deliver services to their communities at close to existing levels in the coming year.</P>
        <P>We had a helpful and constructive debate in the Seanad on the Bill last week and it is fair to say that most of the discussion revolved around the exemptions and waivers from the household charge.  In the main, Senators advocated additional provisions to exempt more owners and properties from its scope.  I am satisfied that the current provisions in the Bill for exemptions and waivers are sufficiently broad and will exclude those households in particular difficulties from the ambit of the charge.  The provision of additional exemptions from taxation measures could give rise to a domino effect.  Providing an additional exemption from the charge may seem entirely reasonable in itself but it could give rise to pressure for more exemptions catering for circumstances different, but not wholly dissimilar, from the original one.  There could be a tendency for calls to be made for an incremental extension of exemptions to a point where the revenue stream from the charge starts to be eroded significantly.  The broad applicability of the household charge has allowed us to set it at the lowest possible level for 2012 at &euro;100.  The inclusion of further exemptions or waivers would require a corresponding <Col N="531"/>increase in the level of the charge and would disadvantage those households remaining liable for the charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is fooling nobody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators also pointed to the provisions in the Bill which enable the level of the charge to be increased in line with changes in the consumer price index, CPI, in the future.  I stress that this provision would only allow for minimal changes in the level of the charge and it is also included in the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009.  Any significant change in the quantum of the charge will require primary legislation and cannot be increased without further reference to the Oireachtas.  I would also point out again that the household charge is an interim measure and will be replaced by a full valuation-based property tax in due course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The charge will be administered on a self-assessment basis and is to a significant extent based on those arrangements applying to the non-principal private residence, NPPR, charge introduced under the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009.  It will be a matter for owners of residential property concerned to register and pay the charge.  It is intended that the liability date will be 1 January, with payment due by the end of March for those not opting to pay by instalments.  This liability date was chosen due to its fit with the overall annual financial cycle of local authorities and will allow moneys collected to be expended by authorities in the year collected.  It also provides clarity as to ownership on the liability date as there are likely to be very few, if any, property transactions on New Year&rsquo;s Day.</P>
        <P>I wish to make clear that the liability date of 1 January is the date upon which persons will have to assess whether, as an owner of a residential property, they are in fact liable to pay the household charge.  The payment of the household charge can be made from this liability date up to and including 31 March 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a nice New Year&rsquo;s Day present for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Persons will have a full three months from the liability date to pay the household charge.</P>
        <P>Significant efforts will be made to ensure that property owners are aware of the household charge and the liability and payment dates.  My Department and local authorities will undertake a national information campaign to advise people of the charge and their responsibilities in regard to payment.  A similar and successful advertising and information campaign was undertaken in the context of the NPPR charge in 2009.  I am confident that those liable to the charge will be aware of their obligation to discharge their liability for the charge by 31 March 2012 and, thereby, avoid late payment fees or late payment interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a major boycott of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is up to the Deputy if he wants to break the law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not up to me; it is up to the people.  The Minister is imposing a draconian fine of &euro;2,500 to try to coerce them.  He has not gone into that at all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has the floor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is getting a little excited about the charge and he is working hard on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not even started yet.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="532"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Late payment fees and late payment interest will only apply if the household charge is not paid in respect of a liable property by or on the due date of 31 March.  These are similar provisions to those that apply under Revenue legislation in respect of the late filing and payment of certain taxes and will act as an incentive for persons to pay the self-assessment household charge on time.  Any household charges, late payment fees and late payment penalties will remain as a charge against the property concerned.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises that the charge represents an additional cost for home owners and it is proposed to facilitate them by allowing it to be paid by direct debit in four equal instalments of &euro;25.  I will set out in regulations the dates by which each instalment will fall due and the arrangements for the payment of the instalments.</P>
        <P>Similar to the &euro;200 charge on NPPRs, an online system is being developed by the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, to enable home owners pay the household charge over the internet by credit or debit card.  In addition, home owners will be able to make payments by cheque and postal order through the post to the LGMA.  A bureau will be put in place in the agency to administer the charge on a shared service-agency basis for all local authorities.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that the existing revenue base of local authorities is narrow by international standards.  This was a consideration in the introduction of the NPPR charge in 2009.  While the charge represents a dedicated source of funding for local authorities, which is relatively stable, it does not go far enough in addressing the imbalance in the sector&rsquo;s financing.  A proper broadening of the revenue base for local government will come about as a result of the introduction of the household charge.  This measure is significant because it recognises that local authorities should not be disproportionately dependent on central government funding.</P>
        <P>The proceeds of the household charge will be paid directly into the local government fund.  As Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government with responsibility for the management of the fund, I will disburse moneys back to local authorities in general-purpose grants.  It is considered that this approach is preferable to allowing local authorities to directly retain moneys collected from the household charge in their areas.  It will make it possible to introduce equalisation into its distribution, ensuring local authorities with higher populations than others do not benefit unduly as a result.</P>
        <P>The Government proposes that a small number of exemptions to the household charge will apply.  The proposed exemptions are properties that are part of the trading stock of a business and have not been sold, occupied or been the source of any income since their construction; properties vested in local authorities or voluntary and co-operative housing bodies for social housing, as making such properties liable would lead to a circular flow of income and be unnecessarily bureaucratic; properties owned by a Government or the HSE and used or let in the performance of their functions, as making such properties liable would lead to unnecessary circular administrative structures; properties to which commercial rates apply &mdash; as with the second house charge, it is intended that this charge would operate as an alternative to commercial rates, that is, a property will be liable for either commercial rates or the household charge if it is domestic property, but not both; where a person is forced to vacate a property because of long-term mental or physical infirmity &mdash; this exemption was included in the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 as a compassionate measure intended to provide for elderly people who have no choice but to move out of their sole or main residence into a residential nursing home; and where a charity owns a property.</P>
        <P>In addition to these exemptions, two important waivers will apply to the charge.  The programme for Government commits to giving consideration, in the context of introducing a property tax, to the impact that such a tax would have on the number of households in mortgage distress.  The Government, therefore, proposes to exclude from the charge households in receipt <Col N="533"/>of mortgage interest supplement from the Department of Social Protection.  Mortgage interest supplement provides short-term support to help eligible households pay mortgage interest payments.  In excess of 18,000 households will benefit from this waiver.  The Government also intends providing a waiver for households in certain categories of unfinished housing estates.  The report of the advisory group on unfinished estates identified two categories of households in particular difficulty: category 3, comprising 1,112 estates, where a developer is in place but there is no on-site activity and where there are significant planning, building control compliance and public safety issues to be addressed; and category 4, comprising 188 estates, where the developer or site owner is not contactable and-or where no receiver has been appointed and serious public safety problems similar to category 3 exist.</P>
        <P>I will set out the estates to which the waiver will apply in regulations.  These regulations will be informed by local authority returns to the Department from the 2011 national survey of unfinished housing estates.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to address the needs of these estates as quickly as possible but, in the interim, this waiver will benefit such residents as they work with other stakeholders in developing resolutions for these problematic developments.  The costs of this waiver will abate over time as the issues in these estates are resolved and property owners become liable for the charge.</P>
        <P>During the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the other House, a number of amendments were put forward, proposing to exempt various additional categories of properties and persons from the charge, including affordable housing, those who had paid stamp duty in the housing boom period and persons in receipt of the numerous welfare payments from the Department of Social Protection.  These proposals would have the potential to severely reduce the amount collectable from the charge, would significantly increase the administrative burden and costs associated with the charge and would be inconsistent with the need to introduce a new broadly based revenue stream of funding, which is vital for local government services.</P>
        <P>While I accept the introduction of the charge is an additional cost to households, the exemptions and waivers provided in the Bill, added to the provisions for instalment arrangements, in my view, provide a comprehensive response to those in particular need.  I would also point out to Deputies that expanding the number of exemptions would leave no option but to increase the charge for others in order to raise the revenue necessary to adequately resource local government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I consider it important to reiterate that those households that have no liability for the charge include: tenants in private rented accommodation for any lease or tenancy under a term of 20 years; tenants in local authority housing; tenants in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement from the Department of Social Protection; households that are purchasing their homes under the shared ownership scheme, where the local authority still retains an ownership stake; tenants and-or those living in housing provided by voluntary and co-operative bodies and charities; those living in housing vested in the HSE or a Minister of the Government; those home owners who have been forced to vacate their property by reason of long-term mental or physical infirmity and who are now living in a property which they do not themselves own; those households in receipt of mortgage interest supplement; home owners residing in certain unfinished housing estates; and those residing in property owned by charities or discretionary trusts.  I am confident, therefore, the Bill provides a reasonable level of protection for those in greatest need in our communities.</P>
        <P>Concerns were also raised in the Seanad on the issue of bedsits and liability to the household charge.  While the charge does apply to such properties, I must stress again that it is the owners of bedsits who will be liable, not the tenants.</P>

	<P>The debate is going very well.  Let us continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill contains 20 sections and is a relatively straightforward piece of legislation, which will be easy for Deputy Higgins to understand.  Essentially, owners of liable residential property will be required to pay to the Local Government Management Agency an annual charge of &euro;100.  I consider it important to minimise the costs associated with its collection.  Accordingly, county and city councils will delegate their functions in administering the charge to one body, the Local Government Management Agency, which will be paid the costs of administering the charge from the proceeds of the household charge.</P>
        <P>As there is no existing database of residential property ownership in the State, the Local Government Management Agency cannot issue bills or invoices.  In this regard, the charge is a self-assessment measure and it is for the owners of residential property, in the first instance, to assess whether they are liable to pay the charge.  Nonetheless, the charge is relatively simple and straightforward and is easy to understand.  In addition to the normal sanctions involving a fine on conviction of an offence, the Bill incorporates late payment fees and late payment interest provisions which should act as a real incentive to pay the household charge when it is due.</P>
        <P>From a drafting perspective, the Bill starts from a position where all residential property is liable for the household charge.  It goes on to exempt certain buildings and owners from this liability.  To put it another way, it identifies what is not liable within the totality of residential buildings, rather than taking as a starting point buildings and owners that are liable.  These include, in section 2, properties which are owned by a Minister of the Government or the HSE, or are vested in local authorities or voluntary and co-operative housing bodies for social housing purposes.  Other exemptions to the charge are provided for in section 4, including properties owned by charities and certain discretionary trusts, and where a person has to leave their home due to long-term mental or physical infirmity.  Waivers are provided for persons in receipt of mortgage interest supplement or residing in certain unfinished housing estates on the liability date.  The household charge will apply to immovable property and, as such, mobile homes and vessels are exempted from the household charge.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that the charge shall be paid to the county and city councils under section 3.  However, local authorities will delegate their collection functions to the Local Government Management Agency under section 13.  In the event of non-payment of a household charge for which a person is liable by a certain date, section 7 sets out that late payment fees and late payment interest of 1% per month, or part thereof, will apply to unpaid amounts.  The late payment fee to apply in the case of a household charge paid not later than six months after the due date is 10% of the amount outstanding; in the case of a household charge paid later than six months and not later than 12 months after the due date, it is 20% of the amount outstanding; or in the case of a household charge paid later than 12 months after the due date, it is 30% of the amount outstanding.  These penalty provisions are proportionate to the level of the household charge and are similar to the provisions that apply under Revenue legislation in respect of the late filing and payment of certain taxes.  They will act as an incentive to pay the self-assessment household charge on time.</P>
        <P>The rolled-up amount of a late payment fee should not be underestimated and non-payment of a charge for a period of two years will result in a liability of some &euro;280 when account is taken both of the charges, the late payment fees and late payment interest.  I want the message to go out clearly to those who are liable to pay this necessary household charge on time, rather <Col N="535"/>than incur late payment fees.  Local authorities will also have power to take prosecutions against owners who fail to discharge their liability to pay the charge.  Prosecution will be by way of summary proceedings and a court may impose a class C fine, under the Fines Act 2010, which ranges from &euro;1,000 to &euro;2,500.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provisions of section 7(3) to (7) came in for some comment on Committee Stage in the Upper House.  These provisions deal with circumstances where a person who is the sole owner of a residential property dies and, at the time of his or her death, household charges and late payment fees and interest were due and unpaid.  It was suggested that upon an owner&rsquo;s death, such unpaid charges and late payment penalties should cease to exist.  I want to take this opportunity to outline to this House why these provisions are included in the Bill.</P>
        <P>In the interest of equity, it would be grossly unfair to those households who discharge their liability for the household charge to allow for unpaid charges to be waived upon death for those who did not fulfil their obligations under the law while alive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>By Jesus, the Minister will follow them to the grave.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Such a provision could potentially create an incentive for persons to avoid or attempt to evade payment of the household charge.  I believe the provisions of section 7 provide for a reasonable solution to the matter.  Penalties and interest which had been accruing up to the point of death cease and no further penalties are applied, provided the personal representative of the deceased discharges the full amount of the household charge&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a new construction on grave robbing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;late payment fees and interest due up to the date of death within three months of the date of the grant of representation to the estate of the deceased.</P>
        <P>Where a property liable for the charge is being sold, the Bill provides in section 10(3) that the vendor will be required to discharge all outstanding household charges, late payment fees and late payment interest on or before the date of transfer.  This should prove a strong incentive for a purchaser and their solicitor to ensure that all outstanding charges are paid before a contract to sell the property is executed.</P>
        <P>In section 14 provision is made for data exchange between local authorities and the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Electricity Supply Board and the Revenue Commissioners.  This data should assist local authorities to identify properties liable for the charge.  The Private Residential Tenancies Board holds data on rental properties and the ESB&rsquo;s systems can generate data on residential properties where electricity is used.  The Revenue Commissioners hold data on certain property transactions, such as stamp duty, VAT and capital gains taxes.  In addition, some other amendments and insertions are being made to the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, which provides for the &euro;200 charge on non-principal private residences. <Col N="536"/> These include definitions and other provisions contained in the Local Government (Household Charge) Bill 2011 in order to mirror, in the Act, the provisions contained in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The 2009 Act exempted properties leased to a local authority under the Rental Accommodation Scheme, RAS.  The RAS exemption was included in order to encourage take-up of the then relatively new scheme.  As the scheme has been in existence for a number of years, an incentive is no longer required.  Indeed, similar long-term leasing arrangements with private property owners are now being entered into in respect of meeting social housing needs.  As leases under RAS, now a mainstream social housing option, are subject to the same legal framework applying to private leases under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, it is not justifiable that a landlord group should continue to receive added incentives simply from inclusion of their properties in social housing arrangements.  Is Deputy Higgins happy with that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has decided that the household charge will apply to properties in this group and has, furthermore, decided to remove the non-principal private residence exemption with effect from 2012.  Linked to this is the exemption for properties leased to the HSE, which will fall to be treated in the same way as RAS.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill also amends the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 to provide for a &euro;10 charge on over-the-counter transactions in respect of the NPPR.  Initial take-up of the online payment option was encouraging, with 85% of users choosing to pay online in October 2009.  By December 2010, this figure had fallen to 59%.  Over-the-counter payments are resource-heavy for local authorities and it is considered that this should be reflected in an additional charge if somebody chooses to use an administratively expensive payment option when others are available.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>A &euro;10 transaction charge was also recommended by the local government efficiency review group to apply to all payments other than those made electronically.  However, at this stage it is only proposed to apply the additional administrative charge to over-the-counter payments for the NPPR &mdash; the Deputies did not wait for the second or third sentence.  Given the fact that some people may still not have access to electronic means of payment and the fact that broadband is not universally available, an electronic option may not be a realistic alternative to a postal payment for many people, particularly the elderly in rural areas.  It is thus not proposed to apply the charge to payments made by post.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware of the significant role which the Local Government Fund has played in the financing of local government since it was established in 1999.  The fund has been financed from a combination of an Exchequer contribution and the full proceeds of motor taxation.  Total funding for 2011 amounts to some &euro;1.16 billion.  The 2011 fund comprises an Exchequer contribution of &euro;164 million and the proceeds of motor tax, projected at &euro;998 million.  Local authorities were allocated general purpose grants of &euro;790 million in 2011, which represents approximately 29% of local authority current funding.  Some &euro;398 million was also provided from the Local Government Fund to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport for the provision of roads and public transport infrastructure.  As announced last week by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, the Exchequer contribution to the Local Government Fund will cease this year and will be replaced by the proceeds of the household charge in 2012.</P>

	<P>What about when property does not go up and people boycott it?  What will happen to the local authorities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Higgins will have to answer that, not me.</P>
        <P>The Government is not solely focused on local government funding issues.  We are also seeking to ensure that local government delivers the services that our communities expect as efficiently and cost effectively as possible.  I will ensure that the proceeds of the household charge will be put to the optimum use in delivering local services on the ground.  I am determined that local authority cost bases will continue to be rigorously examined and reduced to maximise efficiencies which, in turn, impact positively on business.  The realisation of the savings and other efficiencies identified in the local government efficiency review group report will involve implementation over a focused timescale.  In this context I established, earlier this year, an implementation group with an independent chair and business expertise to drive and oversee implementation of relevant prioritised recommendations of the report of the local government efficiency review group.</P>
        <P>The implementation group is focusing on key recommendations in areas such as shared services, procurement, ICT and human resources that will remove costs and yield early financial savings for the local government sector.  I am due to receive the implementation group&rsquo;s first report this month and this will include an assessment of progress made to date.  We must also be cognisant of the reduction of over 6,500 staff posts in local authorities over the last few years &mdash; well ahead of any other area of the public service.  This is one of the biggest contributors to efficiency and productivity in local authorities.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to align the community development sector with local government will also see an expanded role for local authorities in local enterprise and community development.  This, in turn, will maximise the impact of investment to produce jobs at a local level.  My Department will continue to work with the County and City Managers Association to identify best practices in the local government sector, in building stronger sectoral approaches and in eliminating variances between local authorities.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to refer briefly to another issue that is equally important to the well-being of the local government sector.  A range of work relevant to the reform and development of local government is also under way, in accordance with the programme for Government, and significant progress has being made.  On structural reform, the Government announced, on 28 June 2011, its decision to create a single local authority to replace Limerick city and county councils with effect from the local elections in mid-2014.  In addition, the Government decided to establish a unified county council in Tipperary, also with effect from the next local elections.  Implementation groups have been appointed to oversee planning, preparatory work and initial implementation of the reorganisation process in both Limerick and Tipperary and their work is proceeding.  I have also established a local government committee to consider whether the creation of a unified authority in Waterford would be desirable and that committee is also in operation and is due to report to me by the end of February 2012.</P>
        <P>These measures are being progressed ahead of more comprehensive policy proposals which will be brought to Government on local government structures at regional, county and sub-county levels.  The local government sector is a willing and able partner in this agenda and recognises that public sector transformation is an integral part of the solution to Ireland&rsquo;s current economic problems.  In this context, greater coherence and synergy between different levels of Government and the public service are fundamental to more efficient and effective operation.  My Department and the local government sector are working closely together to advance broad public service initiatives for a more integrated public service which can achieve better value for money and enhanced customer service.</P><Col N="538"/>
        <P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Bill 2011 is a short and straightforward legislative instrument.  The Bill establishes a new funding source for local authorities.  The revenue stream to which it will potentially give rise is significant, at &euro;160 million annually.  It builds on the experience of the charge on non-principal private residences and further broadens the revenue base of local authorities.  Household charges raised nationally will be put to good use locally in providing the wide range of local authority services that the public needs and expects.  The household charge is an interim measure and it will be replaced by a full property tax in due course.  The Government has decided that an expert interdepartmental group will be established in the new year to consider the approach to the full property tax and report back to me by the middle of 2012.</P>
        <P>No Government wants to be in the position of having to introduce new taxes or charges on a public that has been subject to austerity measures over recent budgets.  We are in a difficult financial situation and we have to take the necessary action.  The household charge is one of the steps along the path to economic recovery.  It is also required under the EU-IMF programme of financial support, a programme entered into by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.  The legislative measures in the Bill give effect to one of the major requirements of the EU-IMF programme.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputies for their co-operation in facilitating early consideration of the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>

	<P>Fifteen minutes, ten and five, however we are going.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would say at the outset that there is a problem with statements and announcements coming out of the Minister&rsquo;s Department and I will give him two examples.  The publication of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill providing for a registration charge and monitoring of septic tanks was not accompanied by any public announcement until the Department was contacted about it.  Second, this legislation, the Local Government (Household Charges) Bill, was published in the middle of the budget speech of either the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The day before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is responsible for that but he is at the top of the food chain within the Department.  There seems to be something of a trend starting here, that highly contentious and unpopular taxing measures on the public are being announced at inconvenient times with the result that we are not allowed an oppor<Col N="539"/>tunity to respond adequately in the correct forum.  The Minister might acknowledge that and take it on board for some of the other measures that are coming down the tracks.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the EU-IMF agreement, the memorandum of understanding and the four year plan entered into by the previous Government.  It is worthwhile reminding him that when in opposition, both he and the Government parties opposed the four year plan tooth and nail.  With might and mane, they voted against it and they articulated against it at every opportunity.  Now the Minister finds himself in the opposite position where he is cheerleading it.</P>
        <P>It is worth reminding the Minister that the four year plan was based on a deficit reduction to 2014, and that is now stretched out to 2015.  It could be argued with a degree of legitimacy that many of the measures which were included in the four year plan are no longer relevant and do not have to be met within the timeframe indicated because the Government dragged them out to 2015.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also noteworthy that my party, and I am sure the Minister, and all of the other political parties within the Oireachtas, have met the troika.  The troika is at pains on every occasion we meet to tell us that once the bottom line adjustments are made over the intervening years to bring the deficit down to 3% of GDP by 2015, it does not mind how they are made.  It is my party&rsquo;s contention that the household charge is not the correct way to proceed at this point in time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My party is opposing this legislation on the basis upon which it is presented unless it is significantly amended to provide for additional waivers and exemptions to the many hard-pressed citizens and communities across Ireland.  The Bill, as presented, does not provide for enough exemptions.</P>
        <P>As a party, Fianna F&aacute;il recognises the principles of property tax and of broadening the tax base, but the household tax, in its current form, with the limited number of exemptions and waivers, is highly regressive and a blunt instrument.  There is no logic in levying the same amount of property tax on a person living in Ailesbury Road as on a person locked into an apartment in Adamstown or a person living on an island off the west coast.  We need a fundamentally different approach and to take a step back.  We need to consider the charge in a constructive manner along the lines mooted in respect of a site valuation tax.</P>
        <P>The Minister said he hopes to raise &euro;160 million.  Last week, he was representing us at a completely different forum, namely, the climate change conference in Durban.  When the budget was presented last week, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said the household charge would raise &euro;100 million.  It has been mooted consistently that the charge will raise &euro;160 million, which is to be ring-fenced for local authorities.  When the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government gets a chance, he might consult the Minister for Finance and clarify the matter.  Late last week, the environment correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, Treacy Hogan, a fairly reputable and up-to-date environment journalist, rightly pointed out the discrepancy because &euro;60 million is not insignificant.  The Minister for Finance has one take on the matter and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is flagging a different sum of money.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government referred to the NPPR charge.  His last point, that somebody paying the NPPR charge will be subject to a charge of &euro;10 if paying over the counter, is completely ridiculous.  That a person who presents himself at a local authority to conduct a face-to-face transaction, rather than posting a money order or cheque, will be subject to a surcharge of &euro;10 is completely ridiculous.  I cannot see the logic.  The Minister is effectively saying he does not want over-the-counter transactions or human interaction.</P><Col N="540"/>
        <P>With regard to the principle of applying the household charge to properties that are already subject to the NPPR charge, there is a fundamental injustice.  The same person is being taxed twice on the same property.  That is inherently unfair and will have to be teased out a little further on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister is well aware of the debate on pre-1963 units at the time of the introduction of the NPPR charge.  I refer to the properties divided into multiple bedsits, all of which are liable to the charge.  It is likely they will also be liable to the &euro;100 household tax although the entire property will be held under a single Land Registry folio number.  The Minister&rsquo;s party took this up during the debate on the NPPR charge and was against it.  Now that it is in government, it is not against it although it is in a position to do something about it.  This represents an inherent contradiction.</P>
        <P>At the time of the NPPR charge debate, the then Minister, Mr. John Gormley, informed the House that the NPPR charge would be allowable against rental income as a business expense.  People took him at face value.  The Revenue Commissioners, which have taken a decision on the matter, are now disallowing it.  What is the position on the household charge?  Will it be allowable as a business expense?  We want clarity on it.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated he has created a number of categories of exemptions and waivers.  They are pretty limited and we have an issue with this.  Will the Minister expand on the waivers as opposed to exemptions?  He mentioned that people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement will be entitled to a waiver and also those who live in a unit listed in a published schedule of unfinished housing estates.  Will a waiver be partial or in the order of 100%?  Will there be various categories in that some people will get a waiver of 50%, 60% or 70%?  Will the Minister enlighten us on that when he can?</P>
        <P>We will be tabling a number of amendments along the lines of those introduced in the Seanad.  We have an issue with increasing the charge to reflect increases in the consumer price index.  We feel any increase should require legislation in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The categories of persons in respect of whom exemptions and waivers should be expanded further include persons who hold a medical card.  We tangled with the people who held medical cards and paid the price for it.  There are those who rightly qualify for medical cards and my party believes a person who holds a full medical card should not be paying the household charge.  People on social welfare, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, supplementary welfare allowance, the family income supplement and farm assist payments should also be entitled to an exemption from the payment of the household charge.  Old age pensioners, many of whom are medical card holders, are being made pay the charge.  They are in their twilight years, in retirement, and have made their contribution to the State.  Many of them retired with no private pensions whatsoever and live only on the State pension.  They should, therefore, also be exempted, as should those on the disability allowance, disability benefit and the blind pension.</P>
        <P>The Minister created an exemption for people on mortgage interest supplement.  The budget last week tightened up on this so the category of people affected is being squeezed.  We feel the Government, which has not acted yet on the Keane report, should exempt people who are in mortgage arrears and those in negative equity.  I refer also to those who can show, through independent certification, that they have not been able to make 75% of their mortgage repayments, or who can show, again through independent certification, that their property is worth less than 75% of its market value at the time of purchase &mdash; in other words, that they are in negative equity.  These people should also be exempted.</P><Col N="541"/>
        <P>I want clarity on shared ownership.  I do not know whether the Minister mentioned it in his speech.</P>
        <P>We want to see an exemption for households suffering on foot of the pyrite issue.  This is a very topical issue.  It is not one that affects my constituency, thankfully, but it affects many houses in the greater Dublin area.  There was a commitment made by the Government parties, namely, the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, to deal with that issue comprehensively.  An exemption would recognise the problems faced by the affected householders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was rightly stated that the budget was distinctly anti-rural.</P>
        <P>The Minister should consider giving rural dwellers who will have to pay &euro;50 registration charge for septic tanks an annualised offset of &euro;10 against the household charge to redress the imbalance we are creating for rural dwellers.  This will allow him to answer the charge that he is anti-rural.</P>
        <P>This budget has been exceptionally anti-rural.  The Government is discriminating against rural communities with its cuts for small schools, school transport, rural Garda stations and the changes to the family income supplement, disadvantaged area payments and farm assist.  The household charge will impact further on rural society.</P>
        <P>The Minister is a practical politician&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister described this Bill as short and straightforward.  He is correct in so far as he is putting his hands straight into the pocket of the people he took money from last week.  I expected that the legislation would be parked.  He referred to the fact that the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government signed up to the EU-IMF deal but much has changed in the interim.  Given that the Government has renegotiated the deal, last week&rsquo;s budget is its own work.</P>

	<P>The Minister should read the book because I never saw anyone getting into bed with bureaucracy with such speed.  That is what this Bill and the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011 are about.  As he is doing exactly what it says in the book, the bureaucrats should be happy with him for abandoning his practical approach to politics and taking to the comfort zone of doing what they say.</P>
        <P>He mentioned 6,500 staff posts in local authorities.  Similarly, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform regularly equates reform to the loss of 37,000 people in the public service when he should be changing the entire ethos of government.  That is where the efficiencies will be achieved.</P>

Why not reform the structures of local government to put a more efficient system in place so that he does not have to take more money from the same people?

      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">He is taking this &euro;160 million from the same people who were hit by the last budget.  In regard to the amendments being made to the Bill, the tax on second houses is not the best example.  That tax was not fully understood, with the result that some were caught with penalties.  A lady from my constituency who had a second house but had to move for work purposes was hit with a fine of &euro;1,500.  It is impossible to get relief or compassion from the system.  If this Bill follows the same route, it will exclude a significant number of people who, out of hardship, cannot explain their case.  It is ridiculous to impose a charge of &euro;10 on those who want to pay their bills.  Any enterprise in this country would be happy to take cash from a customer but the local authorities, which are top heavy, inefficient and targeted for reform by the McCarthy report, will be allowed to impose a further &euro;10 on those who are trying to make ends meet.</P>
        <P>Given the hardship that householders are experiencing, &euro;100 is a significant amount of money.  Deputy Collins and the Minister have tabled amendments to exclude certain categories.  By excluding so many, the Minister will be taking more from already hard-pressed mortgage holders who are probably in negative equity.  They could be landlords with second houses.  Does he think landlords will pay this tax without attempting to pass it on to their tenants?  They are probably in negative equity and are failing to meet their monthly mortgage repayments.  We are imposing another tax without considering the potential impact of what appears to us a small amount of money for people who cannot manage it.</P><Col N="543"/>
        <P>Given the Government&rsquo;s majority, this Bill will undoubtedly pass but I ask the Minister to put reforming local government at the top of his agenda and this imposition on householders last.  He should consider whether the exemptions that have been suggested will work and determine who is being penalised and by how much.  He has introduced various changes to the tax on second houses under section 19 of the Bill.  The application of the tax in respect of the rental accommodation scheme is being reversed.</P>
        <P>I ask him to allow people to argue their case with local authorities.  If he serious about collecting and disbursing this money, he should strike a balance between local authorities with different population sizes by giving them a lump sum they can spend at their own discretion.  Let us take at least a small step towards reforming local government with this Bill by allowing them to make decisions for themselves.</P>
        <P>In terms of paying the tax online, something has to be done so that people who are too poor to own the necessary technology or do not understand how to do their business that way are not penalised.</P>

	<P>The Minister and Deputy McGuinness were good friends for a while, but I hear they are going to fall out on this one.  We could use many different words and moods to describe the Minister, but he said this would be a short and straightforward Bill.  There is nothing short about it, although it is straightforward and direct.  It is penalising ordinary householders &mdash; the people who went out and built their houses, maintained them and did not go knocking on the Minister&rsquo;s door or other doors looking for houses.  They are the doers and the achievers, those who went out and did all they could.  They are the people who are being penalised again here.  The Minister blames the EU-IMF and the troika, but that has gone out the window.  This is the Minister&rsquo;s budget, not that of John Gormley or any of the old Ministers.  It is this Government that has introduced these cruel charges.  I am glad his backbenchers, some of the Labour Party backbenchers and, moreover, the Government&rsquo;s county councillors around the country have allowed him the silly season to take the Water Services (Amendment) Bill off the agenda and regroup.  They want to rethink and try to bring the Minister into line.  It was a septic Bill, becoming more septic by the hour, and the Minister was not able to handle it.  That is the real reason.  It is not a shortage of time.  The Taoiseach was telling us we could have extra time tomorrow and the day after to discuss what we are discussing today.</P>

	<P>The Minister brought it back because he got frightened.  The Minister is a big man &mdash; I described him before as Big Phil &mdash; but he was a coward when it came to that, because it was a cowardly act.  This Bill is also a cowardly act.  It is hitting people below the belt, and it is unfair, mean and lousy.  We are going down in a minute to launch a book by the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, about his time in sport and his sporting prowess.  I wonder what kind of a book we will be writing about you, and what kind of book will we have to launch when your time is ended here.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The seating arrangements are difficult where I am sitting, but I will address the Chair.  Anyway, I wish the Minister well in politics.  He has been in it a lot longer than I have.  He is a practical man from a neighbouring constituency to mine.  He used to be practical and he used to listen to the people, empathise with them and work for them, but that has all changed.  When Fine Gael Party Deputies were here on this side for the past 14 years, it seemed there was nothing they would not have done for the people if it were not for the chastity belt that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the others were putting them into.  Now they are in Government and they think they have <i>carte blanche</i> to do what they like.  The officials are running the show, not Minister Big Phil, as I call him.  He is not running it.  I know he was out in Zambia or somewhere last week.  I do not know what he was looking at, but I hope he was looking at holes in the ground out there to see what kind of septic systems they have.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>They have none.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>None the less, he was out there.  Then he came back today and withdrew the Water Services (Amendment) Bill, and rightly so.  He should also withdraw the Bill we are discussing, because it is a disgraceful attack on law-abiding citizens with threats of law.  What is it all for?  Is it to keep a bureaucratic system of local government in place?  When I joined the county council in the 1990s, there was a county manager, a county engineer, a county secretary and a few other engineers; now there is a plethora of officials.  It was the previous Government that did this, not the current Minister, but the Fine Gael Party did not object to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>We did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a huge system, top-heavy with officials &mdash; not the ordinary people who are doing the work on the ground.  There are no men with shovels on the ground.  We will pay these charges, but roads and sewer systems are being neglected &mdash; everything is being neglected.  The briars are meeting you up the boreens.  They have done away with the local improvement schemes and everything that was in any way good to prop up a system that is an abject failure and that is top-heavy with officialdom.  They have lost out on the fees and charges they were getting from planning permissions.  Last week in Tipperary there were seven planning permissions in seven days.  That gravy train is gone, and now the Minister wants to give the local councils this system.  He wants to screw the ordinary people to keep the fat cats in jobs.  These are the people who are avoiding the pension levy &mdash; the directors and senior management, not the ordinary people earning less than &euro;100,000, the ordinary workers on the ground, or the clerical officers who do a decent day&rsquo;s work for a decent day&rsquo;s pay.  I am talking about the top people who have credit cards.  I will table a parliamentary question to ask the Minister how many credit cards each county council has given to its managers and directors of services.  It is a gravy train at the expense of the ordinary people.</P>
        <P>The ordinary people are tired of this.  I thought the Minister would know that because he lives among the ordinary people.  What is it they say?  Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  As I said before to the Minister, it took the Government members only a number of months to become arrogant and start attacks on the people, while it took the last Government ten or 12 years.  They are good learners and they are fast runners, but they will not be fast enough to run from the people&rsquo;s wrath on this, because they will not accept it.</P><Col N="545"/>
        <P>To return to the septic tank charges, people will not register.  I do not advocate disobedience, but they will not register, and I doubt they will pay this charge either.  The Minister has added a punishment to the Bill &mdash; he will charge people extra if they do not pay.  I am in business and so are many others in this House.  Most business people throw out a carrot at this time of year to persuade people to buy their products &mdash; two for the price of one, or whatever.  Even when buying an Aero bar, one gets two for a euro now.  What is the Minister doing?  If people do not pay on time, he wants &euro;10 extra.  This is because it is planned by bureaucrats who do not have a clue about how people have to live.  They think they can add on more, and add interest on top of interest, instead of offering a carrot to people to come with them along the road and support these so-called reforms.</P>
        <P>The people were promised reforms, but they got nothing but deforms.  It is an abuse of the people, of the electorate and of the system of government we have.  It will not last.  The honeymoon is over.  It is the Government&rsquo;s budget and the Government&rsquo;s choices, and its members will have to stand up and face the music now.  The Minister will have to go back to Kilkenny and face the people at the weekend and the following weekend.  Kilkenny might beat us in the All-Ireland final, but the Minister will not beat the people with this kind of regressive, penal legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Ferris and Doherty.  I have to follow that Tipperary performance.</P>
        <P>The first thing about this Bill is that it is coming hot on the heels of the budget, which was described to me by constituents last week as being the worst kind of Christmas present they could have received.  People are facing into difficult circumstances, with a plethora of costs and budget cuts.  The liability date for this new charge is 1 January &mdash; the new year.  If the budget was a bad Christmas present, this will really be a disappointing new year for people.</P>
        <P>To introduce a Bill of this nature and force it through by tomorrow is clearly undemocratic.  The Bill would more appropriately be entitled the bank bailout Bill, as it has little to do with raising finance for local authorities and more to do with bailing out banks and unguaranteed bondholders, as I will explain in a minute.</P>
        <P>To put it in perspective, the Government has slashed the Local Government Fund by a massive 84% and expects the public to come up with &euro;160 million to fund services at local government level.  This makes no economic sense.  It is both political and economic piracy.  This cut will bankrupt local authorities.  Councils are struggling to fund services.  In recent years, councils, under pressure from the commercial sector, have had to reduce commercial rates, and this has naturally had a negative effect on the funds raised.  Here in Dublin, the largest local authority in the country has been forced to sell off its waste collection services.  This is despite the lack of proper national legislation to regulate the industry and protect the public from unscrupulous waste collection companies.  The sale was carried out by Dublin City Council to raise funds to allow it to keep functioning.  This unilateral decision was made by the management despite the democratic wishes of the elected councillors.  In fact, on three separate occasions, a majority of Dublin city councillors supported a Sinn F&eacute;in motion opposing the sell-off of this essential service.  It is ironic that although this motion received support from Labour Party councillors at Dublin City Council, here in the House, the Labour Party in Government is involved in an unprecedented attack on local government.</P>
        <P>We in Sinn F&eacute;in believe in local government despite its many shortcomings.  We believe it should be improved and that it should be strong, democratic and accountable.  Local government is strengthened when it has sufficient funds and its councillors can make real decisions and are held accountable by the public for the decisions they make.  This Bill achieves none of <Col N="546"/>that.  In fact, it fails to deal with the democratic deficit in local government.  If it is passed, it will make local government financially weaker and undermine our overstretched public services.</P>
        <P>We also believe that cutbacks need to be made.  We know savings must be made, but this Bill takes the age-old lazy option of introducing a regressive flat tax on households.  Thatcher called it the poll tax.  If we are to address the waste, let us start at the top and make those who can afford it pay the costs.  A quick look at the pay scales of city and county managers would clearly highlight where the real cuts should be made to local government.  Top of the league is the Dublin city manager on &euro;189,000, followed by the Cork county manager, Fingal county manager and south Dublin county manager on &euro;162,000 each.  Not far behind are the managers of Cork city and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown on &euro;154,000 and the Limerick city manager on &euro;142,000, while the Waterford and Galway managers can expect to earn &euro;132,000.  All of these managers will be paying the same household charge as somebody on the new disability allowance following the cut last week.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a desperate attempt by the Government to shift money from local government into the banks.  Local government must be financed by a progressive taxation and rates system.  We have argued for changes in the rates system to provide for an income based clause for businesses.  The Bill exposes the myth that we live in a low tax economy, which has been promoted for years by consecutive Governments.  This mantra is used every time charges are introduced for health care, education and public services, including water and bin charges.  Various Government Ministers and their allies have told us over the years that to keep taxes down, it is necessary to pay more.  That is a contradiction.  Again, in the recent budget the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party Government said it must keep taxes down so it was necessary to get the public to pay for services that have already been paid for in those taxes.</P>
        <P>The public that is being asked to pay &euro;100 to local government will be paying the same amount of income tax next month as it paid this month.  There is no reduction in taxes, just more hard earned money being spent on essential services.  Of course, the rank hypocrisy does not stop there.  When one studies the detail of the Bill, it is clear from section 2 that a person who has a bedsit behind their house, for example, a granny flat, will pay the same rate as somebody living in a &euro;5 million mansion.  Where is the sense or the justice in that, unless one is sitting on the Government benches and wants somebody who owns a bedsit to pay the same for local government services?  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a wealth tax in its budget proposals.  In regard to residential properties, this would only apply to houses worth more than &euro;1.2 million.  That is fairer.</P>
        <P>The Minister has claimed this is a temporary measure until the Government can introduce a more progressive property tax.  We would welcome a real debate about funding for local government based on progressive politics.  However, there is no provision in the Bill for a temporary charge or a commitment that it is being introduced on a temporary basis.  That will be our first proposed amendment to the Bill.  We want a commitment in black and white that this Bill will be temporary.  The sooner the Bill is history, the better.</P>
        <P>There is no attempt to conceal the Government&rsquo;s contempt for ordinary people.  Nowhere in the Bill is there a waiver for people on social welfare.  A list of waivers was quoted by the Minister in his speech but it did not address any of the issues.  Last Tuesday, this heartless Government cut &euro;88 from the disability allowance for young people and reduced the fuel allowance for everybody, including the elderly.  This week the Government is asking people to pay up another &euro;100 for local services.  The Bill will criminalise people for not being able to pay.  It states that where a person is convicted of an offence under the Bill, the court shall order the person to pay the relevant costs and expenses, measured by the court, incurred by the relevant local authority.  In other words, the person who cannot afford the household charge <Col N="547"/>will be brought to court and if found guilty will have to pay the court costs of the local council that brought them to court.  There is also provision for fines of up to &euro;2,500.</P>
        <P>Normally in this country, a person&rsquo;s debts die when they die.  They do not bring their debts with them in the coffin.  Under this Bill, people will be followed to the grave and after that their estate will be pursued for this.  It is outrageous that the Minister is chasing people to the graveyards for it.</P>
        <P>Every provision in the Bill attempts to punish ordinary people for mistakes that were not of their making.  The charge is being introduced in the same week the Government tried to force through the water services Bill.  I only heard two hours ago the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that he will hold back on the septic tank Bill until after Christmas.  Under that Bill, householders are being asked yet again to bail out the Government for the sins of consecutive Governments.  Town halls throughout the country have been filled with ordinary people voicing their objections to the septic tank Bill, including last Friday night in Kerry.  Now these people are being hit with a household charge as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>A private well is okay so Deputy Ferris need not worry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>The anger at these charges is palpable.  People are being hit daily with extra charges but no extra services.  People who worked hard and paid their taxes, including the people who paid taxes of 60% and more in previous bad times to ensure services would be provided, are being asked to dig deeper and pay more for the same services they have been receiving.  This does not add up.  People know when they are being taken for a ride and being punished for others.  Sinn F&eacute;in will campaign at every step against this regressive charge and ensure it is overturned.  We will use every opportunity during the debates this week and next year to ensure it is consigned to the dustbin of history.</P>
        <P>How dare the Government suck the oxygen of funding from local government and expect ordinary people to breathe it back in?  I believe people will simply not pay.  The household charge will not be paid because people cannot afford it.  It is unjust and they see it as such.  It should be withdrawn before it brings the Government into conflict with its communities.  Regardless of what is said in this debate, people have made up their minds.  There is a line in the sand they will not cross.  Households will not pay this charge and the Government can make every threat it wishes to in the Bill.  It can threaten courts, fines and escalating costs, but I believe people will simply withhold payment.</P>
        <P>The Government is depending on 100% payment of this charge to compensate for the 84% cut in its contribution to the local government fund.  The cut is &euro;165 million and the Minister has earmarked &euro;160 million from this charge to make up the shortfall.  I do not believe it will happen.  It is an exercise in self-delusion.  From where will the balance come?  If there is a 90% non-payment rate, we will have the ridiculous situation of the Minister trying to divide &euro;16 million between all the local authorities in the State.  Even if 50% of the population does not pay, it will reduce the amount to be divided among the local authorities by &euro;80 million.  Local authorities need the local government fund in 2012.  Even with the best will in the world, the household charge will not compensate for the cut made by the Government.</P>
        <P>We opposed the bin charges when they were introduced.  We said at the time that the charges were the first step towards the privatisation of domestic waste collection.  We were right.  I predict that if this Bill is passed, it will be the thin end of a very thick wedge.  Households will first be forced to pay the &euro;100, and the cost will increase over time to perhaps &euro;500, &euro;600 or &euro;700.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, the Bill is, at best, ill thought through.  It is a blunt instrument to punish households.  It is another measure to force householders to make up the shortfall in the State&rsquo;s <Col N="548"/>funding, as a result of money being sucked out to pay the interest on bank debts.  At worst, it is an attempt to use the current economic crisis as a smokescreen to bury local democracy further.  Either way, we will lead the opposition to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>The most insidious aspect of the household charge is that it is being imposed as part of the IMF-EU deal which underlies the welding of the bank debt to the sovereign debt.  When people find themselves in difficulty with this &mdash; for some it will be the straw that breaks the camel&rsquo;s back &mdash; they can at least have the satisfaction of knowing that somewhere a major bondholder will sleep easier in their bed at night.</P>
        <P>Indeed, if we want to know what else is coming down the track all we need do is read the IMF-EU memorandum of understanding rather than bother with the programme for Government.  The programme for Government means nothing.  The memorandum of understanding determines what will happen.  The memorandum of understanding with the EU and IMF commits Ireland to the introduction of a property tax for 2012 and to an increase in the property tax for 2013.  At least we cannot be fooled into believing that these are temporary measures or that they will not be increased.  The household charge is only a holding device prior to the introduction of a full scale property tax which the Government has committed to introducing this time next year at the latest.</P>
        <P>I referred to reading the original memorandum of understanding because there was an attempted sleight of hand when the updated and ironically named stability programme was published last April.  It refers several times to the alleged independence of the Irish Government in deciding what to do in order to ensure the debt is repaid.  Many believe it cannot be repaid but we can happily destroy the country in the process of trying.</P>
        <P>It is a bit like when one owes Tony Soprano money and he gives one the choice of burning down one&rsquo;s house and claiming the insurance money or stopping feeding the children.  Like the IMF and Goldman Sachs, the Sopranos are not fussy as long as one pays them back.</P>
        <P>Page 21 of the updated stability programme states: &ldquo;Of course policy is a matter for Government.&rdquo;  That is total and absolute nonsense.  The only matter which the Irish State currently decides is where exactly to implement the massive cuts that we witnessed last week.  The overall strategy is decided by the IMF and the EU and, as I said, the programme for that is laid down in the original memorandum of understanding.</P>
        <P>The Minister admitted the household charge was necessitated by the IMF-EU programme of austerity, yet the Government would also claim that it is still a free agent.  At least the T&aacute;naiste had the good grace to abandon quickly his bravado of stating that it was either Frankfurt&rsquo;s way or Labour&rsquo;s way.  He had his chest out and shouted that prior to the election.  Frankfurt&rsquo;s way is Labour&rsquo;s way, as we have seen.</P>
        <P>There is also the claim that the charge is needed to pay for local services.  It is, but only because the State has stopped funding those services out of overall revenue.  People&rsquo;s taxes will not be reduced and this charge and the coming property tax constitute an extra tax with no extra or improved services.  Services are actually declining.  The overall impact of the austerity programme and other measures will ensure that the level of public provision, through local services and the overall public service, will continue to decline.</P>
        <P>People are being hit both ways.  They are paying more for less.  The assault on people&rsquo;s pockets and quality of life is being justified on the basis that the austerity programme is required to ensure there are teachers, nurses and garda&iacute;.  Of course we all know that is nonsense.  We may have to borrow to pay for services but we always have, at least since 1932 with <Col N="549"/>the first Fine Gael Government, which had a similar attachment to looking after banks and not providing public services.</P>
        <P>This is not about paying for public services.  It is about paying the bank debt.  That is why we have the IMF and this new double form of taxation, one my party will strongly oppose.</P>
        <P>Deputy Stanley mentioned public meetings taking place all over the country in opposition to the septic tanks charge.  I attended a meeting in Listowel last Friday night where over 400 ordinary citizens who will be directly affected by the tax turned up.  It was obvious that despite the invitation neither Government Deputy turned up.  That is an indication of how fearful they are about facing the public because their constant U-turns on their pre-election promises are being exposed.</P>
        <P>Septic tanks will have to be upgraded to complement the terms of the regulation.  People who got planning permission between 1975 and now have done nothing whatsoever to undermine it and have complied with it, but will now be expected to put a lot of money into septic tanks to update them to comply with the requirements.  The regulation was in place in 1975 but was not implemented.  The ordinary public will have to pay for it.  It is an absolute disgrace.</P>
        <P>People right across the country will refuse to pay.  Deputy Mattie McGrath has said he will lead a campaign to refuse to pay the charge.  Genuine political leaders of political parties who are concerned about the poor and the rights and entitlements of ordinary decent citizens will be with people opposing the terrible austerity measures that have been brought about by the Government.</P>

        <P>It is absolutely amazing &mdash; that may be too strong a word given what we have seen the Government is capable of &mdash; that the Government is introducing such a Bill.  It is calling the charge property tax but it is more like a poverty tax.  It is a tax that impacts on 1.6 million households throughout the State without taking into account that many of those households are living in poverty.  It ignores the fact that many families have in recent days, as the cold weather set in, had to go to supermarkets and petrol stations to purchase home heating oil in gallon or five-gallon drums.  It does not acknowledge that more people than ever are seeking assistance from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or visiting charity shops in search of a small bargain to provide for their children at this special time of year.  It ignores the fact that many people will go without because they cannot afford to pay the charge.</P>
        <P>I do not claim any monopoly on wisdom or compassion, but people have come to me &mdash; as I am sure they have come to other Members &mdash; and produced, in table format, a statement of their income and expenditure.  There is nothing more to give.  It is simply a matter of feeding themselves, keeping their home warm and paying the mortgage.  For many, it is about staying above the parapet or threshold below which they will begin to suffocate.  Yet this Bill proposes that regardless of how difficult one&rsquo;s personal circumstances, one must give more.  The wealthiest person in the State, living in a mansion without a care in the world, will pay the same &euro;100 as the person in deep economic distress.  We have all read the letter in the national newspapers from the person who had nothing to feed his children but cereal.  People like that will face the same obligation as the wealthiest people in the land.  There is nothing fair about it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s spokesman on finance, I have presented the Government with a range of options which would secure the deficit reduction target the Government has set for itself under the EU-IMF programme.  We are not opposed to asking those who can afford to pay more tax to do so.  However, we are opposed to an entirely unfair flat-rate tax which impacts most strongly on those who are most needy.  All of the other Ministers and Government Deputies who, excepting the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, did not bother to attend the Chamber for this debate should hang their heads in shame.  Have they no understanding of what people are enduring?  I am sure it is not just in Donegal South-West that one sees houses where Corn Flakes packages are stuffed in door jambs or cardboard boxes placed under the window sills in children&rsquo;s bedrooms in an effort to keep out the draught.  Such measures are necessary because of the cuts in supports imposed by the previous Government.  Grants are no longer available from local authorities to assist people in replacing their windows and doors.</P>
        <P>This Government is continuing along the same line.  In this instance, it is asking large numbers of people to pay a charge they simply cannot afford.  There is a moral question as to whether they should be asked to pay it in the first instance given that this money will not be used to assist <Col N="551"/>the most disadvantaged people in the State but rather to assist people with no disadvantage in other states.  On 25 January 2012, unguaranteed, unsecured bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank will be paid &euro;1.25 billion.  That one cheque, on that one day, would pay the household charge for 1.6 million households for the next ten years.</P>
        <P>It is all about choices.  The Government cannot blame the EU-IMF for having to introduce this legislation.  I have listened to Fianna F&aacute;il Party Members jumping up and down and getting hot under the collar about the household charge.  We all know that if they were still on the other side of the House they would introduce the exact same legislation, because there is no difference between the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael parties.  Nor it seems is there any difference between either of them and the Labour Party.  The reality is that there is no requirement from the EU and IMF to introduce this charge.  My party has met with representatives of the troika and what they are interested in is the headline figure.  They want to see the deficit reduced by the specified amount.  It matters nothing to them whether the Government takes &euro;160 million in the form of a household charge or from some other area.</P>
        <P>If the Government wishes to tax property, it should look to the legacy property reliefs still in existence.  These are the allowances which fuelled the Celtic tiger, made many people millionaires and lumped the ensuing debts on our shoulders.  The abolition of these reliefs would bring in twice as much as will be brought in through the proposed household charge.</P>
        <P>I was listening to a programme on my local radio station, Highland Radio, in the car earlier today in which callers stated their intent not to pay the charge.  I applaud anybody who cannot afford to pay it who refuses to do so.  People should not have to make a choice between meeting this regressive charge and feeding their children, putting clothes on their backs or heating their homes.  They are doing the right thing in refusing to pay if they cannot afford to do so.</P>
        <P>I was particularly struck by one caller, a man of 87 years of age with a fantastic voice that was full of compassion.  This individual is disabled and confined full-time to a chair, and he is genuinely worried about this charge and about his ability to pay it.  The presenter, Shaun Doherty, who is also a very compassionate person, sought to reassure the man that he would surely be exempt on the basis that he is in receipt of disability allowance and so on.  The reality, however, is that this person is not exempt.  That 87 year old should not be worrying about what the Government is proposing in this Chamber tonight.  I do not know what this man&rsquo;s life was like, but it is not right that the Government should impose this burden and worry on him.  People like him are being levied under this unfair tax despite the many options available to the Government to do otherwise.  Shame on it for its unwillingness to take any of those options.</P>

	<P>This Bill is similar in nature to the budget in that it lacks fairness.  The Minister said this evening that those who are in a vulnerable position in society will be protected under its provisions.  I attended a meeting in Wexford last night at which this measure was discussed and where I met many people who are not confident this will be the case.  The Minister was also keen to emphasise the implications of a refusal to pay.  People in this country are already frightened enough; there is no need to frighten them any further.  It will look strange if judges are penalising ordinary people who cannot afford this charge when there is no record of any banker being fined.  I recall being in court one day and seeing a woman who had stolen a pair of shoes from a large store, for which she was sentenced to three months in jail.  However, if one manages to steal millions, it is called big business.</P><Col N="552"/>
        <P>The household charge is a form of indirect taxation.  Such taxes are unfair because they take no account of a person&rsquo;s capacity to pay.  Unfortunately, this State has one of the lowest levels of direct taxation in Europe but one of the highest levels of indirect taxation.  A recent report by TASC showed that the increase in the VAT rate to 21% absorbed 16% of the income of the less well-off, while the corresponding figure for those who are better off was 6%.  Yet the budget increased the higher rate of VAT by two percentage points to 23%, thus increasing the disproportionate burden on those who are least well off.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach told us in his address to the nation that the Government would give people certainty by imposing no increases in income taxes.  If one is making &euro;600 per week and an increase in income tax leaves one with &euro;540 or &euro;550, there is a certainty in that.  It might not be fair, but it is certain.  When indirect taxation, such as VAT increases, there is more uncertainty because one cannot measure one&rsquo;s costs.  The household charge is another unfair measure.  In 2008, this country collected more money in indirect taxation than in direct taxation.  It was screaming out to any fair-minded person that introducing a tax band of 55% for those earning over &euro;100,000 would have brought in &euro;750 million.  This is almost equal to the figure of the social welfare cuts.  I do not think those earning over &euro;100,000 would be screaming if they had to pay a bit more tax on what they earn above &euro;100,000.  However, our Government has chosen to do things differently.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The ability to pay is a significant aspect of this household charge.  The unemployment rate is 14.5% and the rate of long-term unemployment is 56%.  People have to deal with household and credit card debt.  There is no protection for pensioners and their fuel allowance has been cut.  I am flabbergasted at the Government.  I do not normally quote what has been said by the Government.  One year ago, the Fine Gael Party recognised the need to raise more revenue from property &ldquo;if we are to minimise the more economically damaging tax increases on jobs, enterprise and consumption&rdquo;.  It further stated: &ldquo;The Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government proposal to introduce a steadily rising annual recurring residential property tax on people&rsquo;s homes is unfair for three reasons.  The initial flat rate charge means that houses in standard neighbourhoods worth a fraction of some mansions would pay the same rate of tax.  It would be difficult for asset-rich but income-poor households to pay, particularly the elderly and the unemployed.  It would be deeply unfair in the case of a young generation that paid exorbitant amounts of stamp duty and VAT on the purchase of over-valued houses, many of whom now find themselves in negative equity.&rdquo;  I ask if this is the same party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is called a household charge but it is a tax which is unfair and which will be quickly seen to be so.  The county council system, established in 1898, has again been placed at the centre of this provision.  The local authority system has suffered through a lack of reform.  It was put in this same position in the early 1980s and irreparable damage was done at that time.  The current funding of local government is provided by the Exchequer and the motor tax fund, which was ring-fenced in recent years.  The quality of the local authority services is diminishing in recent years because funding has been reduced.  The failure of this Government to even articulate the need for radical local government reform will contribute to the questions being asked by people as to what services will be provided by the payment of this tax.</P>
        <P>I presume the equalisation fund will apply to the Local Government Fund in this case.  The household charge will be collected centrally and the Local Government Management Agency will collect it.  A certain element of confusion exists as to how this will operate and which body will send out the bills, but I will not deal with that matter now.  The Local Government Fund included an equalisation grant and while I am not opposed to an aspect of solidarity, in areas <Col N="553"/>of population growth such as the greater Dublin area, including the three surrounding counties, there has not been a fair allocation of services.  For example, County Kerry has twice as many local authority staff as County Meath although its population is smaller.  The same level of service cannot be delivered if the local authority is short-staffed.  This measure will do nothing to address that issue.</P>
        <P>People will ask why they should pay and what they will get in return for payment of the charge.  This is a new property tax; it is a poll tax.  It is fundamentally unfair because it does not differentiate between the ability to pay of a person living in a two-bedroomed apartment who is struggling to pay a mortgage and a person living in a very large home which is mortgage-free.</P>
        <P>The EU-IMF programme did not commit to a household charge but it committed to a property tax.  We need to define what is property.  The view of many people is that they have no choice but to provide themselves with a home as there are few other housing options available.  Many people do not regard their home as being a property.  Stamp duty is a form of property tax which was paid on inflated property prices and this is not being accommodated in the exemptions.  These people do not own property; they own debt and they are being asked to pay a property tax on debt.  The charge of &euro;100 may not seem a lot of money to some people but 15% of the population is at risk of poverty and the charge of &euro;100 will cause serious problems for some families.  The exemptions only apply to those living in local authority or voluntary housing or those who qualify for mortgage interest supplement &mdash; for which only part-time workers qualify &mdash; or living in a defined ghost estate, which might not include NAMA estates.  Everyone else must pay.</P>
        <P>I remember the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1983 because I was in the forefront in the campaign of civil disobedience.  In that period the Offences Against the State Act was invoked and water and refuse collections were denied.  There will come a snapping point and this tax will be it.  There is a big difference between having to make a conscious decision to pay a charge rather than a deduction from pay or from welfare payments.  People will make an active decision which will be to resist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of the local government household charge will only compound the plight of many householders who are already stretched to the limit to exist in any kind of reasonable comfort.  Until the intended property tax levy on households and water tax in 2014, it seems this &euro;100 household charge is only an interim measure.  This charge and its implementation will set the standard for all future charges.  We will certainly face a property tax and a water tax.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes an inequitable tax.  Those living in the very basic and modest homes with low incomes will be forced to pay the same amount as the very wealthy with large homes.  The old adage of the last straw breaking the camel&rsquo;s back comes to mind regarding this charge as the majority of householders can ill afford this further burden on their finances already strained to the very last.  The past four budgets have dealt ordinary people several hammer blows and upwards of &euro;30 billion has been taken out of the economy.  In this deflated and depressed economy, householders are once more being targeted for the crimes of the bankers and speculators and the general mismanagement in governance in this country.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I will share time with Deputies Brendan Smith and John Browne.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies did not take lightly the decision to move this motion on services in rural areas.  In recent years services provided in rural areas at little cost to the State have been steadily eroded.  The budget announced last week contained a large amount of hidden detail on policies and measures that will chip away at the fabric of rural areas and generate considerable long-term costs to the State if they are not reversed.</P>
        <P>The honeymoon for the Government has come to an abrupt end.  The recent budget containing its choices has laid bare the reality of its incompetence and arrogance.  In the course of the budget debate Ministers and other Government Members patted themselves on the back and spoke repeatedly about how the budget announced last year had succeeded in showing the world that Ireland was on the right track in consolidating its budget.  They also pointed out how economic growth had returned while last year&rsquo;s budget was in operation.  It takes a hard neck to make such statements, given that, having voted and campaigned against the budget introduced last year by the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, the coalition parties are now trying to take credit for this work.  In some ways, this is a backhanded compliment to the achievements of the previous Government.  At all times in the past nine months the Government had sufficient numbers to alter or reverse the previous budget introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  Having played to the gallery, it chose not to do so because it knew our policies were bearing long-term fruit.  In the past nine months it has taken few signifi<Col N="555"/>cant decisions and has instead coasted on the back of plans already in place or ready to go because Fianna F&aacute;il did the heavy lifting in last year&rsquo;s budget.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Never before has a Government spent so much time praising itself while doing so little.  In the past week its hypocrisy began to catch up with it, although in fairness it has proved itself adept at leaks, spin and distortion, as it sought to manage expectations, even if this meant scaring the living daylights out of hard pressed families across urban and rural Ireland.  At the end of a long month of leaks and press conferences, we have finally seen how Fine Gael and the Labour Party intend to govern.  They have moved from speaking in vague generalities to taking real decisions.  We must no longer take them at their word and can see in the cold, hard facts what their priorities are.  The Government has made its own choices, for which it is accountable.  Through the mountain of detail and hours of announcements, what has emerged is a deeply unfair and damaging budget which will hit vulnerable citizens and rural areas particularly badly.</P>
        <P>This is the most regressive budget in years.  It will cost jobs, has broken an unprecedented number of promises made only months ago and may lead to a serious shortfall in Government revenues as soon as early next year.  It will not promote recovery but will endanger the achievement of fiscal targets and shift an unfair burden onto groups which are least able to manage.  The single most important element which will create jobs and ease fiscal pressures is overall economic growth.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports the fiscal target set in the budget.  It is a reasonable compromise between the need to achieve a sustainable deficit level and protect the potential for growth in the economy.  My fear arises from the emergence, in the small print of the budget, of a deeply damaging and long-term attack on the sustainability of rural communities.</P>
        <P>Agriculture is a major growth sector of the economy and Government policy must reflect the central part it plays in job creation and food security, as well as its essential role at the heart of rural communities.  These are outlined in the Food Harvest 2020 document produced by my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the previous Government.  Food Harvest 2020 is the blueprint for agriculture and I am pleased it has been accepted as policy by the Government.  These areas are intertwined and while last week&rsquo;s budget contains some positive measures, it fails to recognise the links between rural life and agriculture.</P>
        <P>While the first budget produced by Fine Gael and the Labour Party contains some small positives, for example, on land transfer arrangements, its broad sweep has been harmful to rural areas.  Cuts to the disadvantaged areas scheme and REPS 4 will impact on a wide range of farmers as a result of new criteria.  Reductions under the farm assist scheme will affect the most vulnerable farmers, of whom 11,239 are in receipt of this vital assistance.  Farm assist is a hard fought for scheme introduced more than ten years ago which focuses on farm families with small incomes.  The cuts under the scheme are an especially miserable attack on their income.  Taken together, I fear these changes will, on balance, damage the fabric of agriculture.</P>
        <P>While agriculture is critical, it is not the only ingredient in sustainable rural communities.  It is in the systematic undermining of these communities that the budget does most damage.  For example, phased staffing adjustments in small schools with fewer than five teachers will be devastating in rural areas.  Some 1,500 small schools will suffer from lower standards as a result of a higher pupil-teacher ratio or will be potentially forced to close.  Garda station closures are another attack on primarily rural communities.  Public safety in some 31 communities will be undermined as stations close, with obvious impacts on quality of life in the communities in question.  Knocknagree Garda station in my constituency gives the community a focus on safety and security and covers a vast area.</P><Col N="556"/>
        <P>Septic tank charges and upgrade costs are yet another area in which people living in rural areas are being asked to bear a disproportionate cost.  By demanding that 475,000 septic tank owners pay for this most basic service, the Government has taken a decision to actively discriminate against citizens living in the countryside.  If a charge were introduced for connection to sewerage services in urban areas, city dwellers would correctly protest.  Let no one deny that the septic tank charges and other measures introduced in the budget constitute a serious attack on rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>Everyone knows that VAT returns are the greatest concern to the Exchequer.  They are well behind projections and underlying consumer confidence remains weak.  The overall deficit target will not be met if VAT returns continue to underperform.  The increase in the VAT rate will drive consumers away from already hard pressed shops and impact on jobs in rural areas in which retail outlets are an important source of job creation and sustainability.  We are now in the bizarre position that the Government is making directly contradictory claims about VAT changes in different parts of its budget.  When it was cutting VAT for selected industries in June, it claimed thousands of jobs would result and argued that cutting the VAT rate was the best way to create jobs.  Now that it is front-loading VAT increases of 2% on a much wider range of goods and services, it claims the increase will not have an impact on the economy.  It cannot have it both ways.  This nonsense is undermining the retail sector which needs confidence and support rather than a sucker punch, which is what the increase in VAT will deliver.  The decision to raise VAT is strategically the wrong call.  It was made because Fine Gael was playing politics with the economy and wanted to be able to claim it had left income tax untouched.  Instead of taking the much fairer option of targeting revenue measures at the highest earners, as Fianna F&aacute;il had proposed, the Government decided to rely on increasing the most regressive tax, which is also the tax that is underperforming most.  The measure has introduced a degree of uncertainty in the programme of fiscal consolidation which the Government may come to rue.</P>
        <P>It does not give me any pleasure to point out that the unequivocal net effect of the budget will be the loss of more jobs in urban and rural areas.  A contraction of net employment in 2012 is confirmed in the budget documentation.  This is more of what we heard from the Government when it announced its downgraded jobs budget.  The most recent Central Statistics Office figures, released yesterday, confirmed an annual decrease in employment of 2.5% or 46,000 up to the end of the third quarter of 2011.  Furthermore, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate increased from 14.2% to 14.4% in the most recent quarter.  The raid on pensioners, which produced a net &euro;250 million for the Government&rsquo;s so-called jobs initiative, is failing.  The measures that have been announced to aid the export and construction sector are to be welcomed.  Once again, however, they are being over-spun.  The fact is they are not enough.  The budget documentation shows that the action the Government has taken is so small that it is having no impact on growth or employment.  It is accompanied by an accelerated cut in capital spending.  The &euro;750 million that is being cut is substantially bigger than any stimulus package that was announced in the budget.</P>
        <P>In terms of its social impact, this is by far the most regressive budget for some time.  The spending cuts and tax increases will fall directly and disproportionately on the weaker sections of society and the poorer sections of rural communities.  As a republican party, Fianna F&aacute;il opposes this lack of fairness vehemently.  The disability cuts were hidden until we spotted them on this side of the House, at which point the Government made a U-turn.  We are glad we forced the Government to think again.  We are not clear on whether or how the Government will achieve the savings it claims it can achieve on expenditure on lone parents, child benefit, jobseeker&rsquo;s payments and widow&rsquo;s payments.  In the past few days, it has become clear that <Col N="557"/>those who receive carer&rsquo;s allowance will have their family income supplement cut.  The Government has tweaked the eligibility criteria for this and many other welfare payments.  We did not see any headlines about such choices.</P>
        <P>Like an iceberg, the real danger in this budget is lurking below the waterline.  We have not yet clearly seen the full extent of the Government&rsquo;s assault on the vulnerable.  It will become more apparent as time moves on.  No amount of spin or camouflage can keep the nature of these cuts under wraps forever.  When the leader of the Labour Party was asked during a general election debate what would be his priority in the social justice area if he were elected to government, the current T&aacute;naiste said:</P>
        <P LI="1">I think it would be looking after people with disabilities ...  The first area that Labour in government would address in terms of equality and in terms of giving decent supports to people would be people with disabilities.  I think, as a country, we have to make that the priority.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The leader of Fine Gael, who is now the Taoiseach, responded quickly by saying &ldquo;that is very laudable and I share that.&rdquo;  Their words ring hollow in the aftermath of last week&rsquo;s budget.</P>
        <P>In its pre-budget proposal, Fianna F&aacute;il has shown how the Government can meet its targets while still delivering greater investment in capital projects to create jobs and invest in Ireland&rsquo;s future.  We are proposing that pension funds, in addition to Government funding, should be invested in commercial projects in partnership with the State.  This is a credible and workable alternative to the Government&rsquo;s pension levy.  It is not too late for the Government to change its mind.  Fianna F&aacute;il has set out how budget targets can be met in a fairer way.  The required savings can be delivered by speeding up agreed reforms, focusing tax increases on the highest incomes and driving further efficiencies.</P>
        <P>One in every five Irish homes is experiencing real mortgage difficulty.  It is time for more action to help people in such circumstances.  We have introduced legislation to give practical help to families in debt.  We ask the Government to take it on board.  It should never be forgotten that the banks have a responsibility to our society.  They should lend to businesses and pass on interest rate reductions to home owners.  Many people in rural Ireland, in particular, are employed by small and medium sized companies.  There are not many foreign direct investment companies in my constituency or elsewhere in rural Ireland.  People farm the land or work in the local shop, school, district hospital or Garda station.  None of these areas are safe under this Government.</P>
        <P>The devil was truly in the detail in this budget.  When the education proposals were announced, the cut in the pupil-teacher ratio was hidden deeply in a brief mention of cuts in career guidance counselling services.  The cuts in education will overwhelmingly fall on rural schools.  The disadvantaged schools that have been mentioned are inevitably those within rural schemes.  Some teachers in my constituency have concluded that the needs of rural communities did not enter the Minister&rsquo;s thinking.  All the cuts in the primary pupil-teacher ratio are being confined to schools of four teachers or fewer, most of which are in rural communities.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has added insult to injury &mdash; in case people in rural areas do not feel sufficiently discriminated against &mdash; by doubling school transport charges, which apply to rural areas only.  The cuts in postgraduate courses will also have an impact.</P>
        <P>This Government is making a significant mistake by pursuing these policies.  For many years, decisions have been taken that benefitted urban Ireland.  We have seen what that has cost the State.  The policies being pursued at farmgate level and across rural communities, such as the cut in the local improvement scheme, will damage the fabric of society in rural areas.  Such areas are experiencing substantial depopulation because of the Government&rsquo;s inability to see <Col N="558"/>the benefit of having people working and living in sustainable rural communities.  The Government needs to support the small family farm, which has been the backbone of such communities for generations.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to support the motion that has been moved by my party colleague, Deputy Moynihan.  He has cogently and strongly outlined the issues that are arising from last week&rsquo;s inherently unfair budget.  The 2012 budget contains a series of measures that will have a serious impact on low-income families and vulnerable households throughout the country.  Rural Ireland, in particular, has been penalised in the budget and by broader Government policy.  The Fine Gael-Labour Party Government has singled out rural Ireland for cutbacks across a wide number of areas.  These cutbacks will have a deep impact on parts of the country that have been already badly affected by the recession, as Deputy Moynihan has said.</P>
        <P>Major investment has been made in rural Ireland in the past ten or 15 years.  Money has been allocated to develop schools, child care facilities, public housing, public water and sewerage schemes, rural group water schemes, sporting and recreational facilities and other community facilities.  There are particular attractions to living and working in rural areas.  As we all know, the primary school is a focal point and important centre in each community.  Small communities value their local schools.  Some towns and villages are fortunate to have the privilege of having a second level school.  In the past decade, an important investment has been made to upgrade existing school facilities and to provide new facilities.  The Department&rsquo;s various school building programmes have enhanced considerably the school stock throughout the country.  Those of us who have visited such schools and participated in the official opening of new facilities are conscious of the pride of the local community in such modern facilities.  Local communities have a sense of ownership of their valued educational infrastructure.</P>
        <P>As a representative of two rural counties, I have been aware since budget day of the widespread concern in our communities about the future of local primary schools.  It is putting it mildly to say there is great concern in rural Ireland about the Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce phased adjustments at primary level to the staff schedules of schools of four teachers or fewer.  It is inevitable that this decision will lead to increased pupil-teacher ratio in rural primary schools.  The Department&rsquo;s advice to small rural schools to &ldquo;consider their future&rdquo; and &ldquo;assess their options for amalgamation&rdquo; is a cause of concern to parents with children who attend smaller rural schools.  The Government gave a commitment to protect primary education and the overall pupil-teacher ratio at primary level.  However, it is obvious that phased changes to the staffing schedules in one-teacher, two-teacher, three-teacher and four-teacher schools &mdash; schools with less than 86 pupils &mdash; will be seriously affected by the Government&rsquo;s budget decisions.  There are 3,200 primary schools in the State.  Some 47% of them have five teachers or fewer.  Those figures clearly show the huge impact on small rural schools of the Government&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>Schools need to know if they face amalgamation or closure.  The Minister must clarify the number of schools that will be affected in each county and specify which schools are involved.  I note that schools of the minority religions are concerned about the viability of such schools due to the smaller enrolments they have had over the years.</P>
        <P>I welcomed the commitment shown by the Minister last June when he stated that in considering any policy changes in respect of smaller schools the Department would consider a number of wider dimensions, and not merely the cost of running such small schools.  I ask the Minister to restate that commitment and to outline clearly to us that small rural schools will continue to be a vital part of the educational infrastructure of our country.  In recent years there has <Col N="559"/>been new development in child care facilities in our towns, villages and rural parishes.  In many instances it is the small rural school in the parish or town which offers the after-school child care facilities that are so important for many families and which benefit the children concerned.</P>
        <P>The Minister has yet to publish the value for money review of small schools that was begun by the Department of Education and Skills earlier this year.  It is not acceptable that the Minister should proceed with amalgamations before we see the findings of this review.  I ask him and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, to have the review finalised and published as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In June 2011, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, stated that in considering any policy changes in respect of small schools, the Department of Education and Skills would consider wider dimensions than simply the cost of running such schools.  At the time my party welcomed that commitment.  The Minister stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Among the issues that will need to be taken into account are questions such as availability of diversity of provision, ethos of schools, parental choice, language of instruction, travel distances, transport costs and the impact of schools on dispersed rural communities.  The review will examine the locations of small schools relative to each other and to other schools of a similar type. It will also examine the costs of running small schools and the educational outcomes associated with small schools.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The position of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on this review has always been that it should be about increasing the educational return to communities from the schools in question, not about finding ways of rationalising them.  We admit there may be areas where shared resources, such as specialist teaching and IT support could make a big difference.  There are many such instances of which the Minister of State will be aware.  I mentioned, for example, two VECs in my constituency which provide services of technology to some primary schools and voluntary secondary schools.  However, my party does not and will not support any programme to rationalise smaller schools.  I stated as much during the last Private Members&rsquo; motion on education in April this year and I reiterate this position today.</P>
        <P>In government the Fianna F&aacute;il party dramatically increased teaching and other resources to small schools and doubled the numbers of teachers working in small rural schools.  We did this because we see local primary schools as an irreplaceable part of community life.  Every Member of this House and the Upper House is well aware of the considerable improvements made to the infrastructure of our smaller schools and to the human resources available in them.  A very important beneficiary of this increased support for small schools has been the schools of Protestant denominations outside Dublin, in particular in my area of Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year my party stated we would support the Minister if his intention was to increase the educational gain from spending on these schools.  Unfortunately, it is now clear he intends to move ahead and take decisions without taking an overall approach.  Again, the Government has singled out disadvantaged schools for significant cuts in teacher numbers this year in another series of callous cuts.  Under the plans 428 posts allocated to disadvantaged schools throughout the country will be removed, on a phased basis, beginning next year.  The rules on class sizes under the DEIS programme will also be changed under this Fine Gael-Labour Party plan.  Class sizes in many disadvantaged schools will be increased to 22 pupils.  Today the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that his Government has protected pupil-teacher ratios in budget 2012.  This is not correct.  The Fine Gael-Labour Party budget targets disadvantaged schools for cuts to teacher numbers from next year.  This is yet another example of the Government&rsquo;s budget hitting the most vulnerable groups hardest while those on higher salaries escape the bulk of the cutbacks.</P><Col N="560"/>
        <P>Schools in disadvantaged areas face the greatest challenges and can least afford cuts to their staffing levels and services.  The cuts announced in last week&rsquo;s budget will result in larger class sizes in most disadvantaged schools and will have a direct impact on the most vulnerable students in our education system.  The DEIS programme is the only scheme that targets educational disadvantage in rural Ireland.  Now many of these schools are to lose teacher posts.  That disadvantaged schools and small rural schools have been singled out in this way is a disgrace.  The Government had a series of choices to make in its budget in order to achieve the necessary savings for 2012.  Unfortunately, it chose to target vulnerable groups and rural communities for the bulk of the cutbacks instead of asking those who could most afford it to play their part.  All Members have spoken to parents whose children have benefited from these schemes and programmes.  Not only have they been beneficial for individual pupils but they also aid the wider school community.  Many principals and other staff members dread the changes proposed by the Minister and his Department.  The children who benefited in the past from the additional teaching support needed that assistance and the pupils in the classroom today need it in their formative years.</P>
        <P>School transport is a significant operation which currently supports more than 125,000 pupils and their families on a daily basis.  The main criteria for provision of a service are distance from a school and a prescribed minimum number of pupils requiring transport from a distinct locality.  As the Opposition spokesperson on education, last year the Minister, Deputy Quinn, railed against the increase in school transport charges.  He referred to a line being crossed in regard to the imposition of primary transport costs.  Now, however, he proposes to double most of those charges.  Should there be school amalgamations and closures school transport will be even more central to the provision of primary education and will create likely additional costs for parents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s decision to change dramatically the provision for career guidance and counselling will have a significant effect on the majority of second level schools and will impact adversely on smaller second level schools.  The Government has decided that from the next school year guidance provision will be managed by schools from within their standard teacher allocation.  It has been stated clearly by the relevant interests that this decision will affect up to 1,000 guidance counsellors in 700 second level schools throughout the country.  How can the Government claim it is protecting front line services in education when such a decision is being implemented from the next school year?  The reality is there will be a significant loss of teaching posts at second level, with some schools losing two posts.  It is clear that the ramifications of this decision are very serious.  All of us appreciate that guidance counsellors are a vital link between schools, society and the wider world of work.  In these difficult times a reduced guidance service is not what pupils or their families need.  Was there ever a more important time to have adequate guidance for young people?</P>
        <P>Educationalists have clearly pointed out that the withdrawal of the entitlement of second level schools to <i>ex quota </i>career guidance counsellors will have the same effect as a straight increase in the pupil-teacher ratio.  Unfortunately, it will mean that the majority of second level schools will lose a teacher.  There will be a further curtailment of subject choice and the running of a transition year and the leaving certificate applied examination may be affected in many schools.  That would be a very unfortunate and retrograde step.  The priority of everybody in this House is to deal with the very difficult economic situation and to provide jobs for our people.  This is a time when young people need career advice and counselling.  Only last January, the ESRI dealt in a publication with the concerns of parents in regard to the availability and the adequacy of career guidance.  That publication clearly showed the importance that parents attach to such guidance.</P><Col N="561"/>
        <P>Even at third level there is an anti-rural agenda.  The Government has taken four decisions that will significantly restrict the ability of young people and the unemployed to continue to third level education.  We know of the commitments made four days before the general election by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, that not alone would they not increase student contribution charges but they would reduce those imposed some weeks earlier.  This pledge, like the others, will not be honoured.</P>
        <P>Thankfully, there has been a significant improvement in third level participation rates.  In 1980, only 20% of all 18 year olds went to third level.  By 2009, 65% of all students who completed their leaving certificates went on to third level which now stands as the highest participation level in the EU.  Between 1997 and 2010 the number of third level students increased 60% from 100,000 to 159,000.  We do not want the Government imposing policies that will restrict access for people from lower income households to third level education.</P>

	<P>I rise to support Deputy Moynihan&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion.  Last week&rsquo;s budget, as put forward by the Fine Gael-Labour Government, was a blatant attack on families in rural communities with proposals for the closure of 31 Garda stations, a hike in school bus costs and the reduction in teachers for small schools.  Reductions in REPS, the disadvantaged areas scheme and the farm assist support will further penalise poor farmers already under income pressure due to the recession.  Local improvement schemes will also be abolished while the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is pressing ahead with charges on septic tank which will mainly affect rural dwellers.  I listened attentively to him last week on the septic tank Bill but am still waiting for him to announce grant aid to support those who may have to replace their septic tank systems.</P>

In fact, the troika agreed with the previous Government that Garda strength should stand at 13,000.  In 2006, when Garda levels had to be similarly reduced, there were no station closures.  The Government should ensure Garda stations remain open and show some concern for people&rsquo;s security in rural areas.</P>
        <P>Community employment schemes have done tremendous work for many communities through meals on wheels, GAA and other sporting organisations.  It is not good enough the training and materials grant will be reduced from &euro;1,500 to &euro;500 per participant per annum.  While some larger sporting organisations might be able to supplement their reductions, others, like meals on wheels and services for the elderly, will not be able to do so.</P>

	<P>Community employment schemes are a valuable entity and should be maintained.  The Minister, coming from rural Kilkenny, will recognise the schemes&rsquo; value.  I expect he will announce this evening the reversal of last week&rsquo;s budget decision on the schemes.</P>
        <P>On Thursday, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will attend the annual EU Council meeting on fisheries in Brussels.  Knowing about it from my experience in the Department, the Minister will argue for three days with his European counterparts about the importance of the fishing industry to coastal communities in Ireland.  The European Commission has suggested quota reductions of up to 40% across the Irish total allowable catch.  If this happens, it will have serious consequences for our coastal communities which depend on the industry such as Rosslare and Kilmore Quay.  It is important we support the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, in his endeavours to ensure the Irish fisheries are protected while these outlandish quota cuts are rejected.</P>
        <P>Instead, we must ensure viable fisheries and that the industry will continue to progress and prosper.  It employs up to 11,000 people with the potential to employ many more.  Several weeks ago, all parties gave the Minister full support to take the gloves off to battle on behalf of the Irish fishing industry at the forthcoming Council meeting.</P>
        <P>The local improvement scheme was developed to provide grants from local authorities towards the construction or improvement of non-public untarred roads.</P>
        <P>The Minister was a local authority member and he will be aware of the importance of the local improvements scheme.  Where farmers and others living on an unserviced road came up with money, they received a grant under the scheme from the county council to carry out works.  It is important that this scheme be restored because if farmers and others living on unserviced roads are prepared to put up money, it is only right that the Government and the local authorities would provide matching funding.  If not, there is not a hope in hell of people bringing roads up to the standard required nowadays.</P><Col N="563"/>
        <P>I ask the Minister to seriously examine the reintroduction of the scheme.  Perhaps he could do a deal with local authorities whereby the people living on the unserviced roads, the Minister and the relevant local authority would put up X amount each and it would be a three-way process.  It is unfair on families in rural Ireland to withdraw the scheme.  At the end of the day, the Government has a majority and it will make decisions but, on the basis of what I have heard over the past week, people in rural Ireland are dissatisfied with the actions and antics of the Government parties.  I have no doubt they are only waiting for an opportunity to boot them out of office.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I wish to share time with Deputies Liam Twomey and Pat Deering.</P>
        <P>It is clear that Deputy Browne has not been talking to too many people.  He did not mention the 2009 reductions made by Deputy Smith as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in spending on the disadvantaged areas and suckler cow schemes and so on.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Funding for the disadvantaged areas scheme was reduced but two new income streams replaced that &mdash; the suckler cow and sheep grasslands schemes.  Spending on them exceeded the reduction in funding for the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the agri-environment options scheme?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="564"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have obviously hit a nerve.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies opposite are well aware, the gap that has emerged between revenues and expenditure is not sustainable.  Budget 2012 estimates the general government deficit in 2011 at &euro;15.6 billion or 10.1% of GDP, which is likely to be the highest deficit in the EU.  The Government is committed to reducing this to 8.6% of GDP next year, a target set under the EU-IMF programme agreed by the previous Administration.  The comprehensive expenditure report 2012 to 2014 and budget 2012 published last week provide for an adjustment of &euro;3.8 billion in 2012 to reach this 8.6% target, with approximately 60% of the adjustment being implemented on the expenditure side.</P>
        <P>Consolidation is being implemented in the least &ldquo;growth damaging&rdquo;  way and there are no increases in income tax this year.  Supporting growth as much as possible must be at the heart of the consolidation process.  Furthermore, as debt servicing costs have first call on resources, an increasing debt interest burden will lead to higher interest costs adding to the burden on the taxpayer, will reduce our productive capacity, increase unemployment and reduce the scope for providing public services in the future.  Borrowing at current levels is not a long-term solution.</P>
        <P>Over the coming years as economic growth returns, we also expect that growth in tax revenues will resume.  However, the tax base is much reduced and economic growth will be export-led, which is not as tax rich as domestically driven growth.  As a result, the expected pick up in tax revenues will not bridge the significant gap that has emerged in the public finances, even taking account of the revenue raising measures that will be implemented.  Taxes in 2015 are currently forecast at &euro;43.2 billion, still some &euro;4 billion below their 2007 peak.  Expenditure, therefore, must continue to play its part also in restoring sustainability to the public finances.  Delivering on our budgetary targets is vital if we are to regain our economic and financial sovereignty and to return to sourcing our own funding from international financial markets next year.  The motion simply bears no relation to these budgetary realities and I oppose it on that basis.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware of the economic challenges facing many property owners and businesses.  My Department provides local authorities with significant resources from central government funds, which help reduce the need for local government charges.  General purpose grants of &euro;651 million from the local government fund have been allocated to local authorities for 2012.  However, it is recognised that the existing revenue base of local authorities is too narrow by international standards.  This was a consideration in the introduction of the &euro;200 non-principal private residence, NPPR, charge in 2009.  While the charge represents a dedicated source of funding for local authorities, which is relatively stable, it does not go far enough in addressing the imbalance in the sector&rsquo;s financing.</P>
        <P>A proper broadening of the revenue base for local government will be achieved as a result of the introduction of the household charge in 2012 and the subsequent property tax in due course, proposals which found great favour with the previous Administration a short time ago.  This charge, which has the potential to contribute up to &euro;160 million towards the provision of local services, is an interim measure and proposals for a full property tax will be developed and considered by the Government in due course.  These measures will provide a stable base of financial support for local government.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy commercial rates.  Rates must be levied on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists which are prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation which is applied to the valuation of each property <Col N="565"/>as determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates is decided by the elected members of each local authority in annual budgets.  Its determination is a reserved function of a local authority.  Local authorities have responded positively to requests from my Department to exercise restraint in recent years in setting commercial rates.  Annual rates on valuation reduced in 2010 and again in 2011 and all commercial rates are collected and spent locally on essential public services.  This is local democracy in action.</P>

	<P>Not in Wexford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is focused on reducing the cost of doing business to support competitiveness and employment in the economy generally and to protect the interests of local communities.  It is not concerned solely with the funding of local government, but also that local government delivers the services our communities expect as efficiently and effectively as possible.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to align the community development sector with local government will also see an expanded role for local authorities in local enterprise and community development.  This, in turn, will maximise the impact of investment to produce jobs at local level.  My Department will continue to work with the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association to identify best practices in the local government sector in building stronger sectoral approaches and eliminating variances between local authorities.  While these are difficult economic times, Deputies will appreciate that local authorities play, and must continue to play, a central role in delivering services at local level.  Local authority capital and current budgets, economic planning and development, and the provision of goods and services, as well as community infrastructure, feed into the communities they serve.</P>
        <P>As regards water treatment, last month I published the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011, which will introduce a proportionate, risk-based approach for the inspections of septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems.  The objective of this legislation, which resulted from a European Court of Justice judgment against Ireland in 2009 that was not acted on by the previous Government, is to protect public health and the environment, and, in particular, drinking water sources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>An attack on rural Ireland is all it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputies opposite want to poison groundwater and water supplies and, in turn, damage the prospects of inward investment, that is their decision, not mine.</P>
        <P>Groundwater is a source of drinking water for many people.  Approximately 26% of the public and private drinking water supply is provided from groundwater sources.  The EPA has identified effluent from on-site waste water treatment systems as one of the main sources of contamination of groundwater in Ireland.  The 2006 census reported more than 450,000 households were served by septic tanks and other forms of on-site waste water treatment systems.</P>
        <P>The Water Services (Amendment) Bill has been drafted to minimize the impact on householders.  The registration fee payable, which will not exceed &euro;50, will cover all administration and inspection costs and no additional charges, such as a re-registration charge, will be levied on householders.  Responsibility for the prevention of pollution from septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems rests with the owners of premises served by such systems.  Section 70 of the Water Services Act 2007 places a duty of care on owners to ensure their treatment systems do not cause a risk to human health or the environment or a nuisance through odours.</P>
        <P>Householders who are meeting their responsibilities in this regard have nothing to fear from the risk-based inspection system that will be introduced under the Bill.  The Bill specifies the <Col N="566"/>basic criteria against which on-site waste water treatment systems will be inspected in line with article 4 of the waste directive.  These are that the system does not endanger human health or the environment, including water, air and soil, the countryside and places of special interest.</P>
        <P>Budget 2012 is a strong statement of this Government&rsquo;s support for the agrifood sector.  It recognises the significant contribution the sector can make to economic recovery and growth.  While acknowledging that savings have to be made in certain schemes due to the budgetary situation, the Government is targeting existing resources at active farmers, especially those in vulnerable sectors.</P>
        <P>With regard to the disadvantaged areas scheme, there will be no changes in either the rates or the eligible areas qualifying for a disadvantaged area payment, despite the fact expenditure will be reduced by some &euro;30 million in 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is some man.</P>

	<P>That is some doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>He can get the local authorities to do that with the rate support grant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Smith can compare that with his record.  This lower financial limit will be achieved by the introduction of targeted reform in the disadvantaged areas payments, which will be achieved through reform of the stocking density, retention period and other elements of the scheme.  The proposed changes will favour active farmers.</P>
        <P>The Government is supporting productivity and the upskilling of farmers and the food sector by investing in R&amp;D, food safety, animal welfare and enterprise development.  The suckler cow welfare scheme will continue to be fully funded from national funds.  In particular, despite the financial constraints faced, the Government will continue to provide the necessary funding to meet all payments due in 2012 at the current rates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, which had been suspended earlier in the year because of the uncertain budgetary situation, are being re-opened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>

	<P>These schemes cover poultry and pig welfare, dairy equipment, sheep handling and rainwater harvesting schemes, as well as the bio-energy scheme.  In addition to providing an incentive for farmers to invest in their enterprises and secure their futures, these schemes will make a worthwhile contribution to job creation and to the maintenance of existing jobs in rural areas.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to afforestation is being honoured.  The forestry sector contributes to job creation and to the maintenance of jobs in rural areas and has a vital climate change role.  The funding provided for in budget 2012 will allow afforestation to continue at roughly 7,000 hectares per annum, as well as providing for the building of forest roads.</P><Col N="567"/>
        <P>In the seafood sector, in addition to funding for investment schemes in the processing sector, aquaculture development and fishery harbours, the Government is providing for an increase in the grant-in-aid for Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I know former Deputy Hugh Byrne would be delighted with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister was going to do away with that a couple of months ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The budget sends out a positive message about the agri-food sector.  It is an indication that the Government has confidence in the ability of the sector to do much more in terms of generating growth and employment.  All the indications are that the sector will continue to outperform other sectors of the economy and continue on an upward trajectory, creating new jobs and building further on the outstanding export performance in 2011.</P>
        <P>Moving to other areas of concern to rural dwellers, the Government is very much aware that public transport is not just an urban issue but one that is very real for rural areas.  Many people in rural areas have great difficulty accessing basic services due to lack of access to transport.  Schemes such as the rural transport programme can and do transform life for those who benefit.  A good public transport system is a necessary precondition for the development of a fully inclusive society in all its social and economic dimensions.  Rural transport is a necessary component of such a system and can determine people&rsquo;s level of access to work, education, medical and social services.  The programme for Government acknowledges the importance of transport for rural communities and includes a commitment &ldquo;to maintain and extend the rural transport programme with other local transport services as much as is practical&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The consolidation that this Government has been required to take has, by necessity, in some cases resulted in reduced services to the public.  However, the Government has ensured that the principles of fairness, growth and reform underpin all decisions that must be taken if Ireland is to regain its economic sovereignty.  I completely refute the allegation from the Deputies opposite that there has been an anti-rural bias to any announcement by the Government.  Rather, as I have demonstrated, the Government has ensured that the rural community, and the rural way of life, has been protected in so far as is possible in these trying times.  I recommend the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the House.</P>

	<P>Reading the motion, it is difficult to see what is Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s policy into the future given it is trying to ingratiate itself with the public it so badly let down in recent years.  It seems to be a mixture of the use of fear to get people on-side and perhaps going back to the territory of comely maidens dancing at the crossroads.  Younger generations, and not so young generations, laughed at the myopic vision of a former Fianna F&aacute;il leader when he talked about comely maidens dancing at the crossroads as if things do not change.  It is not so funny when we consider the utter destruction of this country&rsquo;s economy and public finances by previous leaders of the party opposite.  This is why I find it strange to see Fianna F&aacute;il trying to make itself out to be the guardian of rural life.  Four of the signatories to this motion were themselves part of a Government that landed us in the greatest crisis this country has ever known.  There is a certain sense of hypocrisy when Fianna F&aacute;il members now try to paint themselves as the guardians of rural life.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue of change, which they seem to fail to understand.  It is only 18 years since I qualified as a doctor.  The treatments of common diseases like diabetes and hypertension I was told to instigate when I first qualified are now obsolete and the current treatments are completely different and were unheard of even 18 months ago.  The reason people fear change &mdash; the party opposite is trying to use that fear &mdash; is that all too often the driver for change is <Col N="568"/>a state of chaos.  The chaos of our public finances at present is contributing to a huge need for change.  We are focusing on the education system, the health system and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to try to reflect the changes that are vital to ensure local and national government can provide a quality service to the people in the future.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the Deputies opposite referred to rural Garda stations.  While those stations play a massive role in rural life, they are not sacrosanct in the way some think they are.  Many of these rural Garda stations were opened when we were still under British rule.  Are members of Fianna F&aacute;il suggesting that nothing should change in this country and it should stay as it was on the day the State was founded?  Garda&iacute; nowadays do not use bicycles to do their jobs; they use modern transport and modern communications systems.  Even 40 or 50 years ago, garda&iacute; did not have access to the sort of telecommunications and radio communications that are used nowadays.  Why should we be so stuck with the idea that we must have a block building in every single parish in the way Fianna F&aacute;il suggests?  We should be looking to modernise the Garda in a much more effective way.  That is the sort of agenda we should be pushing forward.</P>
        <P>The same applies to the health services.  If we were to follow the sort of principles Fianna Fail is using, we would go back to the dispensing system, which did not serve the people well.  We are now moving forward with developments such as primary care centres, moving services into the community and looking after people better.  Again, change is coming and while some of it is driven by the financial situation, some of it would happen in any case.  The party opposite, if it sees itself returning to power and correcting the mistakes it has made in recent years, should be ready to embrace some of these changes.</P>
        <P>When there is destruction of the public finances such as we are now dealing with, the reality is there must be a reduction in the type of services we used to offer.  There is no choice.  I have no problem saying we must have a reduction in services because we simply do not have the money for them.  There will be additional costs for people because although when we had a false economy of construction and borrowed money we were able to give the impression that we somehow did not have to pay for services, it is now coming home to roost that this money is no longer there.  We must either cut services or increase taxes and other costs for the general public to try to maintain the current level of services.</P>
        <P>This is the third time in my life the party opposite has brought this country to a similar position, and it was all brought about by extravagant spending.  However, there was an additional element to the greed we saw in the last decade, namely, there was a corruption of the political life, business life and social life of the country.  The party opposite needs to get away from all of that very destructive corruption that was brought into Irish society and it needs to be more reflective of itself.</P>
        <P>The Irish people are very resilient and stoic.  Unlike what I have heard from Members opposite, the people I meet are facing up to the current challenges.  They are not just looking around for people to blame; they are prepared to make the changes and they want to get on with it.  They want to see us run this country.  The saddest thing about November 2010, when the IMF came into this country, was that the people were almost delighted to see that someone would be making decisions.  That is what we saw happen in this country just over one year ago.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il knows quite well that some of what it talks about here does not have the people out on the streets in the way that it would like, and neither does stoking up fears, talk of &euro;300 inspection fees for septic tanks and the suggestion that rural crime will run rampant because a Garda station here or there is closed.  Fianna F&aacute;il knows that is pure rubbish.  It is playing to a narrow audience that still supports Fianna F&aacute;il, but the vast majority fully understands the <Col N="569"/>changes that must be made.  The vast majority of people know that some of the changes are merely changes we must face up to.  We cannot remain static.  They also accept that some of the changes we face are due to the fact that the public finances have been utterly decimated by the reckless behaviour of the previous Government in recent years.</P>
        <P>We will make tough decisions this year, next year and the year after.  If there is one promise that Fine Gael and Labour in Government will make it is that we will try to regain our sovereignty.  We will do our best to get the people out of this mess.  We will try to get this country working again and to provide the services the people deserve.</P>
        <P>In future, the Opposition must change tack on this.  We need for the Opposition to be a little more constructive in what it says.  If opposition Members disagree with something, they should put their case a little better than in this Private Members&rsquo; motion.  This is a lazy Private Members&rsquo; motion and it will not stir any interest outside of this House among those about whom we speak.  I would have expected a little more considering that Fianna F&aacute;il spent so much time in Government and fully understands how things work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickDeering"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Deering</NameTxt>
	<P>Like previous speakers, I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this Private Members&rsquo; motion.</P>
        <P>As a rural TD, I was appalled to read the motion, and particularly the last sentence, where it &ldquo;calls on the Government to abandon its anti-rural bias and adopt a fair and balanced approach to the budget&rdquo;.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
        <P>Never before has agriculture or rural Ireland been mentioned as often in a budget as happened on this occasion.  It is hypocrisy from the Deputies opposite to mention this issue when they, in their four-year plan, proposed to reduce the capital agricultural budget by &euro;20 million over the next four years to &euro;150 million, which was totally unacceptable.  In this budget, we were in a position in Government &mdash; I commend the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Coveney &mdash; to ensure that the capital budget for the next four years will be &euro;168 million rather than the &euro;150 million those opposite had budgeted for.</P>
        <P>In this budget there is a large number of taxation issues which will have a significant effect on agriculture and rural Ireland, a few I which I want to mention.  The measures encourage farmers and a return to a career in farming.  In the past ten or 15 years, agriculture was treated with disrespect by the vast majority of the outgoing Government.  It was unpopular to be a farmer in rural areas or to have anything to do with it.  Everybody was encouraged to go and lay blocks, be it in Dublin or in large urban areas.</P>
        <P>This budget provided incentives to farm partnership and greater production at farm level.  It also stimulates land sales and land transfers.  It facilitates new enterprise opportunities in farming and helps the agri-food business innovate and export.</P>
        <P>There are a couple of main areas on which I want to dwell.  One of the most significant measures introduced in the budget is the new stock relief incentive to encourage farm partnership.  For registered farm partnership, the current rate of 25% stock relief will increase to 50% and for certain young trained farmers entering partnerships, a rate of 100% stock relief will be available.  This new incentive will run until December 2015 which will encourage an increasing number of farmers into the system where, especially as we approach the ending of the milk quotas in 2015, it will encourage more farmers to develop their quotas.</P>
        <P>The stamp duty reduction is important.  Budget 2012 reduces the stamp duty rate on agricultural land from 6% to 2% with immediate effect, which is very important.  In addition, the half-rate of 1% rate will be applicable on transfers to close relatives up until the end of 2014.  This change will substantially reduce the stamp duty payable to the transfer of farms by land gift or sale and it should stimulate the stagnant land market.  As Members will be aware, in Ireland <Col N="570"/>land transfers and land mobility is very different from most parts of Europe.  I understand that land in Ireland only transfers in one in every 400 years compared to an average of one in every 75 years around Europe.</P>
        <P>The capital gains tax relief is also important.  Budget 2012 has restructured the retirement relief available on capital gains tax to provide an incentive for early retirement and the transfer of farm assets to the next generation.  There has not been a change to the 90% capital acquisitions tax.  This means that farms worth up to &euro;2.5 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to the transfer to a farmer&rsquo;s son or close relations.</P>
        <P>Other tax measures that are beneficial to agri-industry include the additional supports for research and development.  The new VAT rate is also to apply to open farms such as pet farms.  This is beneficial as the rate increases from 9% to 23%.  One of the most important issues, one which was flagged early on and on which we made a commitment in the programme for Government, was the review of the universal social charge and this affects a large number of farmers and seasonal workers in the farming area.  Consistent also with the programme for Government on carbon tax, farmers will be able to double the income tax deduction in respect of increased costs arising from the charge in carbon tax.  The carbon tax is to increase from &euro;15 to &euro;20 per tonne as and from May 2012 for agricultural diesel.  This is very important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Also, a number of other schemes were introduced such as the AEOS I mentioned earlier.  Once we came into Government, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine did his best to ensure that we had an AEOS.  An original scheme was announced with no funding for it.</P>

        <P>It is amazing listening to Fianna F&aacute;il tonight.  One of the most regressive developments that ever happened in rural areas, which affects my county and Deputy Moynihan&rsquo;s county, was the <Col N="571"/>closure of the sugar industry.

	<P>Add to this third level education fee charges and more than halving grants for most third level students in Sligo-Leitrim because of the proximity changes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Outside of the budget entirely, the HSE is now considering the wholesale closure of public nursing homes with the threat of moving elderly, vulnerable people to private facilities many miles from their home areas.  It is doing so because the Government refuses to tax the wealthy and refuses to make financial speculators carry some responsibility for their reckless gambles.  The Government continues to operate under the illusion that our economy can recover although we take ever more money from the pockets of the very people who sustain it locally and nationally.  In this process, Fine Gael deserves some recognition for arranging very cleverly for a Labour Party Minister to introduce swingeing cuts in the D&aacute;il on Monday of last week.  He sat down to applause from Fine Gael backbenchers while the Labour backbenchers sat ashen-faced.  Far be it from me to offer any advice to Labour Party Members, but I believe they really should ascertain the intentions and the actions of their new best friends in Fine Gael.</P>
        <P>In agriculture, budget 2012 provides for a 10% reduction in respect of REPS, no commitment to opening the AEOS scheme in 2012 and restrictive changes to disadvantaged area payments.  Farmers in disadvantaged areas will probably end up subsidising those in more advantaged areas just as the truly disadvantaged will be sacrificed to support the better-off generally throughout the State.</P>
        <P>At the weekend I listened as Government parties&rsquo; representatives described budget 2012 on local radio as not being too bad and they stated the bad bits had to be introduced because the previous Government made them do so.  I felt for these spokespersons because they are decent people.  However, they were saying to their own community that the budget will not be too bad for them, yet they knew as they said it that, this year and in the following years, decisions will be made that will have a devastating effect not only on rural areas but on the people of this nation.</P>
        <P>I spoke with local people extensively over the weekend.  People in Sligo-Leitrim are normally fairly laid back, a bit like myself, but they are now very angry.  They want truth, leadership and change but they got none of these in this disgraceful budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought when I was listening to Deputy Pat Deering that Fine Gael would open the sugar factories in Mallow and in Carlow.  I was hoping he would conclude with such a statement but, unfortunately, he did not deliver.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickDeering"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Deering</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not close them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>Having listened to his commentary that the closure was the decision of Fianna F&aacute;il, which I do not dispute, I must state the reality is that the Deputy&rsquo;s party has an opportunity to open the factories if there is sufficient political will to put people back to work.  I await that decision with bated breath.</P>
        <P>One austerity measure that will affect many in rural areas, and my county in particular, is that to end funding for People with Disabilities Ireland, PWDI, from the end of this month.  This will have a massive impact on Kerry Network for People with Disabilities as up to 70% of its funding came from PWDI.  Its  grant from the HSE had been already cut by 5%.  The effect is that, in total, up to 16,000 people, including families, will be affected.  There is a great effort being made by community groups and individuals to maintain the service.  It is invaluable to those most in need.  A large number of disabled people and their families will be at a real loss and it will greatly disimprove the quality of life of all concerned.  The network was established in <Col N="573"/>1996 following consultation with people with disabilities.  That clearly has been one of the reasons for its effectiveness.  Withdrawing the funding, effectively leaving a death sentence hanging over the project, is an extremely retrograde step.  It reflects the overall retrograde and anti-social nature of the austerity programme being implemented by this Government.</P>
        <P>Another such step is the attack on the community employment schemes.  These have been a chink of light to the 22,000 operators and approximately 500,000 who avail of the services and training.  The schemes are of significant benefit to rural people and those in urban centres also.  The centres around the country are a valuable resource for many groups but the cut to their budget, of 66%, will mean many will be forced to close their doors.  Not only will that mean a reduction in the income of those directly concerned but also, and more important, it will be regarded by many participating on CE schemes as closing off the possibility of their improving their circumstances.</P>
        <P>I referred last week to a number of people affected by this cut.  It is clear from the many who have contacted elected representatives that a considerable number are in despair over their future and that of their children.  I read two very painful letters in this regard into the record last week.</P>
        <P>The motion refers to other similarly negative cuts, including the cuts to the farm assist scheme and the disadvantaged areas scheme.  These will cut significantly the incomes of farm households that are already struggling.  I refer to those on the lower, marginal level and who are trying to remain viable and to retain the quality of life of their families.</P>
        <P>Apart from the increasing charges for those whose children are using public transport to go to school, the cuts to education overall will seriously impair not only the level of services provided but also the very ability of people to gain access to education.  In combination, the budget and the overall austerity programme will further plunge the country into recession and exacerbate the serious consequences in all aspects of life.</P>
        <P>The motion refers to the budget&rsquo;s anti-rural bias.  There is certainly a perception that there is such a bias affecting many communities.  The Government, no more than its predecessor, which was led by the party that tabled this motion, is not discriminating between urban and rural.  It is not so much anti-rural as anti-community, anti-growth, anti-jobs, anti-enterprise, anti-development and anti-social.</P>
        <P>I heard Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in from the Labour Party claim his colleague Deputy Nulty had acted selfishly in not supporting the budget.  Surely he ought to applaud the courage of Deputy Nulty because his certainly was a courageous stand to take.  He stood by what he was elected for and on what he campaigned.  He was very badly let down by Frankfurt-Labour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling this motion because it allows us to have a debate on rural life.  While it may seem strange to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, that one who lives in the heart of Cork city wishes to speak on rural affairs, she will know my constituency is 55% rural.  We get to hear at first hand some of the issues and problems that towns and villages throughout the constituency are experiencing.  Rural people have the same right to a decent standard of living and services as those of us who live in the city.  Sometimes we take those services for granted.  Rural dwellers should have the same right of access to services.</P>
        <P>I could point out the irony of the points made by Fianna F&aacute;il in the motion.  The majority of the measures it condemns, if not all, were proposed policies of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Far be it from me to criticise Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling such a motion.  Some would say it is very opportunistic of it to table such a motion on measures it proposed itself, such as septic tank charges and rural <Col N="574"/>school transport charges, but that is not to say the points contained in the motion are any less valid.  They are valid regardless of who tabled the motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Successive Governments, led by all the establishment parties, have presided over the economic and demographic decline in rural areas.  I refer to bad policy and incorrect decisions being made at the incorrect time, such as the failure to be a strong advocate for Irish farmers, fishermen and rural communities as a whole.  What has occurred did not happen by accident.  It has occurred over a period.  It is unfair to say it has happened since March because that is not the case.  This has been happening for the last 15 or 20 years thanks to the policies of successive Governments.</P>
        
        <P>There is no doubt that the closure of Garda stations will have an impact on rural communities.  If an impact analysis was conducted on the effects of closing Garda stations in rural communities the results were not made available to Opposition Members.  When the Garda Commissioner appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, we did not get a comprehensive answer in terms of the criteria used to make decisions on closing stations.  We also need clarity on who is responsible for these decisions.  The Minister has stated that the Garda Commissioner drew up the list but the latter indicated that he was only making recommendations and the Minister took the final decision.  We need to see transparency on this issue.  Garda stations are not just deterrents to crime in rural areas.   They are part and parcel of the fabric of rural Ireland and for that reason their closure is a retrograde step.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is unfortunate that the party putting forward the Private Members&rsquo; motion is responsible for many of the policies they are now criticising.  This year&rsquo;s budget reads like a horror story.  The tax on septic tanks was to come before the D&aacute;il this week but it is now being postponed until January.  Local residents will be paying the price for the failure of consecutive Governments since 1975 to implement EU regulations.  The household charge will also affect rural householders.  The local government fund will be cut by &euro;165 million, and 84% of this figure is intended to be met by the charge.  We can see how that is going to run into difficulties.</P>
        <P>Two serious attacks are being made against our communities.  The first is against community employment schemes, which provide essential services that would otherwise never be provided.  The private and public sectors either will not or cannot provide these services, which range from homework clubs, cr&egrave;ches and meals on wheels to environmental works in villages and towns.  As a former participant and sponsor of community employment schemes, I fear the proposed cuts will result in the closure of many of these schemes.  They are dependent on the material grant for rents.  Education and training are essential elements of community employment.  I was a beneficiary of a training grant in the 1990s.  It helps people to get into employment but it is being killed by the budget measures.  We are being told that schemes will be not allowed to lapse but they are useless if the money for education and training is removed.</P>
        <P>The second attack is against local government services.  Rural households are being asked to pay ever increasing charges from their depleted resources while the funding from central Government is being diverted from local government to bail out the banks.  We can see that in the &euro;165 million being cut from the local government fund by the budget.  The people in our communities did not cause the banking crisis that has brought the economy to this juncture.  I ask the Government to revisit this measure because these people should not be asked to pay the price for it.</P>

        <P>I will not speak about disability cuts because, thankfully, they have been reversed.  The late Brian Lenihan had that measure in his budget but he dropped it after we spoke to him about it.  However, the measure was not shredded and the lazy departmental officials, who are interested in protecting the rich and their own high salaries &mdash; I am speaking about those on salaries of &euro;100,000 to &euro;200,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>We will only have memories of Garda stations after the Government has closed them.  We can show pictures to our children so they can see what we used to have in rural areas.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Skills has a death wish for small schools.  They are the best schools we ever had and they produce the best results.  In rural Ireland, the school will keep people in an area but if it is closed they will drift to bigger areas.</P>
        <P>Carers and home helps keep elderly people out of hospitals.  The hospitals have been closed.  I do not know what the Government wants us to do.  It is driving us into the ground.  The people who are caring for the elderly in their homes are being hit.</P>
        <P>This budget was a well laid plan to attack rural Ireland, the weak, the lower paid and the new poor.  The Government should be ashamed of itself.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="576"/>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  The value of the community employment schemes cannot be underestimated.  They have allowed communities to remain vibrant and empowered people to carry out vital projects, deliver services and provide support for voluntary centres, carers, cr&egrave;ches, elderly day care centres, tidy towns, meals on wheels and numerous other activities.  The proposed reduction of 66% will have a devastating effect on all categories of people and their quality of life.  It will result in the closure of thousands of voluntary community services around the country.</P>
        <P>I give credit to the Government for its emphasis on getting the unemployed back to work but this unnecessary cutback flies in the face of its aspirations to develop work and practical skills.  I urge the Government to reverse this regressive anti-community measure.  The Minister of State with responsibility for community employment schemes, Deputy Cannon, fully realises the negative impact this measure will have, as he is a rural Deputy who has seen the positivity and social and economic enhancement provided by the schemes in his own constituency in the west.  I urge him, as the Minister of State, to use all his negotiating skills and powers in co-operation with the Taoiseach and his fellow Ministers to reverse this measure.  The potential that exists to further advance and maintain these schemes to increase their employment potential and enhance the quality of life of all the people I have referred to is immeasurable.</P>

  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Local Government (Household Charge) Bill" RHead="2011 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)"> 
    <Title>Local Government (Household Charge) Bill 2011 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I will carry on where I left off.  I believe the household charge should be means tested at the very least.  For instance, people with mortgage debt, senior citizens and disabled people should be completely exempt from this charge, but the categories proposed for exemptions do not include any of these.  The proposal that the District Court be the final adjudicator in an exemption appeal is totally unacceptable.  I do not think a court of law is the place for something like this to be judged.  Particularly for many of our more senior citizens, who take pride in the fact that they have lived through their long years of life without ever having to go up the steps of a courthouse and appear before a judge, it would be a huge blow to have to go through this exercise to appeal the imposition of the charge.</P>
        <P>This is another budget on top of the austerity measures that have had a severe effect on the old, the sick and low to middle-income families in particular.  These people are already facing a plethora of hidden charges and taxes, and it is only now, over the past couple of days, as the budget has undergone cost analysis by several people, that the full impact is emerging.  This charge will also result in a further delay to our economic recovery, as there will be less disposable income, which will lead to unemployment and have a detrimental effect on our small businesses.</P>
        <P>The system under which the local authority is the administrator and collector of the charge is basically another means of obtaining maximum moneys for the Exchequer.  It would be only right and proper if all of the moneys were made available to local authorities to deliver services to the public who will be paying into this scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>Normally, one says that one welcomes the opportunity to contribute to a debate on a Bill.  However, in this case, I am disappointed in the Bill and totally opposed to it.  In April of this year, the Technical Group tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion calling for a referendum on the EU-IMF bailout deal, which was rejected by the Government.  At that time, in responding to the motion, the Taoiseach said in the Chamber that the people had had a referendum and that they had voted unanimously in favour of the formation of a Government <Col N="577"/>by the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  The people did not vote for the Fine Gael and Labour parties to continue the policies of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the Green Party, but that is what they got.  There was no referendum and the people did not have their say.  This Bill, when passed, will give people the opportunity to have their say.  It proposes that people come forward and volunteer their registration for this tax, which equates to saying they agree with it.  I call on people to exercise their mandate by refusing to register for this tax.  In this way they will send a message to the Government that the tax is unfair and unworkable and that they will not sign up to pay a household tax that is being levied on them so that the Government can hand over money to bankers and failed property developers in support of an EU-IMF deal that has been imposed upon us.  The people can have their say and refuse to register for it, and that will show that this tax is unworkable and that the people&rsquo;s real choice has been made.</P>
        <P>Over the past number of weeks, thousands of people have attended public meetings all over the country.  Many people who spoke at those meetings said that they simply could not afford to register for and pay this household tax.  Even though the Government says it is less than &euro;2 per week, people are saying clearly in public that they cannot afford it, and for that reason they will not register or pay the charge because it is a step too far for them.  Although Members here can afford to pay the charge, I will stand with those people and say that we will show our displeasure by refusing to register for or pay this tax.  I will stand with the people who cannot afford to pay it.  There are many people all over the country, as has already been outlined in the debate here, who cannot afford to pay this tax.  They are being forced to choose whether to buy food or heat their houses and they are living through the winter nights without heating because of the burden that has been placed on them to support the EU-IMF bailout.  Those people are making a clear decision that they cannot afford it and they will not pay it, and I call on people who can afford it to stand with them.  They can offer their friends or neighbours support by saying that they stand in opposition to this unfair tax and they will not register for it.  They will send a clear message to the Government that this tax is unfair and unworkable and they will not support it.</P>
        <P>The other reason I oppose this tax is that last week in the budget the Government cut the local government fund by &euro;171 million and then, in this Bill, took the cowardly option of penalising local authorities by obliging them to raise &euro;160 million.  The cutting of the Local Government Fund will leave local authorities in dire financial straits due to the imposition of a tax that the Government does not have the courage to levy itself.  It is forcing it on local authorities and forcing ordinary people to come forward to pay this tax.  It is a step too far.  It is unfair, and no amount of waivers for those in council houses or unfinished estates will make it fair.  I call on everybody to support a &ldquo;can&rsquo;t pay, won&rsquo;t pay&rdquo; campaign.  This will send a strong message that we are not supporting it and we will not pay up.  We will stand together, say to the Government that this tax is unfair, and ask it to go back to the drawing board or to its masters in Europe and tell them it will not force this on the people of Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>As we are sitting here today and tomorrow debating this new legislation, we do so against the backdrop of the necessity for county councils around the country to set their budgets from funding that has been slashed in order to take account of this new tax on home owners.  That is an absolute joke.  The reason local authorities are being starved of funding is not that we have not paid our fair share of tax but rather that the Government chooses to use our taxes to pay unsecured bondholders and recapitalise banks, and refuses, patently, to ask the wealthy people at the top of society to pay their share so we can have the public services that we deserve and have paid for.  Instead, it is choosing &mdash; this is a voluntary choice &mdash; to make ordinary people pay yet again.  One of the messages we need to send out is that the people sitting at home can see this as an opportunity to say &ldquo;Enough is enough.&rdquo;  We cannot <Col N="578"/>consider this measure in isolation from all the austerity measures and budget cuts that have been implemented over the past while.</P>
        <P>All Members have received some heartbreaking letters over the last few days.  One of the letters I received was from a young couple, both of whom have lost their jobs.  They bought a house just before the recession.  They cannot afford to turn on the heating so they sit dressed in jumpers, they cannot afford to pay the refuse charges so the rubbish is piling up in the back garden, they have not been out for a drink in weeks and cannot afford to buy a pair of shoes or bring the dog to the veterinarian.  Yet the young woman said: &ldquo;I count myself lucky that I am not disabled, elderly or sick.  I cannot even begin to imagine what life is like for these people and their families if this is what life is like for us.&rdquo;  Asking people to pay a &euro;100 household tax on top of all the cuts and hardships they are already enduring is ridiculous, disgusting and shameful.  I will not be part of it.</P>
        <P>This is the opportunity many homeowners have sought to have their say against all the austerity that has been foisted on them over the past number of years.  Unlike the universal social charge, the social welfare cuts and all the other measures which have taken money out of our pockets in the dead of night, this is something on which we have a choice.  As Deputy Pringle said, thousands of people have attended meetings on this issue recently and have indicated their resolve to have their say against austerity by not paying this tax.  Undoubtedly, there will be a massive campaign of civil disobedience which will make this charge uncollectible, as happened in the 1990s with the anti-water charges campaign.</P>
        <P>I notice the Minister finds it difficult to listen to this debate, but he certainly will not find it difficult to listen to the people when they get organised on this issue.  I will certainly not pay this tax, and I will not register for the tax.  I will appeal to people in the community to take similar action.  People realise and understand that this legislation has nothing to do with &euro;100.  The aim of the game is to open a new tier of local taxation that will see ordinary people facing bills of over &euro;1,000 per household in the next two to three years.  This tax being foisted on people&rsquo;s shoulders when they currently cannot make ends meet is reprehensible.</P>

	<P>I know it will be me.  This is part of a bigger agenda and anybody who doubts that need only look at the legislation before us and the penalties to be imposed on ordinary people for not registering and not paying in terms of late interest payments, class C fines, court appearances and so forth.  It is really punitive legislation which is not being introduced just for this charge.</P>
        <P>However, the Minister and the Government cannot bring everybody to court.  There are 1.4 million households eligible for the charge and, at best, the Minister can bring about 5% to court.  We will go into the courts and defend those people.  The Judiciary is not exactly flavour of the month and the idea of its members imposing heavy sanctions on ordinary people, while not a single banker has ended up in jail, will not be tolerated.  This Bill is a step too far.  People <Col N="579"/>have taken enough and the Minister will face an almighty battle on this issue should he not pull back from the brink.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I oppose this tax, as do the thousands of people who have already attended the meetings.  I have also been knocking on doors in my community and people are absolutely opposed to it.  They feel it is a tax too far; it is the straw that will break the camel&rsquo;s back in terms of people&rsquo;s incomes, how they are living and how they are rearing their families.</P>
        <P>Like every other measure in the budget, this is a regressive, unjust and unfair tax.  It is a poll tax.  A progressive and civilised society should operate on the basis that essential services are provided free for all and are paid for through a progressive tax system.  Those with real wealth should pay the most, and those with little or nothing should be exempt.  However, that has been turned on its head and those with little or nothing are enduring the biggest hit and the most wealthy are exempt.  This was a recession proof budget for the wealthy in this country.  It is shameful that a Government can tax ordinary people again through this double taxation.  No wealth or asset tax has been imposed on the wealthy.  There are no measures to make nominal taxes on their incomes effective.</P>
        <P>This charge is the introduction of a tax that successive Governments have tried to implement over the past 30 years.  This is the Minister&rsquo;s opportunity and he said he is determined to introduce it, at the behest of the troika.  It is a Trojan horse.  The Minister knows that, given that he tried to challenge my colleague.  It will lead to a property tax of &euro;600 to &euro;700 or more in two or three years.  It will be linked to a water tax of approximately the same amount.  We are not talking about &euro;2 per week, and people know it.  They are not stupid.  They know what happened with the bin tax.  It was introduced with the propaganda that it would be only the price of a pint.  This charge is being introduced at &euro;2 per week but between the water tax and the property tax people could be facing charges of up to &euro;1,300 per year, which is &euro;25 per week.  People know they cannot afford that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is another measure to impose the cost of the disastrous bank bailout on the shoulders of ordinary people.  Another aspect of this tax is the preparation for the privatisation of water services.  I recall when the bin tax was introduced in the Dublin City Council area in 2001.  There was a barrage of propaganda about the environment.  There were pictures on the television of waste being blown down the streets.  It was claimed it was an environmental tax and that it was needed to change people&rsquo;s approach to recycling.  On 16 January, Dublin City Council will be the last local authority to privatise the waste collection service.  Our bin service has become a profit-making commodity for companies.  It is no longer a public service for people who need it.  Elderly people must pay massive amounts of money to have their waste collected.  The green bin will now become part of that payment and there will no longer be a question of people benefiting from recycling.</P>
        <P>This tax will be met with massive resistance.  A national campaign to encourage non-payment is up and running.  Thousands have attended meetings throughout the country.  The Government is expecting this because it provided for penal fines in the Bill.  If a person does not register and pay by 31 March next, they could be penalised with a class C fine of up to &euro;2,400.  In addition, if the person does not reply to the letter seeking the information the Government requires, there could be another fine of &euro;2,400.  It is a most aggressive fine on ordinary people.</P>
        <P>However, where have fines been imposed on the people who created this mess?  Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern will see &euro;4,000 taken from his pension.  What a terrible scandal.  The poor man will be in dire straits, wearing rags on his back, because of the cut in his pension.  Meanwhile, the Minister is willing to impose a fine of almost &euro;2,400 on ordinary people who cannot and will not pay this regressive tax.</P><Col N="580"/>
        <P>There will be a huge cost for the taxpayer in imposing an unjust and unpopular tax.  This is equivalent to the Domesday taxes that were introduced by a tyrant many centuries ago, whereby taxing masters travelled around taking note of what people owned, including their sheep, cattle and so forth.  That is exactly what the Minister is doing.  He is getting people to put their names in a register so more taxes can be imposed in the future.  We know what he and the Government intend to do.</P>
        <P>This will be a hated tax.  The bin tax was the start of Fianna F&aacute;il heading for the hills and ending up in their current position.  People will fight back.  We are not telling them not to register and not to pay: they are telling us they will not do it.  We will stand shoulder to shoulder with them.  If the Minister imposes this tax, it will be the most hated ever and this will be the most hated Government along with it.</P>

	<P>They were conned in 1977 when Fianna F&aacute;il bought an election through the removal of rates.  We have been honest in what we said today.  We are introducing a household charge.  When the Minister introduced the Bill he said it was an interim measure until we can put in place a fair valuation system, which means that those living in large properties, the wealthy the Opposition constantly condemns, will pay a larger share of tax.</P>
        <P>I came across a quote recently and was pleased to see it came from a book called <i>The House Always Wins: Time to Turn the Tables</i>.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The abolition of domestic rates caused great damage to local government and real local democracy.  Since 1977 local government has been funded principally from central government and with the central funding came a much greater degree of centralised control, moving democracy further and further away from the citizen.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I do not see Deputy McGuinness in the Chamber but I welcome his input.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not far away.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnthonyLawlor"><NameTxt>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a popular position but the reality is that domestic rates payable to local authorities make local politics serious and connect people in a direct way with <Col N="581"/>their politicians.  I hope Deputy McGuinness will consider voting with the Government on this Bill.</P>
        <P>I must also criticise Sinn F&eacute;in and its criticism of the Minister.  It has no problem supporting a 2.5% increase in household rates in the North, yet is strenuously voting against the Bill.  Deputy Stanley tabled an amendment to introduce a new section which states, &ldquo;This Act, as agreed, will be temporary in nature.  It will have to be reviewed within 12 months from the date it becomes law&rdquo;.  I hope he will agree with what the Minister introduced and that the charge is an interim measure.  When proper valuations are done we will be able to introduce the Bill properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>We had that before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnthonyLawlor"><NameTxt>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</NameTxt>
	<P>The NPPR payment is currently paid directly to local authorities.  It is the intention of the Minister that the Local Government Management Agency would be the main collector of the household charge which would go into the local government fund.  Those of us who came from local government will realise that the local government fund does not fairly distribute funding to counties.  In my county, Kildare, we have been fighting hard with the Department to get proper funding for the local authority.  We have a much larger population and car usage within the county.  The Minister might consider allowing local authorities rather than the local government management agency to collect the charge.</P>
        <P>The tax is being imposed on the owners of properties.  Some people who own second properties are being charged the NPPR and it seems slightly unfair that they will also have to pay the household charge.  The dictionary definition of a household is &ldquo;A house and its occupants which are regarded as a unit.&rdquo;  Most occupants of rented properties will not pay the charge.  The Minister might consider changing that provision in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Aside from this, I welcome the Bill.  What happened in 1977 was a retrograde step for the country and local democracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It was an auction.  You wanted 50% at the time.  The Minister will remember the auction in 1977.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickDeering"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Deering</NameTxt>
	<P>Like my colleague I would also like to refer to 1977, when a Fianna F&aacute;il Government, led by the then Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Martin O&rsquo;Donoghue, wanted to buy an election and decided to eliminate household rates.  Since then local government has suffered drastically.  At that time the total amount collected in local rates was &pound;78.7 million, which equates to &euro;460 million today.  If we had such an amount of money to put into local government today we would not have our current problems.</P>
        <P>Since 1977 commercial rates have been totally unbalanced and unfair and they affect only a very small section of society.  That situation has to be addressed.  The household charge is a very important first step in the reform of local government which since 1977 has become totally undemocratic.  Local councillors have very little power and it is essential that they get back the power they deserve.</P>
        <P>Local councillors should be in charge of the funding they raise and should be able to allocate funding in their local areas.  This is an important first step in restoring power.  The reform of local government has to move onto the next level.  Certain town councils have become irrelevant and their abolition is an important step.</P><Col N="582"/>
        <P>It is amazing that Sinn F&eacute;in, which as Deputy Lawlor mentioned is notable by its absence, has not been afraid to introduce stringent cuts in the North totalling &pound;4 billion.  The household charge in the North is, on average, &euro;1,500, compared to a proposed charge of &euro;100 in this jurisdiction.  As has been mentioned it is an interim measure for a short period of time.  As Deputy Lawlor said, an equitable system will then be introduced but not at the same level as the North.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, who are absent, have no problem supporting cuts in the North but it is hypocritical to criticise and vote against cuts here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Margaret Ritchie, an SDLP MLA said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position is totally unsustainable. The Sinn F&eacute;in socialists have waved through &pound;4 billion in cuts in Northern Ireland without as much as a whimper while pretending there is an alternative to the inevitable cuts in the South.  The position of that party can be summarised thus: in the North as Green Tory and in the south it is a different story completely.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I commend the Minister for his reform policies in local government.  This is an important first step and I look forward to more steps in the months to come.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Like colleagues I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I do not think any of us like being in the position of having to put in place charges on the people in our country.  We have to look at the reality of where we are and the EU-IMF deal which we inherited from the last Government.  A flat charge of &euro;100 on households cannot be argued to be fair but the Minister has been restricted by virtue of the fact that he has to have the charge in place in 2012.  I particularly welcome the ambition to make the system fairer in the future.  Like some of my colleagues have said, this is the first step in a journey that Minister has started in other areas with respect to the reform of local government in our country. </P>
        <P>Like many current and former Members of the House I come from a local authority background and had the pleasure of being chairman of my local authority a couple of years ago.  It is fair to say that local government and city and county councils are very restricted by virtue of their dependence on central Government for funding and how they can secure resources.  As a people and Government we must have confidence in the great talents of many of our local politicians, as well as those who work for local authorities.</P>

	<P>However, we must all agree that there are too many local authorities and that there is scope to reduce their number significantly by way of further mergers.  Furthermore, we have too many politicians in general.  I will not look across at those whom I might choose to discard; that would be a matter for the electorate.  We will soon have a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It is called courage, Mattie.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="583"/>
      <Speaker pid="DaraMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is considerable scope to give more powers and fund-raising capacity to fewer local politicians.  Given the size of the State, there are simply too many of them.</P>
        <P>I strongly support the principle, evident in our policy on the provision of primary care, that the end-user should be brought as close as possible to the suppliers of services.  That also applies to local government and services provided locally.  I urge the Minister to continue on the path on which he is travelling, not by virtue of being forced to impose the cost of services on the people but by guaranteeing that where they do have to pay, the services they receive are of a standard that offers good value for money.</P>
        <P>I have studied some of the figures for other OECD countries, particularly the United Kingdom and what could be described as western Europe.  They show that such charges are significantly lower in Ireland than in most European countries and dramatically lower than in Northern Ireland and Britain.  In many parts of Britain the charges are higher than those which apply in Northern Ireland.  Deputy Deering mentioned &euro;1,500 as being an average figure.  However, it does not include the water and sewerage charge which averages out at some &pound;300.  Therefore, the charge in Northern Ireland is closer to &euro;2,000 on average, with many households paying more than this sum.</P>
        <P>For the same services, we are introducing a charge of &euro;100 per annum.  Nobody likes to have to pay additional charges, but this particular charge amounts to approximately half of what we pay for our television licence.  The devil will be in the detail in future years.  We must see evidence of improved autonomy, integrity and responsibility on the part of local authorities.  People will accept this charge in time, just as they accept similar charges all over the world.  If a service is good, people do not object to paying for it.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister for the broad range of measures he has introduced in the area of local government reform.  I wish him well as he continues his endeavours in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  I begin by reminding the House that the common theme that has dominated our political history in the last 30 years is the Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Party&rsquo;s repeated treachery in seeking to buy elections, a policy that forced us into three recessions and culminated last year in that party ceding our economic sovereignty to the European Union and the IMF.  In 1977 the Fianna F&aacute;il Party proposed, as an election strategy, to abolish rates on property and tax on motor vehicles.  It proved a short-term success, with the party winning a huge majority under Jack Lynch, but it soon led to the Haughey era and the recession of the 1980s.  Every economist since has accepted that a tax base which excludes property tax is unsustainable and insufficiently robust in the event of an economic breakdown.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has announced that the Exchequer contribution to the local government fund will cease from 2012 and be replaced by the proceeds of the household charge.  It will be of little consolation to the households that must pay the tax, but it is important that the funding of locally delivered services is placed on a sound financial footing, with a much closer alignment between the cost of providing services and the demand for those services.  It is more important than ever that local authorities receive sufficient funding to ensure they can operate effectively across their range of functions and responsibilities.</P>
        <P>As they draw up their estimates in the coming days, local authorities throughout the State face difficult choices.  In particular, both local government and central government must be mindful of the need to minimise the burden on businesses which are struggling to survive and maintain jobs.  In this regard, the Government must give consideration to changes to the Valuation Acts which would allow local authorities flexibility in identifying sectors under pressure. <Col N="584"/> Under current legislation, they must grant a rate reduction to all ratepayers or none.  A 1% to 2% reduction is of little use to small businesses but would hugely benefit large companies such as Tesco, Aldi, Lidl and other large multinationals which already enjoy the advantage of a low corporation tax rate.</P>
        <P>Heretofore there has been an emphasis within local authorities on reductions and efficiencies to reduce costs while at the same time seeking to maintain front-line services.  However, given the huge reduction in staff numbers, it is becoming increasingly difficult to strike a balance between competing demands for resources.  Most taxes depend on economic activity which produced huge budget surpluses in the boom times.  These surpluses were spent in expanding State services with little regard to value for money.  Moreover, other taxes were reduced in order to further inflate the economy on an artificial basis.  The building boom of the last decade led to increased tax revenues but undermined the real economy.</P>
        <P>The reintroduction of a household charge was part of the deal reached by the last Government with the EU-ECB-IMF troika.  It is unfortunate that the Government is forced to introduce the tax in the midst of a severe recession.  Each of us here understands the difficulties it will cause for already struggling families.  These adjustments should have been made during the boom years.  Taxes on property introduced at the correct time would have helped us to avoid the worst effects of the building boom on the economy.</P>
        <P>It is often stated we no longer have the tools to guide the economy since joining the eurozone.  While we no longer control interest rates and devaluation policy, we do control tax policy.  That is the means by which the building boom might have been controlled and deflated.  Unfortunately, the opposite was done by previous Governments.  With the building industry now at a standstill, it is the wrong time to introduce a property tax.  However, we have no choice in the matter.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, has kept the tax to a minimum, with exemptions for those who are unable to afford it.  That the building industry was allowed to run out of control in the last ten years does not mean the Government should not support its renewal on a sensible basis.  Genuine builders, tradesmen and subcontractors need support.  A stable building industry should be producing 6% to 7% of GDP.  The Minister has recognised this by introducing several measures which will promote the industry in a sensible way and thus create jobs.</P>
        <P>The abolition of rates had several serious effects.  It meant that county and city councils had to rely on commercial rates and commercial water rates for much of their funding.  This led to an undue burden being placed on industry and the agriculture sector.  This would inevitably affect our competitiveness as a nation, costing jobs in the public sector.  These changes were manageable in a booming economy but have a serious effect in a recession.</P>
        <P>Local government is the basic building block of democracy.  It must be close to the people and communities and responsive to their needs on a day-to-day basis.  When the Fianna F&aacute;il Party decided to abolish rates and vehicle tax, it attacked the very basis of local democracy.  That funding was replaced by a central governmental grant which was gradually reduced during the years.  Central government, through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, controlled the purse strings and increasingly influenced the direction of local government.  This inevitably led to greater centralisation and less accountability.</P>
        <P>The Government is concerned to ensure local government services are delivered to communities in an efficient and effective manner.  The Minister is examining new and more effective ways of achieving efficiencies, including the sharing of services, outsourcing and co-operation, if not amalgamation of local development groups, including enterprise boards.  This reassessment and realignment will maximise the impact of investment in creating jobs at local level <Col N="585"/>and delivering front-line services.  A properly resourced local government sector is vital to local democracy.  This legislation represents a step in that direction by affording local authorities a greater degree of financial independence.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

It would be remiss of me when speaking on local government reform and the household charge not to mention him and to send our sympathies to his family and to all his friends and supporters in Milford.</P>
        <P>We are in agreement with the principle of the Bill but we must ensure that vulnerable households, low income households, are exempted from this charge.  We have been listening to history lessons from some of the speakers opposite about the abolition of rates in 1977.  It might interest them to know that between 1973 and 1977, 75% of the rates were abolished by the then Labour-Fine Gael Government.  Those parties promised, if elected, they would do away with the remaining 25%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and balanced debate.  We all deal with local government officials and we know they are courteous and efficient, by and large.  The local authority system was established 112 years ago and long-standing practices require reform.  Like my colleague, Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins, I never served on a local authority.  However, I contend that the abolition of the dual mandate was a mistake.  The connection between national and local government was lost.  Many of those who served under the dual mandate had the ability to bring issues and concerns  arising in local authority meetings to the attention of the Oireachtas.  The local authorities were then left adrift and the establishment of regional authorities added to the drift.  The role and importance of local authorities in the daily lives of communities cannot be overstated.  They provide guidance and funding to local and community groups.  The proposed reform of local government must provide a connection between local and national government.  The abolition of the town councils will not make any difference because they are probably the most effective local authority bodies and some town councils are progressive and bring in a balanced budget.  They encourage enterprise centres and play a positive role in the life of the town.  I support the commercial ratepayers in towns and those who contribute to the coffers of the local authorities.  Retail centres in towns must attract the people from the hinterland so that they spend money in the towns rather in the cities.  I suggest the Department should be very cautious about changing the planning regulations regarding large retail outlets.  It has been demonstrated in Britain and elsewhere that these large retail outlets have caused the closure of the smaller retailers in towns.  Policymakers over the years have made decisions that have resulted in small, sustainable rural communities dying out.  The Minister needs to take great <Col N="586"/>care to ensure those regulations do not cause the death of provincial towns and that these are protected.  The legislation on household charges under discussion must ensure that the most vulnerable, those on low incomes and in receipt of social welfare, those who do not have the ability to pay, are exempt from the charge.  I urge the Minister that his reform of local government should preserve the best practices of local government as well as rooting out those which are no longer suitable for this century and that any lifting of planning restrictions will not cause further suffering in small and provincial towns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss local government and the household charge.  I commend the Minister on his initial steps towards reform of local government, in particular, in Limerick and in Tipperary.  The country has too many local authorities but the bigger problem is the existence of pseudo-local authorities, such as community groups, partnerships, county enterprise boards, county development boards, organisations acting as a local authority that are not.  I commend the decision to include responsibility for the community sector in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and included in the Minister&rsquo;s brief.  I hope he will merge the two sectors together to create a streamlined process.</P>
        <P>However, the rush to abolish town councils is slightly premature.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not abolish any yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>That is good.  I will speak for my own town council.  I do not have the emotional attachment of having served on a local authority.  The programme, Better Local Government, has been criticised the length and breadth of the country and there is no doubt it has added a significant cost burden to local government.  However, Ballina Town Council is one of the winners in that we now have excellent officials who are based in the town and are planning the proper development of the town, which was not previously the case.  There are party divisions within the council but these are generally left at the door.  The nine councillors will always work together for the good of the town.  The same is true for other town councils such as in Westport where the town council has made a difference and it has acted as the development agency for the town.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty with this household charge because, in my view, we must think differently about local government.  Forcing businesses to pay for local government, as we have done since either 1973 or 1977, depending on one&rsquo;s side of the argument, is wrong and is the reason we are where we are now.  The Minister may be determined to cap the charge at &euro;100 but charges are the opposite to gravity and they go up.  People will be asked to pay for services which they may no longer be receiving.  For instance, most councils no longer provide a refuse collection service and householders must instead pay &euro;300 to a private operator.  Urban dwellers will get water for free but rural dwellers in general must pay into the group water scheme.  The roads in urban areas are well maintained but in rural areas this will become a problem due to the more severe winter weather and roads maintenance budgets are being cut.  It will be difficult to explain to people what they are getting in return for this charge.  I suggest that a summary of the services provided by local authorities be included with the invoices for the charge.  The NPPR, non-principal private residence, scheme, is a model of how local government should operate and I presume the same model will apply in this case.       People should know what services they are getting.  Residents of counties Mayo or Monaghan, for example, should be able to list the services provided by their local council, whether street lights, planning and development services or more general services.  Unless people have a connection to local government and know what they are getting for the money they are handing over, they will resent having to <Col N="587"/>pay the household charge as they believe they pay enough taxes.  If it is explained to them what their money is being spent on, the level of resentment will, I hope, be reduced.</P>
        <P>Deputy Moynihan referred to the need to provide exemptions.  It is wrong that under the proposal, a person living in a &ldquo;Downton Abbey&rdquo; style mansion will pay the same as someone living in a &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; style terrace.  Once local government has been fully reformed, the Government must introduce a tax which reflects the services people use based on the size of their residence and ability to pay.  People will want to ensure the inefficiencies that are endemic in local government are eliminated before such a system is introduced.  They will also need to be sure their money is paying for services as opposed to excesses in their local authority, for example, in staff numbers.  For this reason, the Government must continue the work it has started to reduce costs in the back office and administration sides of local government.</P>
        <P>Deputy Moynihan also referred to retail planning guidelines, which are an item on the Minister&rsquo;s agenda.  I ask the Minister to consider what has taken place in the United Kingdom because we do not want to go down the British route.  The current position meets the needs of our retail sector.  While the exemption made for IKEA has been commercially successful, we do not want a form of &ldquo;Tescoisation&rdquo; of the country, as has occurred in England where people travel for many miles to shop on Sundays because retail services have been sucked out of small towns and into larger ones.  Such a process is not good for rural or urban living, consumer choice or prices.</P>
        <P>Let us challenge local government.  I accept that this is an easy argument for me to make given that I, unlike most Deputies, did not serve my political apprenticeship in a local authority and do not therefore have an emotional attachment to the system.  Every local authority must ask what is its purpose and what is it adding to the equation.  They must be given an opportunity to prove themselves or leave the stage.</P>
        <P>We have heard discussion about super regional authorities.  I cannot imagine a Kilkenny man and Laois man or Mayo man and Galway man agreeing on what is good for their respective regions.  County loyalties and parish boundaries in Ireland do not conform to European norms and for this reason super regional authorities will not work.  When we define the role of local government and the business it is involved in we must devise a structure to allow it to deliver properly.</P>
        <P>It strikes me as strange that a city of 1 million people has four local authorities, all of which display signs at their boundaries informing people that they are entering such and such a county council area.  Despite this, they all don the same jersey on the third Sunday in September.  Perhaps the GAA is a model of how to operate efficiently.  While the introduction of the current structures 20 years ago was probably well intentioned, we must ask whether these structures are delivering.  Do we need four local authorities to deliver services in a city as small in international and comparative terms as Dublin?  A similar question must be asked in areas which have city and borough councils or city and county councils.</P>
        <P>On retail planning, we are stuck in a rut in respect of business rates.  The reform of the valuation system is too slow and must be transformed.  That is the fault of previous Governments but the current Government has an opportunity to do something about it.  The Minister should start from scratch.  I receive replies to parliamentary questions which suggest people are comfortable with the prospect that it will take ten years to complete the valuation process.  This is not good enough given that many businesses have the remaining ten days before Christmas to generate sufficient income to enable them to continue to operate in January and February.  As Deputies Niall Collins and Michael Moynihan noted, it is ridiculous that councils do not have the flexibility to offer specific rates to companies establishing a business in a certain town or offer discounts to firms which agree to employ a certain number of staff.  If we want local <Col N="588"/>authorities to have a local economic development role, they must have the power to give businesses in their respective areas a break.  They do not have the flexibility in the area of development charges and rates that is required for a modern business model.  I ask the Government to make this an urgent priority in its local government reform programme.</P>
        <P>The Department is in a comfort zone on the issue of the valuation process because it has been completed in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Dublin and will be rolled out nationwide over the next ten years.  We must collectively challenge this comfort zone by starting again and delivering a completed valuation process in 18 months or two years.  The 2014 local government elections will take place in two and a half years.  This is a short period which will fly by.  Unless we have a completely new model of local government by 2014, the recent trend of low turnouts at local government elections will continue because people will believe voting at local level does not matter.  It does matter, however, because local government is the coalface of government.</P>
        <P>In two and a half years, when people go through their wallets they will have a closer connection to local government than is currently the case.  They must be convinced that local government makes a difference in their daily lives and is relevant to them.  As the Minister implements the legislation and bills for local government charges are sent out in the coming months, he has an opportunity to drive home this message and show people what they will receive for the charges they are paying, as is done on invoices in other areas.  I hope the reforms on which he is embarking will be in place before the 2014 local elections in order that people are given time to buy into them.  I also hope that when we come to vote in June 2014 the electorate will vote for a system that has been transformed and become much more effective.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Deputy Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to reform local government and make it work for citizens.  Having been the Fine Gael Party spokesperson on environment and local government while in opposition, he knows the issues inside out.  It would have been useful if Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies had remained for the debate given that their party is the only political party represented in the House which has experience of a valuation system and household charges.  For this reason, Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position on this issue would have been very useful.  I fully support the Bill.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the amount paid by my Department to external consultants during each of the past six years, the names of the consultants and the type of work they were contracted to do is contained in the tabular statement.  This information excludes the Defence Forces. The data relating to the Defence Forces is currently being compiled and will be provided to the Deputy as soon as possible.  The objective of using external consultants is to ensure that my Department achieves value for money and maximises efficiency and effectiveness. My Department engages the services of external consultants only when there is a clear need for specialised expertise and following a rigorous examination of skills and resources available in-house. My Department is always mindful of the costs involved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 66 together.</P>
        <P>My priority as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible.  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces will continue to have the necessary resources to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government <Col N="592"/>including provision of assistance to the civil authorities in any emergency situations that might arise.</P>
        <P>Whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they will continue to provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a severe weather emergency in an Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role under the multi-agency Framework.</P>
        <P>The various procedures that are in place, both nationally and locally, were seen to operate very effectively last Winter as the Defence Forces made all assets, resources and capabilities available to the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning and responded to all requests for assistance received from the civil authorities during the period of severe weather which ran from 27 November to 26 December 2010.</P>
        <P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force at the end of that period (2010) was 9,550 and at 30 November last, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength was 9,460 personnel.  I am committed to maintaining the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at or around 9,500 personnel.  Whilst it can be difficult to estimate precisely how many personnel will retire for reasons other than on age grounds, based on the latest available information (30 November) I can state that 53 officers and 437 enlisted personnel have submitted applications to retire or to be discharged from the Defence Forces on dates prior to 1 March 2012.</P>
        <P>The extent of these retirements and discharges must however be counter-balanced by the fact that it has been possible to carry out some recruitment this year.  To date, 32 Officers and 491 enlisted personnel have been recruited and it is anticipated that a further 39 enlisted personnel will be recruited before the end of this current year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of personnel that can be recruited to the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve is dependent on the level of funding available for training.  The level of resourcing available for Defence has reduced significantly over recent years.  The funds available for paid training days for members of the Reserve have been cut from &euro;4.96 million in 2009 to &euro;2.48 million in 2011.  This provided for approximately 30,000 paid training mandays in 2011. </P>
        <P>These paid training days provided targeted development training for existing members of the Reserve including career courses and skills courses.</P>
        <P>In addition, it was possible to provide for the training of 200 new recruits to the RDF. This level of recruitment was agreed in consultation with the Military Authorities, having regard to the requirement to maintain the existing capabilities of the Reserve to the greatest extent possible.</P>
        <P>The number of personnel that may be recruited in the coming year or future years has not been determined as yet. Officials from the Department are due to meet with the Acting Director of Reserve Forces in the coming week to discuss the training priorities within the Reserve over the coming year and to determine the level of recruitment that can be accommodated within the available resource envelope.</P>

	<P>The number of persons currently employed within the Naval Service Diving Section (NSDS) is eleven.  The establishment for the Naval Service Diving Section is twenty three.  As the Naval Service Diving Section can cater for a maximum of 12 students per course, and only one course is held annually, the maximum number of students that could be trained over the next two years is twenty four. Naval Service operational requirements will dictate the number of students who can be released at one time to attend this course, and therefore it is not possible at this juncture to say how many will be released to attend over the next 2 years.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>In February 1997 the then Minister for Defence set out policy on married quarters on the basis that they were largely an anachronism and that they should be discontinued in a managed and orderly way.  At that time there were 500 married quarters of which 380 were occupied.    In the intervening period over 150 quarters located outside of barracks have been sold to occupants while many more have been demolished or converted to other uses.</P>
        <P>As of now the stock of married quarters stands at 95 occupied premises.  A number of other former quarters are vacant pending a decision on conversion to other military use or demolition. 48 of these quarters are occupied by serving members of the Defence Forces or members of the chaplaincy service.  The remaining 47 continue to be occupied by &ldquo;overholders&rdquo;, a phrase used to describe people who did not vacate the property on their retirement or resignation from the Defence Forces as required under Defence Force Regulations. A number of these are in the process of buying the properties which are outside of barracks.</P>
        <P>As part of the process of discontinuing the use of married quarters my Department will, in the near future, be addressing the remaining overholder issue.  This will see a small number of <Col N="594"/>people being granted continued occupancy of the properties for the remainder of their lives.  In the other cases the Department will be beginning the process of seeking vacant possession of the properties.  The first phase of this will involve those concerned being, yet again, made aware of their responsibility to vacate the quarters and advised of the need for them to make alternative arrangements.  The Department will provide supporting material to those applying for Local Authority housing.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties. All promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit.   A number of initiatives have been taken in recent years. In 2006 the minimum height requirement for joining the Defence Forces was reduced from 5 ft. 4 in. to 5 ft. 2 in. This increased the potential recruitment pool of females from 60% to 90% of female population.</P>
        <P>In 2007, the Department of Defence received the report of a TNS/MRBI study it had commissioned, titled &ldquo;Retention and Recruitment of Women in The Defence Forces&rdquo;. This research was commissioned with a view to identifying areas where action could be taken to maximise the number of women applicants to the Defence Forces, hence increasing the number joining.  The question of retention was also studied.</P>
        <P>The results of the research were, on balance, positive. Three-quarters of serving women agreed that the Defence Forces are a good place to work.  In addition there was a very high level of satisfaction (70%-80%) expressed as regards the issues of job security, pay and benefits and the variety of work on offer.</P>
        <P>The recommendations of the report on the issue of attracting and retaining women are being implemented and the challenges identified therein continue to be addressed. Those challenges include raising the profile of a career for women in the Defence Forces in their recruitment campaigns, promoting a dual gender image and providing education to career guidance teachers on the role of women in the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces on the direction of the Chief of Staff is establishing a Working Group to examine levels of female participation in the organisation. The Working Group will, <i>inter alia</i>  , inquire into why women apply or do not apply for positions within the Defence Forces and what can be done to increase awareness among the female population of a career in the Defence Forces. The data gathered from the review will be used to formulate new policies in this area, specifically aimed at increasing female participation in the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The number of female personnel serving in the Permanent Defence Force on 30 November 2011, the last date for which figures are available, was 565, of which 468 were serving in the Army, 31 in the Air Corps and 66 in the Naval Service. In terms of ranks the breakdown of female personnel serving on 31 October 2011 was 146 Officers, 186 Non Commissioned Officers and 228 Privates and 5 Cadets. The percentage of female personnel serving on 31 October 2011 was 5.98% of the overall strength of the Force on that date. This compares favourably with <Col N="595"/>2000 when 4.08% of personnel were female.  I also understand that of the 240 recruits currently being inducted to the Permanent Defence Force, 4 are female.</P>

	<P>I am satisfied that the Civil Defence organisation continues to be in a position to train and equip volunteers to a very high standard. In accordance with the Framework for Major Emergency Management, which identifies a wide role for Civil Defence in emergency response, the strategies identified by the Civil Defence Board place a high priority on the organisation&rsquo;s ability to respond effectively to severe weather and other types of emergencies. </P>
        <P>A recent programme of seven Regional Exercises, augmented by specific training courses delivered through the Civil Defence College in areas such as Water Awareness, Advanced Driving Instruction and the qualification of over 120 additional Emergency Technicians in the Casualty Service, has greatly enhanced the capability of Civil Defence to respond to severe weather emergencies. The purchase during 2011 of floating walkway systems, waterproof radio sets, additional four-wheel-drive vehicles and a second all-terrain vehicle have also enhanced the organisation&rsquo;s capability in this regard.    As the Minister for Defence has previously outlined to this House, during the serious flooding conditions that were experienced in counties Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Monaghan in October of this year, over 200 Civil Defence volunteers responded, at very short notice, to a wide range of calls for assistance from front-line service providers.</P>
        <P>The organisation&rsquo;s capability was also seen to operate very effectively during the severe weather events of the last two winters as volunteers responded to requests for assistance from the Garda&iacute;, local authorities and the HSE.</P>
        <P>The recently published Report on the Review of the Response to Exceptional Severe Weather Events of 2009-2010 highlighted in very positive terms the role that Civil Defence played in the response.</P>

	<P>The first White Paper on Defence was intended to encompass the period to end 2010. Having considered the preliminary work undertaken on the preparation of a new White Paper, I decided in September 2011 to expand the planned consultative process by initiating the preparation of a Green Paper on Defence. The intention is that this will act as a catalyst to ensure an appropriate level of debate on Defence.   The priority in my Department in recent months has been the completion of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in Defence. Arising from the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure I have announced a re-organisation of the Defence Forces including the movement from three to two brigades. Obviously, these tasks have drawn from the resources in the Department targeted to work on the development of the Green Paper. </P>
        <P>The outcome of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and budget 2012 have provided a necessary degree of clarity in respect of the resources that will be available to Defence in the short to medium term.</P>
        <P>This will frame the policy options available and inform the Green Paper consultative process, which I expect to be launched in the first quarter of 2012.</P>

        <P>Special Advisers are appointed under the terms of Section 11 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997 and are required to perform any duties that may be assigned to them from time-to-time by the relevant Minister as appropriate to the position held.  Those duties include providing advice as well as monitoring, facilitating and assisting in the achievement of Departmental objectives.    The Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 and the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour apply to the post-holders.  The restrictions under the terms of the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour on civil servants engaging in political activity do not apply to Special Advisers and they can engage in political activity or join political parties if they wish.

	<P>Ireland and its EU partners are committed to enhancing stability in the Western Balkans.  The EU perspective for the countries in the region, as agreed at the June 2003 Thessaloniki European Council, is essential in helping to build and maintain this stability. The EU will remain engaged in assisting the countries in the region to undertake the reforms necessary to move forward in their path to the EU.  At the European Council meeting of 9 December last, Heads of State and Government of the European Union noted the considerable progress Serbia has made towards fulfilling the political criteria set by the Copenhagen European Council and the Stabilisation and Association Process requirements and the fact that a fully satisfactory level in its co-operation with ICTY has been reached.  The European Council welcomed that Serbia has re-engaged in the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue and that it is moving forward with implementation of agreements in good faith.  It also welcomed the Agreement on Integrated Border Management. </P>
        <P>With a view to granting Serbia the status of candidate country, the European Council tasked the Council of Ministers to examine and confirm that Serbia has continued to show credible commitment and has achieved further progress in moving forward with the implementation in good faith of agreements reached in the dialogue, including on Integrated Border Management; that it has reached an agreement on inclusive regional co-operation and that it has actively cooperated to enable EULEX (European Union Rule of Law Mission) and KFOR (Kosovo Force) to execute their mandates.  In the light of its examination, the Council of Ministers will take a decision in February 2012 on granting Serbia candidate status, to be confirmed by the March European Council.  With regard to difficulties on the border between Kosovo and Serbia, it is essential that the Government in Belgrade does everything possible to persuade the ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo to desist from provocative acts.</P>

	<P>The Joint Committee of the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission presented their advice for a Charter of Rights for the island of Ireland earlier this year.  This was in accordance with the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.   The advice of the Joint Committee was delivered to the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Ceann Comhairle, who passed the advice to all the political parties in both jurisdictions for their consideration.  According to the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the Charter of Rights would be for signature by the political parties.  At the time the advice was presented, I expressed my gratitude to the Joint Committee for their work on the Charter of Rights and welcomed their input.  This advice should be given serious consideration by all the political parties on the island of Ireland.  I urge my colleagues here and in the Northern Ireland Assembly to make every effort to progress this important document.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that I have been planning an official visit to the region.  I hope this may be possible early in 2012.  My primary purpose will be to meet the parties in relation to the Middle East Peace Process, to hear from them the prospects and obstacles as they see them and to encourage them to commit seriously to this effort.  I will look at some of the issues on the ground and develop Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relationships in the region.  My visit will therefore involve elements in both Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.  I would also intend if possible to visit Gaza.  It is not an absolute requirement to combine all these elements in a single visit, but it makes practical sense to do so if possible.  It is clearly essential that as Foreign Minister I speak to and hear from both sides.  I am not at this point aware of other Ministerial visits to Israel which may be planned for 2012.  I will, however, encourage colleagues who are planning such visits to meet, if they can, with relevant counterparts in the Palestinian Authority as well as with representatives of the Israeli government.  I will also encourage visits to the occupied Palestinian Territories.  The Government will use all the contacts we have with Israel and the Palestinian Authority to underline our support for a lasting resolution of the conflict and for a peaceful and prosperous future for both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.</P>

Section 5.4 of the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour excludes staff holding temporary unestablished positions and whose tenure is coterminous with that of the relevant Minister from the restrictions on engaging in political activity as set out in section 5 of the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour.</P>

        <Quest> the reason a State-owned bank, PTSB, is charging its standard variable rate customers 6.5% APR which may be reduced to 5.9% after the ECB rate is implemented who are being funded in large part by the European Central Bank which is currently charging them 1.25%; if he has asked the board to review the interest rate charged; if he has asked the Central Bank of Ireland to assess the means by which PTSB sets SVRs; the reason rate charged by the State owned bank is higher than the rate charged by all the non-State owned banks including the Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and others; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I have not asked the PTSB board to review its mortgage interest rates.  Neither the Central Bank nor I, as Minister for Finance, have a statutory role in the setting of interest rates charged or paid by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank.  Ultimately, the pricing of financial products, including variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the respective management teams and boards of the banks having given due regard to its customers and the impact on the profitability of the bank, particularly as their cost of funding, including deposit pricing, is under pressure.  The Central Bank has informed me that, using its existing powers, it will engage with lenders that appear to have standard variable mortgage rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds.  Credit institutions are not primarily or always funded from the ECB, but rather from a wide variety of sources.  In relation to the current rates charged by PTSB, I understand it will charge 5.19% on all standard variable rates following the ECB rate cut on 8 December 2011.</P>

	<P>The position is that cohabitating couples are expressly recognised for the purpose of social welfare law but are not recognised for the purposes of Income Tax law.  Although this may appear contradictory, the main aim of both the welfare code and the tax code is to uphold the constitutional right of married couples not to be treated less favourably than unmarried couples.  The basis for the current tax treatment <Col N="604"/>of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v</i>. the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland <i>v</i>. Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.  In the particular circumstances outlined, where a couple is cohabiting rather than married, they are treated as separate and unconnected individuals for the purpose of Income Tax.  Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes and, accordingly, credits and bands cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  On that basis, the main tax credits available to a person in the circumstances set out in the details supplied are the single person&rsquo;s tax credit of &euro;1,650 and the employee tax credit of &euro;1,650.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that this question may relate to the flexible options on retirement first introduced in Finance Act 1999.  Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension under a defined contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract was required to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the appropriate tax-free lump sum. Finance Act 1999 introduced significant changes which gave a considerable degree of control, flexibility and personal choice to certain categories of individuals in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans. <Col N="606"/> These choices include the options to purchase an annuity, to receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions.    </P>
        <P>Access to these flexible options was extended to all main benefits from retirement benefit schemes (other than Defined Benefit arrangements) in Finance Act 2011.  The changes made in Finance Act 2011 have particular relevance for ordinary members of occupational DC pension schemes in respect of the main benefits from such schemes, as up to the passing of the Act, the only option available to them in respect of those benefits had been the purchase of a retirement annuity after taking the tax-free lump sum.  These individuals now have the choices referred to above depending on their particular circumstances. It should be borne in mind, however, that the option to invest in an ARF or AMRF as opposed to purchasing an annuity may not be appropriate for everyone.</P>
        <P>Under the regime the options to</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />invest in an ARF, or</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate) are subject to conditions.  The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (specified income) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised.  Finance Act 2011 increased the guaranteed level of pension income required from the previous fixed amount of &euro;12,700 introduced in 1999, to a variable amount equal to 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) bringing the &ldquo;specified income&rdquo; limit to &euro;18,000 per annum at present.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of the specified income limit is to ensure, before an individual has unfettered access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF for example, that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed income throughout their retirement.  The change to the specified income limit introduced in Finance Act 2011 was strongly signalled in the National Pensions Framework published in March 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an AMRF must be chosen into which a &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount must be invested from the pension fund equal to 10 times the maximum annual rate of State Pension (Contributory) &mdash; &euro;119,800 at present &mdash; or the remainder of the pension fund, after taking the tax-free lump sum, if less. Prior to Finance Act 2011, the &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount was fixed at the first &euro;63,500 of the pension fund or the remainder of the fund after the tax-free lump sum, if less than that amount.  The purpose of an AMRF is to ensure a capital or income &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; throughout the period of their retirement for individuals with pension income below the specified income limit.  The funds in an AMRF can be used by the owner at any time to purchase an annuity.  On death of the AMRF owner, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF and any remaining funds may be passed on in a tax efficient way to a surviving spouse and/or children.</P>
        <P>Prior to Finance Act 2011, if the minimum specified income test was not met at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option was exercised and the individual placed a &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount in an AMRF, that capital sum was effectively &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; and could not be accessed by the individual, other than to purchase an annuity, until he or she reached 75 years of age (at which point the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF) though any income generated by the fund could be drawn down subject to tax.  This was the position even if the minimum <Col N="607"/>specified income test was met after retirement.  Finance Act 2011 changed this rule so that where the minimum specified income test is met at any time after retirement and before age 75, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF with full access to the funds.</P>
        <P>The Budget and Finance Act 2011 changes seek to ensure that those in pension arrangements to whom the flexible ARF options on retirement have been extended will have choices which best suit their particular circumstances.  In making the changes, however, there was also a concern to ensure that the parameters and rules governing the extension are set in a way that avoids an increase in the risk of income poverty in old age.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Capital Gains Tax (CGT) initiative I announced in the Budget is a relief from CGT on the disposal of certain property, where that property is bought during the &ldquo;incentive period&rdquo; from 7 December 2011 to 31 December 2013 and is held for seven years.  The relief will apply to all property, whether residential or non-residential.     The relief will not apply if a property is sold within seven years of its acquisition.  If it is sold more than seven years after acquisition and a gain is made on the sale, relief will be given for the initial seven year holding period.  For example, if the property was bought in January 2012 and sold in January 2022, the property would have been held for ten years, so seven tenths of any gain will be relieved from CGT and three tenths is taxable.  If the property is held for 50 years, as per the Deputy&rsquo;s question, seven fiftieths of the gain will relieved from CGT and 43 fiftieths will be taxable.</P>
        <P>There will be no cost to the Exchequer from the scheme in the next seven years, because the relief cannot be claimed until a property bought in the incentive period is owned for at least seven years.  It is not possible to project how much CGT relief will be given after that date, because the number of cases in which relief can be claimed is dependent on the number of properties purchased within the incentive period, and the relief will vary in every case depending on the value of the property on its disposal and the date of the disposal.</P>
        <P>Together with the reduction in the rate of Stamp Duty on non-residential property to 2%, which I also announced in the Budget, the measure is intended to stimulate the property market.  While there may be a cost to the measure itself in the long term, the intended stimulus effect should lead to additional employment, activity and revenue to the State from other taxes in the short term.</P>
        <P>Full details of the measure will be contained in the Finance Bill.</P>

As this claim relates to the year 2006, it is outside the 4-year time limit for the making of claims for repayment of tax, a rule which is expressly prescribed by Section 865 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  </P>
        <P>I am also advised by the Commissioners that there is no record of a request for a P21 in 2006.</P>

        <Quest>  if the relief for energy efficiency measures to the maximum value of &euro;10,000 announced in budget 2011 will be honoured in 2012 to award credits to members of the public who undertook such work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 13 of Finance Act 2011 provided for income tax relief at the standard rate for expenditure incurred by individuals on a range of works carried out to improve the energy efficiency of residential premises situated in the State.  The underpinning legislation for the scheme was subject to Commencement Order.  However, that legislation, on review, was found to have flaws and would have required amendment before it could be implemented.</P>
        <P>As part of the announcement in the Jobs Initiative, the Government undertook to provide further funding for the grants available under the Better Energy Homes scheme operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Because of these circumstances, I decided to review the requirement for a co-existing tax incentive for similar works and, following this review, I decided not to proceed with the introduction of the tax relief scheme.</P>
        <P>It is worth pointing out that it was never envisaged that individuals could qualify for both the grants and the proposed tax relief.  Refocusing the funding such that it is provided via the grants scheme clarifies Government support measures for energy efficiency works.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 108 together.</P>
        <P>Since I took office I have appointed 2 Special Advisers, a Personal Assistant and a Personal Secretary in accordance with the revised conditions for Ministerial Appointments as published by the Department of Finance on the 24th, March 2011.  The Minister of State at my Department has similarly appointed a Personal Secretary and Personal Assistant.  The tabular statement gives details of the Ministerial appointments made at my Department earlier this year <Col N="611"/>together with details of their current salaries.  They were placed on the appropriate point of the salary scale proximate to the earnings they were in receipt of in their former employment.</P>
        <P>In relation to their political activities or affiliations, I am not in a position to give details as it is not open to me to request the appointees to provide this information.  However, the Deputy should note that the restrictions which have traditionally been imposed on civil servants engaging in political activity under Paragraph 5.4 of the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour do not apply to Ministerial Staff holding temporary unestablished positions and whose tenure is coterminous with that of the relevant Minister.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the terms of the Ethics in Public Office Acts copies of the appointees&rsquo; contracts of employment together with details of the Special Advisers qualifications were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the 28th, October 2011.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>While difficult choices had to be made to identify savings across my Department&rsquo;s budget, the Government has tried to protect front line services in 2012.</P>
        <P>The Government has protected the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, prioritised targeted support for the most disadvantaged schools and maintained the overall number of resource teachers and SNAs to support children with special needs.</P>
        <P>Until now, a specific resource was provided to all second-level schools for guidance in addition to the standard teacher allocation. In future, schools must meet their guidance requirements from within the overall resource provided by the normal staffing schedule. Individually schools can continue to make provision for guidance and counselling. Decisions on how this will be done will be taken at school level in the best interests of students and to ensure the best use of resources available. I am confident school management and teachers will continue to work together to meet the needs of the students in their care.</P><Col N="613"/>
        <P>In this way, the main teacher allocation can be maintained at 19:1 for schools generally, while schools will have discretion to balance what they allocate for guidance against the competing demands of providing subject choice. The change that has been announced gives schools greater autonomy in how they allocate staff resources to best meet the needs of their students.  I have also provided for the filling of 300 Assistant Principal posts in second-level schools over the level originally planned. This will ensure that schools have sufficient management positions to ensure appropriate supports are available for all students. This is an important change which will reduce the impact of the moratorium on the filling of posts of responsibility in second level schools.</P>
        <P>A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS will be given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools.</P>
        <P>Psychologists from my Department&rsquo;s national educational psychological service NEPS, are present in schools across the country and provide a range of supports. These include the promotion of positive mental health among the general student body and assistance in supporting pupils with particular social, emotional or behavioural difficulties. The NEPS also encourages the development of structures among teachers and schools care teams.</P>
        <P>The change to guidance allocations must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times.  My Department will be notifying schools of the impact of the budget changes in January, 2012.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide further details on the specific analysis on tuition fee income available to schools and its utilisation in the Protestant fee-charging schools; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many Protestant fee-charging schools have significant additional expenses because they must <Col N="614"/>be run as boarding schools to cater for the geographically dispersed Protestant population; if his further attention has been drawn to the fact that almost half of the Protestant students in fee-charging schools come from households whose disposable income is so low that they qualify for a grant and that fee-charging boarding schools is often the only feasible way to provide a Protestant ethos secondary education; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked my officials to conduct an analysis of the potential extent and nature of the Exchequer investment, including funding for teacher posts, in the fee-charging schools.</P>
        <P>The specific analysis to be conducted by my Department will involve looking at the level of the tuition fee income based on fee rates and pupil numbers. It will take account of Exchequer investment foregone (in teacher allocations and recurrent grants) because the school is charging fees. In this way the additional or discretionary income available to fee charging schools relative to other schools can be assessed. It will then involve some dialogue with schools to confirm the information and each fee charging school will have the opportunity to identify if there are certain individual factors which may limit their freedom to use this discretionary income  &mdash; e.g., mortgages entered into for capital developments or other verifiable liabilities.  This process will apply to all fee charging schools.</P>
        <P>In relation to the other points made by the Deputy in relation to provision for Protestant students I want to assure the Deputy that the Government is fully conscious that maintaining a network of schools is important if students from minority denominations are to be enabled attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos, while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements for those schools are in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
        <P>I should clarify for the Deputy that schools may charge for boarding facilities and still be classified as in the &ldquo;free scheme&rdquo; where they get the additional funding and teacher resources payable to all second level schools that do not charge tuition fees.</P>
        <P>There are at present two second level schools serving the needs of Protestant children where boarding facilities are provided and where tuition fees are not charged.  One of those schools ceased to charge fees in the past year and now has access to the grants and teaching resource allocations available to second level schools generally. My Department worked with the school concerned to facilitate its transition from the fee charging sector.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> if he will outline in detail where the 428 posts which were allocated to schools under legacy programmes prior to the roll-out of the DEIS initiative in 2005 which are due to be phased out are based. </Quest>
        <QRef>[39532/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the scale of our economic crisis, adjustments have had to be made across all areas of the public sector. Despite this challenge, the Government has sought to do this in as fair a way as possible.</P>
        <P>We have protected the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, prioritised targeted support for the most disadvantaged schools and maintained the overall number of resource teachers and SNAs to support children with special needs.</P>
        <P>While DEIS schools are not immune to budgetary measures, a key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.</P><Col N="615"/>
        <P>The new staffing schedule for DEIS Band 1 primary schools, which now gives greater autonomy to schools, will operate on a general average of 1 teacher for every 22 pupils. This simplifies the existing system whereby schools are given a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; allocation to support lower class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes. DEIS post-primary schools will be targeted for additional support through an improved staffing schedule of 18.25:1, which is a 0.75 point improvement compared to the existing standard 19:1 that applies in post-primary schools that do not charge fees (or compared to the 21:1 ratio that will apply in fee-charging schools).</P>
        <P>In order to ensure fairness in the distribution of resources available under the DEIS plan, it is no longer possible to allow some schools to retain legacy posts on a concessionary basis that predate the introduction of DEIS. A range of measures has been announced to withdraw supports (428 posts) from earlier disadvantage programmes/schemes in 270 primary schools and 163 post primary schools, both DEIS and Non-DEIS that exceed what equivalent schools are entitled to under DEIS or to which non-DEIS schools are not entitled. These measures will take effect from the 2012/13 school year. The breakdown of these legacy posts are: &mdash; 38 concessionary teaching posts will be withdrawn from 15 non-DEIS primary schools previously in Giving Children an Even Break Programme and who retained a reduced PTR of 20:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes.- 102 concessionary posts will be withdrawn from 52 Urban Band 2 DEIS schools previously in the Giving Children an Even Break Programme and who had a reduced PTR of 20:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes.- 43 Support Teacher Posts will be withdrawn from 48 primary schools (45 DEIS and 3 Non DEIS)- 45 concessionary posts will be withdrawn from 32 DEIS Schools previously in the Breaking the Cycle Programme and who had a reduced PTR of 15:1 at the junior classes- 64 concessionary posts in 59 primary schools and 136 posts in 163 post-primary schools will be withdrawn from DEIS schools previously in the Disadvantaged Area Scheme.</P>
        <P>Some alleviation measures will be available for those schools considered to be most acutely affected by these changes. Schools will be notified in January 2012 of their staffing entitlements under the new arrangement for 2012/13, including any alleviation measures that may apply.  The Government&rsquo;s protection of schools serving disadvantaged areas is further underlined by the maintenance of &euro;13 million in enhanced funding for DEIS schools, &euro;2 million in school book funding for DEIS schools, as well as a &euro;26 million investment in the Home School Community Liaison scheme. All of these areas have been protected from reductions in expenditure for 2012.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 139, 142, 168 to 170, inclusive together.</P>
        <P>As part of the Budget decisions announced last week, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.   The schools concerned are those with four or less classroom teachers.  The pupil thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools (disadvantage schools) are not as high as they reflect the newly introduced 22:1 staffing schedule. Reduced pupil thresholds will continue to apply in respect of schools that are the only primary school on an island.  It is important to emphasise that no small schools will be closed due to the changes that have been announced.</P>
        <P>The phased adjustment is estimated to yield a saving of 250 teaching posts over the next three years, with 100 of these posts being removed in 2012/13  school year.  The resulting surplus teachers will be redeployed to vacancies in other neighbouring schools in accordance with the redeployment arrangements.</P>
        <P>The phasing of these measures provides the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  We have a very significant number of small schools across the country.   Due to the way the staffing schedule works at present, small primary schools benefit from significantly lower pupil teacher ratios than larger primary schools. While the staffing schedule operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils the ratios for small schools are significantly better. This is particularly evident for schools that are at or just above the minimum pupil thresholds for the appointment of classroom teachers. For example, the minimum pupil threshold for the <Col N="617"/>appointment of the second teacher in a 2-teacher school is currently 12 pupils.  This means that this school has an average of 6 pupils in each of its 2 classes.  The changes that we are introducing will mean that in September 2012 a minimum of 14 pupils will be required for the appointment of the second teacher in the 2 teacher school. The subsequent increases in September 2013 and September 2014 will increase this minimum pupil threshold to 20 pupils.  Even when all of these phased increases are implemented the threshold will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that were required for the appointment of the second teacher in schools prior to the mid 1990&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>The existing staffing schedule also acts as a disincentive for small schools to consider amalgamation.  We have to ensure that the very valuable but limited resources we have available in the system are used in the best and fairest way across the whole system.  It is important to emphasise that no small schools will be closed due to the changes that have been announced.   It is not necessarily the case that capital investment would be required if schools decided to amalgamate &mdash; particularly with the relatively small number of pupils in these schools. All areas of public spending have had to experience some adjustment given the scale of our economic crisis.  Despite this challenge, the Government has sought to do this in as fair a way as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 to 119, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>While there is no basis in law, catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960&rsquo;s and were determined following consultation with local educational interests. For planning purposes the country was divided into geographic districts each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. The intention was and continues to be that these defined districts facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs.</P>
        <P>Enrolment in individual post-primary schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that earlier this year, I launched a discussion paper on school enrolment.  The document, &ldquo;Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment&rdquo; contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent.</P><Col N="618"/>
        <P>I wish to make clear that the paper was not meant to be prescriptive, nor have any decisions been made as to what elements will be contained in any final regulations or legislation.  The purpose of the paper was to lead and provoke debate on enrolment policies and practices.</P>
        <P>I invited education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department by 28 of October last and my officials are now co-ordination the submissions received. The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment.</P>

	<P>The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place  in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the <Col N="619"/>enrolment policy on  which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 149 and 164 together.</P>
        <P>The Statistics section of my Department&rsquo;s website contains class size data at individual primary school level in county order for the 2010/2011 school year. The source of this data is the National School Annual Census. Statistical information in respect of the current school year is currently being compiled in my Department and is due for publication in September 2012.</P><Col N="620"/>
        <P>As you will be aware from the budget announcements, there is no increase in the general average of 28:1 for the allocation of classroom teachers at primary level. The relevant appointment and retention figures for mainstream staffing has been published on the Department&rsquo;s website. However, the staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of other budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process. The reform of the allocation process is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools so there will inevitably be some schools that will lose posts and some schools that will gain posts.</P>
        <P>My Department will be notifying schools in January of the new staffing arrangements for 2012/13 school year.</P>

	<P>Applications have been received from 31 primary schools in Co Kerry for school extensions. In addition, applications have been received from a further 7 primary schools for new replacement school buildings  Details of the schools concerned are attached for the Deputy&rsquo;s information.  The current status of all projects on the school building programme, including those in County Kerry, may be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i> and this will be updated on an ongoing basis.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government&rsquo;s Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework, which was published on 10 November 2011, sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years. The priority now is to focus on major school projects and smaller projects devolved to schools to meet the demographic demands. The primary aim will be to ensure that every child will have access to a school place. I recently announced that a school building construction programme for 2012 will be published this month and that a 5 year construction programme will be announced in the New Year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos 127 and 128 together.</P>
        <P>Major applications have been received from 38 primary schools and 11 post primary schools in Co Kerry for extension projects or replacement of accommodation. In some cases school applications may involve, without specific reference, the replacement of some or all of the school&rsquo;s existing prefabricated accommodation, both rented and owned. Accordingly, information about the level of such accommodation is not readily available. The current status of all projects on the school building programme, including those in County Kerry, may be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i> and this will be updated on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>In addition, 2 primary schools in County Kerry applied this year to replace prefabricated accommodation with permanent accommodation.  No such applications have been received from post primary schools. Details of the two primary schools concerned are attached for the Deputy&rsquo;s information. The application by one of the schools was unsuccessful as the accom<Col N="622"/>modation at the school was deemed adequate to meet the needs of its pupils. Funding had previously been approved for this school to provide for a permanent extension of two mainstream classrooms to replace some temporary accommodation.  In the case of the other application, this school was approved significant funding to provide a permanent extension to replace two mainstream classrooms.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is a lack of adequate disabled access facilities at a college (details supplied), that there is no lift or escalator for ease of access from the third to fourth floor, that there is no wheelchair friendly toilet facility at the campus; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that students with disability needs are dissuaded from attending the college; and the plans he has to rectify the situation. </Quest>

	<P>My Department has no record of having received an application for the works referenced by the Deputy.  However I wish to advise the Deputy that the College, referred to by him, has received substantial funding from my Department in recent years.  In 2006, &euro;205,910 was provided to the College in question under the Summer Works Scheme 2006 for improvement works to facilitate disabled access.  In addition, the College has also benefited from significant funding under my Department&rsquo;s Emergency Works Scheme &mdash; in 2009, a grant of &euro;364,612 was provided to upgrade the Electrical System as well as &euro;542,640 in 2010 for Roof Works.</P>
        <P>It is open to the facility to consider if it qualifies for grant under my Department&rsquo;s Emergency Works Scheme.  The purpose of the Scheme is solely for unforeseen emergencies or to provide funding to facilitate inclusion and access for special needs pupils.  An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and in the case of a school if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.  Details of the Scheme are available on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Grant assistance remains available to postgraduate students on a more limited basis.  The primary motivation for the Government in taking very difficult budgetary decisions is to retrieve our economic sovereignty and put the economy on a road to recovery.  In closing the gap between revenue and spending, unpalatable savings measures are necessary and savings for student supports were inevitable as part of that.  Given the growth in demand for participation in third level, the Government has endeavoured, to the greatest extent possible, to protect disadvantaged students.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I have adopted a fees only contribution at postgraduate level but this will continue to provide support for a relatively wide number of post-graduate students.  While there would be no maintenance payments, all &lsquo;special rate&rsquo; students will have their fees paid while another 4,000 students will receive a fee contribution of &euro;2,000.  In access terms, the requirement to pay a fee would be likely to be a greater obstacle to entry than lack of maintenance support.  This approach has enabled me to ensure that substantial allocations continue to be made to students from lower income backgrounds to achieve an under-graduate qualification to improve their job opportunities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 140 together.</P>
        <P>While difficult choices had to be made to identify savings across my Department&rsquo;s budget, the Government has tried to protect front line services in 2012.  The Government has protected the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, prioritised targeted support for the most disadvantaged schools and maintained the overall number of resource teachers and SNAs to support children with special needs.</P>
        <P>Until now, a specific resource was provided for guidance in addition to the standard teacher allocation to post primary schools.  In future, schools must meet their guidance requirements from within the overall resource provided by that normal staffing schedule.  Individually schools can continue to make provision for guidance and counselling.  Decisions on how this will be done will be taken at school level in the best interests of students and to ensure the best use of resources available.  I am confident school management and teachers will continue to work together to meet the needs of the students in their care.</P>
        <P>In this way, the main teacher allocation can be maintained at 19:1 for schools generally, while schools will have discretion to balance what they allocate for guidance against the competing demands of providing subject choice.  The change that has been announced gives schools greater autonomy in how they allocate staff resources to best meet the needs of their students.  The change to guidance allocations must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times.  My Department will be notifying schools of the impact of the budget changes in January, 2012.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 141 together.</P>
        <P>Given the scale of our economic crisis, adjustments have had to be made across all areas of the public sector.  Despite this challenge, the Government has sought to do this in as fair a way as possible.  While DEIS schools are not immune to budgetary measures, a key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.</P><Col N="627"/>
        <P>In order to ensure fairness in the distribution of resources available under the DEIS plan, it is no longer possible to allow some schools to retain legacy posts on a concessionary basis that pre-date the introduction of DEIS.  A range of measures has been announced to withdraw supports (428 posts) from earlier disadvantage programmes/schemes in 270 primary schools (4 DEIS and 1 non DEIS in Mayo, 2 DEIS in Sligo) and 163 post primary schools (5 DEIS in Mayo and 3 DEIS in Sligo), both DEIS and Non-DEIS that exceed what equivalent schools are entitled to under DEIS or to which non-DEIS schools are not entitled.  These measures will take effect from the 2012/13 school year.</P>
        <P>While the exact staffing entitlements for schools for 2012/13 is not yet available, including the net effect of the withdrawal of legacy posts, the breakdown of these legacy posts are: &mdash; 38 concessionary teaching posts will be withdrawn from 15 non-DEIS primary schools previously in Giving Children an Even Break Programme and who retained a reduced PTR of 20:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes.- 102 concessionary posts will be withdrawn from 52 Urban Band 2 DEIS schools previously in the Giving Children an Even Break Programme and who had a reduced PTR of 20:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes.- 43 Support Teacher Posts will be withdrawn from 48 primary schools (45 DEIS and 3 Non DEIS)- 45 concessionary posts will be withdrawn from 32 DEIS Schools previously in the Breaking the Cycle Programme and who had a reduced PTR of 15:1 at the junior classes- 64 concessionary posts in 59 primary schools and 136 posts in 163 post-primary schools will be withdrawn from DEIS schools previously in the Disadvantaged Area Scheme.</P>
        <P>Some alleviation measures will be available for those schools considered to be most acutely affected by these changes. Schools will be notified in January 2012 of their staffing entitlements under the new arrangement for 2012/13, including any alleviation measures that may apply.  The new staffing schedule for DEIS Band 1 primary schools, which now gives greater autonomy to schools, will operate on a general average of 1 teacher for every 22 pupils.  This simplifies the existing system whereby schools are given a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; allocation to support lower class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes.  DEIS post-primary schools will be targeted for additional support through an improved staffing schedule of 18.25:1, which is a 0.75 point improvement compared to the existing standard 19:1 that applies in post-primary schools that do not charge fees (or compared to the 21:1 ratio that will apply in fee-charging schools).</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s protection of schools serving disadvantaged areas is further underlined by the maintenance of &euro;13 million in enhanced funding for DEIS schools, &euro;2 million in school book funding for DEIS schools, as well as a &euro;26 million investment in the Home School Community Liaison scheme.  All of these areas have been protected from reductions in expenditure for 2012.</P>
        <P>We have protected the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, prioritised targeted support for the most disadvantaged schools and maintained the overall number of resource teachers and SNAs to support children with special needs.</P>

As the Deputy is aware a further report was prepared subsequent to a separate review of the school by a member of the Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate and an Educational Psychologist.  The Board of Management has confirmed that the recommendations of this report have also been implemented in full.  My Department remains in regular contact with the school and is satisfied that significant progress has been made.  My Department will continue to monitor the position in the coming months. </P>

	<P>As part of the recent process of briefing patrons in relation to applications for patronage of the new schools, a number of queries were raised with the Department about possible applications for patronage which involve partnerships between two or more patrons.  These issues chiefly concerned the particular patronage model that would apply where two or more patrons intended to have a joint or co-patronage role or arrangement in any of the new schools.  The Department undertook to examine the issues further and then issue clarification on the matter.  The deadline for receipt of applications for patronage of new second level schools to be established in 2013 and 2014 was Friday 13th January 2012.  Given that prospective patrons will need some time to consider possible applications and the options for co-operation with each other, it is proposed to allow an extra six weeks for this and therefore the deadline for receipt of applications has been moved to Friday 24th February 2012.  Details of the new arrangements for patronage of new schools and the criteria for deciding on patronage of these new schools is available on my Department&rsquo;s website,<i> www.education.ie</i>. </P>

	<P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school.  My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </P>
        <P>Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected. <Col N="629"/> Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</P>
        <P>I understand the parent of the pupil in question lodged a section 29 appeal against the decision of a school to refuse enrolment.  I further understand that the Section 29 Administration Unit has sought a copy of the letter of refusal to enrol from the Board of Management of the school.  Once this is received, the section 29 appeal can be admitted in accordance with the procedures.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB may be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement within the pupil&rsquo;s area. The contact details for the NEWB in your area is National Educational Welfare Board, Block 3 Floor 1, Grove Court, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, phone number 01-8103260.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 to 148, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In 2009 students in 65 countries/economics, including Ireland, participated in the assessment, making PISA 2009 the largest international survey of education to date.  The overall mean score of students in Ireland in the 2009 study was 495.6 compared with 526.7 in 2000.  The survey was constructed in a manner to ensure a nationally representative sample taking account of school type, size, gender, and socioeconomic composition. Therefore disadvantage was taken account of in the construction of the sample, but special needs and migrant students for whom English is not the mother tongue were not part of the sample construct.</P>
        <P>The study included questions on immigrant status (first or second generation  migrants) and language spoken at home, so that the scores of such pupils are identified separately.  In Ireland, the key difference is not between native and migrant students, but rather between native <Col N="630"/>students and those for whom English or Irish is not the mother tongue. In Ireland the percentage of students with immigrant status rose from 2.3% in 2000 to 8.3% in 2009, and the proportion who spoke a language other than English or Irish at home rose from 0.9% to 3.6%.The mean score of students who spoke another language was 532.8 in 2000 and 443.9 in 2009. The socioeconomic status of such students was similar to the national profile in 2009, but was significantly higher than the national profile in 2000.</P>
        <P>The study also gives separate data on the mean scores of students with high, average and low socioeconomic status. In 2000 just over one quarter of students attended schools designated as disadvantaged under the Department&rsquo;s Disadvantaged Areas Schools Scheme. DEIS was introduced in 2005, and in the 2009 study, 23.7% of participants attended schools in the Schools Support Programme of DEIS.  The mean scores in 2009 for those  with high, average and low socioeconomic status were 535.5, 497.9 and 459.5 respectively. The mean scores of such students in 2000 were 558.6, 529.0 and 492.5 respectively. While a third of pupils fell within each socioeconomic category in 2009, the proportions in 2000 indicated 38.1% of students had high socioeconomic status, 28% had average status and 30.7% had low socioeconomic status.</P>
        <P>The PISA study did not identify separately the proportion and scores of students included in the study who had a disability. However, a team of international experts identified the decline in PISA results since 2000 in Ireland as partially due to the growth in the number of migrant students for whom English is not the mother tongue, the inclusion of greater numbers of students with special needs in mainstream education, a decline in early school leaving,  the random inclusion of 8 schools in the survey with very low levels of achievement, and survey fatigue.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153, 155, 156, 158 to 162, inclusive, and 167 together.</P>
        <P>While difficult choices had to be made to identify savings across my Department&rsquo;s budget, the Government has tried to protect front line services in 2012.  The Government has protected the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, prioritised targeted support for the most disadvantaged schools and maintained the overall number of resource teachers and SNAs to support children with special needs.</P>
        <P>Until now, a specific resource was provided to all second-level schools for guidance in addition to the standard teacher allocation. This broadly equates to an additional allocation of about 1 teacher for every 500 pupils. In future, schools must meet their guidance requirements from within the overall resource provided by the normal staffing schedule. Individually schools can continue to make provision for guidance and counselling. Decisions on how this will be done will be taken at school level in the best interests of students and to ensure the best use of resources available. I am confident school management and teachers will continue to work together to meet the needs of the students in their care.</P>
        <P>In this way, the main teacher allocation can be maintained at 19:1 for schools generally, while schools will have discretion to balance what they allocate for guidance against the competing demands of providing subject choice. The change that has been announced gives schools greater autonomy in how they allocate staff resources to best meet the needs of their students.</P><Col N="633"/>
        <P>I have also provided for the filling of 300 Assistant Principal posts in second-level schools over the level originally planned. This will ensure that schools have sufficient management positions to ensure appropriate supports are available for all students. This is an important change which will reduce the impact of the moratorium on the filling of posts of responsibility in second level schools.</P>
        <P>A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS will be given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools.</P>
        <P>The change to guidance allocations must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. My Department will be notifying schools of the impact of the budget changes in January, 2012.</P>

        <P>My Department recognises a number of postgraduate qualifications as acceptable for school guidance work. Teachers participate in these programmes of their own volition and at their own expense. As schools will continue to provide guidance and counselling services there will still be a need for teachers with specific postgraduate qualifications in this area.  As with all postgraduate courses future provision will depend on the level of demand and availability of resources.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the current means testing arrangements for student grants take no account of the capital value of savings or assets in determining eligibility for financial assistance.  This approach is at variance with other major financial support schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection and other public bodies such as the HSE.</P>
        <P>A considerable body of reports produced by the Department over a number of years have strongly recommended the introduction of a capital test for student grants to create a more equitable basis for means testing, based on a more complete analysis of a family&rsquo;s capacity to support their children in pursuing further or higher education.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the objective of the student grant scheme is to target available funding at socio-economically disadvantaged groups to support greater participation of students from these backgrounds in further and higher education.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances and in the context of the current financial climate, the importance of accurately targeting increasingly scarce resources to those most in need has become a high priority.  In this regard, a dedicated Capital Asset Test implementation group for student grants has been established.  The group has been charged with bringing forward detailed implementation proposals on new means testing arrangements for student grants, to include the value of assets, for new applicants from the 2013/14 academic year.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos 171 to 173, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="636"/>
        <P>It is anticipated that the funding available in 2012 for the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) will be sufficient to meet demand.  I understand that this is possible for a number of reasons including a greater integration of delivery of supports to students with disabilities into the core activities of institutions which has led to lesser dependence on supplementary funding through the FSD.  In addition, in practice, there is a frequent incidence of lower take-up by students of accommodations agreed as per a student&rsquo;s Needs Assessment at the beginning of the academic year.  Furthermore, students accessing the fund in year one don&rsquo;t necessarily need to access the fund at the same level in subsequent years.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;13.7m was available to the Fund for the 2010/11 academic year.  The allocation for the 2011/12 academic year is currently being assessed as part of the applications process which remains on-going.</P>
        <P>In 2010/11, it was estimated that 6.4% of new entrants (2,544) to higher education had one or more disabilities.  This compares to 6% (2,386) in 2009/10. The number of students with disabilities supported through the Fund for Students with Disabilities (i.e. undergraduate and postgraduate years) in 2010/11 was 6,090.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Under Section 28 (2) of the State Property Act 1954, the Minister for Finance assumes responsibility for all personal property and land vested in or held in trust for a body corporate (other than personal property or land held by such body in trust for another person) immediately prior to its dissolution.  Upon the dissolution of the body corporate, such property becomes State property.  The effect of Section 28 is that the Minister does not hold the assets of dissolved companies as beneficial owner.  He holds them in trust.  The title which the Minister acquires under this Section has been described as a defeasible title since, if the dissolved company is restored to the Register of Companies within twenty years of the date of its dissolution, its property is automatically restored to it.  The State Property Act also includes, in Section 31, a power for the Minister to waive the interest acquired under Section 28 of the Act.  The relevant functions under the State Property Act have transferred in the current year to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
        <P>It is understood that the property which is the subject of the current question was held within a company which was struck off the Register of Companies in September 1972 for failure to file annual returns with the Companies Office.  The beneficial owner of the property applied to the Department of Finance for a waiver of the interest acquired by the Minister for Finance under the provisions of the State Property Act and that waiver, in respect of which the consideration was &pound;160, was completed in October, 1986.  The effect of the waiver, which was not a sale by the State, would have been to allow the beneficial owner to complete the process of assembling a satisfactory title.  The waiver itself would have formed only a limited element in the establishment of that title and the transaction was a normal exercise of Departmental functions.  The price which the beneficial owner may have secured in a subsequent sale was not a matter <Col N="638"/>for consideration in the context of the waiver and, accordingly, would not merit enquiry by me at this juncture.</P>
        <P>I am advised that all applications for waiver of property falling within the scope of Section 28 of the State Property Act are referred to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for legal advice and that any policy issues that may arise in particular cases are given full consideration on their merits.</P>

	<P>I refer to Parliamentary Question No.106 of 17 November 2011.</P>
        <P>During 1984 the rate of interest charged by the Local Loans Fund to local authorities for house purchase and improvement loans was 12%. Local authorities were permitted to add an administration charge of 0.5%.  The rate of interest charged on non-housing loans from the Fund during 1984 was 13.5%.</P>
        <P>Since 1989 individuals who have mortgages from local authorities have been permitted to redeem their loans early without penalty.  In turn, local authorities were permitted to redeem without penalty Local Loans Fund loans of matching amounts and at matching interest rates to the individual loans redeemed.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works administers the Local Loans Fund on behalf of the Department of Finance.  I understand from that Office that South Dublin County Council no longer has any loans with the Local Loans Fund.  If South Dublin County Council contacts the OPW with a loan number, it will be able to provide information on the loan issue amount and the interest paid over the lifetime of that loan.

	<P>The process for appointing a Special Adviser to a Minister or a Minister of State is set out in <i>The Guidelines on Staffing of Ministerial Offices.  </i>These Guidelines were revised following decisions by the Government on a number of cost saving measures relating to the personal appointees of Ministers and Ministers of State.</P>
        <P>Under the Guidelines it is normally intended that only Ministers of the Government and any Minister of State who regularly attends Cabinet will have Special Advisers appointed to them.  However, in exceptional circumstances where a specific need is identified, a Special Adviser may be appointed to a Minister of State subject to the approval of the Government.</P>
        <P>There has been a reduction in both the overall number and cost of Special Advisers compared to the previous Government.</P><Col N="640"/>
        <P>Under the old <i>Guidelines on Staffing of Ministerial Offices</i>   Special Advisers were paid their existing salary plus an &lsquo;attraction allowance&rsquo; of 10%, subject to the overriding maximum remuneration of the Principal (higher) scale &mdash; (currently &euro;99,236).</P>
        <P>Under the revised Guidelines Special Advisers are placed on the Principal Officer (standard) scale: &euro;80,051 &mdash; &euro;83,337 &mdash; &euro;86,604 &mdash; &euro;89,898 &mdash; &euro;92,672.  The Guidelines provide that appointments are to be on the first point of the scale except where the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform approves a higher starting salary.   In addition there is no longer an attraction allowance of 10%.</P>
        <P>The cost of Special Advisers under the previous administration was approximately &euro;4.35m in October 2010.  The figure under the current Government, as at December 2011, is approximately &euro;3.4m.  This means a saving in the cost of Special Advisers of approximately &euro;900,000 as at December 2011.  This estimate of savings also reflects the fact that 2 Special Advisers have recently vacated their posts.</P>

	<P>You will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce new legislation to protect small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies.  In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Mr Brian Hayes has been working with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Construction Contracts Bill, which is now before the D&aacute;il, into a robust piece of legislation. </P>
        <P>In order to address a number of issues that were raised during the consultation on the Bill a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) was carried out.  The RIA was completed and published on 27 September.  The Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i>www.per.gov.ie/reports</i>.</P><Col N="642"/>
        <P>The RIA examined issues relating to payment practices in the construction sector and assessed the need for legislative intervention.  It found that legislation is desirable to improve payment practices and to allow swift resolution of payment disputes by way of adjudication, allowing projects to be completed without wasting time and money in litigation.  In addition, the RIA examined the main proposals to amend the Bill that were raised during the Seanad debate and subsequent consultation.  It found that there were merits to considering amending the Bill in a number of respects e.g. to bring lower value contracts within its scope and to make the adjudicators award binding in payment dispute cases.  It concluded that any such amendments should be formulated in such a manner that would protect the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Minister Hayes is now reflecting on the findings of the RIA and is preparing legislative proposals which will be brought to Government shortly for approval.  It is essential that the solution to this issue be balanced so as to avoid imposing regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others.</P>

	<P>My Department does not provide direct funding or grants to businesses but provides funding to a number of State Agencies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland, through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.  The role of the CEBs is to develop indigenous potential and stimulate economic activity at a local level primarily through the provision of financial and technical support for the development of small and micro-enterprises.  The Boards form a nationwide support network for small business and are considered to be a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business.</P>
        <P>The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise.

	<P>In early 2010, IDA Ireland published &lsquo;Horizon 2020&rsquo;, its strategic blueprint for attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Ireland in the coming decade.  FDI has been, and will continue to be, a key <Col N="644"/>element in the export led recovery of the economy.  Horizon 2020 sets out a road-map of what is needed to fuel Ireland&rsquo;s future success with leading global corporations, setting the following targets for achievement over the period 2010 to 2014:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />640  investments;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />50% of investments outside of Dublin and Cork;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />62,000 direct new jobs in Ireland;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />20% of Greenfield investment from emerging markets by 2014; and,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;1.7bn client spend on Research, Development and Innovation (RD&amp;I) by 2014.</P>
        <P FLI="0">IDA Ireland&rsquo;s results for 2010 show that very good progress has been made towards achieving these targets.  While final results for 2011 will not be available until next month, the indications are that these, too, will be very encouraging, particularly with regard to the job creation target in Horizon 2020.</P>
        <P>Successful implementation to date by IDA Ireland of its Horizon 2020 Strategy has resulted in the achievement of the following significant outcomes:</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Investments</i></P>
        <P LI="3">126 foreign direct investments were won in 2010, with 47 companies investing in Ireland for the first time, representing a 20% increase on the 2009 figure.  62% of investments came from existing client companies.</P>
        <P LI="3">I am informed by IDA Ireland that the trends for 2011 are very encouraging with mid year results for 2011 showing projects approved up from 63 in 2010 to 75 in 2011.</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Regional Spread</i></P>
        <P LI="3">In 2010, IDA Ireland achieved a total of 37% of projects outside of Dublin and Cork.  These projects were employment intensive, resulting in the strong outturn of 45% of jobs locating outside of Dublin and Cork.</P>
        <P LI="3">IDA is continuing its efforts to win investments for Ireland and to encourage, where appropriate, investments to locate in regional locations in line with the National Spatial Strategy.  To date in 2011 there have been a number of significant regional investments announced including: JRI-America in Tralee (100 jobs); Valeo in Tuam (100 jobs); Pivot in Galway (100 jobs); AMS in Athlone (50 jobs); and, Kelcourt in Offaly (55 jobs).</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Employment</i></P>
        <P LI="3">IDA supported companies created almost 11,000 new jobs in 2010, significantly greater than the previous year.  At the same time, 9,545 jobs were lost by IDA supported companies, leaving an overall increase in IDA&rsquo;s employment portfolio of 1,352.  A number of the job losses arose from the implementation of job reductions announced in the first half of 2009.  IDA&rsquo;s strategy includes winning as many new jobs as possible each year and giving equal priority to maintaining existing jobs.  The Agency recognises that job losses occur every year for a variety of reasons including changing competitiveness, competition from sister sites, product and technology lifecycles or global location rationalisation as a result of mergers and acquisitions.</P><Col N="645"/>
        <P LI="3">I am informed by the Agency that it expects that the 2011 performance in relation to jobs will be stronger than in 2010.</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Growth markets</i></P>
        <P LI="3">In order to achieve its objective of achieving 20% of Greenfield investments from high growth markets (India, China, Russia and Brazil) by the year 2014, IDA Ireland recently expanded its global office network to include Shenzhen in China, Bangalore in India and Singapore.  Also, in 2011, the Indian company HCL announced the opening of a software delivery centre in Dublin which will create 80 jobs.</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>RD&amp;I</i></P>
        <P LI="3">In 2010 IDA approved 37 Research, Development and Innovation (RD&amp;I) investments with an associated spend of approximately &euro;500 million. These investments play a strategic role in embedding existing employment and laying the foundations for increased future employment.  This strong performance has continued in 2011 with a number of significant RD&amp;I projects announced, for example, EMC (Cork), Boston Scientific (Tipperary), Biotrin (Dublin), Caci (Dublin), Misys (Dublin), ON Semiconductor (Limerick).</P>

	<P>My Department does not provide direct funding or grants to businesses but provides funding to a number of State Agencies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland, through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.  The role of Dublin City Enterprise Board as part of the network of CEBs is to develop indigenous potential and stimulate economic activity at a local level primarily through the provision of financial and technical support for the development of small and micro-enterprises.  The Boards form a nationwide support network for small business and are considered to be a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business. </P><Col N="646"/>
        <P>The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing micro-enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of priming, expansion/development and feasibility/innovation grants.  The CEBs also deliver non-financial supports such as one-to-one mentoring and a range of business advice and training programmes to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow, which may be available as appropriate to the needs of the promoter&rsquo;s business.</P>
        <P>The promoter may therefore wish to contact Dublin City Enterprise Board to discuss what options may be available to them and their proposed business venture.

	<P>The Deputy is referring to the Temporary, Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme which should be in operation by the end of March 2012.  An Invitation to Tender was published on Monday 5th December to select on Operator for the Scheme.  In parallel with this selection process, I will be introducing appropriate legislation in the Oireachtas to underpin the introduction of the Scheme. </P>
        <P>The Scheme is intended to address two specific market failures which act as barriers to lending to viable enterprises which otherwise would have received bank credit.  These market failures are inadequacy of collateral and inadequacy of understanding of the novelty of a business model, market, sector or technology.  Eligible companies will be commercially viable, well performing companies that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, thereby demonstrating their ability to repay the loan.  Refinancing of existing debts will be excluded as the purpose of this Scheme is to facilitate additional lending into the economy.</P>
        <P>Decision making on facilitating individual loans including assessment of eligibility and the viability of the borrower will be fully devolved to the participating lenders.  The baseline for determining commercial viability within the Scheme should be no different from the standard viability test applied by each Lender within their normal commercial SME lending procedures.</P>
        <P>It is not clear from the details supplied whether the person concerned would meet the eligibility criteria for the Scheme when introduced.  The individual may wish to discuss with banks the extent to which his credit requirements may be facilitated under current lending arrangements.</P>

	<P>The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department which processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and makes payments to over one million people every week.  While the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them, as Minister, I am very conscious of the need to protect public money and I am determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.  </P>
        <P>To this end, I launched a new Fraud Initiative (2011-2013) in September last which aims to put in place a range of actions to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to ensure there is public confidence and trust in it.</P>
        <P>Under the Initiative, there will be a greater focus on inter-agency co-operation at the local level and an emphasis on undertaking joint projects and pooling of local knowledge, many of which focus on the black (or hidden) economy. There are a number of themes and approaches under-pinning the Initiative, including greater inter-agency co-operation among public bodies at national and local level to combat fraud and abuse and a greater presence of social welfare inspectors on the ground. In addition, there will be greater liaison at national and, in particular, at local level with employers, their representative organisations and businesses generally to ensure good information exchange on emerging fraudulent trends in the labour market and to maintain a fair and level playing pitch for all enterprises.</P>
        <P>As part of its control activities, the Department has formed alliances with a range of enforcement and compliance agencies, in particular, the Revenue Commissioners. Both organisations are working together with a view to aligning expertise and information across their operations.</P>
        <P>On an on-going basis, my Department and Revenue request specific information and data matches from each other for the purposes of combating fraud and abuse. The risk inherent in black or hidden economy has been identified by both organisations as being a key corporate priority to be tackled.  A sectoral approach is being taken in this regard with projects and control operations focussing on the following:</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Trade suppliers;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />White collar sectors which have the potential to engage in cash transactions; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Other sectors including markets, casual trading, couriers, clothes recycling, car valeting, security sector, and haulage.</P>
        <P FLI="0">With regard to incidents of suspected fraud, my Department accepts reports of possible fraud and abuse of the social welfare system offered by members of the public in relation to the operation of its schemes. To this end, it has both a dedicated phone number and a facility on the Department&rsquo;s website for this purpose. Members of the public are asked to provide as much detail as possible about the case they are reporting and they can do so anonymously.</P>
        <P>Reports can be made as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />By email: <i>www.welfare.ie</i></P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />By phone: (01) 704 3000, ask for Central Control Section or (071) 9672648 or Locall: 1890 927999.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />By Post: Central Control Division, DSP, Shannon Lodge, Carrick-on-Shannon, Co Leitrim.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I would like to thank the Deputy for the information he supplied and I would invite him to supply more specific details of the alleged abuses to enable staff of my Department to investigate the particular cases referred to.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, based on 2010 figures, the average time taken for a case which requires an oral hearing is 51.1 weeks.  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the processing time for Disability Allowance dealt with by way of summary decision is 30.8 weeks appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. </P>
        <P>I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.   In that regard, as a result of various <Col N="651"/>initiatives, including the assignment of 9 additional Appeals Officers from April, taken over the past 12 months, 22,406 decisions were made by appeals officers in the first eleven months of 2011,   in comparison to 16,232 for the same period in 2010.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that a very wide range of community services and works can be delivered with the support of the community employment programme and the rural social scheme.  The types of works that are undertaken are determined locally.   It is a requirement of these programme that the works undertaken are consistent with the terms and conditions of the relevant programme or scheme and meet other criteria, particularly in respect of not displacing works that are the responsibility of statutory bodies or local authorities or that are undertaken by other contractors.  Regard must also be had for the skills required to undertake such works, safety of, and risks to participants, and the costs associated with the provision of materials, tools and equipment.  The F&Aacute;S Community Services Office based at Unit 1, Kenmare Place, Killarney (Telephone 064 32466) will be able to advise on the opportunities to undertake this work under the community employment programme.  North and East Kerry LEADER Partnership based at Clash, Tralee, Co. Kerry  (Telephone 066 7180190) will be able to advise on the rural social scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the Redundancy Payments Scheme is to compensate workers, under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 2007, for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy.  Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.   Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).  The total amount paid out in redundancy rebates to employers was &euro;152.2 million in 2006; &euro;167.4 million in 2007; &euro;161.8 million in 2008; &euro;247.9 million in 2009; &euro;373.2 million in 2010 and &euro;186.2 million so far in 2011<b>.  </b>Given the current economic climate, this level of rebate expenditure is not sustainable and, in Budget 2012, it was announced that the rebate will be reduced to 15%.</P>
        <P>To give effect to this change, legislation was introduced and passed all stages in this House last week and is due to be debated in the Seanad this week.  While I acknowledge that this change may cause difficulties for employers it should be noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 256 together. </P>
        <P>Community employment helps long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine. Some 1,100 organisations in the community, voluntary and not-for-profit sectors provide work and training placements for participants nationwide.  The number of placements available during 2011, including supervisor positions, was of the order of 23,300.  The number of persons engaged at the 5th   December 2011, including supervisors, was 23,846.  The distribution of the placements is set out in the table below. Places are allocated regionally to reflect the underlying level of unemployment. I hope to be able to maintain the same level of placements in 2012.  In delivering these placements, the Department of Social Protection/F&Aacute;S will continue to operate with sponsor organisations in a flexible manner in order to maximise progression to the labour market and ensure placements are fully utilised, while at the same time facilitating support for the delivery of community services.</P>

	<P>The One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) is made up of a personal rate for the parent and of extra amounts for dependent children.  The current payment rate is &euro;188.00 per week &mdash; with a further &euro;29.80 payable for each additional qualified child.   The amount of the payment depends on the weekly means of the parent. Currently, earnings of less than &euro;146.50 per week are excluded from the assessment of means &mdash; with claimants entitled to the full rate of payment.  Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50% up to a maximum of &euro;425.00 per week &mdash; with a reduced rate of OFP payable.</P>
        <P>The reform of the OFP payment commenced when legislative changes were introduced to the scheme in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2010.  These changes, which came into effect on 27 April, 2011, lowered the age limit of the youngest child for receipt of the payment from 18 (or 22 if in full-time education) to 14 for new recipients and introduced a six-year phase-out of the payment for existing recipients, with entitlement to the OFP being maintained at the age of 18 for 2011 and 2012, and then being reduced on a yearly basis from the age of 17 in 2013 to 16 in 2014, to 15 in 2015 and to 14 in 2016.</P><Col N="656"/>
        <P>The provisions contained in Budget 2012 will continue this reform &mdash; with the age limit of the youngest child being further reduced to 12 in 2012, to 10 in 2013 and to 7 in 2014.  The earnings disregard on the OFP payment will also be reduced on a phased basis, moving from &euro;146.50 per week to &euro;130 per week in January 2012, for new and existing claimants.  Both the weekly personal rate for the parent and the qualified child rate will not change.</P>
        <P>As an existing OFP customer, the recipient referred to will continue to receive their payment in April 2012. Phasing arrangements after this point, for such customers are currently being considered.  This client&rsquo;s weekly earnings, which total &euro;60.55 from 7 hours of employment (based on earnings at the national minimum wage rate of &euro;8.65 per hour), will not affect her entitlement as they fall under the earnings disregard of &euro;146.50 for 2011 and of &euro;130.00 for 2012.  She would currently be receiving a payment of &euro;188 per week for herself and &euro;29.80 per week for each of her three children under 18 years. This assumes that she was an OFP recipient prior to April 2011 and that the older two children over 18 years are not in full-time education. This gives her a total social welfare payment of   &euro;277.40 per week.  If she became an OFP recipient after April 2011, when the age 14 limit was introduced, she would be receiving payment of &euro;29.80 for one child, giving her a total payment of &euro;217.80 per week.  In both instances her payment would remain unchanged in April 2012.</P>

        <Quest> the findings of research on fuel poverty and older people by the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Institute of Public Health, if she will accede to the petition sponsored by an organisation (details supplied) which states that hundreds of older people die each winter in Ireland because they cannot afford to keep themselves warm and lives could be saved if the Government reversed its decision to cut their electricity and gas units; if she will reverse the cuts to the free gas and electricity units available under the household benefits package, in view of the increased hardship it will cause for older persons on low incomes. </Quest>
        <QRef>[39558/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The research referred to has not been published to date.  However, my Department will spend over &euro;530 million in 2011 on the fuel scheme and the telephone, gas and electricity elements of the household benefits package which will benefit some 390,000 people on household benefits and 375,000 on the fuel allowance.  In 2005 there were 325,000 people on household benefits and 265,000 on the fuel allowance at a cost of &euro;280 million.  The costs have almost doubled in six years while the number of customers has risen by more than 20%.  My Department is covering the cost of the price increases in electricity which came into effect from 1st October.  The electricity allowance, which was &euro;35.80 per month, has increased to &euro;39.40.  The price increases will cost the Department over &euro;4 million in 2011 and &euro;17.3 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>Difficult decisions had to be made in light of the existing economic situation and commitments made by the previous government.  A number of measures for savings in 2011 and future years were specified as part of Budget 2011 but were not announced by the Government at the time.  These included a saving of &euro;30 million in the energy and telephone elements of the household benefits package in 2011 and subsequent years.  They also included the abolition of the smokeless fuel allowance with a saving of &euro;7.7 million in 2011 and &euro;17.5 million in subsequent years. The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance were reduced from 2,400 to 1,800 with a view to generating savings of &euro;17 million in 2011 and &euro;65 million annually.</P><Col N="657"/>
        <P>Excess winter deaths are generally defined as the difference between the number of deaths during the four winter months (December to March) and the average number of deaths during the preceding autumn (August to November) and the following summer (April to July).</P>
        <P>Ireland, in common with other European countries, experiences higher levels of mortality in the winter than in the summer. Studies have found that mortality increases as mean daily temperatures fall (below 18 degrees).  However, it is the countries with (relatively) the mildest winters in Europe which report the greatest excess deaths. This has been termed the, &lsquo;paradox of excess winter mortality&rsquo;.  There is no simple clear cut explanation for excess winter mortality.</P>
        <P>The factors include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the increased prevalence of influenza and cold viruses during the winter months;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />older age &mdash; especially for people aged 75 years and over or those who are frail;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />poverty/fuel poverty;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />poor housing stock;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />living alone.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty is to reduce consumption of energy through improving the home&rsquo;s thermal efficiency.  Sustainable Energy Ireland has administered the Warmer Homes programme for privately owned low-income households since 2001, benefitting 65,000 households, with a further 15,000 to receive upgrades this year. A similar programme is in place for local authority houses.</P>
        <P>We should also bear in mind that data show that households comprising predominantly older people have lower consistent poverty rates than other age categories. In 2009 single adults aged over 65 with no children had a consistent poverty rate of 0.6% while people in households with 2 adults at least one of whom was aged 65 or over with no children had a consistent poverty rate of 1.0%.   In the general population, 5.5% of people were in consistent poverty.  The Survey on Income and Living Conditions (2009) also showed that the elderly were less likely than other groups to have gone without heating in the previous year.</P>

	<P>There are currently 387,000 customers in receipt of the telephone allowance, administered under the household benefits package at an annual cost of &euro;115 million in 2011.  This is a significant increase since 2005 when 311,000 people were in receipt.  The household benefits package, comprising telephone and electricity or gas allowance, as well as a free television licence is available for people aged 70 years or over, people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and people aged between 66 years and 70 years who are getting a qualifying payment e.g. pension, and are generally living alone.  It is also available to people aged under 66 years who are getting a disability or caring related payment.</P>
        <P>In recent months, the Department of Social Protection negotiated a deal with Eircom, the main supplier used by 75% of social welfare customers, whereby Eircom customers (including the person on whose behalf the Deputy has made the enquiry) now get a value of &euro;26.86 toward their monthly telephone bill at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;22.22.  This meant that from 1st  September this year, the monthly rate of the telephone allowance charged to the Department was reduced from &euro;25.91 to &euro;22.22 achieving annual savings of &euro;16.9 million on the scheme.</P>
        <P>There was no change to the telephone allowance in Budget 2012.  Difficult decisions had to be made in light of the existing economic situation and commitments made by the previous Government.  However I believe the deal negotiated with Eircom provides real savings to the State while minimising the impact on the customer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of my Department which processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and makes payments to some 1.4 million people every week.  However, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently launched a new Fraud Initiative (2011-2013) which is aimed at putting in place a range of actions to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to ensure there is public confidence and trust in the system. My Department accepts reports of possible fraud from members of the public in relation to operation of its schemes and uses both a dedicated phone number and a facility on the Department&rsquo;s website for this purpose. Members of the public are asked to provide as much detail as possible about the case they are reporting and they can do so anonymously.</P>
        <P>Reports can be made as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />By email: <i>www.welfare.ie</i>.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />By phone: (01) 704 3000, ask for Central Control Section or (071) 9672648 or   Locall: 1890 927999.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />By Post: Central Control Division, DSP, Shannon Lodge, Carrick-on-Shannon, Co Leitrim.</P>
        <P FLI="0">All anonymous or confidential reports are examined and, where relevant, are referred to Scheme owners and/or to the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors.</P>
        <P>However, it is important to note that a payment is not normally suspended or stopped solely on the basis of an anonymous report. The anonymous report, however, may be a trigger for the instigation of a review of a customer&rsquo;s entitlement.  A Social Welfare Inspector may then deem it appropriate to interview the customer and to carry out a full review of the circumstances and means of the customer in order to determine on-going entitlement to the relevant payment. The Inspector may then send his report on the case to one of the Department&rsquo;s deciding officers for a decision regarding entitlement. Where the review indicates that the <Col N="667"/>customer is not entitled to the relevant payment, the claim may be suspended, reduced or terminated.</P>
        <P>The following are the number of anonymous reports received in the period January-November 2011:</P>

        <P FLI="0">In approximately 12,300 of these cases, a report of suspected fraud was sent to the relevant area for examination. Some clients about whom a report was received were in receipt of more than one payment.  In over 3,800 of the cases received in 2011, it was not possible to issue a report to an investigator due to either a lack of information supplied, or no claim being in payment or the information reported would not impact on entitlement.</P>
        <P>My Department is very conscious of its obligation to protect public money and is determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.  Therefore, it is the Department&rsquo;s policy to review all customers on an ongoing basis, and in addition, all cases of suspected abuse are referred for investigation. However, my Department is also very conscious of the fact that most social welfare recipients are fully entitled to their payments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251, 259 and 262 together. </P>
        <P>Due to the current economic circumstances and the need for the Department of Social Protection to find savings of &euro;475 million in Budget 2012, it was necessary to examine all aspects of Departmental expenditure. This has resulted in the following changes being made to the Community Employment (CE) scheme, which were announced as part of Budget 2012:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. A reduction in the training and materials grants from &euro;1,500 to &euro;500 per participant per annum;</P><Col N="668"/>
        <P LI="1">2. The ending of the concurrent entitlement to a CE payment and a social welfare assistance payment for new CE entrants;</P>
        <P LI="1">3. The ending of the dual payment of Qualified Child Dependent Increases to CE participants in receipt of certain DSP payments.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In relation to the reduction in the training and materials grant the Department of Social Protection will seek to minimise the effects of these changes on those schemes most affected and will examine the income and expenditure of schemes with reference to their capacity to absorb the changes made to the grant.  The National Training Fund will provide &euro;4.2 million for training on CE in 2012.  In addition, SOLAS will continue to provide access to its training programmes to CE participants.</P>
        <P>The need for training on CE varies depending on the needs of participants and how long they have already been on the scheme and the training already received.  Progression to employment is the key aim of the Government and there is a need to ensure that the supports we have in place aim to substantially improve individuals&rsquo; chances of securing employment. Forf&aacute;s published their &ldquo;Review of Labour Market Programmes&rdquo; last year which showed that CE participants&rsquo; progression into employment is low and is only 3% higher than individuals who remain on the Live Register.  There needs, therefore, to be a better focus on progression and value for money.</P>
        <P>The second change to CE announced in Budget 2012 ceases the concurrent entitlement of certain individuals on CE had to both a CE allowance and a proportion or all of their social welfare assistance payment. This measure will take effect from 16 January 2012 and will only apply to new entrants to CE.  Any individual who was employed on a CE scheme before 16 January will not be affected by this change.</P>
        <P>The third change announced in Budget 2012 relates to the qualified child increase that certain individuals receive when in receipt of a social welfare assistance payment. Under changes announced in Budget 2012 payment of two qualified child increases where the person is on a CE scheme and one parent family payment, deserted wife&rsquo;s allowance/benefit or widow(er)&rsquo;s pensions will be discontinued for new and existing recipients.  Despite the changes outlined above, the Department of Social Protection will be spending in excess of &euro;960 million on employment supports (including CE schemes) in 2012, up from &euro;882 million in 2011.</P>

	<P>In general, the maximum participation limit for community employment (CE) is one year with the opportunity to extend for a further year if this is considered by F&Aacute;S as the most suitable and cost effective measure to assist the participant in gaining employment.  A participant may be eligible for different periods of engagement and extensions on CE due to a range of circumstances, including their age, the nature of the qualifying payment and/or time already spent on CE.  Persons of 55 years or over may be eligible to a maximum of six years overall participation on CE.  In general, those in receipt of any of the four disability linked Social Welfare payments (Disability Allowance, Blind Pension, Invalidity Pension, or Illness Benefit) may be eligible for one additional year&rsquo;s participation bringing the total to seven years in the case of a person aged 55 years or over, or four years otherwise.  I have no plans to extend the time a person will be allowed to spend on CE.  </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 and 265 together.</P>
        <P>As provided for in the Guidelines on the staffing of Ministers&rsquo; Offices, I have sought and received sanction for the appointment of two special advisors. Also in accordance with these Guidelines, Minister of State McGinley has not sought the appointment of any advisor.  I have appointed Mr. James Kenny as special advisor with effect from 7 June 2011.  As provided for in the above mentioned Guidelines, Mr Kenny&rsquo;s salary has been appointed at the first point of the Principal Officer Standard Scale.  As Mr. Kenny is in receipt of a public service pension, his salary has been abated to &euro;38,215 per annum.</P>
        <P>My Department has also received sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the appointment of Mr. Se&aacute;n Mac C&aacute;rthaigh as special advisor. Details of his contract and remuneration are currently being finalised by my officials in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
        <P>The restrictions under the terms of the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour on civil servants engaging in political activity do not apply to Special Advisers and they can engage in political activity or join political parties if they wish.  These are not matters for which my Special Advisers would be accountable to me under their contracts of employment.</P>

	<P>Primary responsibility for the promotion and funding of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.  The arts community can apply online through the Arts Council website for funding and for other services, including grants for performances and productions.  The Arts Council has an excellent online service, which was selected by public vote for the Net Visionary <Col N="672"/>eGovernment Award.  Under legislation, the Arts Council is independent in making its funding decisions.  The Office of Public Works is responsible for the management of Newgrange.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Those seeking to build wind farms require a grid connection in order to be able to export the electricity generated to the national electricity grid.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is statutorily responsible for grid connection.  The &ldquo;Gate&rdquo; process was established by the CER as the mechanism for processing applications from renewable generators.  The processing and issuance of grid connection offers to renewable generators are grouped rather than dealt with on an individual basis. </P>
        <P>Under Gate 1 and Gate 2, 1755MW of connection offers were made to renewable generators and accepted.  Under Gate 3, over 3900MW of offers were made to renewable generators.  The total amount of renewable generation under Gates 1, 2 and 3 is capable of delivering Ireland&rsquo;s 40% renewable electricity target.  Between 175MW and 200MW of windfarms are expected to be connected to the grid this year.  EirGrid&rsquo;s website <i>www.eirgrid.com</i> provides lists of connected and contracted wind farm developments with indicative connection dates for those contracted.  The group processing approach facilitates a strategic approach to be taken to network building requirements and aims to put in place efficient connection solutions to cater for large number of applications to ensure optimum network development, minimising network costs and avoidance of network bottlenecks.</P><Col N="675"/>
        <P>Over and above those projects in the Gate process, I am advised that EirGrid and ESB Networks are in receipt of many expressions of interest to connect several thousand megawatts of onshore and offshore wind to the grid.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 and 286 together.</P>
        <P>I have appointed two Special Advisers to my office.  Both were appointed in accordance with the Instructions on Ministerial Appointments for the 31st D&aacute;il and sanctioned by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, where appropriate.  Ms. Claire Langton was appointed as a Special Adviser to my office on 10 March 2011 with a salary of &euro;80,051.  No pay increase has been awarded to Ms. Langton since her appointment.  Mr. Sean McKeown was appointed Special Adviser to my office with effect from 3 October 2011 with an annual salary of &euro;92,672.  No pay increase has been awarded to Mr. McKeown since his appointment.  The contracts of my Special Advisers have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 5.4 of the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour excludes staff holding a temporary unestablished position and whose tenure is coterminous with that of the relevant Minister from the restrictions on engaging in political activity as set out in section 5 of the Code.  There is no obligation on me to know if my Special Advisers are members of a political party and there is no obligation on them to tell me.  The same principle applies in relation to whether any of them have been elected to local authorities.</P>
        <P>Special Advisers appointed to my Department are required to perform any duties that may be assigned to them from time to time as appropriate to the position of Special Adviser as set out in Section 11 of the Public Service Management Act 1997.  Their functions will include the provision of advice and the monitoring, facilitation and provision of assistance in securing Government objectives that relate to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No 58 of 24 March 2011 which comprehensively addressed the issues regarding the registration of the title of Architect.  Earlier this year I approved the schedule of fees applicable in respect of the registration of Architects in accordance with the Building Control Act 2007.  The fee in relation to candidates who apply for registration under the Technical Assessment route has now been set at &euro;4,500.  This amount is considerably less than the amount referred to in the details supplied with this question.  </P>
        <P>I have no plans to amend the arrangements for the registration of Architects, as set down under Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007, along the lines suggested.  The Act sought to provide for the registration of the title of Architect in order to protect consumers.  There is no question of persons who fail to register through one of the routes to registration provided for in Part 3 of the Act being allowed to use the title of Architect.</P>

	<P>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 provides the legislative basis for the &euro;200 charge on non-principal private residences (NPPR), including the application of late payment fees.  The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property which is situated in the State to assess his or her liability for the charge in the first instance.</P>
        <P>Section 9 of the Act places collection of the charge under the care and management of the relevant local authority.  It is a matter for an individual who may be experiencing hardship in meeting their payment obligations under the Act to make contact with the relevant local authority in the first instance to establish if there is a basis for amelioration of the charge.</P>

        <P>A public consultation designed to inform policy development concluded in September 2011. A large number of responses were received from a broad spectrum of interests. As one might expect, a consensus is not apparent and, on almost all of the relevant issues, a considerable breadth of opinion was expressed. Many responses cited concerns such as the potentially adverse impact of franchise bidding on waste collection firms and the loss of the benefits of ongoing, side-by-side competition. Other responses pointed to the possible significant savings for householders and the potential for improved environmental outcomes if franchise bidding were introduced. All of the responses received, in addition to a summary document, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>The role of Special Advisers in giving assistance with political implications is expressly recognised in the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour. To ensure public confidence in the political impartiality of the Civil Service, paragraph 5.1 of the Code of Standards restricts civil servants above a certain grade from engaging in political activity; but, under paragraph 5.4, the restrictions do not apply to Special Advisers who hold &lsquo;temporary unestablished positions&rsquo; and &lsquo;whose tenure is coterminous with that of the relevant Minister&rsquo;. Declaration of membership of, or links to, a political party is not required of a Special Adviser. Neither of my advisers has held elective office.</P>

In addition, all Divisional Officers were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the following is a break down of the courses facilitated by the Garda College and Garda Headquarters.  The Stinger Course is facilitated at a Divisional Level and collating the relevant data would require a disproportionate amount of time and resources to compile.</P>

	<P>The Canine Unit was established within the Irish Prison Service in early 2008 and currently has<b></b>26 trained dog handlers and a compliment of 36 trained dogs consisting of 23 passive dogs, 3 active dogs and 10 patrol dogs. All dogs are housed in-house at purpose built kennels located at designated prisons throughout the country. </P>
        <P Just="Left">While it is not proposed to increase the number of handlers and dogs in the Prison Service Canine Unit in the short term, the Canine Unit does play a particularly important role in the prevention of contraband entering prisons. It is intended to maintain existing resource levels in the Canine Unit through a tender for the provision of dog handler training and trained dogs. This is currently being developed and the Irish Prison Service intends to publish the tender in the near future.</P>

	<P>It has been decided that funding to People with Disabilities in Ireland (PwDI) must cease at the end of 2011.</P>
        <P>On the basis of a value for money review, it has been clearly established that the vast majority of the money allocated to PwDI is being spent disproportionately. The largest proportion of PwDI&rsquo;s annual budget has been spent over the last number of years on the operation of its office headquarters and on administration rather than on the development of projects which would directly benefit people with disabilities. This was an untenable situation that could not be allowed to continue as people with disabilities were benefiting very little from the allocation in real terms. However, there is no reason why the local PwDI networks around the country should not continue to be active as volunteer bodies and continue their work with people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>It is my wish to ensure that people with disabilities directly benefit from any money allocated to this sector. With this in mind, I am currently overseeing the finalisation of a major Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in the Department of Health to ensure that existing funding allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect. I am also <Col N="691"/>interested in hearing what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them. I recently established  and am personally chairing a new National Disability Strategy Implementation Group to develop and progress disability strategy. The new group includes representation from a number of disability stakeholder organisations and also a number of people with disabilities who will bring their lived experience directly to bear on the very important work of this high level group. This will ensure the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost effective way.</P>
        <P>The Government must ensure in 2012, and continuing thereafter, that funding is allocated for maximum provision of services for people with disabilities, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The reduction referred to by the Deputy will present a challenge to the running of my Department and the associated bodies included under Vote 24 (Vote 19 in 2011). Details of the various bodies concerned are listed on pages 171-173 of the recently published Part IV &mdash; Estimates for Public Services and Summary Public Capital Programme of the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014.</P>
        <P>The dreadful financial legacy inherited from the previous Government requires all of us to make difficult decisions and, like all other areas of public expenditure, there is no magic formula for generating money for the Justice area. We have a continuing obligation to contribute to the overall reduction in public expenditure that must be achieved in the public interest to enable our State regain economic sovereignty.</P>
        <P>While the reduction in budget is challenging, we now have to plan to ensure that the most critical areas within the sector are prioritised for funding, and that the resources will be concentrated on those areas.</P>
        <P>The 2006 Justice Vote current expenditure outturn was &euro;362 million. The Department and the associated bodies concerned functioned with that allocation, and will continue to function properly with the new allocation. </P>
        <P>The total current expenditure funding available to the Justice Vote for 2012 is &euro;392 million. This covers nearly 60 subheads, and includes allocations of funding to agencies and organisations in the areas of immigration and asylum, equality, disability and human rights, charities, youth justice and others. This represents a reduction of &euro;15 million and, in light of this, priority will be given to those organisations that are actually providing services and, accordingly, there will be limited funding available for non-governmental organisations which are largely engaged in an advocacy role. </P>
        <P>In any given year, even if the overall funding available was the same as in the previous one, the amounts allocated to each of the various bodies included in the Justice Vote would not necessarily remain constant year on year. Similarly with 2012, those tasked with managing my Department and the various bodies funded from Vote 24 will take into consideration the annual fundamental task of managers everywhere when preparing their business plans for the year ahead i.e. the utilising of the resources available in order to achieve their business objectives.</P>
        <P>I would also point to the significant transformation programme in place across the Justice Sector with the objective of ensuring that key front-line services are efficiently maintained in an era of reduced budgets and staffing resources.  The transformation programme is examining every aspect of the way in which work is done and resources are deployed, with the objective of maintaining front-line services to the public to the maximum extent possible.</P>
        <P>While much has been said about reduced budgets of late it should be borne in mind that some budgets are reduced as a result of greater efficiencies and savings. At the same time, other budgets have increased in order to meet new strategic objectives.</P>
        <P>For example, funding of over &euro;40 million, which represents a modest increase of &euro;1.4 million over 2011 expenditure levels is being made available to the Probation Service in 2012, which <Col N="694"/>will support a range of initiatives in this area, including the pilot project for an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which offenders who pose no threat to the community are offered early release in return for supervised community service.</P>
        <P>I am also pleased also that there is funding in the Justice estimates of over &euro;2.8 million in respect of the Family Mediation Service.  This is reflected in the budget for the Legal Aid Board, which has recently taken over responsibility for the Service.  It has also been possible, despite the difficult financial climate, to maintain the budgetary levels for both the Equality Authority and Human Rights Commission at broadly the same levels as in 2011.</P>
        <P>There is, of course, a need to effect essential savings in the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme and in this context there is a reduction of &euro;10 million on the expected expenditure level in 2011.  However, the Government has recognised that in the current economic circumstances there are considerable pressures in the resources available to the Civil Legal Aid Scheme, and has maintained funding to the Scheme at existing levels.  In addition, funding to the Free Legal Advice Centres has been maintained at 2011 levels. </P>
        <P>Finally, I would also like to mention the substantial progress being made in relation to a number of proposals which emerged from the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure which has been undertaken across the Sector over recent months.  In particular, the cross-cutting reforms which will be implemented across the Sector to ensure more streamlined interaction between the various components of the Criminal Justice system, with consequent efficiencies and cost savings for all concerned, and t  he structural reform being progressed in areas such as the immigration and asylum areas, which aim to achieve a more streamlined and less costly operation while maintaining the current high levels of transparency and standards in operations. It is envisaged that the savings and efficiencies which will flow from these initiatives will help the Department and its associated bodies in their efforts to maintain and, where possible improve, the level of services they provide during times of reducing budgets.</P>

        <P>Funding totalling &euro;137,000 has been provided to Community Alert in 2011 to date, and further funding of &euro;23,000 is being provided, bringing the total for the year to &euro;160,000.  This reduction in funding, of 11%, is due to the financial legacy which this Government has inherited.  The work of Community Alert continues to be highly valued.  No final decision has been taken as to the precise level of funding which can be provided to the organisation in 2012.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The current business permission arrangements are in place for a considerable period and in my view are no longer appropriate to the economic needs of the State. In that regard, INIS has been working on new immigration schemes in the area of entrepreneurship and investment.  I believe there is scope for a pro-active approach in this sphere so as to contribute to our national recovery.  I anticipate being in a position to publish the details of these schemes shortly.</P>

	<P>I attach the highest priority to the full investigation of white collar crime and bringing the perpetrators of such crime to justice.  I have already expressed my unhappiness at the protracted nature of the investigations underway.  This is not a criticism of the investigators and prosecutors, who face tough challenges as a result of the complexities of the matters being investigated.  At the same time, I am anxious to ensure that I do not say anything which might jeopardise any prosecutions. </P>
        <P>Within eight weeks of taking up office, I moved urgently to draft, and seek Government approval to the introduction of, additional legislation.  This new legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 2011, was enacted on 2 August.  The Act is an important step in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackle white collar crime.  Its main purpose is to address delays in the prosecution and investigation of complex white collar crime by improving certain important procedural matters and strengthening Garda investigative powers.  The Act&rsquo;s provisions are based on the experiences of those involved in investigations and prosecutions of white collar crime, and in particular on the experiences of those involved in current investigations into bank fraud and financial irregularities.  It provides new procedures and powers which will speed up both current and future investigations, including investigations into offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption.</P>
        <P>It provides for offences committed by persons or witnesses who are unwilling or reluctant to assist with an investigation. The provisions of the Act include a new power for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply to court for an order to require any person with relevant information to produce documents, answer questions and provide information for the purposes of the investi<Col N="697"/>gation of relevant offences. Failure to comply with such an order will be an offence, punishable by way of a term of imprisonment or a fine or both. This is a central provision of the Act.</P>
        <P>It is expected that the Act will provide vital assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the completion of current investigations as well as providing assistance to them in investigations undertaken in the future.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment that rogue bankers and all those that misappropriate or embezzle funds are properly pursued for their crimes and that the full rigours of the law will apply to them.  I am determined to see this commitment fulfilled.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigations into Anglo Irish Bank by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) are ongoing, with a full investigation team employed at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  This team continues to conduct necessary follow up enquiries in respect of investigations, as well as investigations into separate complaints received regarding other alleged malpractices.</P>
        <P>All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na allocated to such investigations have previous experience in the investigation of fraud related offences, and the investigations are augmented by experienced investigators from ODCE.  There is close cooperation and ongoing liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ODCE, with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seconded to ODCE.</P>
        <P>I am informed that three comprehensive investigation files have been submitted by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation to the Law Officers, in December, 2010 and October, 2011.  In addition, a supplementary investigation file was submitted in May.  The files remain under consideration by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and directions are awaited.  Following recent developments it is anticipated that a further investigation file will be submitted to the DPP.</P>
        <P>Garda management is satisfied there are sufficient personnel and technical expertise available to assist in the various aspects of the ongoing investigations.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in August, 2010.</P>
        <P>The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible. As the processing requirements and time taken to complete necessary checks vary from case to case, it is not possible to provide a specific date for determination of an individual application. However, I can inform the Deputy that good progress is being made in reducing the time taken to process the generality of applications and it is my objective that by the spring of next year, save in exceptional circumstances, persons applying for citizenship will be given a decision on their application within six months.</P><Col N="698"/>
        <P>It is open to applicants for a certificate of naturalisation to submit whatever additional documentation they wish in support of their application. Any such documentation will be considered. However, it is important to reiterate that all applications are now being dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>

	<P>I understand that the National Disability Strategy Recession Plan to which the deputy refers was a commitment in the Programme of the previous Government and that it was not finalised before that administration left office.  However, I can inform the Deputy that the current Programme for Government commits to publishing, &ldquo;following wide consultation, a realistic implementation plan for the National Disability Strategy (NDS), including sectoral plans with achievable time scales and targets within available resources and ensuring whole-of-government involvement and monitoring of the Strategy, in partnership with the disability sector&rdquo;.  As the Minister with responsibility for disability, in line with this commitment, I have established and am personally chairing a new National Disability Strategy Implementation Group, which held its inaugural meeting on 30 November.  The NDSIG will develop and implement the required Implementation Plan for the NDS over the lifetime of the Government.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in April, 2010.  I can inform the Deputy that the application is at an advanced stage of processing and will be submitted to me for decision shortly.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>
        <P>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</P>

	<P>On the 5 December I announced plans, prepared by the Commissioner under the draft policing plan for 2012 for the closure of 31 Garda stations throughout the country, including the Garda Station referred to by the Deputy, and for a reduction in the public opening hours of 10 Garda stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  In making his recommendations, the Garda Commissioner reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures. In addition, all Divisional Officers were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area.  Commenting on the closures, the Commissioner said that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had decided that resources could be better deployed and a more effectively used on the frontline if these particular stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  The Garda Commissioner has reiterated the commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to providing a professional and effective service to the community.  In the coming months local Garda management, in places where a station is going to close, will consult with local communities to determine how best to continue to deliver a policing service in their area.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that following an investigation of an incident, a person was arrested, charged with assault and convicted following a plea of guilty.  The court ordered compensation to be paid to the injured party, and I understand this was done.  I am also informed that subsequently civil proceedings instituted by the injured party were settled before coming to court.  Where an offence is disclosed, the matter is investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and an investigation file prepared for the law officers, who, in the exercise of their independent role, determine the matter of criminal charges against any person.  The incident referred to was fully investigated and brought before the criminal courts, where a conviction was secured.  As the Deputy is aware, the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, and it is not open to me to comment on or intervene in any way in the conduct of, or decision in, any individual court case.</P>

	<P>Each year the Garda Commissioner prepares a Policing plan which must be submitted to me for approval and any plans the Commissioner has in relation to the closure of Garda Stations must be detailed in that annual policing plan.  As the Deputy is aware, the 2012 policing plan provides for the closure of 31 Garda stations throughout the country and the formal closure of a further eight non-operational stations.  Details of these developments were formally conveyed to organisations representing staff interests in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shortly before they were publicly announced.  In making his recommendations, the Garda Commissioner reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures. In addition, all Divisional Officers were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area.  Garda management will continue to engage with the organisations representing staff interests on how this decision will be implemented, and there are mechanisms in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to facilitate discussions on any concerns their members may have.</P>

        <P>Ireland is currently contributing 529 Defence Forces personnel to 11 different missions throughout the world. Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement below.</P>
        <P>The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed, are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 455 personnel, the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 12 personnel, the EU Training Mission (EUTM) Somalia with 7 personnel, the EU-led operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and <Col N="705"/>Herzegovina, with 7 personnel, and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan with 7 personnel. Participation by the Defence Forces in these missions is subject to annual review by the Government and ongoing review by the Minister for Defence.  As regards participation in UNIFIL, which is our largest mission, Ireland&rsquo;s participation is expected to continue for 3 to 4 years.</P>
        <P>Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered.</P>
        <P>Apart from the recent deployment of a battalion to UNIFIL and the appointment of Colonel Michael Beary in August 2011 to the post of Mission Commander for EUTM Somalia, no other requests have been received at this time.</P>

Since the publication of the White Paper and subsequent Strategy Statements, the Defence Forces have undertaken a continuous modernisation process, and the production of the ten-year Equipment Development Plan (2009-2018) aims at prioritising equipment procurement to ensure that the Defence Forces have the most modern and effective range of protective equipment, weaponry and training available.  The Equipment Development Plan is regularly reviewed to ensure that Defence Forces procurement is kept in line with new technology, and where possible, cooperation is undertaken with other like minded countries in achieving economies of scale. </P><Col N="707"/>
        <P>Preparations for Defence Forces operational deployments and the development of military capabilities have necessitated coherence in a number of key planning areas, particularly an equipment procurement plan complemented by demanding training programmes which ensures interoperability with other defence forces deployed on UN-mandated missions abroad. The Defence Forces have been able to bench-mark the success of this interoperability through their deployments with the EU Battlegroups and extensive deployments on UN-mandated missions abroad.</P>
        <P>I am advised that military training techniques are up to date in all respects. Defence Forces training plans are structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them by Government. The challenges of preparing military units for participation in international peace support operations constitute the major dimension of Defence Forces collective training. The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards. Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice and Defence Forces personnel have full access to the best international training standards available.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces deployment to EUFOR CHAD/CAR, later with MINURCAT and now in Lebanon proved that the Defence Forces having trained to a very high standard, were able to operate at a very high tempo where our equipment and personnel proved equal to other troop contributing nations.</P>

	<P>The following table outlines the number of vacancies in the Permanent Defence Force by rank. The number of vacancies set out in the table is based on the current Employment Control Framework of 10,000 all ranks in the Permanent Defence Force versus the strength of 9,460 as at 30 November 2011, the latest date for which figures are available.  As the Deputy will be aware a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces will now be initiated resulting from the Government decision to maintain the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500. This re-organisation, which will prioritise &ldquo;front line&rdquo; service delivery, will have an impact on the number of vacancies in each rank. I have asked the Chief of Staff and Secretary General to bring forward detailed re-organisation proposals for my consideration. The effect of the changes cannot be determined until the proposals are considered and decisions made.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 350 to 352, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>In the current economic situation, the acquisition of defensive equipment and training takes place on a strictly prioritised basis to ensure that the Defence Forces can carry out their roles at home and overseas.  A particular focus is maintained on ensuring that modern and effective equipment is available for overseas peace support operations as is the case with the UNIFIL deployment in Lebanon.</P>
        <P>Investment in new equipment and upgrading of existing equipment for the Defence Forces is provided for under various Subheads of the Defence Vote relating to defensive equipment, mechanical transport, aircraft, Naval Service ships and stores, communications and Information Technology equipment. The provision for defensive equipment for 2011 allows for the acquisition of a restricted range of priority equipment such as Chemical Detection Equipment, Body Armour, Force Protection Equipment, Rifle enhancement and Communication Equipment in order to maintain the Defence Forces capabilities. The 2011 provision also allows for the acquisition of ammunition needed to maintain stocks given the training and overseas requirements throughout the year.</P>
        <P>The priority in the coming years will be on maintaining the capability of the Defence Forces to deliver effective services across all of the roles assigned by Government.</P>
        <P>One of the most significant allocations provided for this year, and which will be required in the coming years, relates to the Naval Service subhead which provides for the provision of two new Off Shore Patrol vessels, the first of which is to be delivered in 2014.</P><Col N="709"/>
        <P>With regard to the Air Corps, the equipment and aircraft available are of a high standard and are maintained by the Air Corps in accordance with best practice. The main expenditure in the Air Corps in 2011 relates to the maintenance and Power by the Hour contracts set up to keep the fleet fully operational.</P>
        <P>Training is at the core of all things military. I am satisfied with the ongoing actions to keep military training techniques up to date in all respects and that Defence Forces training plans are structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned by Government.</P>

	<P>The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region. In accordance with the roles assigned to them in the White Paper on Defence, the Air Corps and the Naval Service are committed to providing support to the civil authorities including in relation to search and rescue. In this regard, the Air Corps and the Naval Service provide support to the Coast Guard as the need arises and within their available capabilities.  A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Irish Coast Guard which sets out the search and rescue assistance that the Air Corps and Naval Service can provide, within their capabilities, to the Coast Guard. The provision of onshore assistance by Air Corps helicopters for mountain rescue operations is covered in the agreement as is the fixed wing top cover by the Air Corps Casa aircraft to Coast Guard helicopters offshore.  Assistance that is provided by the Naval Service to the Coast Guard during maritime search and rescue and recovery operations is also included in the SLA.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that both the Air Corps and Navy have the necessary resources to meet all their operational requirements including the provision of search and rescue assistance to the Coast Guard.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to say that following the outcome of the Government&rsquo;s Comprehensive Review of Expenditure,  the Government decided to maintain the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel. This recognises the significant modernisation that has been achieved to date and reflects the Government&rsquo;s intention that the Defence Forces retain the capacity to operate effectively across all of the assigned roles within the restricted financial allocation.  In response to this revised strength ceiling of 9,500, it is necessary to undertake a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces encompassing a reduction in the number of Army Brigades from three to two. The Chief of Staff was consulted in this regard. I have asked the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence to bring forward detailed proposals for my consideration.  </P>
        <P>The reduction in the strength of the PDF to 9,500 personnel will deliver sustainable savings. The re-organisation is a response to this reduction and is not intended as a cost saving measure <Col N="710"/>in its own right. The primary focus is to free up the maximum number of military personnel from administrative and support tasks. In short the re-organisation is about maintaining operational outputs and capabilities to best effect, within a reduced strength.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have said previously annual savings in respect of utilities, security duty allowances and maintenance amount to approximately &euro;1.3 million per annum in respect of the four barracks being closed.  In relation to O&rsquo; Neill Barracks Cavan these savings amount to approximately &euro;0.35m based on the most recent figures available. In addition to the cost of utilities each barracks requires a security detail and additional further personnel are tied up on purely administrative duties connected to the management of the particular barracks. Because maintaining barrack security can require around the clock cover, a much larger pool of personnel is required. Therefore, several hundred additional man years will become available for operational duties. At a minimum, the value of this efficiency gain across the four locations will exceed &euro;5 million per year.  The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme and has been recommended in many reports over the past number of years.  This was a key consideration of Government in addressing this issue as releasing personnel from security and support functions enables the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to be maintained notwithstanding the fall in strength.</P>
        <P>O&rsquo; Neill Barracks will close on 30th March 2012 with the personnel serving there being re-located to Custume Barracks, Athlone.</P>

	<P>The Government has decided to accept my recommendations that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force will be maintained at 9,500. I believe that this is the optimum level required to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.  I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 30 November, 2011, the latest date for which details are available, was 9,460 comprising 7,671 Army, 806 Air Corps and 983 Naval Service. </P>
        <P>Targeted recruitment has continued in 2011 to maintain the appropriate level of Defence Forces personnel and capabilities.  It is my intention that targeted recruitment will continue in 2012, within the resource envelope allocated to Defence, so as to maintain the Government approved strength of the Defence Forces.  There is currently an intake of recruits underway to the Curragh the majority of which were enlisted on 5 December.</P>

	<P>The Horticultural industry consists of a number of different sectors, each of which has differing problems and needs.  In terms of fresh fruit and vegetables, Irish self sufficiency levels vary greatly depending on the product in question.  For example Ireland is well over 1000% self-sufficient in mushrooms but many fruit types can&rsquo;t be grown in Ireland due to our climate.  Overall Ireland is circa 85% self sufficient in vegetables (including potatoes) but the corresponding figure for fruit is much lower. We are also net importers of nursery stock and flower crops.</P>
        <P>Following the publication of Harvest 2020, a Horticultural Action Group was established and this Group made a number of specific recommendations.  Many of the recommendations address general issues of competitiveness, costs of production and availability of credit which the Government is tackling right across the economy, whilst my colleague Minister of State, Mr Shane McEntee has been involved in progressing those recommendations which come within the remit of my Department. He has had many meetings with different elements of the industry stressing the need for greater co-operation in order that we can compete against imports, whilst meeting the demands of the retailers.</P>
        <P>Within my Department, we have two main means of promoting the industry.  In its 2007 reform of the common organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables, the EU made further provision for financial assistance to producers grouping, on a voluntary basis, to form recognised Producer Organisations (POs) under the EU Scheme of Aid for Producer Organisations in the Fruit and Vegetables Sector. The POs play a vital role in supporting Irish producers of fruit and vegetables. The strengthening of their role is a core part of the EU strategy for improving the competitiveness of the fruit and vegetable sector in the future and was one of the main recommendations for the horticultural industry in the Harvest 2020 Report.   My Department continues to encourage growers to become actively involved in Producer Organisations.</P>
        <P>Through the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector, my Department continues to provide grant aid for horticultural growers who are making capital investments in specialist plant and equipment.  The main objectives of the scheme are to improve the quality of products, to facilitate environmentally friendly practices and to promote diversification of on-farm activities in response to market demand. Under the 2011 Scheme, my Department approved 157 projects.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to note that, in the recent Budget, &euro;3.25 million was allocated to the Scheme for 2012 and applications under the scheme will be accepted shortly.  The grant aid covers all areas of the horticultural industry and will assist in funding investments of approximately &euro;8 million in 2012.</P>

	<P>I am keenly aware of the significance of the horse racing and breeding sector. This an industry in which we are world leaders. It provides significant employment, foreign direct investment and export sales with Irish thoroughbreds exported worldwide.    </P>
        <P>I want to ensure that this sector&rsquo;s world-class standing and reputation is protected and maintained into the future.</P>
        <P>As a clear signal of intent and despite our current very serious financial difficulties the Government last week retained the annual allocation to the Horse and Greyhound Fund.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that, yesterday, I announced I will, shortly, be commissioning an external review of the structures and legislation governing the industry. The 1994 Irish Horseracing Act and the 2001 Horse and Greyhound Racing Act achieved structural reform but I believe the reform now needs to be completed to ensure that governance and administrative procedures are modernised and fully effective in supporting a world class industry into the future.</P>
        <P>In taking this action I am acutely aware of the huge effort and commitment which has been given by so many in bringing the industry to where it is today. But now we need to build on this foundation and provide the framework that will provide further progress.</P>
        <P>In order to allow the completion of this review I asked the current Chairman of Horse Racing Ireland Denis Brosnan to continue in his role until the end of November 2012. I am delighted Mr Brosnan has agreed to do this. His experience and advice will be of considerable value in the year ahead. I believe it is vitally important for the sector that we all work together constructively in the months ahead in order to have an infrastructure in place to grow and develop this great industry while maintaining the pre-eminent position of Ireland on the international stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish sheep sector continues to show positive signs of renewal. Last year saw a halt in the decline of sheep numbers. The results of the Crops and Livestock Survey for June 2011 (provisional estimates) confirm that, after successive years of decline in our national flock, the trend has been reversed with our total sheep numbers increasing by 3.5% on the previous year to 4.8 million. Of significance was the 4% rise in the number of younger ewes being used for breeding, which reflects a sense of confidence amongst farmers in terms of rebuilding breeding stock numbers which will ultimately lead to an increase in through-put. Whilst it is still early to provide an accurate estimate for the 2012 lamb crop, it is estimated that it will be up in the order of 1-2%. The Grassland Sheep Scheme is proving to be a valuable support mechanism in terms of improving income and confidence in the Sector.</P>
        <P>Added to the rise in sheep numbers, average prices to date for the sheepmeat sector are also up by 9% on last year and the outlook for the sector in 2012 is both upbeat and positive. Against this backdrop of renewed confidence at producer level the market outlook remains <Col N="715"/>promising for the Irish sheep sector.  Bord Bia anticipates that prices will continue to hold firm in 2012 given the reduced availability of New Zealand lamb entering the EU market.  Traditionally, New Zealand has played an influential role in determining sheep meat prices in Europe. However on account of a fall in their domestic production, coupled with a 40% increase in average export prices, New Zealand lamb prices are almost at an equivalent level to Irish sheep meat prices.</P>
        <P>2012 looks set to remain strong, however with ongoing tight supplies, much will depend on demand levels in key markets such as France and UK and on the industry&rsquo;s ability to meet the needs of the market.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the prospects for the dairy sector are very positive in 2012 and beyond. Dairy markets have recovered fully from the 2009 price collapse, with EU and World Markets performing strongly this year, and the short term outlook remains positive. This market buoyancy is good for Ireland, as we export over 80% of our dairy production. Last year exports of Irish dairy products and ingredients were valued at some &euro;2.3 billion, an increase of 17% from 2009.</P>
        <P>The effect of this recovery can be seen in the average milk price paid to Irish producers.  In 2010 this was over 30 cent per litre, well above the 2009 average of 24 cent.  This year farmers are currently receiving 34 cent per litre for their milk.</P>
        <P>In recent years the dairy sector has experienced extreme volatility in product prices, primarily caused by an imbalance of supply and demand in international markets.  While there will always be short term fluctuations in dairy prices, it is important to remember that the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good.  Growth in global population and wealth is forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products, and I am confident that the Irish dairy sector is well placed to benefit from this additional demand.</P>

	<P>The levels of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and ultimately the quotas for Ireland in 2012 will be determined at the December Council of Fisheries Ministers being held on December 15th and 16th   in Brussels. </P>
        <P>A summary of the main 2011 quotas for Irish fishermen are detailed in the table below.</P><Col N="717"/>
        <P>The European Commission proposals for 2012 are based on formal advice received from ICES (the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas), and also on the views of the STECF (the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries), which gives the Commission its views on the economic and social impacts of the scientific advice.  The advice shows that many stocks where Ireland has a quota are not in a healthy biological state and therefore are in need of urgent remedial action. The Commission has proposed cuts of 15% and 25% in many stocks that they deem to be in data poor situations.  At the October Fisheries Council in Luxembourg, the Council considered TAC and quota proposals for the Baltic Sea.   In that context, and in response to concerns that I and other colleagues expressed about the overall policy being pursued, Commissioner Damanaki gave a commitment to rethink her previously stated policy of applying automatic reductions   of 15 or 25% to a swathe of stocks in the absence of full scientific advice.  The Commission now appears receptive to looking at the scientific advice on a case by case basis, which is what I have been advocating. She did, however, state that she intends to implement, as a matter of principle, a level of cut to all stocks without full scientific advice, regardless of the indications of available data and advice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have consistently stated that wherever the scientific advice indicates a need for a cut in TAC levels I will accept this measure. The Sustainability Impact Assessment on TACs and quotas for 2012, which I presented to the D&aacute;il on 23rd   November,  agrees with the need to cut the quotas for some  of the stocks in 2012, though the level of these cuts is queried  in some cases, while in others there is clear scientific data to suggest that a cut is unwarranted.  In other cases, the available evidence is that an increase in the TAC can be justified.</P>
        <P>There is a high cost from a social and economic perspective when quota cuts are proposed and we have to be satisfied that in every case these cuts are justifiable. Fishing ports and whole communities all around our coast are dependent on fisheries for their very survival.</P>
        <P>We need to use all sources of verifiable science when determining our decisions on fishing levels and try to strike the right balance to ensure the health of the fishing resource and the wider ecosystem with the economic and social realities of our network of rural coastal communities.  I will be making every effort to ensure, at the Fisheries Council this week, we deliver on these objectives.</P>

        <P>REPS 4 is a measure under the current 2007-13 Rural Development Programme and accordingly is subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications to be completed before any payments can issue. Administrative checks in respect of 2011 payments have been finalised and I expect the 75% payment for 2011 to issue to the person named shortly.</P>

        <P FLI="0">There are no delays in payments to farmers under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, in relation to which there is no regulatory payment date &mdash; however, it is generally recognised and indeed acknowledged in the Farmers&rsquo; Charter, that a payment target of late September of the year in question is the most realistic.</P>
        <P>Payments commenced, on target, on 22 September, with payments issuing to those farmers whose applications had been confirmed eligible for payment at that time. I can confirm that my Department has, in the interim, continued to pay individuals, as their cases became clear, with payment runs taking place twice a week. This is normal practise and will continue on an ongoing basis, as necessary. In this regard, while I am pleased to note that payments worth in excess of &euro;212 million have issued to date, representing over 93% of applicants, I remain confident that the full budget for the Scheme will have been exhausted by year-end.</P>
        <P>Where in-house checks reveal anomalies in applicants&rsquo; applications, the necessary correspondence issues immediately. By replying to all such correspondence as quickly as possible farmers ensure the rapid resolution of issues, thereby allowing their payments to be made.</P>

        <P>REPS 4 is a measure under the current 2007-13 Rural Development Programme and is subject to EU regulation which require detailed administrative checks on all applications to be completed before any payments can issue. These checks have been completed in respect of 2011 and payments have now commenced.</P>
        <P>There are 2,117 REPS 4 participants in Co. Kerry of which 932 have been paid the first 75% instalment of the payment due in respect of 2011 leaving 1,185 cases remaining to be paid. Further payments are issuing on an ongoing basis and payment of the balancing 25% payment will commence shortly. My Department is also examining cases on which queries have arisen with a view to an early resolution and payment of all outstanding cases as quickly as possible.</P>

        <P>Earlier this year, I successfully sought the approval of the Commissioner to have advance payments made. I am pleased to say that these payments started issuing, on target, on Monday, 17 October. To date, payments worth in excess of &euro;1.162 billion have issued nationally to over 117,202 farmers, representing over 95% of eligible applicants. The following tabular statement shows the position regarding applications and payments to County Kerry herd-owners under the 2011 Single Payment Scheme:</P>

        <P FLI="0">As is clear, while the timing of all direct aid payments to farmers is crucial, it is the Single Farm Payment that is of most importance to farmers, given that it represents in excess of &euro;1.2 billion of the &euro;1.7 billion that is paid out in direct aid. The SFP forms a significant part of the annual income of all farmers in Ireland, in many cases is used to subsidise the running costs of the farming enterprise and is, therefore, greater than the net farm income.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 390 to 394, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is very important for this country, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland&rsquo;s total land area. From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of almost 100,000 applicants, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.</P>
        <P>However, in light of the recognised, ongoing difficulties in the public finances, savings had to be found in my Department&rsquo;s 2012 budget, in the context of which a decision was taken to limit the spend under the 2012 Scheme &euro;190 million. To achieve this saving, priority is given to active farmers and a range of adjustments to the qualifying criteria are under consideration, including:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />increasing the minimum stocking density requirement, from 0.15 livestock units per hectare to 0.30 livestock units per hectare;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />doubling the minimum retention period from three to six months;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />excluding horses from the stocking density calculation;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />providing for reduced rates of aid where applicants hold both eligible and ill-eligible land (non-Disadvantaged Areas land);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />excluding land located more than 80 kilometres from an applicant&rsquo;s main holding where that main holding is situated outside the Disadvantaged Areas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I would emphasise that these changes are not yet confirmed and their potential impact is still being considered, therefore is not possible to give numbers of farmers affected. Furthermore, given that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is part of the wider Rural Development Programme 2007/2013, it will be necessary to obtain Commission for any changes beforehand.</P><Col N="724"/>
        <P>The following tabular statement details the numbers of farmers in receipt of payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the value of their payments, in respect of 2009, 2010 and 2011 (to date), for counties Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Donegal:</P>

	<P>This is a very important Scheme for the country, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland&rsquo;s total land area. From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.</P>
        <P>However, in light of the recognised, ongoing difficulties in the public finances, savings had to be found in my Department&rsquo;s 2011 budget, in the context of which a decision was taken to limit the spend under the 2011 DAS to &euro;190 million. To achieve this saving priority has been given to active farmers and a range of adjustments to the qualifying criteria, including the exclusion of horses for the stocking density calculations, are currently under consideration, also including:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />increasing the minimum stocking density requirement, from 0.15 livestock units per hectare to 0.30 livestock units per hectare;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />doubling the minimum retention period from three to six months;</P>

Furthermore, given that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is part of the wider Rural Development Programme 2007/2013, it will be necessary to obtain Commission for any changes beforehand.</P>
        <P>In relation to the exclusion of horses from the stocking density calculation, I must also emphasise that the exclusion will not apply to equine breeding enterprises. My Department paid over &euro;3.3 to 2,171 applicants under the 2010 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, whose only livestock were horses. This figure is likely to increase further in 2011. There is a clear pattern evident when these applications are subjected to detailed analysis. The applicants were generally maintaining livestock but when ceased doing so they lost their entitlement to the Disadvantaged Area aid as they no longer met the minimum stocking density requirement. Subsequently, they acquired some horses and submitted horse passports in support of their case that they had met the stocking density requirement. Applicants, who submitted passports applied for the Scheme in a very haphazard manner. Some years they submitted passports and other years they did not. That meant that were not eligible for the aid every year. In fact, only six such applicants submitted passports for each of the years from 2007 to 2011.</P>
        <P>In addition, the average number of horses maintained by these applicants was minimal with an average of four horses per applicant in 2010. Finally, it is important to note that many of these farmers continue to benefit from aid payments under the Single Farm Payment and REPS. It is also an option for these farmers to resume livestock production and they will <Col N="726"/>continue to benefit from aid under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme if they meet the proposed revised minimum stocking density criteria.</P>

	<P>The market for the beef sector is very good at present with cattle prices up over 15%-18% on average for all categories of animals over 2010. With the supply of cattle expected to continue to be tight into the first 6 to 8 months of 2012, with Irish and EU production forecast to be down between 3%-5%, we expect the prospects for the returns from the sector to remain strong.</P>
        <P>On the trade side the expected contraction of UK production by 6% in 2012 will provide further opportunities for Irish producers. The UK remains our largest export market which together with continental Europe accounts for 97% of beef exports. For third country trade, prospects will be impacted by developments in Turkey and Russia and from imports from the Mercosur region which are down by 17% to date in 2011. While some slight increase in production is expected in Argentina, Australia and Brazil these will be offset by reduction in US beef production due to higher feed prices.</P>
        <P>In order to support the sector in responding to the needs of the marketplace the long term development plan for the sector is set out in the relevant part of the Food Harvest 2020 report. Among the measures that my Department will be implementing in response to the requirements of Food Harvest 2020 are continued support for the Suckler Cow welfare scheme. Some &euro;25 million has been allocated for the scheme in 2012. Also I have been able to secure &euro;5 million in funding for a beef technology adoption programme. This programme will be modelled on the successful dairy group concept, and my department is, at present, working with Teagasc to put the final technical and administrative arrangements in place.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ireland is a deficit market for cereals, and prices here are greatly influenced by world market conditions. The maintenance of an efficient and viable cereals sector in Ireland is clearly very important. Not only does the sector generate an income for our tillage farmers but it is also a key source of feeding stuffs for our livestock sector.</P>
        <P><i>Harvest 2011</i></P>
        <P>The most recent Teagasc Crop Report estimates total grain production to be in the region of a record 2.4 million tonnes.  This is well above the long-term average production of 2 million tonnes. The highest national yield in more than 20 years has been recorded in winter and spring barley and the spring oats crop. It represents a 17% increase on the 2010 harvest figure mainly due to the combination of increased area planted and exceptional yields. Increased growing costs and land rental cost would balance out the grain sale benefits for most growers.</P><Col N="727"/>
        <P>In line with world and EU markets, cereal prices in Ireland peaked in February of this year, with barley at &euro;226/t and wheat at &euro;239/t. Current prices have levelled off with average prices for barley at &euro;183/t and wheat at &euro;183/t.  Over two thirds of Irish grain is used for animal feed purposes and the remainder is used as a raw material for the brewing, distilling and flour milling industries. Spring barley is the main cereal crop grown by farmers and is used for the malting, seed and feed industries.</P>
        <P>Winter and spring wheat, winter barley and winter and spring oats are the other important grain crops produced for the agri-food industry. My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency, quality and viability of cereal production. These services include seed certification, seed testing and recommended lists of varieties. In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers. The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereal producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world.</P>
        <P><i>CAP Reform Proposals</i></P>
        <P>The CAP Reform Proposals are the main reforms facing agriculture in general and the cereal sector in the coming years.  The greening measures in the proposals will have a direct effect on the cereals sector.  Two of the three greening proposals will apply directly to cereal farmers, those relating to Crop Diversification and Ecological Focus Areas.  Under the proposed Crop Diversification measure, farms with over 3 hectares of cereals will be required to grow at least 3 crops, with any one crop occupying a minimum of 5% of the arable area and a maximum of 70% of the arable area.  Cereal farms will also be required to set aside 7% of the area as an ecological focus area.</P>
        <P>In order to minimise the impact of the reforms on the Irish cereal sector, these issues along with a number of other aspects of the reform proposals will be subject of ongoing discussions with the EU Commission and other Member states.</P>

	<P>The sport horse sector is a very important contributor to the Irish economy. It is worth &euro;400m annually to the Irish economy and supports the equivalent of 16,000 jobs.  Responsibility for the development of the sport horse industry rests primarily with Horse Sport Ireland, the organisation established in 2007 in accordance with the proposals outlined in The Dowling Report. Horse Sport Ireland, working with its affiliate organisations, has been proactive with regard to the development and implementation of policies and strategies for the sustainable development of a vibrant sport horse sector in this country.</P>
        <P>Statistics from Horse Sport Ireland indicate that foal numbers registered by them continued to decline from their peak of over 10,000 registrations in 2008 and it is expected that this trend will continue in 2012.  It is crucial that breeding quality animals remains the focus of Sport Horse breeders in Ireland. To this end, and to aid the breeders with their breeding decisions, Horse Sport Ireland have recently launched an on-line, database called Capaill Oir, which contains the pedigree records of over 320,000 horses. In addition, this facility contains the performance records of 30,000 horses which provides very useful information for breeders.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that my Department and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport have been able to support the work of Horse Sport Ireland.</P>

        <P FLI="0">There are no delays in payments to farmers under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, in relation to which there is no regulatory payment date &mdash; however, it is generally recognised and indeed acknowledged in the Farmers&rsquo; Charter, that a payment target of late September of the year in question is the most realistic.</P>
        <P>Payments commenced, on target, on 22 September, with payments issuing to those farmers whose applications had been confirmed eligible for payment at that time. I can confirm that my Department has, in the interim, continued to pay individuals, as their cases became clear, <Col N="730"/>with payment runs taking place twice a week. This is normal practise and will continue on an ongoing basis, as necessary. In this regard, while I am pleased to note that payments worth in excess of &euro;212 million have issued to date, representing over 93% of applicants, I remain confident that the full budget for the Scheme will have been exhausted by year-end.</P>
        <P>Where in-house checks reveal anomalies in applicants&rsquo; applications, the necessary correspondence issues immediately. By replying to all such correspondence as quickly as possible farmers ensure the rapid resolution of issues, thereby allowing their payments to be made.</P>

The SFP forms a significant part of the annual income of all farmers in Ireland, in many cases is used to subsidise the running costs of the farming enterprise and is, therefore, greater than the net farm income.</P>

        <P>The Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2001 sets specific responsibilities on office holders in relation to the employment of special advisers. Generally speaking, any special adviser who is appointed pursuant to the Public Service Management Act 1997 will be required, not later than 31 January each year, to provide a statement of interests to the employing office holder and the Standards in Public Office Commission. The office holder is then required to lay a copy of that statement before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Additionally, where a special adviser has a material interest in a function falling to be performed, he or she will provide the employing office holder, and the Standards Commission, with a statement of the facts of the interest.  An office holder will also, in the case of a special adviser, lay, before each House, a statement of the qualifications of the person which are relevant to the position.</P>
        <P>In addition, an office holder is required to lay two other documents before the Houses, (1) a copy of the contract of service and (2) a statement as to whether the person is a relative of the office holder. There is no requirement under the Ethics in Public Office Acts for a declaration from special advisors of current or previous membership or association with a political party.  I can confirm that I have laid the appropriate documentation before the Houses and, as such, they are a matter of public record.</P>

	<P>The HSE has responsibility for the implementation of the recommendations from the report on the inspection by HIQA that was undertaken last October.  I have been informed by the National Manager for Special Care and High Support for the HSE  that a number of critical actions identified by HIQA have already been undertaken. HIQA has indicated that it will carry out another full inspection of Gleann Alainn in January 2012. The implementation of the recommendations made in this report will be assessed at this time. It is critical that the HSE take prompt action <Col N="734"/>to deal with the remaining issues and officials of my Department will continue to liaise closely with the National Manager in this regard.</P>
        <P>HIQA currently undertake inspections of Special Care Units under the Child Care Act 1991 and report their findings to me. I have written to Mr Gordon Jeyes, National Director of Children and Family Services, HSE asking him to inform me directly of his plans to ensure the standard of care in Gleann Alainn is safe and acceptable.</P>

	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 426 and 473 to 478, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In July of this year I requested that public hospitals ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  In order to achieve this target a new calculation methodology was introduced, the new method is described as the &lsquo;Maximum Waiting Time Target&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>The NTPF working on behalf of the Special Delivery Unit was first tasked with creating a comprehensive list of those persons &mdash; who if not treated &mdash; would be waiting for over 12 months by the 31st of December 2011.  The creation of such a list therefore had to effectively search into the future to estimate the number of people that might require treatment. In July of this year the NTPF established the list by ascertaining all the names of people who had been listed for treatment on or before the 31st of December 2010. The list contained approximately 14,000 names. It is clear that that database had to include ALL of the patients who would have reached or exceeded a 12 month target on the 31st of December 2011. This list is referred to as the Primary Targeting List (PTL).</P>
        <P>This explains why the list being operated by the NTPF for the SDU is calculated on a different basis to the list offered by the HSE in its performance reports.  The HSE list, also compiled by the NTPF, is a snapshot and relates to those who had already been waiting longer than 12 months on a specific day.  By the end of August it was determined that 9,657 persons listed on or before 31 December 2010 continued to be available for treatment.  Of these all but 684 had received their treatment by 8th December last.</P><Col N="736"/>
        <P>The NTPF determined in August that University College Hospital Galway (UCHG) had 2,530 patients whose treatment must be provided by the end of December this year in order for UCHG to meet the new target that no patient could be waiting for longer than 12 months for treatment at the end of this year. I can confirm that as of 8th December this number has fallen to 455.  The NTPF and the SDU continue to work closely with UCHG to reduce this figure further.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the 30,756 September figure for patients waiting over three months, I can confirm that this number is correct. However I wish to advise the Deputy that the number for people waiting over 3 months at the end of November is 26,832 indicating a significant reduction of 13%.  The NTPF calculation methodology has been in place for some time and there have been no changes in this regard.</P>
        <P>The NTPFs Patient Treatment Register was established in 2005 and is compliant with the Council of Europe Recommendations.  The number of patients who are waiting for more than one year for surgery in each hospital now and this time last year is set out in the following table. The figures are from the Patient Treatment Register and show the numbers of patients waiting 12 months or more as of 8 December 2011. They differ somewhat from the PTL.</P>

	<P>Dr. Sean Faughnan worked in the office of the Leader of the Opposition from late 2008, prior to becoming my Special Adviser in 2011.  My Press Adviser, Mr Mark Costigan, deals with a wide range of press enquires from both the national and local media and from the specialised health publications sector. He also works closely with the my Department in arranging the output of information on health issues. To that end he is in constant contact with the Health Service Executive and a range of other bodies regarding developments in the delivery of health care. He is in regular contact with government ministers and backbenchers to provide information related to matters under coverage by the media and to answer their questions. The enquiries from the media which relate to health are sometimes political in nature and require a response which take that into account. He has never been a member of a political party and has never stood for election.</P>
        <P>Dr. Maev-Ann Wren is an expert in health economics and is working as an Adviser to Minister R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall on a part-time basis. Dr. Wren is not currently, nor has ever been, a member of any political party. She has never been elected to any local authority.</P>

	<P>One of the key elements of the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme is financial reform of the acute hospital sector. We are committed to introducing a more efficient and transparent &lsquo;money follows the patient&rsquo; funding system for hospitals. Various initiatives to facilitate achievement of the &lsquo;money follows the patient&rsquo; funding system are already under way. These include a patient-level costing project that tracks resources actually used by individual patients in hospitals. This project is ongoing at present.</P>
        <P>I would also like to advise the Deputy that the HSE currently operates a national casemix programme. Under this programme, the national average cost per inpatient case in 2009 (the latest full year for which data is available), based on hospitals participating in the programme, was &euro;5,217, and the national average cost per case for an elective daycase in 2009 was &euro;703.</P><Col N="739"/>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to the cost of long-term residential care in public nursing homes, this is published on the HSE&rsquo;s website at <i>http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Find-a-Service/Older-People-Services/nhss/costs.html</i>. The cost of care in public nursing homes is currently being reviewed.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to review the Mental Health Act 2001, &ldquo;informed by human rights standards and in consultation with service users, carers and other stakeholders.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Government and I attach great importance to this review and following my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for Mental Health policy, I established a Steering Group to oversee the review within three months of taking up office.  Included in the Group&rsquo;s Terms of Reference is a commitment to undertake the review having regard to the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.</P>
        <P>To ensure that the review attracted wide attention, a public consultation campaign was launched in September and a series of meetings with key stakeholders are being held to discuss the issues arising.  Among the organisations which the Steering Group have met are the Irish Human Rights Commission, Amnesty International and Mental Health Reform, all of whom, among others, have a strong focus on the human rights aspect of our mental health legislation.</P>
        <P>When the meetings are completed, it is the intention of the Steering Group to produce an Interim Report setting out the results of the consultation process and the main issues and questions to be resolved in the full review.  The substantive work of the review would then commence in January with the final report to be completed by June 2012.</P>

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.

        <P>As part of the overall VFM review, a separate Expert Reference Group on Disability Policy was established to look specifically at existing disability policy and whether it needs to be changed to better meet the expectations and objectives of people with disabilities. The Group&rsquo;s final report has been the subject of internal consultation within the Department of Health and with other Government Departments.  During November it was released for the public and interested parties to have their say and these submissions are now being collated and analysed.</P>
        <P>On completion, it is my intention to look at both reports together and in conjunction with Minister Reilly to ensure that proposals for the future of our disability services are brought to Government for its consideration and publication in due course.</P>

	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appoint<Col N="748"/>ment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

A National HIV Prevention and Sexual Health Awareness Programme for men who have sex with men (MSM) was launched on 1st December to address this situation. </P>
        <P>This new initiative is particularly timely and relevant as it targets younger MSMs with messages which are designed and delivered by their peer groups and aimed at raising awareness, building self-esteem and equipping them to be able to make safer sex choices.  The programme will take into account social and cultural aspects of the target population to ensure the message will be accessible and is a collaborative partnership between the Gay Health Network, Dublin City Council and the HSE.  The awareness programme is in line with the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee&rsquo;s &lsquo;Education and Prevention Plan, 2008-2012&rsquo; which provides a roadmap for HIV and AIDS Education and Prevention.</P>

        <P>The Minister for Health agreed to the amendment to the backdating provision in the HSE&rsquo;s <i>National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Homes Support </i>Scheme subject to certain assurances from the HSE. Among these were the fact that average processing times for complete applications should not exceed 4-6 weeks and that geographical location would not disadvantage applicants. However, it should be noted that a significant volume of applications are submitted to the HSE without the necessary supporting documentation. This can create delays which are outside of the HSE&rsquo;s control.  It is my understanding that the HSE is currently processing complete applications within the 4-6 week timeframe.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Currently, there are no statutory regulations governing sunbed use. However, the Government recently approved the drafting of legislation to regulate sunbed use, and in particular to prohibit their use by those under 18 years of age. Other proposals include ensuring that adequate protective eyewear is provided, that information on the health risks associated with sunbeds use is provided, and prohibiting sunbed outlets and retailers from attributing health benefits to sunbed use.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government has been requested to draft the necessary legislation and the matter has been accorded priority drafting in view of the health risks involved. My aim is that the legislation will be initiated in the Oireachtas before the Summer recess next year as my Department has already completed a considerable body of work in relation to the proposed legislation.</P>

	<P>I am acutely aware of the challenges facing the disability services as a result of reduced resources in 2012<i>. </i> The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that an efficiency saving of 2% is being applied to the budget for disability services in 2012.  Services will also have to make provision for savings in employment and procurement costs which are required of the health services as a whole next year.  The precise levels of savings required will vary depending on the <Col N="752"/>profile of individual service providers and will be determined within the context of the HSE&rsquo;s service planning process.   Services will also have to meet anticipated extra demand from within their budgets in 2012.</P>
        <P><b>Value for Money &amp; Policy Review of Disability Services</b></P>
        <P>A major priority for the Government in the coming months will be to finalise the current Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services to ensure that existing funding for people with disabilities is spent to best effect. It is now more important than ever that large scale spending programmes of this nature are subject to detailed periodic review. The VFM Efficiency and Effectiveness Review will make recommendations that will ensure that the very substantial funding of &euro;1.5 billion provided to the specialist disability health sector is used to maximum benefit for persons with disability, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, there is currently no statutory, independent inspection system in place in relation to residential services for people with disabilities.  The lack of regulation of this sector is acknowledged as a matter of concern and the Government is committed to addressing this issue. </P>
        <P>The legislative framework for the regulation of these services is provided for by the Health Act 2007, which imposes a statutory obligation on HIQA to register and inspect designated centres for older people, people with disabilities and children in need of care and protection.  It envisages the registration and inspection schemes being supported by standards and underpinned by appropriate regulations.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2007 was commenced in respect of residential services for older people on 1 July 2009 and from that date all residential services for older people have been regulated and inspected by HIQA.</P>
        <P>The Act has not yet been commenced in respect of residential services for people with disabilities.  However, standards for the sector have been prepared and published by HIQA.<i> </i> The standards outline what is expected of a service provider and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services.  They clearly set out what a quality safe residential service for people with disabilities should be and support the delivery of person-centred care.</P>
        <P>The current programme for Government includes a specific commitment to put these standards on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA.  As I announced on 16 June, discussions have begun between the Department of Health and HIQA to progress this commitment.  Given the complex nature of residential service provision for people with disabilities, ranging from congregated settings to dispersed housing in the community, careful consideration is being given to designing the most appropriate regulatory model and this work is ongoing.  Appropriate regulations will be drafted as part of this process.</P><Col N="754"/>
        <P>A target date of January 2013 has been provisionally set for the commencement of the proposed registration and inspection scheme for the sector.</P>

	<P>Hospitals must remain within budget so that planned services are delivered safely and efficiently and core activities maintained.  Management of acute hospitals in the HSE-South have adopted appropriate measures to ensure that these objectives are met.</P>
        <P>As part of ongoing cost-containment measures, steps have been taken to control unrostered overtime.  Within the HSE-South, Cork University Hospital, Kerry General Hospital and Wexford General Hospital now give time off in lieu of unrostered hours worked.  Waterford Regional Hospital has adopted a policy whereby NCHDs are rostered to work overtime (on-call) as part of their rostered working week.  Such rostered overtime is remunerated.  Any hours worked outside the rostered hours and not approved in line with rosters agreed with clinical departments are deemed to be unrostered.  NCHDs in the hospitals have been advised of the rules in place.  The HSE advises that the position at South Tipperary General Hospital is currently the subject of local negotiation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible to provide a direct cost comparison between directly-employed nursing staff and agency staff, since the rate of pay varies as between individuals. Directly-employed staff may be in receipt of additional remuneration in respect of working unsocial hours, as well as allowances in respect of particular types of work or qualifications held. On average, such additional payments add approximately 20% to a nurse&rsquo;s basic pay.  Agency nurses are currently paid, depending on experience, at either the first or fifth point of the 2010 consolidated salary scales and receive the statutory minimum annual leave. Additional costs arise in respect of commission payable to the employing agency, on which VAT is levied.</P><Col N="756"/>
        <P>In the context of the expenditure allocation for the health service in 2012, the HSE will be focusing on a range of measures to contain the costs of service provision, including a reduced reliance on the use of agency staffing.  The cost implications for the health service arising from the implementation in Ireland of the EU Temporary Agency Work Directive will therefore be dependent on both the extent of ongoing usage of agency staffing and the precise terms of the legislation when enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>Recognising the success of the Dublinbikes scheme, the Programme for Government commits my Department to look to extend the scheme to other cities.  The National Transport Authority has, at my request, had an assessment of the potential for similar bikes schemes in the regional cities carried out which included initial analysis on how to address key issues identified such as the changed commercial environment to that pertaining when the Dublinbikes scheme was negotiated and different characteristics of scheme provision in smaller cities.  </P>
        <P>I am committed to exploring a range of mechanisms to seek to secure public bike schemes in other cities.  To that end I arranged Symposiums in Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway with the National Transport Authority and the City Councils to inform and involve key business and civic stakeholders, to consider the various issues involved and to provide a defined channel via my office or the National Transport Authority, which any interested parties could avail of to discuss engagement with the scheme publicly or in commercial confidence. Work is ongoing in that regard and expressions of interest in potential funding arrangements for a scheme or elements of a scheme are welcome on a city by city basis or more broadly on a national basis.</P>
        <P>The NTA will further assess the potential for delivery of bikes schemes in the regional cities in the light of all additional information and consideration will then be given to whether procurement of any further public bike scheme or schemes should take place on a national or individual city basis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 516 to 518, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants where available. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, this Government has had to scale back capital spending considerably in recent times. This will have a particular impact on the number of larger projects, such as Narrow Water Bridge, which can be undertaken.</P>
        <P>The Narrow Water Bridge project is estimated to cost approximately &euro;19 million. In recent months, Louth County Council has expressed a willingness to complete the next stage of the planning process from its own resources.  I have no objection to this and my permission is not required. </P>
        <P>I also understand that Louth County Council hopes to secure INTERREG funding for the project.  To do so, they will need to secure a commitment from the Northern Ireland authorities to fund in the order of 75% of the project from their resources (some of which could be recouped through INTERREG).  To date this commitment has not been forthcoming.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the condition of the country&rsquo;s roads, particularly rural county roads that are being neglected by local authorities; his plan to ensure that these roads are not further neglected; his further views on whether the long-term neglect of these roads will lead to increased cost to him and <Col N="759"/>local authorities and have a devastating effect on local infrastructure and business; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. </P>
        <P>While my Department provides these grants (which are administered through the NRA) to road authorities for works on regional and local roads, such grants are intended to supplement their own resources. My Department&rsquo;s grants are not and never were intended to provide for the full funding of regional and local roads. </P>
        <P Just="Left">This year local authorities have been provided with grants totalling &euro;452 million for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads. This includes an additional &euro;60 million allocated for road strengthening under the Jobs Initiative in May of this year. However, there is also a need for local authorities to provide sufficient moneys for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads from their own resources budget.</P>

	<P>In April of this year I signed regulations under which learner drivers are now required to undergo Essential Driver Training (EDT) before they can sit the driving test.  EDT is one of a number of measures being introduced as part of a Graduated Driver Licensing system for Ireland.  I appreciate that this entails additional costs for learners.  However, EDT is a major step forward in terms of road safety and offers great benefits both for learners and for all road users.  It will ensure that learner drivers develop a baseline of knowledge and skills which would not have been the case before.  This will improve the quality of driving in general on our roads over time, benefitting <Col N="760"/>the learners themselves and as well as other road users.  My Department has no funding available to provide assistance with the cost of EDT lessons. </P>

	<P>The normal procedure for the hosting of international sporting events is that the Irish affiliate of the relevant governing body will bid to host the event in question in Ireland. In this case, it would be  a matter for the IRFU to decide if it wishes to make a bid to host the rugby world cup in Ireland. </P>
        <P>If the IRFU decides to make a bid, my Department will be pleased to provide assistance in the preparation of such a bid.</P>
