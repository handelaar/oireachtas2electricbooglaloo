	<P>As the Taoiseach knows, in February last, all of our European partners agreed to change our financial support package to make it more sustainable.  This was officially confirmed at the eurozone summit that the Taoiseach attended just over three months ago.  Since then there has been no progress, and things have actually been going backwards.  The euro crisis is getting worse by the week.  In our case, the only thing that has changed is that we have given up looking for better terms on all the funds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On Monday, senior sources in the office of President Sarkozy expressed amazement that the Taoiseach has yet to go to Paris to discuss the interest rate.  Incredibly, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own office refused to confirm that he had even spoken to President Sarkozy on the telephone.  Since the election, he has held a bilateral meeting with only one European leader involved in our funding package, the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, yet he refused even to ask him about reducing the interest rate.  What has happened to the pledge the Taoiseach made days before the election to use his contacts in Europe to arrange a great rush of meetings with European leaders?  Finance Ministers have failed to reach agreement on our interest rate, and it is not even on the agenda for Sunday&rsquo;s emergency meeting.  Will the Taoiseach end his hands-off policy and arrange to meet face-to-face the leaders who are standing in the way of delivering the better terms everyone agrees are required?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P Just="Left">It seems that what Deputy Martin wants to do is to increase the level of what was deemed to be a Gallic spat to an all-out war.  Things have changed since last February.  The first thing that happened was that the Government had a look at the agreement that was reached by the Deputy&rsquo;s own Government and the troika, and set about renegotiating elements of it within the constraints of the overall deal in order to improve the lot of Ireland by obtaining agreement on the reversal of the cut in the minimum wage and obtaining approval for a limited jobs initiative and for the comprehensive spending analysis that is currently under way.  That is very different from what applied prior to February of this year.  The result of those negotiations has been confirmation from the troika itself, the IMF, Olli Rehn, Christine Lagarde and a whole range of others of Ireland&rsquo;s case for a reduction of interest, which was approved in principle at the meeting of the Heads of Government and devolved to the Ministers for finance, and also confirmation that Ireland is now on the right track.</P>
        <P>What I discovered in the context of other things was that the relationship of this country with our European partners was nothing short of disgraceful.  The reason for that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should back that up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is that Ministers in the last Government did not attend meetings they were supposed to attend&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Who told the Taoiseach that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and if they did speak, they spoke only on a confined basis about elements of this country and had no contribution to make in the broader context of Europe.  The T&aacute;naiste and I, along with every other Minister, have worked hard to restore the reputation of this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Where did the T&aacute;naiste do that?  Was it Tanzania?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will continue to work at that.  This country was always exceptionally highly rated by our European counterparts, but that slipped over a decade of non-attendance and non-participation and an arrogant assumption that this country was on top of the pile and would stay there.  We need to rebuild that reputation, and I will be asking the Deputy for his help because he has connections in Europe.  He should admit that things are different and that we are now on a different path towards sorting out the problems that this country faces and the legacy that was left to us.</P>
        <P>The last time I met President Sarkozy in Brussels, he agreed that we must have a meeting; he said this more than once.  We will have a meeting in due course and at the appropriate time.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is accountable for his own promises and for the commitments he made.  The assertion he has just made about Ministers in the former Government is a most reprehensible one.  It is a low charge that has no substance, and he should withdraw it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">That is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the Taoiseach who made the commitment to use his contacts and hold meetings with European leaders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Could we have a supplementary question, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In February, every country agreed to deliver a significant cut in our loan terms, but today we are again being blocked on a much smaller request.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision to hand over responsibility for these negotiations was a mistake and should be reversed immediately.  Meetings with European leaders should not happen only during election time.  We are not talking about a Gallic spat or anything that was over-hyped by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s <Col N="205"/>people.  The bottom line is this: a simple meeting or series of meetings with European leaders could do a lot to resolve this issue.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the man whom the Taoiseach was supporting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in his campaign for the position of President of the European Central Bank said he had no interest in providing the medium-term funding we are seeking and that inflation is his main concern.  At next week&rsquo;s summit, he is due to be handed an eight-year term.  Instead of just smiling and nodding his appointment through&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, you are over your time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;will the Taoiseach commit to talking to him personally about his comments?  Mario Draghi is unknown here at the moment, but he will become very well known in his organisation in terms of his policies with regard to Ireland.  Before we support him, we should have some indication of where he stands and the degree to which he understands the needs and requirements of Ireland and other peripheral countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not regard telling the truth as being reprehensible.  The fact is that this country was let down by non-attendance and non-participation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and a very limited contribution from the last Government in particular.  Nor do I agree with the Deputy that it was a mistake to devolve responsibility for continued negotiation on the principle of an interest rate reduction to the finance Ministers.  I repeat that the reason the Heads of Government made that decision was that the stress tests on the Irish banks were not complete.  As leader after leader has said, we cannot make a decision in the absence of the figures, and the figures were not known at that stage.  That is why the authority was devolved to the Ministers for finance.  As Deputies know, there is a meeting of ECOFIN on Sunday and Monday, and this issue will arise in those discussions.  In addition, I will meet with the President of the European Council, Mr. Van Rompuy, here on Friday to discuss a range of issues.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s comment on medium-term funding, it would be beneficial for everybody if such funding were made available now.  When I spoke to Mr. Trichet by telephone when he was in China about Ireland&rsquo;s position, he stated ECB-guaranteed funding would continue for Ireland, irrespective of a downgrading or not following the publication of the stress tests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach aware the health service is facing its first crisis since he took office?  Accident and emergency units are struggling to maintain 24-hour cover and are at risk of closing.  Hospitals and hospital wards are facing closure while essential services, such as maternity and infant schemes, are under threat.  Up to 1,600 hospital beds have been closed due to the previous Administration&rsquo;s cutbacks but this Government has not re-opened one of those beds.</P>
        <P>One of the main factors in this health crisis is the shortage of junior doctors on whom our public hospitals are dependent.  I predict that on 11 July, following the changeover in job rotations, the number of vacant junior doctor posts will come to at least 400.  This will be substantially worse than anything seen before.  It will have a devastating effect on the provision <Col N="206"/>of front-line services in the health system.  Will the Taoiseach accept this prediction?  If so, what will he do to rectify this problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The overall position of the health system and services leaves much to be desired, particularly in respect of those who cannot get inside the system.  I and other public representatives have evidence of the exceptional quality of treatment patients receive once they get into the system.  However, I recently had a case of a person who was in hospital for three weeks awaiting an MRI scan, who told me he was taking up a bed that could be used for someone else.  That is why the Government has set out a programme to change the nature and structure of the way health services are delivered.</P>
        <P>The question about junior doctors is relevant.  Obviously, junior doctors make a particular contribution to the quality of health services.  The shortage of such doctors will be addressed by the Minister for Health on Friday morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach on the wonderful work done by the health services but, once again, he has avoided the question.  There is a crisis which I believe will be unprecedented.  I ask that all Deputies note what I say.  Our public hospitals, particularly our smaller regional ones, are dependent on junior doctors.  If no intervention is made between now and 11 July, the chronic shortage of junior doctors will have an effect on emergency trauma services.  Paediatrics will be under so much pressure that services will not be maintained.  The hospitals affected will include Drogheda, Portlaoise, Roscommon, Cavan, Beaumont, Castlebar, Limerick, Letterkenny, Cork&rsquo;s South Infirmary, Portiuncula&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are meant to be asking questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;Mid-western Regional Hospital and Waterford.  The Taoiseach needs to take immediate action to assess the impact on services on 11 July.  Will he undertake to make a statement to the House on the matter after he has examined this severe crisis?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>For years the Vote for the Department of Health went through the House in the normal way.  By July or August every year, health boards and the Health Service Executive ran out of money for some services.  Consequently, hospital wards were closed, expensive medical equipment lay idle and trained personnel did not have an opportunity to give of their best.  That is why the Minister for Health has set out to change the direction, nature and structure of the way health services are delivered.  In the past three weeks, he had to investigate why &euro;100 million in funding for a detailed purpose went in a different direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We still do not have an answer to what happened in that particular case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can have more than one debate on the health services.  The Minister for Health will not be afraid to spell out the truth and nature of the difficulties.</P>
        <P>Having looked at how the Government must deal with these problems, I have decided to appoint another Cabinet sub-committee to deal specifically with health issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not be able to ask any questions then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is central to the entire problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Beginning in January 2014, approximately 11,000 workers will reach 65 years of age and should be going on to the State contributory pension.  Today, the Minister for <Col N="207"/>Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, intends to ram a Bill through the D&aacute;il which will mean these workers will not get a cent at 65 but will have to work another full year.  The Minister also intends to ram through an increase in the age for receipt of the State pension to 67 years in 2021 and thence up to 68 years.  Has the Taoiseach any appreciation of how socially regressive these measures are?  Has he any appreciation of how heartless these Government proposals are?</P>
        <P>It will hit hardest the lowest paid workers who have paid their taxes and worked all their lives.  It will hit hardest the men and women who work in the most difficult employment areas.  How would the Taoiseach like to be forced to work on a construction site until he was 70 years of age?  I note the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, finds that amusing.  I do not think people out there will find it so when they discover what is in store for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I have the Deputy&rsquo;s question, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">How would the Taoiseach like an aunt or another female relative to be forced to work in industrial cleaning until she was almost 70 years?  This is nothing more than a further attack on working people in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s mission, along with the EU-ECB-IMF, to salvage the speculators in Europe from their disastrous debts in Irish property.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach aware that France, Spain and other countries had major national debates on raising the state pension age?  In Ireland, however, the media seems to have gone to sleep.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is out of time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>No worker knows what is coming.  In view of the democratic right of people to have a major debate on this crucial change in social policy, will he withdraw these rotten measures in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011 to allow for a national debate on them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>Shame.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill also gives effect to the reversal of the cut in the minimum wage which, as Deputy Joe Higgins well knows, affected lower paid workers and who would have felt a larger brunt of the difficulties this country faces.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Answer the question and stop giving red herrings.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Does Deputy Joe Higgins wish to ask a supplementary question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I find it interesting that the Taoiseach, the Government and its backbenchers treat this issue with contempt.  It is an issue of primary importance for the tens of thousands who will be affected by it and forced to work in the most difficult circumstances until they are 68 years.  More importantly, only in two and a half years time these measures will <Col N="208"/>affect 11,000 workers.  This is of the most serious import.  Any Deputy who votes for this measure today should be ashamed of himself and herself.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach indicate how he dares to call the Ministry in question the Ministry for Social Protection, particularly in view of the fact that a measure which amounts to social aggression will be put through the House today?  What is proposed represents an attack on the elderly or those who are growing old.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I want the Deputy to understand that the Government does not in any way regard this as treating people with contempt.  Each day I deal with people who are experiencing the same challenges as those being encountered by the individuals to whom the Deputy refers.  I do not agree with his assertion that members of the media are asleep.  I am of the opinion they are very much awake and vigilant, as is their responsibility.</P>
        <P>In the context of where we are headed, I obviously want as many people as possible in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency and all other constituencies to be removed from the live register.  These individuals have the right to earn a decent living and to contribute to their pensions in the best way possible in order that the eventuality under discussion will not occur.  People have been aware of this matter for some time.  The Deputy will recall a time when the pension age was 70.  I am not stating we should return to having such a pension age.  We have reached agreement on this matter &mdash; as people are well aware &mdash; and we must resolve the difficulties and challenges the country faces in order that everyone can be guaranteed a decent future.  People must be informed well in advance of the increased age limit in respect of pensions.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Duine &eacute;irimi&uacute;il ab ea Brian Lenihan agus polaiteoir den ch&eacute;ad scoth.  Duine l&aacute;ch, sibhialta, c&uacute;irt&eacute;iseach a bh&iacute; ann.  Bh&iacute; gach &eacute;inne gean&uacute;il air agus bh&iacute; sp&eacute;is aige i ngach &eacute;inne freisin.  Bh&iacute; am aige do gach duine.  I rith a shaoil ba l&eacute;ir gur thuig s&eacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; aon duine eile go bhfuil dualgais orainn uile don t&iacute;r agus don St&aacute;t.  D&rsquo;oibrigh s&eacute; go dian d&iacute;cheallach ar son mhuintir na h&Eacute;ireann mar pholaiteoir, mar reacht&oacute;ir agus mar Aire Rialtais.</P><Col N="209"/>
        <P>It is fitting that we are remembering Brian Lenihan in this House which he graced for the past 15 years.  Brian&rsquo;s passing is deeply felt on all sides of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Many of us have been numbed by the loss of a brilliant politician, a patriotic Irishman and, to so many of us here, a great friend.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Brian fought a brave and courageous battle with a serious illness during the past 18 months.  In all of that time, he never once flinched from his public duties and he showed an unceasing and untiring commitment to tackling the economic crisis facing this country.  Even when receiving debilitating treatment, Brian continued to work assiduously in the best interests of this country.  For Brian Lenihan, that was always paramount.  Brian&rsquo;s commitment in doing his utmost for the Irish people defines modern patriotism and all that is laudable in our politics.  His loss to Irish public life is immense.</P>
        <P>Brian Lenihan was a superb lawyer and academic, as well as a politician of rare ability and great talent.  He had already accomplished much on Ireland&rsquo;s behalf and had the potential to achieve so much more.  He was a politician with few peers and a man in his prime, which makes his passing all the more distressing.  To quote William Butler Yeats:</P>
        <P LI="1">Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,</P>
        <P LI="1"><?oasya _mv-9- ?>As &lsquo;twere all life&rsquo;s epitome.</P>
        <P LI="1"><?oasya _mv-9- ?>What made us dream that he could comb grey hair?</P>
        <P FLI="0">Of course we could never have been certain that what Brian once light-heartedly described, in an interview with Sean O&rsquo;Rourke, as his &ldquo;famous dark indestructible hair&rdquo; would ever have turned grey.  However, we all would have liked to have seen Brian get the chance to age with dignity and to live a much longer life.</P>
        <P>As a young man, Brian Lenihan studied law in Trinity College, Dublin, and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, graduating from both institutions with first class honours.  He subsequently worked as a barrister and as a lecturer before devoting himself to politics.  He was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in a by-election for the Dublin West constituency in April 1996, following the death of his father, Brian Lenihan Snr., who in his time had also been a much loved and respected political figure in Irish life.  P. J. Lenihan, Brian&rsquo;s grandfather, also served in this House in the 1960s, having joined Fianna F&aacute;il in the early 1930s.  In his youth, P. J. Lenihan had been strongly associated with Michael Collins.  In later life, however, he became a close confidant of Se&aacute;n Lemass.  Brian served in this House for many years in the company of his aunt and former Minister, Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, and his brother, Conor.</P>
        <P>Last summer, Brian was extremely honoured to have been asked to speak at the Michael Collins commemoration at B&eacute;al na Blath where he touched upon his grandfather&rsquo;s &mdash; and his own &mdash; admiration for Collins and Lemass as two of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest ever leaders.  At B&eacute;al na Blath, Brian said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Years after the Civil War, after a decade as a civil servant, my grandfather joined Fianna F&aacute;il, attracted in particular by Se&aacute;n Lemass who shared many of the same qualities he had admired in Michael Collins: the talent for organisation, great energy and a modernising tendency.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Brian Lenihan was rightly proud of his family&rsquo;s immense contribution to public service in this country.  The highest compliment I can pay Brian is to say that by his own impeccable career he has added further lustre to the proud record of distinction of a truly great political family.</P>
        <P>Brian Lenihan was undoubtedly an outstanding public representative of this generation.  He had an unrivalled combination of skills and an unstinting work ethic which he generously put <Col N="210"/>at the full disposal of the Irish people.  He had a formidable intellect and was a gifted communicator.  He was full to the brim with ideas and had a great grasp of policy.  He was an intellectual powerhouse, but he wore his learning lightly.  He was witty, he was good humoured and he was full of fun.  He was engaging, he had charisma and he loved meeting people.  He was one of the best-read people I ever met and although he was a first-rate academic, he always retained the common touch.</P>
        <P>Brian&rsquo;s academic prowess was not just confined to the law, brilliant though he was in that sphere.  His knowledge of literature and history was also breathtaking.  A former party official and friend of Brian&rsquo;s told me of a recent conversation he had with him on evolving political attitudes to the Presidency in 20th century Ireland.  As part of their discussion, Brian referred in detail to a D&aacute;il debate that had taken place in 1947.  When Brian was asked how he had come across this interesting but slightly obscure information, he matter of factly informed his stunned friend that he had read every single D&aacute;il debate from the 1940s.</P>
        <P>Brian, of course, read those D&aacute;il debates in hard copy.  When future scholars come to study the D&aacute;il debates of our time, they will have the benefit of online technologies and search engines.  They will need to do no more than insert the words &ldquo;Brian Lenihan&rdquo; to find some of the most outstanding D&aacute;il speeches of the second half of the 1990s and the first decade of this century.  His contributions to this House were consistently erudite and always impressive.</P>
        <P>Just as Brian was a voracious reader of history, especially Irish history, he also had an immense passion for languages.  He was a Francophile and had a great command of French, so much so that in his contacts with the French Finance Minister, Ms Christine Lagarde, Brian would regularly discuss technical and complex fiscal matters with her in that language.  Many people will have heard Ms Lagarde&rsquo;s interview at the weekend in which she described Brian as &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; and as a politician who was &ldquo;calm, solid and very analytical when we had major issues&rdquo;.  This weekend, <i>The New York Times</i> praised Brian for his &ldquo;tenacity&rdquo;, while Commissioner Ollie Rehn observed &ldquo;this is a loss which will be shared by many people across the political spectrum in Europe, who have had the honour to know Brian Lenihan as a politician and as a person&rdquo;.  In life and in death, Brian Lenihan is respected at home and abroad as a great statesman.  He brought credit and distinction to our country and represented Ireland with superb diplomatic skills in a challenging international environment.</P>

        <P>Bh&iacute; gr&aacute; daingean ag Brian don Ghaeilge chomh maith.  Mar ch&uacute;lbhinseoir d&rsquo;oibrigh s&eacute; go crua chun a chuid Gaeilge a fheabhs&uacute;.  T&aacute; sc&eacute;al ag Conor Breen faoi chuairt a thug Brian ar shiopa leabhar anseo i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath chun B&iacute;obla Naofa, Sean-Tiomna, as Gaeilge a cheannach.  Chaith Brian go leor ama ins na seachtain&iacute; ina dhiaidh sin ag l&eacute;amh an Bh&iacute;obla agus ag d&eacute;anamh aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in ar an t&eacute;acs.  Is f&eacute;idir a r&aacute; go raibh a mh&oacute;dhanna foghlama neamhghn&aacute;ch, ach bh&iacute; Brian cinnte de gur sl&iacute; chliste &iacute; chun a chuid Gaeilge a fheabhs&uacute; agus, ag an am gc&eacute;anna, a chreideamh a neart&uacute;.</P>
        <P>Ar bh&aacute;s Bhrian, is f&eacute;idir focail Thom&aacute;s U&iacute; Chriomhthain a thabhairt chun cuimhne, &ldquo;N&iacute; bheidh &aacute;r leith&eacute;id&iacute; ar&iacute;s ann&rdquo;.  I gc&aacute;s Bhrian is f&eacute;idir a r&aacute;, le br&oacute;d agus le huaigneas, nach mbeidh a leith&eacute;id ar&iacute;s ann.</P>
        <P>As a ministerial colleague, I was privileged to observe Brian Lenihan at close quarters.  He had my complete admiration.  He was, quite simply, brilliant and often in a league of his own.  He was a solutions based politician with a sharp and incisive mind and an uncanny ability to get things done.  He served first as Minister of State with responsibility for children, where it was my pleasure to work closely with him as Minister for Health and Children.  Brian was a conscientious and compassionate children&rsquo;s Minister of State and he brought forward a number of fresh and valuable policies relating to child protection, child care and youth justice.  In June <Col N="211"/>2007, Brian Lenihan was appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In this Department he was a reforming and innovative Minister with political and legal mastery of his portfolio.  He was particularly focused on putting the rights of victims of crime centre stage.</P>
        <P>Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s time in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was relatively short and in May 2008, he was appointed Minister for Finance.  He was in this key economic portfolio when the worst financial crisis ever to hit independent Ireland emerged.  Brian Lenihan faced events at a scale and a pace of magnitude that no other Irish Minister has ever previously had to contend with.  He rose to this unprecedented challenge and he never complained.  His performance characterised grace under pressure.  He was tested, and tested hard, but he played a stellar role in meeting the fiscal crisis head-on.  When Ireland was in the eye of the storm, Brian Lenihan never faltered.  Day in and day out he continued to step up to the plate and he did not shirk his responsibilities.  He was tenacious and he never gave up.  He did his utmost to communicate with clarity the hugely difficult predicament the country found itself in.  In a hugely volatile and rapidly evolving political and economic climate, Brian Lenihan was always cool and clear-headed in his decision making.  He was willing to take unpopular choices if he believed these were necessary and in the country&rsquo;s best long-term interests.  His unyielding determination to do his duty, in spite of a serious illness, was remarkable and inspirational.  It was truly a profile in courage.</P>
        <P>History will record that Brian Lenihan did an outstanding job in extraordinarily difficult circumstances.  I believe Brian Lenihan will be remembered with affection, gratitude and enduring respect by the Irish people.  The poet Stephen Spender wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">I think continually of those who were truly great.</P>
        <P LI="1">Who, from the womb, remembered the soul&rsquo;s history</P>
        <P LI="1">Through corridors of light where the hours are suns</P>
        <P LI="1">Endless and singing. ....</P>
        <P LI="1">The names of those who in their lives fought for life</P>
        <P LI="1">Who wore at their hearts the fire&rsquo;s centre.</P>
        <P LI="1">Born of the sun they travelled a short while towards the sun,</P>
        <P LI="1">And left the vivid air signed with their honour.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>The Truly Great</i> captures the essence of Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s contribution.  Brian&rsquo;s untimely death robs this country of a hugely talented politician and someone who had so much more to give.</P>
        <P>The greatest loss belongs to Brian&rsquo;s family, the people who knew him best and loved him most.  I wish to extend my deepest sympathies to Brian&rsquo;s wife, Patricia, his son, Tom, his daughter, Clare, his mum, Mrs. Ann Lenihan, his brothers, Conor, Niall and Paul, his sister, Anita, his aunt, Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, his extended family and many, many friends.</P>
        <P>My own abiding memory of Brian Lenihan is of a politician who was never deflated, who was always optimistic and restless to achieve more.  He spent all of his time in politics in vigorous pursuit of the public interest.  He packed so much into too short a life, and he did it all with great humanity and wisdom and always with a smile upon his face.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Well done Brian, you have done us all proud.  Now rest in peace, my friend.  Ar dheis De go raibh d&rsquo;anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

        <P Just="Left">No words of mine can adequately deal with the sense of loss felt by Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s family.  I recall the eloquence of the silence, and indeed the applause, in Porterstown church yesterday, where I attended his funeral.  I spoke to Brian Lenihan on a number of occasions in the House, particularly on the last occasion I met him before his last attendance here.  He said, &ldquo;I really shouldn&rsquo;t be here&rdquo;.  The job he held in the Department of Finance gave him that extra challenge to cope with his debilitating illness and the job of getting on with life.  I listened to his open and candid interview when his problem was first diagnosed.  The openness and courage with which he explained what his medical problem was and how he intended to cope with it was a revelation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Brian Lenihan exhibited a great sense of humanity, particularly when he chaired the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and during the five years when he was Minister of State with responsibility for children.  When he was appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he had a real attraction to the work and showed a real inclination to make serious changes in the way our judicial and legal system operates.  Events moved on and he was appointed Minister for Finance.  The scale of the chasm in front of him became apparent to him very quickly.</P>
        <P>He exemplified a love of politics and an association with people.  Far from being locked into an individual or political rut, Brian Lenihan would always break off to talk to people from other parties, of other persuasions or with other interests.  He demonstrated that ability on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>His facing up to a terminal illness as he did and the openness with which he spoke about it to everybody is a lesson for every person.  His funeral brought home to everyone elected to this House, and those who might think they are above their station, that at the end of the line the tricolour will fly at half mast for everyone who is in this Chamber.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I like to think Brian Lenihan will be remembered as a politician who made a contribution and constantly strove to bring out the best in politics.  We argued and had many reasons to argue differences of political opinion but as a person, as a representative of politics and of the country and in the constitutional Ministries he held, I always regarded Brian as a friend.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The words of Louis McNeice come to mind: &ldquo;By a high star our course is set.&rdquo;  Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s course was set by a high star.  Fate and time intervened to prevent him from, possibly, achieving higher office in which I know he had an interest.</P>
        <P>I offer with Deputy Martin and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party my condolences to Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s mother, Ann, his wife, Patricia, his children, Tom and Clare, and the broader Lenihan family.  I commend them on their contribution to public life and sympathise with them on the loss of a husband, father, political representative and politician.  That was epitomised by the numbers who turned up to pay their last respects to somebody for whom they had an affinity, regardless of whether they agreed with his politics.

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhr&oacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh ar son Ph&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre mhuintir agus le clann Brian Lenihan.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I offer my sincere condolences to Brian&rsquo;s family: his wife, Patricia; his children, Tom and Clare; his mother, Mrs. Ann Lenihan; his brothers, Conor, Niall and Paul; his sister, Anita; and his indefatigable aunt, Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, a former colleague of ours and a very good friend to every woman who has had the honour of being a Member of this House.</P>
        <P>I first met Brian during the presidential election campaign of 1990, when he was one of the principal campaigners and strategists for his late father, Brian.  That was a hard campaign for the Lenihans.  Many different things happened as they do in different campaigns.  Politics is not <Col N="213"/>all about the glory days; there are many hard and difficult times in politics for most people.  Although in many ways Brian Lenihan, coming as he did from such a distinguished lineage in politics, was, if one likes, a political aristocrat, political battles had to be hard fought and hard won by the Lenihans as they are by everybody in this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday, I was as happy as one could be in such a sad situation that the sun was shining on St. Mochta&rsquo;s church in Porterstown.  When I first represented Dublin West, that constituency was represented not just by the Lenihans, but also by the Lawlors.  That particular road and lane and the fields leading down to the Liffey were the subject of many pitched political battles on rezoning and development.  For those who had fought to keep some green fields in Dublin West in the context of a population of 92,000, nature collaborated in a way that on the evening of the removal a swallow was high up in the roof of the church.  I know there are some myths that sometimes when a person&rsquo;s soul is passing, one sees something like a bird and it expresses the soul of the person going away to another space and into another realm.  It was nice that the service, which was so intimate and personal to Brian, the Lenihan family and to all that he loved and cherished, was attended by so many people not just from the community of Dublin West and his own family and friends, but also by people from throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Dublin West issues are in many ways the issues of the development of modern Ireland in the past two or three decades &mdash; schools, the hospital, public transport, community development and infrastructure.  I am happy to say that although Brian was very competitive in politics &mdash; I am certainly a competitive person &mdash; we were happy to co-operate as do most Members of this House at a local level on behalf of the interests of their constituents, of the families and the children who make a home and a community in an area such as Dublin West, which grew over 30 years from approximately five small villages into a population of 92,000, which makes it bigger than the cities of Limerick, Waterford or Galway.</P>
        <P>Brian was a consummate lawyer and had the lawyer&rsquo;s great ability to read and master a brief.  He was enormously wrapped up in the law, and he loved the law.  Many lawyers were present yesterday and the very fine words of Paul Gallagher summed up the respect his fellow lawyers had for him.</P>
        <P>He was happiest in ministerial service in the period after he became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It was a personal joy for him to achieve that, particularly as his late father had been Minister for Justice.  He was always tremendously conscious of his responsibilities in terms of the Lenihan dynasty and of achieving things that would have made his father proud.</P>
        <P>To be made Minister for Finance was a great honour but also brought great responsibility.  I differed with him and his predecessor on their approach to the famous tax breaks that fuelled the property bubble, the bank guarantee and NAMA.  However, these were political and ideological differences and arguments about matters that were fundamental to the well being of the people.  I am happy that despite these clashes, it never ran to personal rancour or bitterness, which was one of the things that made Brian so respected across the political spectrum.  There were long nights in this House when Brian was sitting where the Taoiseach is, the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, was sitting where Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is now and I was somewhere hereabouts.  We three carried the debates on our own with four or five people from the different parties coming in and out at different times.  We often took time to talk privately in a quiet corner about the best way forward for the country.  In the early months after the introduction of the bank guarantee, I gave him a short paper I had written about approaches to bank failures, bank resolution and so on.  For months and even years afterwards when I met him, he still had the details of the eight or nine points on the paper, which he had taken in and analysed.  He came back and discussed them with me as the situation evolved.</P><Col N="214"/>
        <P Just="Left">Above all Brian was a Fianna F&aacute;il man born and bred.  He loved Fianna F&aacute;il with all his being as his father had done before.  He, like Brian senior, loved the fun and mischievousness that people could get up to at election time and the little tricks that rivals in constituencies often played on one another, including why someone managed to appear at an event and someone else managed not to appear, the little things that make up the bread and butter of political experience.  He also loved Ireland and its people &mdash; most people in politics, regardless of party, love their country and try to do their best.</P>
        <P Just="Left">He was immensely brave about his illness, and by doing so gave so much hope to other people afflicted by serious illness.  He had that great ability of courage and grace under fire, and great fortitude.  Many people who have been ill themselves have told me that they found the way he approached and coped with his illness deeply inspiring and comforting.  His passing reminds us that there is more to life than just politics.  Ultimately it is his family &mdash; his children, wife, mother, brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles &mdash; who will really miss him and grieve very sorely for him.  Politics is a bit like diplomacy &mdash; one has interests rather than friends.  When times are tough, we go back to our families and core communities, the people with whom we are most at ease.  All the people who gave care and attention to Brian during his final illness and the months when his strength began to wane &mdash; he acknowledged that privately to many people here in this House &mdash; really did him a great service.  In many ways it was being a politician and being a Minister which I often felt kept his adrenaline going in the face of the great challenges he faced at a personal level.</P>
        <P>We mourn his passing.  I hope he goes gently into that good night and I know that he did.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

I extend my sympathy to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, which was so much a part of Brian&rsquo;s life and which was enriched by the contribution he and his family made over many years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mar a d&uacute;irt na cainteoir&iacute; eile, bh&iacute; Brian Lenihan an-l&aacute;idir agus an-mhisni&uacute;il leis an tinneas a bh&iacute; air.  Bh&iacute; meas agam ar an tsl&iacute; a rinne s&eacute; d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an chruach&aacute;s a bh&iacute; air le d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  Ag an am seo, aithn&iacute;onn cairde theaghlaigh Lenihan go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh ama d&oacute;ibh f&eacute;in.  Brian&rsquo;s courage and fortitude in the face of his illness were an inspiration.  We all knew he was seriously ill but he never seemed to let it get him down.  He set an example for all of us.  In many ways, he was a role model for other citizens suffering from debilitating illness.  In his work in this Chamber and public interviews and engagements, there was no sign of the obvious emotional impact his illness must have been having on him and his family.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; go han-chr&oacute;ga.</P>
        <P>Throughout his ordeal, Brian was an articulate and able advocate for the Fianna F&aacute;il Government and its policies.  Brian was a talented and gifted politician who worked diligently on behalf of his constituents and party.  At the funeral yesterday, four or five people approached me to pay testimony to him and the work he had done in this regard.</P>
        <P>Brian was also a considerate person.  On the first day of the new D&aacute;il, he was very open.  He stayed behind after business and sat here when most other Deputies had left to engage with some of the first-timers, and he did so in a very cordial and welcoming way.  I remember meeting him during the recent election campaign.  I was chiding him gently &mdash; we were talking one-to-one about what was going on &mdash; and he said with a smile, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just have to do what you have to do, and good luck with that.&rdquo;</P><Col N="215"/>
        <P Just="Left">Above all, Brian Lenihan was a husband, father, brother and son.  To Patricia, Tom and Clare in particular, I extend again, on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, my sympathy and solidarity.  Brian&rsquo;s death will leave a huge gap in their lives.  All his family, particularly Patricia and his children, can take comfort from knowing that, in his relatively short life, he helped many people and was genuinely liked.  Sometimes people use a lot of pl&aacute;m&aacute;s when speaking of others.  Irrespective of political differences, Brian was genuinely liked by all sides, by friends and political opponents alike.  Perhaps there is no greater legacy than that.  Go nd&eacute;anfaidh Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

The huge turnout of Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s constituents since last Friday was a true testament to the man who served them for so long.  Brian was a man of immense talent and had a magnificent ability to deal with any situation, no matter what presented itself at any given hour.  He was a man of enormous intellect.  Brian had an innate sense of decency and was totally committed to public service, which he always saw as his first duty.  He was a true patriot.  With his love of country and family and his commitment to his party, he was able to transcend all political views and ideologies.  Service to his constituents was his first dedication.  He, as a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, was truly honoured to be the first person independent of Fine Gael to be asked to speak at B&eacute;al na mBl&aacute;th.  What a job he did on that occasion.</P>
        <P>He excelled as a Deputy, Minister of State with responsibility for children, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, latterly, Minister for Finance.  During the last D&aacute;il, he was available at all times to meet colleagues, of any party or group, at any time of the day or night.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The tributes paid to Mr. Lenihan, including those by Commissioner Olli Rehn, Christine Lagarde and many other foreign politicians and dignitaries, demonstrate clearly that Brian was an astute politician who understood totally the gravity of the circumstances in which Ireland had found itself, and who wanted at all costs to deal tenaciously and honestly with the financial crisis for the sake of the people of all of Europe, but primarily the people of &Eacute;ire.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unyielding determination to continue in the Ministry for Finance during a debilitating illness displayed the true Brian Lenihan, a man of courage and bravery with an interest in his country.  Brian was a shining beacon that illuminated the sky and gave inspiration and hope to all of us in this House and to his family, party and community.  During many an animated debate that backbenchers and I had with him during the tough 18 months of his illness, Brian never showed any bitterness.  On the morning on which he was leaving Baldonnel to go to serious discussions with the IMF and the European Union, which discussions history will judge, he telephoned me because my mother was being laid to rest.  He found the time in his schedule, as he did for everyone, to telephone me to apologise for his absence at her burial.  This meant an awful lot to me.  That was the true style of Brian and that is why he meant so much to so many.</P>
        <P>The biggest loss will be to Brian&rsquo;s family.  I thank the parish priest for his lovely ceremony yesterday and all the people who attended.  A wonderful eulogy was delivered by Brian&rsquo;s colleague, the former Attorney General.  We can reflect on that and on thoughts of Brian.  We will have many a happy discussion about him in the future.  Again, I extend my sympathy to his family.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh anam d&iacute;lis Brian &Oacute; Luineach&aacute;in.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join the Taoiseach, party leaders and other Members in extending my condolences to Patricia, Tom, Clare and the rest of the Lenihan <Col N="216"/>family on their sad loss.  I extend my condolences to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, for which a bright light has gone out.</P>
        <P>I first got to know Brian when I was a young councillor in about 2003, at which time he was Minister of State responsible for children.  He was already the senior politician in the constituency.  As an ambitious young councillor looking to make a name for myself, I always made a point of taking Brian on and holding him to account for pretty much everything that went wrong in the constituency in the hope that criticism would give rise to provocation and, perhaps, publicity for myself.  More often than not, Brian&rsquo;s good humour and unflappable nature thwarted my objectives.  He always seemed to be able to rise above the cut and thrust of normal politics.  When Brian was speaking at constituency functions as a Minister of State, as he always did at that time, he always began by acknowledging the presence of politicians from other political parties, who potentially would have gone unnoticed had he not done so.  I promised myself at the time that if I ever had the opportunity to be a Minister, I would make sure to do the exact same.  I do so.  He was a very good constituency colleague.  He was always willing to share information and listen to suggestions, and his first instinct when a problem was presented was to try to solve it rather than rush to the media or the barricades.</P>
        <P>Brian Lenihan was the only Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy to hold a seat in the Dublin area in the recent general election.  Most politicians believe they have a personal vote but it is only when the tide goes out for one&rsquo;s party or one decides to go it alone that one finds out who does and does not have a personal vote.  In the most recent general election the tide went out for Fianna F&aacute;il as it had never gone out previously but Brian held on, and the genuine personal vote he had stuck with him.</P>
        <P>His legacy and achievements are etched into the fabric of the Dublin West constituency, for example, St. Francis Hospice in Blanchardstown for which he secured the land and funding &mdash; in a bitter irony Brian became one of its first home care patients; playgrounds across west Dublin and Ireland were built on foot of the national play policy, which was developed while he was Minister; and also school buildings.</P>
        <P>When Dublin West faced a very serious school places crisis in 2006 Brian took it upon himself to try to solve that problem.  He went into the Department and worked with it to establish a new model of national school, the community national school, of which we now have two in Dublin West, Scoil Choilm and Scoil Grainne.  Neither of those schools are called after saints because they are run by the State and are non-denominational.  They were given a random Irish language name to give them some identity but the next time we build a community national school in Dublin 15 we might call it Scoil Br&iacute;an after Brian Lenihan and to remember him in that way.</P>
        <P>Brian was extremely intelligent but always grounded.  He was patrician but never superior.  Sometimes he was wrong but he always tried to do what was right.  When others were weak he was strong.  When others gave up, he fought on.  When others complained that they could give no more, Brian gave everything.</P>
        <P>Members will be aware that he was a very learned man and from time to time liked to quote the great Greek philosophers.  I will end with a quote from Aristotle: &ldquo;The beauty of the soul shines out when a man bears with composure one heavy mischance after another, not because he does not feel them, but because he is a man of high and heroic temper&rdquo;.  May he rest in peace.</P>

	<P>In the Dublin West by-election of April 1996 the late Brian Lenihan, on the final count, secured 11,754 votes.  I happened to be the nearest rival candidate, just 370 votes behind.  In the context of that by-election and since we clashed sharply on political issues, <Col N="217"/>and it has to be said that our differences would have grown wide as a chasm, especially on issues relating to the EU-IMF-ECB agreement.  This is not the time to rehearse all that.</P>
        <P>Cancer is an awful disease.  Those of us, and we are very many throughout this country, who have had friends and family claimed by it at untimely ages of their lives know the anguish of Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s loved ones.  To them and to his extended family I wish to extend our condolences and sympathy.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Deputy, Jackie Healy-Rae, was most anxious to ensure that we expressed our sympathies on Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s sad passing.  When I first came into this House a few months ago he was extremely kind, warm and welcoming to me and I appreciated that very much.  His constituency and Ireland have lost a brilliant, hard-working and dedicated politician.  His family have lost a caring and loving son, husband, father and brother.</P>
        <P>The Lenihan family are highly thought of the length and breadth of this country.  In County Kerry in particular they are highly regarded as his aunt, the former Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, spent a great deal of time holidaying in the county.  They were very well respected.</P>
        <P>I sympathise with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, as Brian was an extremely committed party man.  I also sympathise with all of his colleagues who worked with him during the different Administrations.</P>
        <P>Jackie Healy-Rae asked me to record Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s kindness, ability to do his job and helpfulness to everybody in this Chamber.  When he was riding high in the Government he was also very kind to everyone in all quarters of the House.</P>
        <P>Life is very short for all of us but we must try to pack whatever living we can into each day, and Brian Lenihan did that.  He did not waste time.  He used every minute to the betterment of his constituency, his country and everybody he encountered.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business, yesterday the Government announced three referendums to be held in October.  So far the Government has broken with previous practice and failed to consult with the Opposition on anything to do with these referendums.  Can the Taoiseach explain how he intends to get the three referendum Bills through the Oireachtas in time for October?  Can he explain also the reason the referendum to ban corporate donations, which he promised three months ago, will not now be taken?  The only published amendment is our amendment on corporate donations.  Should the Taoiseach not agree now <Col N="218"/>to send that amendment to the relevant committee and hold a referendum on the banning of corporate political donations along with the presidential election and the other referendums?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is preparing legislation to deal with corporate donations and that will come before the House in the not too distant future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement by Government of the setting up of an interdepartmental committee to deal with the issue of the Magdalene laundries.  I also understand the Cabinet is to consider the United Nations report in respect of the victims of those institutions.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when the Cabinet review will be made public and brought before the House?  I also seek an assurance from him that the interdepartmental review is not a mechanism to avoid a full statutory inquiry, as recommended by the UN.  The women still await an apology from him on behalf of the State for the huge violation of their rights over many years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter is being treated very seriously by the Government.  It is difficult to put in words the scale of the emotional impact for many of those women who worked in the Magdalene laundries.  However, we need to find out the facts here, what happened, how many were involved, and what was the State&rsquo;s involvement.  That is the reason the Government has decided to have an interdepartmental committee to deal with this.  A great deal has been written and said about it, but when it is apparent that a number of women who worked in the Magdalene laundries who are currently being looked after by religious congregations, it behoves us all to find out the nature and the scale of what happened.  The interdepartmental committee will report within three months.  That is based on a potential achievement and it is in everybody&rsquo;s interests that we contribute to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach committed to giving Oireachtas committees powers to vet all State appointments in advance.  Will every appointment to State boards be included?

The fund is bringing in between &euro;40 million and &euro;45 million per annum.  The community sector has been targeted disproportionately by Government cuts and I have the figures for that.

	<P>I heard the Taoiseach indicate earlier that there will be three referenda on the day of the presidential election.  This is the first time that we have heard about the particular focus of each of those and none of them referred to children&rsquo;s rights.  Can he advise us of the status of the proposed referendum on children&rsquo;s rights to enshrine those protections within the Constitution?  Can he clarify why it now appears that the Government will not proceed this year with that referendum?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I stated before that my view was that it would not be possible to finalise all the elements of the children&rsquo;s rights referendum by the date of the presidential election later this year.  The Government has stated its priorities in respect of the Abbeylara case and whistleblower rights and we made the decision yesterday to have a third referendum dealing with the matter of judicial pay.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is pursuing the issue of the completeness of all requirements for the children&rsquo;s referendum.  The commitment will be honoured, but it will not be held on the day of the presidential election.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The proposed agenda for the meeting of the European Council on 23 and 24 June is a wide-ranging one, covering economic issues, migration and asylum, and international questions.  Economic policy issues will include the making of country specific recommendations on foot of the recent proposals made by the Commission.  These represent another step in the European semester process and are intended to inform the national budgets that member states will adopt later in 2011.  The meeting is also expected to endorse an EU Presidency report on the inclusion of the Roma population in the EU, and to endorse the Council&rsquo;s conclusions on the launch of the Danube strategy.</P>
        <P>Asylum and migration issues arise in the context of recent events in the southern Mediterranean area.  Discussion at the European Council will hopefully give momentum and direction to the ongoing debate, including on reform of the current arrangements under the Schengen Agreement and the principle of solidarity between member states.  Depending on developments, the European Council may be asked to sign off on the conclusion of Croatia&rsquo;s negotiation for accession to the Union.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The appointment of the future president of the European Central Bank is also expected to arise, following consultation with the ECB and European Parliament on the suitability of Mr. Mario Draghi for the post.</P>
        <P>I look forward to meeting all of my colleagues, including the Prime Minister of Greece and the new Prime Minister of Portugal.  As regards bilateral meetings, I met with Prime Minister Cameron in London on 18 April, and in Dublin on 18 May; with President Obama in Dublin on 23 May; and with Prime Minister Orb&aacute;n of Hungary in Dublin on 1 June.  Hungary currently holds the Presidency of the European Union.  I will meet in Dublin with the President of the European Council, Mr. Van Rompuy, on 17 June, and with the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Buzek, on 12 July.</P>
        <P>I hope to be in a position to travel to China, perhaps later this year, although of course this is a matter for agreement with the Chinese authorities.  Other arrangements have not been finalised and remain under review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I am dealing with Question No. 1.  I acknowledge there are differences between the economy in this State and the economies in Portugal and Greece.  What we have in common is that we have all lost economic sovereignty and citizens have been forced to pay a debt they did not create.  Is there merit in trying to build alliances?  Has either the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste done any work in that regard?</P><Col N="222"/>
        <P>In regard to the interest rate cut, will the Taoiseach put it on the agenda of the next European Council meeting?  Will he explain what the Government is doing to bring about such a cut?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not set the agenda.  That is the responsibility of Mr. Van Rompuy whom I will meet on Friday.  Obviously, we will discuss a number of matters in that regard.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Finance has been carrying out extensive negotiations on the principle which was agreed of a reduction in the interest rate.  I am sure that matter will again be the subject of discussion at the ECOFIN meeting &mdash; probably on Sunday but certainly on Monday.  I am also sure it will arise at the European Council meeting next week.</P>
        <P>Following on the mandate given to the Minister for Finance, there has been extensive contact between officials and at ministerial level in this regard.  We are pursuing that as a matter of priority.  I have pointed out on many occasions that the adoption of that principle into a reduction in the interest rate will not be consequential on any shift in Ireland&rsquo;s position on the 12.5% corporation tax rate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I note the Taoiseach has grouped Questions Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive.  I tabled four questions and if they were answered separately, I would be entitled to 24 minutes under Standing Orders.  I would appreciate an opportunity to ask some additional supplementary questions because there is quite a range of questions here.  The Ceann Comhairle has no power to persuade the Taoiseach to answer the questions he is asked or to stop him grouping ten questions together.  The only way we can get a specific response is to ask supplementary questions relating to the questions we have tabled.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will agree that before the election he explicitly said that he would use his position as vice-president of the EPP to help persuade our European partners to change the terms of our financing.  He said his meeting with Chancellor Merkel in Berlin was only the first step in a major diplomatic offensive which he would lead.</P>
        <P>It is very clear from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply that he has abandoned such a diplomatic initiative and he needs to explain why.  After three months in office, to have met only one leader who has been involved in deciding the terms of our financing is incredible and to have failed to raise the topic in that meeting is amazing.  The Taoiseach would not ask the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, about a lower interest rate nor would he ask the US President, Barack Obama, about the vetoing of the burning of bondholders.  He has not really met anybody else on a substantive bilateral basis in regard to a reduction in the interest rate and more sustainable terms for Ireland.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach abandon his policy of simply delegating negotiations to the Minister for Finance?  Our interest rate is not even on the agenda of the ECOFIN or the eurozone meetings early next week.  Any change requires the Taoiseach&rsquo;s personal involvement.  He confirmed to me when he took office that the eurozone leaders had already agreed the 11 March communiqu&eacute; about improving the terms of the financing.  Three months later, we have halved our demand and have seen it slide off the agenda.  Will the Taoiseach explain his strategy from here on in?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy claimed I had abandoned all diplomatic negotiations in this matter and then he asked if I would abandon the matter.  There is a contradiction there.  I assure the Deputy that we have not abandoned our negotiations in this matter.</P>
        <P>In respect of diplomatic offensives, the Deputy is aware that the T&aacute;naiste recalled all our ambassadors and called in the European Union ambassadors to explain to them Ireland&rsquo;s strategy which is to deal with the range of challenges before us, from moving on dysfunctional <Col N="223"/>banks to creating incentives for the expansion of our indigenous economy to ascertaining the scale of meeting our commitments in terms of the troika and what programmes will have to be abandoned, maintained or enhanced.  That comprehensive analysis is currently taking place.</P>
        <P>The agenda for the Heads of Government meeting is determined by the President of the European Council, Mr. Van Rompuy, whom I intend to meet on Friday.  Obviously, the discussions will encompass the major issues which confront Europe and I intend to participate fully in those discussions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am genuinely taken aback by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s responses here and over some time in regard to this issue.  According to his reply, the Taoiseach will meet Mr. Van Rompuy and the President of the European Parliament and, potentially, a political trade mission to China will take place towards the end of the year.</P>
        <P>I read during the week of clear annoyance in President Sarkozy&rsquo;s office about the briefing done by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s staff following the 11 March summit.  A relatively common exchange was hyped up to make the Taoiseach look like the new tough guy in town.  Those kinds of briefings are unhelpful.  The French said they are waiting for overtures or for someone to say we want to meet.  Why has the Taoiseach not met other European leaders who are critical on a substantive bilateral basis?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I called in the ambassadors in my time in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  That is not something dramatic or transformative; it is normal in terms of communicating to one&rsquo;s ambassadors the messages they are to articulate on behalf of Ireland in their respective countries.  That is no big deal.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is responsible for the commitments he made and he hyped this up.  He said it was the biggest issue facing the incoming Government.  If that is the case, I find it extraordinary that he has not met the key European leaders who have an impact on ensuring that the agreement arrived at by Heads of State on 11 March is delivered.  The Taoiseach accepted what was on the table by the outgoing Government and ran with it.  All the other European Heads of State agreed at the time that there should be better and more sustainable terms.  For some reason,  the Taoiseach has not engaged in a more proactive diplomatic initiative with those who are blocking it.  The Taoiseach should get on an aeroplane and travel to meet them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Since his time in the Department of Foreign Affairs, it seems the Deputy has been imbued with the requirement to travel.  I have met the leaders of the Union on two occasions at the Heads of Government meeting.  If the Deputy wants us to set off on a 27 nation tour on a regular basis, he would have a different story on which to comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The ambassadors from the European Union countries were called in by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and were given a very clear message that this country is open for business, that there is a new Government with a different set of priorities and that it is making decisions, which had been left in abeyance for years to the detriment of our people and our country, to repair the international reputation and status this country lost.  That is all part of the work.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance and the officials from the Central Bank and the Department of Finance have been in constant contact with their counterparts at an official level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Finance is accepting the responsibility handed to him and other Ministers for Finance by the Heads of Government to continue negotiations on the interest rate reduction.</P><Col N="224"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy is well aware that when leaders attend Council meetings they do not do so on the basis of being the leaders of countries with 30 million, 50 million or 80 million people, but as equals.  Obviously the Deputy wants to convey the impression that there is a new figurehead in town.  The day after I was elected leader of the Government I attended the first meeting of the Heads of Government.  Is the Deputy seriously expecting me to say I would lie down in the face of a requirement to increase Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax rate and not stand up for my country and for what has the support of every party in the House?  Of course, I would not lie down.  If some people wish to write that up as a Gallic spat, a term I gave it, or to make it something bigger than it was, that is within their right to comment.</P>
        <P>I attend those meetings on behalf of this country and have equal status with every other leader.  The leaders do not attend on the basis of their countries&rsquo; population numbers.  We will continue to pursue these important issues where they should be pursued.  In the meantime, we will continue to discuss and negotiate with those who have been delegated that responsibility, and I have every trust in them to achieve that.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer Deputies to Standing Order 42 which provides that supplementary questions may be put only for the further elucidation of the information requested and should be subject to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle both as to relevance and to number.  I do not wish to interfere each day with the working of this Parliament but it is my duty to adhere to Standing Orders.  When Deputies are asking supplementary questions it is not a time for making statements but for seeking further elucidation of the information requested.  If Deputies get the information, there are no supplementary questions allowed.  I wish to be as flexible as possible and I ask Deputies, once again, to bear that Standing Order in mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be easier for all concerned if ten questions were not grouped together, but I accept it is beyond the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s control.</P>
        <P>The very important point at the core of this issue is the complete failure of the Union to take a comprehensive approach to all countries.  It is actually fuelling the sense of crisis.  Incidentally, I would have no difficulty with the Taoiseach conducting a nationwide tour.  I am not into that type of politics, and never was.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must put questions, not make statements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a failure of collective action which is getting worse every day.  Will the Taoiseach agree to contact other leaders directly before next week&rsquo;s summit to press them on the need to stop the endless rounds of crisis meetings and to take comprehensive action?  I asked the Taoiseach if he made any attempt to put an item on the agenda but in the formal reply to the question he did not say what request he had made on behalf of the country to be included in the agenda for the next summit.  Perhaps he would also answer that question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will meet and speak with the person who determines the agenda, Mr. Van Rompuy, on Friday.  I will discuss a range of issues with him when he has clarified his proposals for the final agenda.  I am concerned about the matters we have discussed here previously, such as Europe&rsquo;s stance towards countries that face a challenge and how best to deal with that.  Obviously, I expect there will be serious discussion in respect of what is happening in a number of other countries.  It might well be the case that the discussions at ECOFIN on Sunday or Monday, although I cannot confirm this, might include further discussions about the interest rate principle.  In any event, I will report to the House before I go to Brussels on the outcome <Col N="225"/>of the discussions with Mr. Van Rompuy and regarding the general areas to be discussed at that Council meeting.  I undertook to do that and I will honour that undertaking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Boyd Barrett has three questions in this group.</P>
      </Speaker>
<TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The context for these questions is obvious.  It is, as we approach the end of the Government&rsquo;s first 100 days in office, the objectives and hopes the Government had to deal with the most important issue facing the country, the EU-IMF deal.  Is it not time to acknowledge that the strategy pursued by the Government in terms of seeking to ease the burden of this brutal deal has failed spectacularly?  The strategy of being the good boys and girls of Europe and of bowing subserviently to the EU and IMF in terms of imposing austerity and putting on the backs of Irish people the private gambling debts of speculators, developers and financiers has failed.  All my questions ask whether it is not time to abandon this failed strategy and consider another strategy by recognising the very stark contrast between our failure to achieve any relief from the EU and IMF and the success of ordinary Greek people taking to the streets, protesting and resisting the austerity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, that is not a supplementary question</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the question is about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Then ask it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Do we not need to learn from the Greeks in particular and from the other so-called PIGS countries that have taken a different approach?  We should be talking to them about how, as a result of their resistance to the EU-IMF deal and particularly the resistance of the people of those countries, the German Finance Minister is now talking openly, in the context of the Greek situation, about burning the bondholders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Question Time.  Will the Deputy put a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach recognise the effectiveness of the Greek resistance to this package and how it is forcing a debate among the EU authorities about burning the bondholders?  It is what we all know must be done to relieve the ordinary people of this country.  Should we not meet with the Greeks, the Portuguese and the Spanish to discuss that and recognise that we stand or fall together and we will only stand, rather than fall, if we resist this insane package, the austerity and the attempt to unload the speculators&rsquo; debts onto the backs of ordinary people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s entire career has been based on resistance.  His three questions ask whether I will consider conducting a fact-finding mission to Greece, if I will raise the agenda for the meeting with my European counterparts and if I will have a fringe meeting with the representatives of Portugal, Greece and Spain at the Council meeting.  I have enough to do in terms of getting in there and discussing the issues that affect the country where they should be discussed.</P>
        <P>It appears that the Deputy wishes to have the entire programme for Government implemented within the first 100 days.  The strategy has not failed.  We made it perfectly clear that elements of the bailout package should be changed.  Negotiation took place on that and agreement was reached on changes that are to the benefit of this economy and which will, hopefully, bring a stimulus to the indigenous economy through the creation of employment and job opportunities.  I also made it perfectly clear to the European Central Bank, and we <Col N="226"/>reached agreement on this arising from the publication of the stress tests on the banks, that because we intended to have two main pillar banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, there would not be a follow through in terms of burning senior bondholders in respect of those two banks.  That is not the case with the subordinated bondholders.  In return for that, the ECB guaranteed continued funding for Ireland irrespective of any downgrading by rating agencies.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Martin mentioned this morning, medium-term financing would be very beneficial for every country.  However, the Deputy is aware that in the European Central Bank decisions are made by the governors of the central banks in the eurozone countries.  Negotiations take place with them and they obviously have their own agenda and priorities.  I do not agree the strategy has failed.  We did not ask to be in this EU-IMF bailout deal and our economic independence is constrained until we get out of it.  That is where the Government is headed and the decisions being made by the Government will lead us to a point where we can retrieve and restore our economic independence, return to the bond markets, borrow at cheaper rates and be in charge of our economic destiny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There can be one further supplementary question in accordance with Standing Order 42.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking a question and the question is about appealing to the Taoiseach to consider changing strategy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not your question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>All of the questions request the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>To have fringe meetings.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Indeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for a particular purpose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Boyd Barrett should ask a different question the next time.  I cannot allow you to control Question Time, making statements.  There are other Deputies in the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not making a statement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please ask a short supplementary question or I will not call you again.  I am trying to be fair to everyone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a logical connection in the questions I am asking.  We should specifically meet other countries in the same plight as we are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="227"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a question.  You are making a statement.  Will you ask the Taoiseach a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Ask him the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to reconsider his decision not to do that and his strategy of appealing only to the EU authorities as a whole rather than specifically making common cause with the Greeks, the Portuguese and Spanish, who are in the same plight as us.  I am suggesting and asking the Taoiseach to do so on the basis that resistance by the Greek people to the EU-IMF austerity measures is proving more effective than the Taoiseach&rsquo;s strategy pursued to date&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because it is forcing the German authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you very much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;seriously to reconsider the rescheduling&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Taoiseach answer the supplementary question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of debt and the burning of bondholders.  Is that not proving more effective and do we not have something to learn from the Greeks in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Boyd Barrett is very wrong and is completely out of line if he considers this country is in the same boat as other challenged countries, notably Greece.  We are not in the same position, we are in a very different position.  The deputy head of the IMF said recently that Ireland is heading in the right direction, that it is meeting its commitments and is proceeding along a path to get out of the IMF-EU bailout deal so that we are once again in charge of our fortunes.  That has been endorsed by Commissioner Olli Rehn, by other countries, by Christine Lagarde and by a number of other people.  It is completely wrong for Deputy Boyd Barrett to equate Ireland&rsquo;s situation with the situation in Greece.  The Greek Government and the Greek people are challenged&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Are our people not challenged?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, they are but from a slightly different perspective.  I hope the Greek Government and people, with the support of all the countries of the EU, can deal with their problems.  We are in a bailout situation and severe conditions are attached to it.  It is causing difficulty for a number of our people but we are meeting the challenges and heading in the direction we must go to be in charge of our fortunes.</P>
        <P>It is wrong of Deputy Boyd Barrett to equate the circumstances of Ireland with those of Greece.  We have a very flexible and adaptable workforce, a strong trade surplus, strong indications of continued investment and high productivity.  Our challenge is economic, caused by greed within banks, reckless lending policies and promissory notes that created a huge charge on us.  As a consequence, we are in a bailout deal which we want to get out of to get back to the markets.  We are now headed in that direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>My question to the Taoiseach was to outline the issues he intends to prioritise for the EU summit.  Unfortunately, he did not answer that question so I must ask a <Col N="228"/>number of key supplementary questions.  It beggars belief that the Taoiseach did not come in here today and say that his priorities for the EU Heads of State meeting were the conditions laid down by the EU-IMF-ECB diktats, a demand for the interest rate to be cut and burning of the bondholders.  Should that not be the overriding issue for the meeting of the EU Heads of Government?  If not, why not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Having travelled before the election to meet his political big sister, Frau Merkel, to establish what we thought was a best friendship forever on the basis that she would insist on supporting a reduction in interest rates and burning bondholders, what has happened?  Has the Taoiseach abandoned completely the promises he made and his strong hint that his Government would demand the speculators take at least some of their losses?  They should take them all.</P>
        <P>I ask the Taoiseach to acknowledge that the crisis in Greece is not utterly different&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy Higgins is back into statements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that it is a crisis of the same diseased financial system in Europe and that the Greek working class are the victims of it, like Ireland, that they are on the verge of revolt and revolution and that we should support them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is different.  The situation of international banks in Greece is different to Ireland.  I have pointed out in my reply the main areas that will, more than likely, be discussed at the Heads of Government meeting.  I intend to meet with Mr. Van Rompuy on Friday.  Ireland&rsquo;s position is a priority for us.  Let us be very clear that the Heads of Government agreed there should be or could be a reduction in interest rates applied to countries in the EFSF bailout.  At that time, Ireland was not in that category.  Neither was Greece, although it was being bailed out under a slightly different scheme.  A reduction and an extension of the repayment period was applied in the case of Greece.  When Ireland became involved in a bailout deal, the question of the interest rate reduction was part of that.  Responsibility for that was given to the Minister for Finance because the banks&rsquo; stress tests had not been concluded.  That is one element of the conditions that apply here.</P>
        <P>We met the conditions laid out by the troika but, because of a particular demand placed in Ireland that we go beyond the conditions for the bailout deal by increasing our corporation tax rate, I was not prepared to concede.  Negotiations on that have been ongoing since and will continue.  Hopefully we can reach a conclusion in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe the Irish people should change anything at the diktat of President Sarkozy or anybody else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the point of Question Time.  Does Deputy Higgins have a supplementary question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the principle of unanimity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a question of opinions, this is Question Time.  We need to have supplementary questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach raised this matter.  Leaving aside the pressures of the European establishment, why is the Taoiseach prepared to die on the trenches to ensure big <Col N="229"/>business does not pay a cent more but he has no compunction in hitting the working class and the disabled?  When the Taoiseach meets President Van Rompuy, will he insist the issues of the bondholders and the interest rates to this State are key issues on the agenda of the EU Heads of Government?  Otherwise, will the Taoiseach admit he has abandoned any intention of pursuing this, as the Minister for Justice and Equality seems to have told us?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance is being represented in court in respect of the burning of subordinated bondholders.  I explained to Deputy Boyd Barrett our position in respect of dealing with the ECB and its responsibility.  The situation is being pursued by negotiation and we will continue along those lines.  I hope the principle accepted by everyone unanimously can be adopted.  The country has measured up in the first deep analysis by the troika &mdash; the outside partners &mdash; of the bailout deal.  We have work to do in order to keep measuring up&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Thanks to the previous Government&rsquo;s efforts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and get to a point where we are again in charge of our own affairs.  An element of that is an interest rate reduction, which is being pursued by the Minister for Finance.  When I meet Mr. Van Rompuy on Friday I will speak to him about our priorities and I want to assure him that I intend to participate fully in the debates taking place at the leaders&rsquo; meeting about issues concerning Europe in general, our own country and whatever appropriate issues arise.  I will involve myself fully on behalf of the country and the people in those debates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I am seeking some guidance and advice from the Ceann Comhairle and the Taoiseach.  Our attention was quite correctly drawn to Standing Order 42 and it was indicated that supplementary questions are allowed to elicit further information.  As part of the Opposition my job is try to hold the Government to account and inform citizens about issues of the day.  I put two clear short questions to the Taoiseach and did not make long statements but I have not received an answer.  I also put forward a critical issue concerning emergency health services this morning and the difficulties we will see within a month but I did not get an answer to that question either.  As a rookie I am seeking some guidance.</P>

	<P>As Standing Orders are at present, I do not have any control over what replies are given to parliamentary questions.  All I can do is work within existing rules.  If Deputies wish to change Standing Orders there is a place to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fair enough and I respect entirely your ruling.  You are a very fair Ceann Comhairle.  The Government has spoken about reform and how this place must be changed to benefit citizens.  As somebody who has just been elected to this House I can see everything that is wrong with the system.  It is very frustrating to ask simple and straightforward questions that do not get an answer.  The Taoiseach answered a question I did not even put and spoke on a subject I did not raise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy asks a supplementary question now based on his original question, I will ask the Taoiseach to answer.  The question concerned whether the Taoiseach spoke to the Greek and Portuguese Governments for the purpose of examining the way the three states&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a very simple question.  Has the Government decided, either through the good offices of the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste, to deal with these other governments?  They may not have exactly the same difficulty as us but they are being asked to pay a <Col N="230"/>significant burden of debt.  Has the Taoiseach opened up any negotiations or discussions with them to the benefit of the people of this State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question is clear.  We can have all the discussions we like on the margins of Council meetings and there can be discussions between the leaders of any countries about issues that might affect them and relations between countries.  These are European decisions which require unanimity from the Council.  The Deputy is aware of the process of enhanced co-operation in some areas; for example, it occurs with regard to the common consolidated corporate tax base, which was raised here, and that is part of the Euro-Plus pact.</P>
        <P>With regard to the problem facing Europe and the challenged countries, Europe decided to provide mechanisms for dealing with the issue.  There is clearly a serious challenge ahead but the solution will not be decided in bilaterals between any two countries or a small group.  There must be an EU decision.  In that sense and with the point I make about the interest rate reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s case, most countries accept that we have measured up to very severe conditions and passed the first analysis of where we are headed.  There is a demand, or a request, that there be an increase in Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax rate.  Tax is a national competence, and I feel very strongly about that issue, as does the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I will meet the new Portuguese Prime Minister at the meeting and have discussions with him about the new position of his country.  These are decisions taken by the 27 leaders and they are the only people in the room.  From that perspective I intend to participate fully in the discussions affecting the Union and the countries therein, specifically those which are challenged.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked if I had spoken to the Greek and Portuguese Governments with the purpose of examining the way the three states affected by bailouts may be able to help each other.  I have not.  I spoke to the Greek Prime Minister before the last meeting, when he asked for support in respect of an interest rate reduction and an extension of the repayment period; I supported him on those issues.  I spoke to the former Portuguese Prime Minister when his country was not in receipt of a bailout and he resigned afterwards while continuing in a caretaker capacity.  Elections have taken place and I hope to meet the new prime minister at the Council meeting.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I find that answer incredible.  The Taoiseach will meet Mr. Van Rompuy and I remember when he was appointed Belgian Prime Minister he did an immediate tour of capitals.  He visited Dublin.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="231"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter has been delegated to the Ministers responsible for finance.  The Minister for Finance has had several meetings with the French Minister, Ms Christine Lagarde, about the matter.  He has had extensive negotiations with other Ministers responsible for finance, and that is the duty and responsibility assigned to them.  I expect and have every faith in the Minister being able to conclude that.  If an opportunity arises, I will of course accept President Sarkozy&rsquo;s invitation to me that we should meet.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 13, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government was adopted by the Government at its first meeting as the framework for its work over the coming years.  It sets out the policies and initiatives to be progressed over the term of the Government to tackle the many challenges facing the country.  My Department will be supporting the implementation of the programme as a whole and it will do this with a more explicit focus on its role as a Cabinet office.  Whereas my Department  co-ordinates policy in a number of ways, responsibility for implementing specific aspects of the programme rests with the relevant Department.  The priority for implementation rests in the first instance with each Minister having regard to the programme and to the matrix of priorities and responsibilities that exist within and across each portfolio.</P>
        <P>It is my intention, once the first 100 days has been completed, to give a detailed report of the progress made to date under the programme for Government.  It should be noted that the Government has already made substantial progress across a number of Departments in meeting its commitments under the programme.</P>
        <P>For example, the quarterly review mission under the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland has been successfully concluded.  The mission assessed the programme to be on track and that the targets in the programme have been met, and there was agreement to changes to reflect provisions in the programme for Government.  Following completion of the solvency stress tests, decisions on the recapitalisation of financial institutions have been made and a comprehensive strategy to reorganise and reform the domestic Irish banks has been adopted.  An integrated decision-making structure for dealing with the financial crisis in the shape of the Government economic management committee has been established.</P>
        <P>The Nyberg report has been published and the Government has committed to holding a referendum before the end of the year to strengthen the powers of committees to inquire into <Col N="232"/>crucial issues of public concern, such as the banking crisis.  Ministerial salaries have been reduced, as has the cost of ministerial transport.  Legislation is being prepared on political donations and to enable the number of Deputies to be reduced.  The number of D&aacute;il sitting days has been increased through sitting during St. Patrick&rsquo;s week and on Tuesdays following public holidays, and shortening the Easter and summer breaks.  A comprehensive spending review has been initiated, the jobs initiative has been announced and the top level appointments committee is being revised so that its chairperson and the majority of its members are drawn from outside the public sector.  There will be a more comprehensive report once we reach 100 days in office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am conscious of the limited time available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Adams has a question in this group, I want to give him a chance to contribute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that one of the defining features of this Government is its commitment to over spin even the smallest of moves and to brush aside solemn commitments, no matter how recently made?  The list which the Taoiseach outlined represents a triumph of optics over substance.  The decision of the IMF and the troika reflects the tough budgetary decisions taken in advance of the election.  That is the essential reason we are on track from a fiscal and monetary point of view and in the first three months of the year nothing substantive was done in that regard.  I look forward to receiving a full report rather than an over spun and selective list.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, after 100 days, he has not fully established his Government?  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, who is in charge of a Department, has gone longer without answering questions than any other Minister in the history of the State.  He published 29 pages of amendments to the 23 page Bill which provides for the establishment of his Department.  The Government is not properly established in terms of portfolios and accountability.</P>
        <P>I ask the Taoiseach about the commitment he made to direct all Ministers to focus entirely on their new portfolios and avoid constituency work in their first 100 days.  Every Minister is doing constituency work and as many as 100 people are employed on the public payroll to help them.  The Taoiseach needs to explain why he broke that commitment.  Whenever he is caught breaking a promise, he blames everyone but himself.  His decision to break his promise on constituency work has nothing to do with the last Government.</P>
        <P>Where are the lists and scorecards he compiled on Ministers and when will they be published?  He may recall that when he appeared on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; he told the nation that he is keeping a scorecard for every Minister and he informed the D&aacute;il that he has agreed a specific list of issues which Ministers were required to deliver within 100 days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Martin had kept scorecards in his time, the scores would not be great.  It is important that we get things right.  The Government created entirely new Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Children and Youth Affairs.  That was done deliberately so there would be a real change from the carry on of the past.  The Deputy indicated he is not interested in Punch and Judy.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will require clarity from Ministers regarding expenditure in their Departments, their value and effectiveness and whether programmes should be continued, abandoned or expanded.  They have to get the true scale of this matter before they can plot their way ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>An bord snip already published a comprehensive spending review.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="233"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>One could have added a further 20 pages to the bord snip report and say &ldquo;of course, away you go&rdquo; but Governments have to make decisions about people and their lives.  We are trying to achieve the right balance.  In respect of the establishment of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, we have to be thorough and comprehensive about the issues that may arise in regard to children, youth affairs or whatever.  We can draw from every Department to ensure clarity in regard to the powers and authority the Minister can possess.  The Ministers, Deputy Howlin and Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, want to answer parliamentary questions as much as anybody else but it is important we ensure an adequate transfer of power to their offices so they are constitutionally and legally entitled to do so.</P>
        <P>This is not a case of spin over substance.  Important issues must be addressed and one of the iconic failures of Deputy Martin&rsquo;s Government was to drive 13 or 14 State cars to Farmleigh House in the middle of black Friday while saying it would do the best it could.  We have changed that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge it is only perception but it is important that people understand this.  We have addressed the issue of ministerial pay and we will do the same again if the people decide to pass the referendum in respect of judicial pay.  The Minister for public expenditure will make proposals on ceilings for higher paid public servants and at the highest level in semi-State bodies.  Everybody is going to understand there is not a focus on any one sector.  If we have to sort out this problem, let it be from the top down and let that be seen to be so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Tomorrow marks the Government&rsquo;s 100th day and I wish it well because I believe in constructive opposition.  Part of the role Sinn F&eacute;in is trying to play relates to the notion that good Government needs good Opposition.</P>
        <P>The fatal flaw in the Government&rsquo;s position is that, while it made a considerable number of commitments, the past 100 days have seen U-turns, reversals and the breaking of gealltanas i ndiaidh gealltanais.  The core of the problem is that the Government&rsquo;s acquiescence to the EU-IMF deal is Fianna F&aacute;il-lite in many ways.  As we face into the next 100 days, the Government&rsquo;s decisions on issues such as the universal social charge, the EU-IMF burden, the crisis in the health service which my colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, warned about or the increase in the pensionable age to 68, are in breach of what it promised in the course of the election.  Is it not time that we took a transparent and joined up approach so we can deal with issues on which all of us agree as opposed to the Government dodging these questions?</P>

	<P>I asked for a statement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health will deal with that matter on Friday morning.  In order to deal with those structural defects, we have to determine the scale and nature of the problem and make decisions as to how we are going to rectify and pay for it.  That means every cent of public money has to be assessed in terms of its effectiveness for the people it is supposed to serve.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="234"/>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Stop putting it in the banks in that case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy appears to assume that a five year programme is being implemented in 100 days.  He is aware that I support transparency and accountability, and that is why he will be asked, whenever the date of the presidential election is fixed, to vote on giving Oireachtas committees greater powers of compellability of attendance so answers can be given to the public.  I share his concerns but we cannot bring change at the click of our fingers.  We might be able to do so in a dictatorial setting but we cannot in a democracy.  We have to set out the legislation and the question that will give Oireachtas committees additional powers to provide the accountability and transparency he and everyone else wants to see.  We have to give effect to that through decisions and in this case a constitutional referendum is required.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, as the Ceann Comhairle is aware, we will also seek support from the people on a referendum to give full protection to those who are deemed to be whistleblowers in the sense of making confidential information of relevance available to Deputies or citizens, as the case might be.  That is part of the next 100 days and it will be essential that the committees on which Deputies serve have powers of compellability of attendance and, as a consequence, accountability and transparency.  That is the way it should be.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, line 29, after &ldquo;Part&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;&ldquo;Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Social Protection and&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment was linked to a number of other amendments which I tabled, some of which have subsequently been ruled out of order for the usual, bizarre reason that they are a charge on the Exchequer.  It is very difficult for Opposition Members to be positive and constructive on any Bill dealing with social welfare or finance only to be ruled out of order when our suggestions are likely to incur a charge on the State.  The benefit of Committee Stage is that we can still raise various issues.  In the normal course of events there would be a Report Stage in which those issues raised on Committee Stage could be reconsidered but to my knowledge no Report Stage has been signalled for tomorrow.  The intention is to continue with Committee Stage and to take Report Stage without further debate.  I will return to the subject of Report Stage later.</P>
        <P>Given that the Bill has only recently been published it is difficult to deal with it.  I thank the departmental officials for the informative briefing we received which helped clarify one or two issues.  Many aspects of social welfare are difficult to understand.  There is much legislation relating to the area and it is not in an easy, readable format.  I suggest that in the context of D&aacute;il reform we devise a mechanism to provide continuous consolidated Bills so that when we propose changes what is being deleted or inserted is evident on the same page with an explanation.  Such a system would be more easy to follow than is the case at present.  The first time I saw such an approach to legislative change was in the Nice treaty.  Someone published the entire Treaty of Rome with the proposed insertions and exactly what they meant.  I found such an approach much easier than skipping back and forth through various pieces of legislation just to find out what was intended.</P><Col N="235"/>
        <P>The amendment in question relates to the Minister&rsquo;s new title.  It ensures that she or he is the person responsible rather than any other Minister.  My intention is that the amendment would give effect to the other amendments ensuring that she or he would produce the various reports to which I referred in amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6.  Two of those amendments have been ruled out of order so I will not deal with them in detail now.  My intention is to ensure that the onus would be on the Minister for Social Protection rather than the Department or a committee to produce reports and that she or he would then be answerable to the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The amendments involve certain responsibilities.  Even though we accepted section 1, which explains the various Acts &mdash; we will come to the Title at the end &mdash; the Bill does much more than just amend social welfare legislation and pensions.  For that reason we will return to the Title.  The Minister is selling herself short in the Title and explanatory memorandum.</P>
        <P>As there is not an opportunity later I wish to refer to citizens information legislation and citizens information centres which are mentioned in section 1.  There should be an increase in funding for such centres.  One mechanism for doing that is by allocating the fines to which we will refer later to that purpose.  I will return to the point when we discuss fines.  It is almost a moot point if we do not have a Report Stage debate on the Bill.  I will leave it at that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for the amendment.  However, for reasons I will explain, the definition being proposed is not required in the Bill and, therefore, I do not propose to accept it.</P>
        <P>While previous Social Welfare Acts have contained a definition of &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; for the purposes of those Acts, it has not been considered necessary by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to include such a definition in this Bill, as the term &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; is used only once in the text of the Bill.  That reference is contained in section 1(3), which enables particular provisions of the Bill to come into operation by way of commencement order, and the Minister for Social Protection is referred to in full in that subsection.</P>
        <P>The other references to the term &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; in the Bill all relate to provisions that are being directly inserted into various enactments, all of which already contain definitions of &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; for the purposes of these Acts.  For example, the term is used in a number of places in Part 2 of this Bill; however, all these references are contained in provisions that are being inserted into the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  As this Act already contains a definition of &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; for the purposes of that Act, there is no need to define this term again in this Bill for the purpose of any provision that is being inserted into that Act.  Similarly, Part 4 of this Bill also contains the term &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; in a number of places.  All of these references are being inserted into the Pensions Act 1990, which already contains a definition of &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; for the purposes of that Act.  As a result, there is no need to define the term again in this Bill.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for his courteous remarks about the officials of my Department.  The period in which we can work on this Bill is short because it arises from the jobs initiative and other financial measures which were brought before the D&aacute;il by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  As the Deputy said with regard to the explanatory memorandum, the Bill has a number of quite important provisions which are not purely related to social welfare.  I and the Government were particularly anxious that the restoration of the national minimum wage would come into effect on 1 July.  It is important for low-paid people that the national minimum wage is restored.  It was a mistake by the previous Government to cut &euro;1 off the minimum wage, as acknowledged by a number of Deputies from Fianna F&aacute;il in their contributions on Second Stage.  I was anxious to see this change introduced as early as possible.</P><Col N="236"/>
        <P>The Bill also provides that the changes to the social welfare code with regard to reductions in employers&rsquo; PRSI will commence at the same time.  There are other changes, some of which arise as a result of commitments entered into by the previous Government in the IMF-EU troika programme.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, there are changes with regard to appointments to the board of the Citizens&rsquo; Information Board.  The later part of the Bill also contains provisions implementing European Directive 2003/41/EC on the Activities and Supervision of Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision, the IORPS directive.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh that it is quite a wide-ranging social welfare Bill, and the officials have worked hard to get this broad and complex Bill ready to meet the 1 July date for the restoration of the national minimum wage.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, line 36, to delete &ldquo;1 July 2011&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;2 July 2011&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These are minor amendments to sections 3 and 23 of the Bill to align the commencement dates applying to the overall provisions of each of these sections with the date given in the table accompanying each section.  The main provisions contained in section 3 provide for a halving of the lower rate of employers&rsquo; social insurance contributions from 7.8% to 3.9% with effect from 2 July 2011.  Section 23 provides for a similar halving of the national training fund levy from 0.7% to 0.35% in cases in which the lower rate of employers&rsquo; social insurance contributions applies.  The provisions of sections 2 and 23, when combined, provide for an overall halving of the lower 8.5% rate of employers&rsquo; PRSI to 4.25% where a worker&rsquo;s earnings do not exceed &euro;356 in any week.</P>
        <P>The date of 2 July 2011 has been chosen as the commencement date for the halving of the lower rate of employers&rsquo; PRSI in order to align the start date with the start of a tax week.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I must ask about a technical point even though I have been here a while.  If we accept this amendment at this Stage, does it require the Bill to be published again before Report Stage, which is tomorrow afternoon?  I asked the people in the Bills Office if they would consider amendments from me for Report Stage, and they said there was no Report Stage scheduled and that it would require the Whips to alter the timetable for tomorrow.  In some ways they were discouraging, without being interfering.  I was asking with the intention of tabling an amendment on Report Stage with regard to the Citizens&rsquo; Information Board because I missed the deadline for Committee Stage amendments due to the timeframe involved.  It is only a technical point.</P>
        <P>Section 3 provides for a reduction in employers&rsquo; PRSI.  This is the bargain that was made with employers in exchange for the increase in the national minimum wage.  It was mentioned that the provision in the Bill is a temporary one.  There is no guarantee that this will be stuck to, because we could come here in two years&rsquo; time with another social welfare Bill which provides that the reduction for employers will be extended.</P><Col N="237"/>
        <P>The effect of section 3 will be to reduce substantially the amount of money paid by employers in PRSI for low-paid workers and therefore substantially reduce the money received by the Exchequer.  This is happening at a time of increasing costs to the Exchequer due to unemployment.  There is no benefit that I can see in giving this concession to employers rather than employees. I can see no advantage for employers rather than employees getting the benefit.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Until recently, the difference between the two employer PRSI rates have been quite close and, subsequently, there was no major move by employers to reduce wages.  This new measure might end up being an incentive for employers to reduce wages just to gain a saving on their PRSI contributions.  For example, an employer paying &euro;390 a week to an employee could reduce it by &euro;34 to comply with the &euro;356 threshold.  The employer could save &euro;27 on PRSI contributions, on top of saving &euro;34 gained through the wage reduction, a total of &euro;61 a week.  Over a year, this saving on one employee would amount to &euro;3,172.  There is, accordingly, an incentive for employers of the low paid to drop wages by hook or by crook.</P>
        <P>My amendment No. 3 proposes that the provisions of section 3 would only apply to new jobs.  A new job would be defined by the employer applying to a panel comprising officials from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and representatives from trade unions and employer organisations.</P>
        <P>A person who earns more than &euro;356 a week but comes under pressure to take a pay cut to come below this threshold or loses their job to be replaced by someone on the lower wage rate should be allowed to take their case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  We need to have mechanisms in place to protect the low paid.  Given that the Government is reviewing joint labour committee wage agreements and employment regulations orders, a substantial number of workers will be affected by the pressures for a reduction in their wages.</P>

	<P>These measures will come in shortly.  The Oireachtas has been put under pressure to satisfy the diktats of the International Monetary Fund.  It says very little for Irish sovereignty if our legislative process is dictated by a deal entered into by the former Government and re-endorsed by this Government.  The D&aacute;il is sitting until 21 July.  The introduction date for these measures is 2 July, a time which I accept may suit employers and payroll organisation.  However, it could easily be introduced at a later date such as 2 September.  We cannot allow our social welfare policy to be decided on by some arbitrary figure picked out by the troika or this or the former Government to satisfy a crisis in the euro.  This Parliament should be sovereign enough to decide when it will apply such measures in its time.  It is madness that when this legislation is passed by the Seanad, it will be enacted three days later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The reduction of employer&rsquo;s PRSI on those earning &euro;356 or less a week was a commitment in the programme for Government.  While it is important to create new jobs, it is also important to maintain existing jobs.  This reduction in employer&rsquo;s PRSI, which will last until the end of 2013, applies to existing and new jobs.  Everyone knows from the economic collapse the difficulties in getting new jobs and maintaining long-standing jobs and businesses.  This measure will help achieve both.</P>
        <P>The underperformance in the tourism sector over the past several years highlights the need to improve the sector&rsquo;s cost competitiveness.  One set of costs important to this sector and other employment-rich sectors are labour costs.  This measure will give an incentive to employers to <Col N="238"/>take on new workers and maintain existing jobs.  The halving of the lower rate of PRSI until the end of 2013 will improve labour and competitiveness, assist job creation and maintain existing employment in labour-intensive industries.  The measure is in line with the commitment given in the programme for Government which was to halve the lower rate of PRSI.</P>
        <P>Given the current unemployment situation, I am satisfied the lower rate should apply until the end of 2013.  A lower rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI for workers earning below &euro;356 per week has been in operation for several years.  There is no evidence to suggest the existence of this rate encouraged employers to reduce wages to come within the qualifying criteria to attract the lower rate.  I understand and respect the Deputy&rsquo;s concern about this matter.  He should, however, bear in mind that the Bill also provides for the restoration of the minimum wage to &euro;8.65 per hour.  This will be extremely important for employees who are on the minimum wage and who work a 40-hour week.  The change will be worth &euro;40 per week to these individuals.  It is, therefore, quite an important measure.</P>
        <P>This is one of the issues which the Government has sought to address in a way that differs from that pursued by the previous Administration in the context of the agreements into which it entered with the IMF, the EU and the ECB.  I hope the Deputy will accept that the Bill is balanced, that it restores the minimum wage and that it provides an important incentive to employers in respect of not just taking on new staff, but also with regard to retaining existing employees.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is clear that most Deputies in the Chamber support the reversal of the cut in the minimum wage.  However, in section 3 the State is assuming responsibility for the burden of the associated cost by letting employers off the hook by means of tying into the reversal the idea that employer PRSI will be halved.  The State will, therefore, forfeit revenues which could be accrued.</P>
        <P>Section 3 is extremely flawed in that it contributes to the myth that wages and the cost of employment act as a deterrent and have given rise to unemployment and that if we reduce the level of employer PRSI, this will give rise to an increase in the number of jobs being created.  That simply does not add up.  Wages in Ireland are below the EU average.  Those who work in the areas targeted by this provision, namely, the lower paid sectors of the economy, including catering, cleaning and other types of minimum wage employments, have already endured reductions in their wage rates.  As a result, wage rates have fallen further behind the EU average.  I do not believe there is any evidence to support the idea that what is proposed would give rise to job creation.</P>
        <P>There is, however, evidence which shows that this country already has one of the lowest levels of employer PRSI in the world.  This has been a contributory factor with regard to the poor state of social services in this country.  We are already well under the average.  Even employers in the United States pay more social insurance on behalf of their employees than do their Irish counterparts.  Reducing the level of employer PRSI further does not make any sense.  I am of the view that what is proposed represents a hugely retrograde step which will further skew the wealth imbalance that exists in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Another problem with the section is that it targets the lowest paid by making provision to halve employer PRSI in respect of wages under &euro;365 per week.  The Minister is de facto creating <Col N="239"/>a disincentive for employers to pay people wages above this rate because there will be a marginal benefit to them if they keep wages below that level in order to avail of the 50% cut in PRSI.  That is the real purpose of the section, which essentially legitimises the driving down of wages and taking income away from social services in order to benefit employers.  We can demonstrate that the manner in which this is being done will ensure that there will be no impact whatsoever on employment.  As already stated, this is a massively retrograde step.  We were opposed to it before and we will continue to be opposed to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred earlier to the maintenance of jobs and she obviously believes that this section is vitally important in that context.  She is correct in one sense.  If one walks down the high street in any town throughout the country, one will see that a significant number of long-standing businesses are either reducing their operations or are closing down.</P>
        <P>The difficulty of matter does not relate to either the amount of PRSI or the wage rates which employers are obliged to pay.  The real problem, which the section does not address, is the fact that this Government is continuing the process of job destruction begun by the previous Administration.  This is being done by way of the removal of huge amounts of money from the economy.  If someone walking down the high street in Clonmel or any other town does not have money in his or her pocket, then he or she cannot go into nearby shops to make purchases.  That is the real reason long-standing businesses are closing down.</P>
        <P>Approximately &euro;14 billion has been removed from the economy in recent years.  The policy in this regard is directly responsible for the destruction of jobs, the massive increase in the number of people who are unemployed and the high level of business closures.  As long as the Government continues to remove money from the economy, to cut social welfare and reduce people&rsquo;s take home pay, what I have outlined will continue.</P>
        <P>We all welcome the reversal in the cut to the minimum wage.  However, the other side of the coin in this regard is the fact that there are proposals for huge cuts in respect of the 250,000 people who are employed in the sectors covered by joint labour committees, JLCs, and employment regulation orders, EROs.  Again, what is proposed in this regard will remove further significant amounts of money from the economy and out of the pockets of individuals.  As a result, there will be further job losses.  Neither section 3 nor the programme for Government addresses that problem.  Effectively, the current Administration is continuing with the policies pursued by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Clare Daly made the point that there is no evidence that what is proposed in this section will lead to the creation of jobs.  That is what the section is supposed to be about in the first instance.  I would like to address this issue and also that which relates to pay.  Earlier, the Minister referred to the fact that the section reverses the cut to the minimum wage.  That is a welcome and important development, particularly in the context of the fact that some people might have &euro;40 extra in their pockets each week.  If, however, a person is paid &euro;390 per week and if his or her employer wants to benefit from the 50% reduction in PRSI proposed in the section, then the latter will be obliged to reduce his or her wages by &euro;34 per week in order to bring them down to the &euro;356 threshold.  I am of the view that the section leaves it open to employers to do this and does not provide any protection toworkers.</P>
        <P>The Davenport Hotel made the first move in respect of the minimum wage.  When the reduction in the latter was introduced, it was only supposed to apply to new rather than to existing contracts.  However, the company which runs the Davenport Hotel insisted that all of the employees should sign new contracts under which they would be paid the new rate of &euro;7.65 <Col N="240"/>per hour.  This section leaves it open to other employers to do the same in respect of their employees.  All they need do is gather their workers together and inform them that their weekly wages are going to be reduced to &euro;356 per week.  It is for this reason in particular that I am opposed to the section.  However, I also oppose it on the basis that there is no evidence that it will give rise to job creation and in the context of certain people&rsquo;s general acceptance of the EU-IMF deal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important section and I wish to refer to it in the context of a number of the points the Minister made in respect of amendment No. 2.  There is major concern with regard to the number of jobs being lost throughout the country.  The authorities in other jurisdictions have used different mechanisms to ensure the retention of existing jobs.  I do not think anyone would say we should not put such mechanisms into place.  Germany is a case in point, where employers were grant-aided to retain existing workers.  Sinn F&eacute;in has argued for a jobs stimulus package.</P>
        <P>My concern is that if someone is working a 40 hour week on the minimum wage his or her employer will be liable for the lower rate of PRSI.  Any employer worth their salt, from the employers&rsquo; point of view, will aim at creating all new jobs at the minimum wage level because they can then benefit, for two and a half years, from the Government bonus of the lowered employer&rsquo;s PRSI rate.  When we debate section 23 we will deal with the reduced training levy.  There is no logic behind this measure.  Because of the changes there is now an additional incentive to employers to lower wages because they could benefit, in the example I cited, to the tune of more than &euro;3,000 per employee per year.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the State will lose substantial income because of the reduction in employers&rsquo; PRSI, which goes into the social welfare pot to pay unemployment benefit and allowance.  The State will also have to pay out more in family income supplement to the people who will be on a lower wage, given the incentives to employers.  The Minister has said there is no particular evidence to suggest that a lower rate of PRSI encourages employers to reduce wages in order to come within the qualifying criteria.  That might have been true when the higher and lower rates were close together.  However, there is now a substantial difference between the higher rate and the proposed reduced rate.  There is a greater incentive, if that is the proper term, for employers to reduce wages.  The financial incentive is substantial.  In the example I cited of a wage reduction from &euro;390 to &euro;356, an employer would save a substantial amount, given the stricken times some of them are experiencing.  Other employers are not in stricken times but will jump on the bandwagon, as they have done repeatedly in the past, to try to drive down wages.  This is particularly true in many of the sectors where joint labour committee agreements and employment regulation orders are in place.  Is this part of a twin-track approach?</P>
        <P>The Minister said parts of our economy are under-performing and she mentioned tourism.  Tourism might be under-performing but there is a variety of reasons for that.  One is that we are in a global recession.  People are not travelling as much.  We need to do as much as possible to capture those who are travelling but this should not be done at the expense of workers in the tourism industry.  Surveys of the tourism industry did not identify labour costs as a key problem.  Most of the factors that needed to be prioritised related to fuel, electricity and similar costs.  Labour costs did not feature as prominently among the costs of running a business as has been claimed in recent days.</P>
        <P>I have major concerns with this element of the Bill, especially as it is being tied with the minimum wage.  Someone working a 40 hour week on the minimum wage will come within this measure.  Workers&rsquo; wages will be reduced to the minimum or their hours will be reduced so that their weekly wage is below the figure required for the benefit.  Workers and the public <Col N="241"/>purse will be the hardest hit by this.  If the public purse is reduced, the numbers unemployed increase and the Government honours its commitment to the IMF and the ECB to reduce social spending, how can we square that circle?  This problem will certainly exist for the near future, whatever about the long-term future when we hope there will be a reduction in unemployment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 3 and the Bill in general deals, in part, with the implementation of the jobs initiative announced a few weeks ago by the Government.  The initiative is pathetically inadequate against almost half a million people unemployed.  This was recognised by the Government itself in the way it dampened down expectations leading up to the announcement of the initiative.  It was downscaled from a major jobs budget.</P>
        <P>The changes in PRSI made by the Ministers for Finance and Social Protection and proposed in the Bill would mean a reduced income for the Exchequer of the order of &euro;190 million in 2012 and &euro;183 million in 2013.  The Minister averred that this will create jobs.  She said there was evidence.  Where is the evidence and what is it?  Deputy Seamus Healy put his finger on the problem when he said that everything being attempted here is countermanded by the general policy of the Government continuing the disastrous policies of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party at the diktat of the EU, ECB and IMF.  Slashing the ability of working and poor people to purchase goods and services slashes jobs.  What evidence does the Minister have that employers, who would be relevant to this section, will not simply increase their profits rather than increase the number of people at work?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, when pressed on a number of occasions by me, resolutely refused to give us any targets for job creation, or even jobs maintenance, in respect of his jobs initiative.  Can the Minister for Social Protection give us such figures today?  What studies have been done to back up what she says, that this significant reduction in income to the State will result in jobs created?  At least part of the raid on the pension funds is to pay for this reduction in PRSI.  We have no problem with raiding the pension pots of millionaires and billionaires but we do have a problem with attacking the pension funds of ordinary working people and being a disincentive.  We need to see the evidence and any projections the Minister may have.</P>

	<P>The need for reform of the joint labour committee system was clearly signalled in the programme for Government.  A very detailed report, the independent review of employment regulation orders and registered employment agreement wage-setting mechanisms, setting out a reform mechanism was finalised in April of this year and circulated to members of the Government in the usual way.</P><Col N="242"/>
        <P>The relevant stakeholders will now participate in a consultation process on the report and the Government does not have a predetermined outcome to this process.  The outcome of the consultation process will be brought to Government and any proposals in this area will be decided collectively by the Government.  In that context, the Government will consider the impact of the reform proposals on workers with a view to achieving balanced reform which produces good outcomes for employment and social protection.</P>
        <P>Poverty impact assessment is the process by which Departments, local authorities and State agencies assess policies and programmes at design, implementation and review stages for the likely impact they will have or have had on poverty and on inequalities which are likely to lead to poverty, with a view to poverty reduction.</P>
        <P>I have asked my officials to examine the broader impact of the report on low-paid workers and the social protection system generally and how reduced pay levels could possibly lead to an increased reliance on the social welfare system.  This assessment will assist the Government&rsquo;s deliberations on the proposed reforms with a view to achieving balanced reform for all those affected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said that when the assessment is carried out there will be a decision made by the Government as a whole.  Based on what some of her party colleagues say about these proposals, it is evident there is divergence between them and the proposals that have come from the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  As I said last week I take at face value the assessment to be carried out by her officials.  When is that expected to be complete?  Will it be made public and will this House have the opportunity to respond to that exercise in its own right?  When is the Government to set about making a decision on the matter when all members of Cabinet have carried out their own research?  In that regard the Minister for Social Protection is no different from any other Minister.  When will the assessment be complete?  Will it be made public and available to us?  When does the Government expect to make a &ldquo;whole of Government&rdquo; decision as it has been described?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The need for reform of the joint labour committee system was clearly signalled in the programme for Government.  Mr. Kevin Duffy of the Labour Court and Mr. Walsh have produced a very detailed report setting out a reform mechanism.  The relevant stakeholders, the employers and trade unions, are now participating in a consultation process on the report initiated by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The outcome of the consultation process will be brought to Government and any changes in this area will be decided collectively by the Government.  In that context, the Government will consider the impact of the reform proposals on workers with a view to achieving balanced reform which produces good outcomes for employment and social protection.</P>
        <P>In the meantime I have asked my officials to examine the broader impact of the report on low-paid workers and the social protection system generally and how reduced pay levels could possibly lead to an increased reliance on the social welfare system.  This assessment will assist the Government&rsquo;s deliberations on the proposed reforms with a view to achieving balanced reform for everyone concerned.</P>
        <P>The social inclusion division which was in the Ministry formerly known as &ldquo;Craggy&rdquo; has returned to my Department since 1 May.  That division has an important Government role in promoting the implementation of poverty impact assessment as a key tool in promoting good practice and innovation in policy implementation.</P>

	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s answer does not answer the specific question I asked.  I accept the Minister is entitled to investigate any effect such measures would have on those receiving entitlements.  Once what the Minister has requested is complete, will she make it public before the Government makes the decision?  It is appropriate that those of us on this side of the House who have a duty in this area are aware of any such impact especially if that has been adjudicated on by her officials.  If that is substantial we need to know it before a decision is taken.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The consultation process has not been completed yet.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to complete a poverty impact assessment on the proposals because we do not yet have those proposals.  When we get those proposals the social inclusion division of my Department will carry out such an assessment.  I do not have a date for the Deputy and I must wait and see what proposals are forthcoming.  I believe the Duffy Walsh report contains a number of extremely sensible proposals, many of which are in the course of implementation in different employments because there has been considerable employer-union interaction in certain key areas in recent time.  I want to wait until I get the proposals before giving a time-based answer as the Deputy has requested.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  The population share of those aged 65 and over is expected to more than double between now and 2050, from 11% to 26%.  People are living longer and healthier lives with average life expectancy set to rise even further in the future, up to 88 years for women and 83.9 for men.  In contrast, the share of the working age population is projected to decline gradually from 68% to 58%.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population who are at work.  Spending on public pensions, that is social welfare pensions and public service occupational pensions, is projected to increase from approximately 5.5% of GDP in 2008, to almost 15% by 2050.  For these reasons, State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of State pension age at 66.  The State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  It is worth noting that until the early 1970s, the qualifying age for the State pension was 70 years.  The legislative changes being included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011 also fulfil one of the commitments in the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>The risk of fuel poverty is based on a combination of fuel price, income and efficiency of housing.  My Department assists low-income households with heating costs through their basic payments and through the means-tested fuel allowance scheme.  This scheme has been improved significantly in recent years, including through an extension in the number of weeks paid and increases in the rate.  Fuel allowance is paid to people who are dependent on long-term social welfare and unable to provide for their own heating needs.</P><Col N="244"/>
        <P>People affected by the increase in pension age who are not in employment may still qualify for the fuel allowance if they are in receipt of another qualifying social welfare payment, such as disability allowance.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs because of ill health or infirmity.  In addition, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost that an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>The Government is also committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of fuel poverty through investment in programmes to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock and energy efficiency awareness initiatives such as the Keep Well and Warm booklet and accompanying associated website.  Some 150,000 copies of the booklet have been distributed in recent years.  The warmer homes scheme administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is the primary mechanism for alleviating the key underlying cause of energy poverty, namely, the thermal inefficiency of houses.  Over 19,000 low-income houses were retrofitted in 2009 and a further 24,291 in 2010.</P>
        <P>The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio and it convened an inter-departmental-agency group on affordable energy to co-ordinate and drive Government policy in this area.  My Department is represented on this group which was tasked with devising an energy-affordability strategy.  I understand this is to be published shortly and it will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability.</P>
        <P>Growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State pension age.  Increasing the State pension age is one of the ways in which we can sustain the pensions system, maintain the value of the State pension and support people to remain in the workforce.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>My question concerns the fuel allowance and the consequences of the change.  Given the changes signalled in the social welfare legislation before the House, a certain category of individuals will be affected from 2014 onwards.  I am concerned that people whose contracts will finish when they are 65 will not be entitled to a fuel allowance.  Is there any intention to ensure that those who finish at the age of 65 will be able to qualify for the fuel allowance as it currently exists?  If their contracts finish when they are 65, they might be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance but not to the fuel allowance because they will not have been on a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for a long-term basis at that stage, especially bearing in mind that the State pension age will be increased from 67 to 68 in 2028.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The most important objective pertaining to older people and fuel property is to provide a much better standard of insulation for homes, both to reduce and prevent heat loss and to improve the comfort and standard of housing.  As we know, many older people live in older properties.  The inter-departmental-agency group has been asked to draw up an energy-affordability strategy.  This strategy will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability and will have regard to both the impact of the carbon tax on low-income households and a range of supports in making its recommendations.</P>
        <P>The group has been asked to make recommendations as to the precise package of measures, including the area of income support, that should be put in place to assist those at risk of fuel poverty.  These recommendations will be considered as part of the overall strategy to deal with energy affordability, which will include supports for low-income households.  As the Deputy <Col N="245"/>knows, the fuel allowance is not the sole income support mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with special heating needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is saying no account is taken at this stage of the effects of the change to the fuel allowance provided for in the social welfare legislation being taken today.  As of 2014, those who are 65 will not be entitled to a fuel allowance until they are 66.  After 2021, the age of entitlement will be 67.  Am I correct in stating one cannot qualify for a fuel allowance until one is on long-term jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I said we need to examine this holistically.  The critical issue for many who are dependent on the fuel allowance is to improve heat retention in their houses.  I refer to problems such as dampness.  The inter-departmental-agency group is drawing up an energy-affordability strategy.  The heating allowance, while incredibly important to people, is not the only provision we should be examining.  We should also be seeking to really improve the quality of insulation in houses.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware in respect of the jobs initiative, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has introduced a scheme that will provide for insulation.  I and many Deputies in the House would like to see emphasis on reducing energy loss and heat loss and on improving insulation.  This is probably more important than the issue of the heating allowance.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>   the way she will ensure participants in the community work placement initiative T&uacute;s have relevant training or previous experience before engaging in work such as the social care of all age groups and persons with a disability or with limited mobility.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[15461/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>T&uacute;s is a community work placement initiative which will provide up to 5,000 short-term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  Some &euro;30 million has been provided in the Department&rsquo;s Estimates in 2011 to fund the roll-out of the initiative.  This initiative is being delivered through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas.  The purpose of T&uacute;s is to focus on those people who are long-term unemployed.  For this reason, eligibility is at present confined to those on the live register for 12 months and in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  These provisions are to ensure a targeted approach to those currently affected by long-term unemployment.  People already in employment are not eligible for these positions.</P>
        <P>Participants will, in the first instance, be identified by the Department of Social Protection.  Once selected, participants will be referred to the appropriate local development company operating in their area where their skills set, background, experience and suitability will be assessed.  Local development companies will then attempt to match each participant with work placements that have been identified and evaluated as being suitable, taking account of the job profile and the participant&rsquo;s profile.  In all work placements, some element of task related induction or training will be required.  This will be provided by the staff of the local development company and the community organisation.  In the particular circumstances identified by the Deputy, additional work-related training may be required.  The provision of such specialist training is primarily a matter for the service provider, who is best placed to identify and provide access to the necessary training opportunities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>As I implied in my question, I am a little concerned that people working in care provision experience many problems at present.  Given the many unsavoury <Col N="246"/>reports issued over recent years by various institutions, perhaps there is a lack of training and regulation in the area.  It seems that people unemployed for more than a year may be forced off the welfare scheme if they do not agree to what is proposed for them.  I would have thought the Minister would have regarded this as a little draconian.  Does she believe people may be forced to do something they may not want to do?  If we are to put them in a position where they are responsible for looking after vulnerable people in social care, this is hardly a positive approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that people working in care need to be trained.  People working in care generally or community organisations that deal with children or vulnerable adults must be vetted by the Garda.</P>
        <P>The T&uacute;s scheme was designed by the former Minister for Social Protection as a kind of urban copy of the rural social scheme.  Many Deputies will be aware of the latter, which has been quite successful in a targeted way in respect of activities in rural communities.  The opportunity afforded in these communities should also be available in urban areas.</P>
        <P>When I became Minister, I found that none of the 5,000 places available had been activated.  In terms of the number of people looking for opportunities to be actively involved in some kind of community development or work it is important that we operate the scheme and offer those opportunities.  The scheme is carefully supervised.  In many areas the advertisements for supervisors have been published, supervisors have been taken on and the scheme is proceeding to take on applicants who will be engaged in the work.  I will bear in mind what the Deputy said about concern but as the local development companies will be the managers of the schemes it will be their responsibility to design the work programme for people taking part in the scheme in a way that does not give rise to the concerns the Deputy has expressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>If there are more than 440,000 people unemployed, 300,000 of them would love to have a job.  They are not avoiding work.  I suspect that in terms of this scheme the view might be that there are some people who do not want to work and that if they refuse work they should be taken off the social welfare scheme.  Will the Minister agree that the resources of the country are meant to be shared by all the citizens of the State and that it would be a retrograde step to cut people off welfare?  With so many people looking for work surely we can work with the people who would volunteer.  There are many people who would like to do this work.  We could probably get many people to do it without having to force people who might not be in the right frame of work to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The important strategy is to provide people with options and opportunities.  I would be distressed to find a younger person in their early 20s drifting onto social welfare as a permanent condition of their life.  I am aware, as is everybody, of the huge drop in employment opportunities recently and most people are looking for work but if somebody on social welfare is drifting into long-term unemployment it is important that they be given positive options in education, training and work experience.  People are offered positive opportunities through the initiatives announced in the jobs programme, the various educational initiatives and initiatives such as the back to work schemes and the T&uacute;s initiative, like the rural social scheme.  In terms of people refusing positive options and opportunities to engage, and those opportunities and options must be realistic for people, people who are working in low paid conditions and paying PRSI should be entitled to be reassured that those who are long-term unemployed and whom the State is assisting to get back into employment take up those options.  If they refuse to engage, there are now provisions whereby somebody&rsquo;s social welfare <Col N="247"/>payment should be cut, but that is a last resort.  It is important that people engage in positive options for work training, education and work experience.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have just told the House in answer to the previous question, the Government is committed to tackling Ireland&rsquo;s economic crisis in a way that is fair, balanced and which recognises the need for social solidarity.  The appropriate level of overall expenditure by my Department will be considered in the context of budget 2012 and subsequent budgets.  This consideration will be informed by the commitment in the programme for Government to maintain social welfare rates.  There will be an ongoing necessity to curtail overall expenditure in 2012 and in later years.  The comprehensive review of expenditure currently under way in all Government Departments and agencies will form the basis for achieving this objective.  Draft reviews will be submitted to the steering committee in July and they will be finalised over the summer.</P>
        <P>The objectives of the review are to inform the best use of resources and to guide us in achieving the Government&rsquo;s public service reform objectives.  Better use of resources will enable us to meet overall fiscal consolidation targets, realign spending with programme for Government priorities, target resources at the most effective programmes and set new objectives so that we can continue to make social welfare payments at appropriate levels, sustaining social cohesion and treating people with dignity.  All Departments are covered by the review, with each Department preparing a comprehensive assessment and review of programme savings and the identification of efficiencies and reforms.</P>
        <P>Cross-cutting issues which relate to a number of Departments are also being examined.  The new expenditure review process is crucial to the success of our Government programme.  The outcome of the review will be considered by the Government in September.  Any changes to the wide range of schemes and services provided by my Department, including the levels of welfare payments, will be informed by the overall Government-wide options identified in the review to better and more efficiently targeted scarce resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked this question in the context of the commitment in the programme for Government that the Government will maintain social welfare rates.  Is that commitment in respect of all social welfare programmes and all rates?  Is it for this year, next year and every year?  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, spoke last week about the finances being on track and the commitment in last year&rsquo;s budget being adhered to, in order words, so far so good in respect of the public finances.  Does that now afford the Minister the opportunity to commit more specifically than she has done heretofore, reaffirm the commitment in the programme for Government and state now that existing social welfare rates will remain?</P>
        <P>I worry when I hear the Minister say &ldquo;in the context of the budget&rdquo;, &ldquo;the most effective programmes&rdquo; and so forth because that may mean she is beginning to make choices in regard to rates.  The Minister&rsquo;s commitment is in regard to all welfare rates.  Can the Minister reaffirm that considering what the Minister for Finance said last week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The commitment in the programme for Government is in regard to welfare rates but the commitment is also to reform and to a comprehensive expenditure review.  We had a discussion earlier on T&uacute;s and other programmes and options that are available to get people back to education, training and work experience.  Part of the reforms I hope to see <Col N="248"/>in the Department is to ensure that younger people do not drift into being on long-term social welfare.  It is not good for them, their families or their children.  The reform of the social welfare system is to provide options, opportunities and encouragement for people to become active and engaged.</P>
        <P>Social welfare involves paying pensions to older people who have retired.  We want to ensure that money is spent in a way that is targeted and effective but that also provides options and opportunities that ensure people become active and activated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister commit to the existing social welfare rates, notwithstanding the authorisations, changes and overhaul of various systems she spoke about in grandiose terms?  I take at face value the Minister&rsquo;s commitment in that regard but I ask her to confirm the commitment in respect of the existing rates, especially in the context of what the Minister for Finance said last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Suggesting to people that we will reform the social welfare system in a way that ensures people get options and opportunities is not in any way grandiose.  I would have thought that was common sense because if we look at any community in any village or town throughout the country we see a wealth of resources available and a community spirit that is anxious to work with the local community and give people opportunities to develop and prosper.</P>
        <P>The social welfare system, particularly for those in their active working years, has to be geared to give the maximum encouragement to people who have lost their jobs or were never able to get a job in the first place, so that they can avail of opportunities in education to improve their employability.  That is an absolutely critical reform.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government commits to maintaining social welfare and to a comprehensive expenditure review.  The expenditure review requirements are very onerous.  The country is in an IMF structural adjustment programme.  That is something to which the previous Government signed up and bequeathed to this Government.  We hope to be able to exit that programme and return the country to full financial independence and sovereignty.  In the meantime, everything must be reviewed.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>   the reason she will not conduct and publish a cost-benefit analysis of using the PRSI system not only to collect the auto-enrolment pension contributions that are proposed by the national pensions framework but also to manage that money and make payments rather than handing those responsibilities over to the private pension industry.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[15459/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Increasing pensions coverage, particular among the lower paid and those with gaps in their employment, is a priority for the Government.  The introduction of an auto-enrolment system is one of the best ways in which we can do this.  An inter-departmental group, chaired by the Department of Social Protection, is developing the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to introduce a number of pension reforms in the national pensions framework, including auto-enrolment.   </P>
        <P>It is envisaged at this stage that contributions for an auto-enrolment system will be collected through the PRSI system.  In developing the various aspects of the system, we will consider the costs and benefits associated with the options available.</P><Col N="249"/>
        <P>There will be a limited number and limited types of funds available under the scheme.  The Government will decide how these participating investment funds will be selected and managed.  It is expected that a competitive process will be run by the State which will also ensure that charges are kept to a minimum.  The competitive process will not necessarily be confined to the private sector.  It could include State organisations such as the NTMA.  No decision has been made as yet.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the auto-enrolment scheme will be introduced in 2014, but only if it would be prudent given the economic conditions prevailing at that time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her answer, which goes beyond the answer I received to a written question I tabled recently.  I welcome the fact that she said part of the State mechanism may be able to tender for this work.  I do not think it should be limited to the NTMA, and the State itself should be involved to a greater degree.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that before the crash, and in spite of huge tax breaks, the private pensions industry failed completely to deliver an adequate income for the vast majority of the people who were reaching retirement age?  Does she agree that the PRSI system has proved to be an effective and straightforward system in which the public can have confidence?  Does she agree that it should be the system to deliver private pensions, beyond just collecting contributions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The evidence from other countries is that auto-enrolment is a very effective way of getting more workers to start providing for retirement pensions at an earlier age.  There is very considerable merit in this system, but its introduction in 2014 will very much depend on the economic conditions at that stage.</P>
        <P>Younger people are often focused on acquiring a house and other commitments, such as settling down in relationships and having children.  However, time slips by for many workers who fail to become involved in pension provision and as they become older, they are seriously underprovided for.  This is an issue for Irish society and the purpose of the auto-enrolment scheme is to assist that.</P>
        <P>When the Deputy mentioned other institutions, I presume he was referring to An Post.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>There are good models available and one of the best schemes that ever existed was the simple savings scheme with An Post.  A person could basically save relatively small amounts of money for five years and get a return.  This was dealt with in a very effective and comprehensive way.  I acknowledge that An Post potentially would have a role to play in this, along with the NTMA.  However, there would also be strong interest from private providers.  At the end of the day, the advisory group currently working on this will provide the advice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister confirm that there is no preferred option at this stage?  Without substantial changes to the private pensions industry, it should not be considered suitable, given that there is a need for greater transparency on costs.  Up to 30% of a pensioner&rsquo;s lump sum is often swallowed up in charges.  The return on private pension assets was recently only 1%, whereas the return from the An Post scheme is 3%.  That would be a better model to follow when providing a second tier pension.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The pensions industry is an important industry and employer in this country.  It is a very important route for many people, providing for pensions through defined <Col N="250"/>benefit and defined contribution schemes.  The industry will continue to play an important role.  That does not in any way prevent the existence of schemes being offered through State mechanisms such as the NTMA and An Post.  We want schemes that will afford the maximum take up at the most reasonable cost to the highest amount of workers from as early in their working life as they are willing to start thinking about providing for a pension.  That would leave us all in a happier position.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 39, 52, 58, 65 and 68 together. </P>
        <P>The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  There is an important and significant policy background to these changes which is that with increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  This has obvious implications for the future costs of State pension provision.</P>
        <P>I want to emphasise the fundamental principle that people need to participate in the workforce for longer and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.  The population share of those aged 65 and over is expected to more than double between now and 2050, from 11% to 26%.  People are also living longer.  Spending on public pensions, that is, social welfare pensions and <Col N="251"/>public service occupational pensions, is projected to increase from approximately 5% of GDP in 2008 to almost 15% by 2050.</P>
        <P>As announced in the national pensions framework, the State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014, with the standardisation of the State pension age at 66.  The State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  It is worth noting that until the early 1970s, the qualifying age for a pension was 70 years of age.  The legislative changes for this are included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011 currently before the D&aacute;il.  It also meets commitments Ireland entered into in the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland.</P>
        <P>By gradually increasing the qualifying age for State pension, people will be further encouraged to remain in employment beyond 65 years of age.  The numbers currently at work drop dramatically at 65 years of age.  The quarterly national household survey of 2010 showed that 77.2% % of people aged 45 years to 54 years were at work.  This drops to 64.3% for 55 to 64 year olds and to just 8.7% for people aged 65 years or over.</P>
        <P>In terms of consultation, the Green Paper on Pensions was published in October 2007 and commenced an extensive consultation process to gather the views of people and organisations on the Irish current pensions system with submissions received from individuals and from organisations.   The consultation process continued until the end of May 2008 and a report on the consultation process was published in September 2008.  This report and the submissions received can be viewed on the national pensions framework website.</P>
        <P>Work then began on developing a framework for pensions which was published in March 2010.  Further consultation has taken place on implementation of aspects of the national pensions framework.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the consultation process has been an open and inclusive one and that all those who wished to make their views on pensions known have had the opportunity to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that the Minister is trying to put a positive spin on what is an outrageous diktat from the IMF-EU to force working people in this country to work longer, harder and for less?  Given that working class people, poor people, live shorter lives, this will disproportionately hit them and essentially work some people to death when they should have a few years to enjoy a dignified retirement.</P>
        <P>Is not the least we could expect in such a serious matter, namely, raising the pension age, that the people would have a democratic say?  Is it not extraordinary that in Slovenia on 5 June, a referendum was held on this matter and the people voted 72% against raising the pension age when their government planned to do the same as this one?  Could we not have the same level of democracy on this key issue affecting ordinary people as the people of Slovenia had?</P>
        <P>Italy has referendums on key and substantial issues of policy.   One would not associate a country headed by Silvio Berlusconi with great levels of democracy but it has held referendums on serious and substantial issues and the government there has been defeated.  Why can we not have a democratic say on this outrageous measure to force the people to work longer and harder for less?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know about the Deputy&rsquo;s experiences but I frequently meet older people who would like the right to work longer.  Happily, as a society, we are all living longer.  In terms of the contribution and commitment of this State, everybody in work paying taxation and PRSI is contributing extensively to pensions.  Some 280,000 people are on contributory State pensions which cost &euro;3.45 billion in 2010 while 97,000 people are on the non-<Col N="252"/>contributory pension which cost almost &euro;1 billion.  The contributions of the citizens of this State through taxes and PRSI they pay to pensions is considerable.</P>
        <P>As I said, the age profile of this State is changing.  Happily, people are living longer and many want to work longer.  Many people stay in education longer than people used to and their working lives are somewhat shorter than they used to be.</P>
        <P>What we need is a level of flexibility and flexi-security to deal with the changing demographics and the changing nature of work and work patterns in this country while ensuring that when people retire as they get older, they have a State pension at a level which allows them to live in comfort and dignity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not really answer the questions.  Is it not the case that if we had a referendum on raising the State pension age, some would be in favour of it, as in Slovenia where 20% or so were in favour of it, and some would be against it, as in Slovenia where 72% were against it?  Is it also not the case that if we had a referendum and people had a democratic say, we would get a similar result?</P>
        <P>Given the physical nature of their jobs, manual workers are exhausted by the age of 65 and they would not wish to be forced to work longer.  Can we have consultation on what is a very serious measure?  Has the Minister costed this?  If public sector workers, who will be paid at the top of the incremental scale, work longer, younger workers, who will come in at the lower end of the incremental scale, will not be coming in.  Will it not cost the State money to force public sector workers to work longer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The discussions currently with public sector workers are under the aegis of the Croke Park Agreement and unless I am mistaken, workers and their representatives were voluntary participants in the Croke Park Agreement discussions and the structure and nature of that agreement.  The State is an important and a critical employer in this country and it should be involved in negotiations with workers and their representatives.</P>
        <P>The Deputy must recognise that those working on building sites for many years will probably not wish to do so when they are in their late 50s or early 60s.  However, many members of my family were builders and builders labourers.  My two uncles worked well into their 70s and nobody could stop them, even though we wanted to do so.  I do not believe we should be overly prescriptive on how working class people live their lives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be voluntary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Some people wish to work longer while some wish to retire earlier.  There may be people who have no particular desire to work at all, although they would be few in number.  We must provide a good system of pensions in retirement which, in particular, allow for the different types of lives people live.  Women, for instance, often drop in and drop out of the labour force because they may take time out when rearing small children.  Women and men also may take time out when caring for older relatives.  The pension structures we are evolving must reflect the diversity and complexity of modern life and work patterns.  That makes sense rather than representing a threat to people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying she is carrying on the cuts Fianna F&aacute;il introduced, because she has laid out the process since 2009?  Is extending the age for the State pension reflective of quotes from people like Colm McCarthy of an bord snip nua who, in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> in July 2009, stated that people used to snuff it at 70 but they have now decided to snuff it at 80, 85 or 90 and that something has to give?  Is this what the Minister is giving?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="253"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnHalligan"><NameTxt>Deputy John Halligan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister serious that people such as small farmers, who might work 70 to 90 hours per week, and shift workers, who might have been doing shift work for 20 to 40 years, want to work an extra year when they reach the age of 65?  The Minister cannot seriously believe that.  It comes down to having some type of dignity and quality of life at the end of one&rsquo;s working life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnHalligan"><NameTxt>Deputy John Halligan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister really believe that?  She will obviously say she does but is she seriously stating that when people at the lower and hardest end of the working scale, such as builders, labourers, small farmers and people on shift work, reach 65 years of age they do not wish to spend more time with their families?  The Minister is saying they want to work an extra year at their eight hour shift that starts at midnight or to go out on their farms to start work at five in the evening.  Nobody in Ireland would believe that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Collins referred to people who are 90 years of age.  The proposal is that in 2014 the standard pension age would become 66 years.  The only person aged 90 I saw recently who is actively working was pretty impressive and is probably a strong recommendation for people remaining very active, but active in a way that is appropriate to their physical condition, age and inclinations.  The critical issue is offering people opportunities and options.</P>
        <P>This country has a good and solid old age pensions system which has evolved through collective social agreement between all the political parties and people of no political party over a long period.  However, this country faces really serious demographic changes for which we must make provision.  We are also in a desperate economic hole.  The Government did not develop this economic hole, but we will not go into that at present.  We must try to make the best possible use of resources.  There are some people who wish to have the opportunity to work for longer.  Deputies must also take account of women who might have a reduced number of working years due to their commitments to caring for young and older people.  The pensions system must be designed for a wide range of people.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>   if she will consider re-instating, as a matter of urgency, supplementary welfare allowance payments in respect of persons (details supplied) in County Wexford.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[15368/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, SWA, which is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, HSE, is designed to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  Since 1 May 2004, all applicants for SWA regardless of nationality are required to be habitually resident in the State to qualify for a payment.  The effect of this condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere does not qualify for SWA.  Once-off exceptional and urgent needs payments are not subject to the habitual residence condition.</P>
        <P>SWA cannot be viewed as a temporary or interim means of income support available independently of the habitual residence condition while an applicant awaits the outcome of either a decision or an appeal against a decision on a claim for a social welfare payment from the Department.  It is understood that the persons concerned moved to Ireland from the UK in April 2010.  They had been in receipt of incapacity payments and a carer&rsquo;s allowance in the UK.  However, it is understood that these are no longer in payment.  It appears they moved to Ireland with no apparent means of supporting themselves except to claim social welfare.</P><Col N="254"/>
        <P>The HSE has advised that it awarded a basic supplementary welfare allowance payment and a rent supplement payment to the persons in question in May 2010.  This decision was reviewed in March 2011, and the HSE discovered that the persons in question should never have been considered habitually resident in the State.  The HSE has further advised that it then decided to withdraw the payments and advised the person in question of this decision on 15 March 2011; payments ceased from the beginning of April 2011.  The decision of the HSE to withdraw payments was appealed to the HSE appeals office and is currently under consideration.</P>
        <P>The persons in question also claimed carer&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance from the Department.  Both of these claims were also refused as the medical criteria for the schemes were not satisfied and the deciding officers also considered that the persons in question did not satisfy the habitual residence condition.  These decisions have been appealed to the chief appeals office which has advised that it proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The wealthy members of the global diaspora will yet again be feted in this country.  We constantly talk about the global diaspora and how important it is, but in the case of these two people this is just contempt through the implementation of the habitual residence condition as it is applied to a less well-off Irish citizen, the male in this case.  We are talking about an Irish citizen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I appeal to the Minister to examine this case.  The man concerned is an Irish citizen.  His family is from Clonegal and most of his family live there.  His mother is returning from England.  He happened to be born in England but has severed all ties with Britain, at the request of the social welfare authorities here.  He has nothing to return to and all his family are in this country.  He and his wife, who has mental health issues, face eviction this Friday; they will be out on the street unless payments are resumed.  Their cases are under appeal.  It is just incomprehensible that these people have been refused under the habitual residency requirement.  I appeal to the Minister to re-examine this case.  It is absolutely unfair and contemptible treatment of an Irish citizen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The people involved have applied to the Irish social welfare system for a number of different payments.  Some of those payments are determined by medical criteria.  The view of the medical experts, who make their judgments in a medical context, was that they did not qualify for the payments for which they applied on medical grounds.  With regard to the other payments for which they applied, they are currently under appeal and the appeals office will hold an oral hearing.</P>
        <P>It is important to bear in mind the circumstances in this case.  One of the persons arrived in Ireland in April 2010.  Shortly afterwards they wrote to the Department of Social Security in the UK and ceased the incapacity benefit which they had been receiving.  That Department wrote to the person and advised that it would cease the payment as the person no longer wished to receive it.</P>

	<P>In England.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The Deputy must appreciate that in respect of the habitual residence condition there is a line between people moving to this country and claiming significant benefits from the State, which is currently under pressure, in a situation where they are not habitually resident in this country.  They were in receipt of payments for a year, their case was reviewed and it is now subject to an oral hearing.  They may have additional information or <Col N="255"/>evidence they wish to submit to the oral hearing.  The appeals mechanism is independent of the Minister and is in operation.</P>

        <Quest>   the costs involved in funding Pobal per annum; the cost of Pobal&rsquo;s administrative services since its establishment and if the work being sub-contracted out to Pobal could be withdrawn and brought back into the public services, thereby saving considerable amounts of money.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[15020/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Pobal delivers a range of publicly and EU-funded programmes on behalf of a number of Departments.  My reply concerns services delivered by Pobal in respect of the rural social scheme and the community services programme that transferred to the Department of Social Protection last September following the reconfiguration of Government functions announced in March 2010.  Pobal operates under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which has an oversight and co-ordination role in respect of the company.  Members of the board of Pobal are appointed by the Government from nominations provided by the social partners and other stakeholders.  The company is subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and its operations are covered by the Freedom of Information and Ethics in Public Office Acts.</P>
        <P>The fees paid to Pobal in respect of work undertaken are matters for each individual Department.  I have provided a table for the Deputy of the fees paid in respect of the rural social scheme since it commenced in 2004 and for the community services programme since it commenced operations in 2006.  Both programmes fell under the former Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and latterly, the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs prior to the transfer to the Department of Social Protection.</P>
        <P>The services provides to the Department of Social Protection relate to payroll and some related functions on the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s.  Around 2,600 participants and 130 supervisors are paid weekly by Pobal on the rural social scheme.  Pobal has begun to make weekly payroll payments in respect of T&uacute;s, the new community work placement initiative which is currently being rolled-out nationally.  Some 5,000 weekly payments are planned for T&uacute;s when it is fully operational.</P>
        <P>The services provided on the community services programme are significantly different than the former and encompass application management, appraisal and assessment, contract maintenance, distribution and management of payments by instalments to service providers, monitoring of progress, various support to beneficiaries, risk audit, financial verification, control and inspections and advice on service development to each of the 445 service providers currently in contract to the programme.  The Minister of the day approves all applications for funding from the community services programme following detailed assessment and recommendation by Pobal.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P>While it is possible that the services provided by Pobal could be provided internally by my Department or other Departments, it is unlikely that significant savings would arise given that staff resources would need to be redeployed, systems would require development and the necessary expertise in providing advice to the sectors concerned may not be readily available.</P><Col N="256"/>
        <P>Additionally, because Pobal delivers funding on behalf of a number of Departments involved in supporting services in the not-for-profit, community and voluntary sectors, the company is in a unique position to bring considerable value-added because of its comprehensive knowledge of the sectors.  The central administration and integration of services offered by the company across the various programmes and the fact that the same staff work on a number of programmes are considerable strengths which would not be easily replicated if Departments separately implemented programmes.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for her response.  Does the Minister consider Pobal an extra layer of bureaucracy?  While I have no problem with the services it provides, it is a private company providing the service, albeit a charity.  Charities incur heavy wageroll costs.  In 2008 Pobal&rsquo;s salary costs were &euro;14.6 million, which amounts to &euro;55,000 on average for each of the 266 employees.  Does the Minister believe this is another quango, of which we have one for every 4,000 people?  Should it be brought within the remit of the Departments?  Grants and wages for the rural social scheme are being delayed because of four levels of administration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his question and I would be happy to hear from him in detail about the problems or delays he has encountered in respect of payment of participants.  The services provided by Pobal could be provided by my Department or other Departments but it is unlikely to result in significant savings.  Staff resources would need to be deployed, systems would need development and the expertise in providing advice to the sectors concerned may not be readily available.</P>
        <P>There have been further changes to Pobal since the Government took office.  It is now under the aegis of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  I will consider what the Deputy said.  Pobal is a service provider for the rural social scheme and the community services programme.  If the provider was to be replaced, we would have to examine the implications for the resources of my Department.  There is an extraordinary call on the services of the Department and we have recently taken on additional work, including insolvency and redundancy payments.  I am reluctant to commit to extra services unless we carry out a full evaluation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomBarry"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Barry</NameTxt>
	<P>The money will be spent anyway, whether we pay Pobal or new staff are allocated in the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  Does the Minister consider that it would add to the expertise of the people working in her Department if this matter was examined over time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of ICT and computer facilitation upgrades are taking place in the Department.  If the Deputy outlines his concerns, I will examine them.  The Department of Social Protection is responsible for paying more than 1 million people some kind of payment or benefit.  The Department took on redundancy and insolvency payments in order to reduce the <Col N="257"/>backlog when those payments were managed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  That was an extra job taken on by my Department.  I will consider what the Deputy said.</P>

        <Quest>   the number of extra staff redeployed from other Departments to her Department in each of the past three years to date in 2011 with particular reference to the need to clear a backlog under various headings; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

	<P>Since May 2008, some 825 posts have been assigned to the Department of Social Protection to fill critical staff vacancies and additional posts approved to deal with the significant increase in claims for the schemes operated by the Department.  The assignment details on a yearly basis are set out in the following table.  The majority of these posts have been sourced through the lateral transfer and redeployment of staff from within the Department and from other Departments.  Staffing needs are kept under constant review to ensure the best use is made of all available resources.  Processing times vary across schemes because of both the volume of applications and the differing qualification criteria.  For example, means assessments are required for all of the social assistance schemes; medical examinations are required for some of the illness-related schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence conditions.  In the case of the insurance-based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.</P>
        <P>One of the main impacts on current service delivery has been the increase in the live register.  In this context, the Department has introduced a range of process improvement initiatives regarding claims for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  One of the most significant initiatives, aimed at reducing queuing times and waiting times, involves the customer attending the local office by appointment at which time the claim is taken and decided.</P>
        <P>Process improvements have resulted in a significant reduction in the number and proportion of all claims awaiting a decision.  For example, there were 33,591 jobseeker claims awaiting a decision on 4 June 2011, equating to 7% of the total claim-load.  This compares favourably to 5 June 2010 when 46,879 claims or 9% of claim-load awaiting decision and 74,553 claims or 16% awaiting decision in June 2009.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>My Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  All scheme areas in the Department are subject to continuous business process improvement supported by modern technology, the potential of which is continuously harnessed and applied to maximum effect.  The plans to integrate the community welfare service from the Health Service Executive into my Department together with the employment and other services of F&Aacute;S, and functions transferred from other Departments represent significant milestones in business transformation and will provide the basis for a new model of service delivery in my Department.  This will ensure that our services and resources are organised to deliver effective, more timely, case management based, income and employment support services to our customer base.  The following table details the number of posts per year assigned to the Department of Social Protection.</P>

	<P>Notwithstanding the strides made by the Minister in the short time she has been in office and given the magnitude of the problem which was unfolding when she began in office, is it an opportune time to seek further redeployments to ensure a dramatic reduction in waiting times and backlogs under a number of headings?  At the same time we could reduce the kind of duplication taking place that is laborious, time consuming and non-productive.  It entails officials poring over the same kind of documents, with some cases on four or five occasions.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister confirm to the House that a waiting time of one year is too long, particularly in examples like carer&rsquo;s allowance?  Some of those cases go back 18 months.  I accept the Minister is only in office a very short time and I congratulate her for the work she has done.  The magnitude of the problem unfolding now is such that unless something is done about it in the very near future, the whole system will break down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of different elements to reducing the overall waiting times for people making applications for benefits and schemes, as well as for allowances.  The Deputy referred to duplication and the laborious processes taking time and causing delays.  One of the overall changes that the Department is undergoing currently, as the Deputy is aware, is that community welfare officers are joining the Department and will become civil servants.  They will be integrated into the Department.  At the same time, the employment services side of F&Aacute;S will also come into the Department, and F&Aacute;S employees who join the Department will also become civil servants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This will allow us to build a new national employment and entitlements service, which will move us towards the famous one-stop-shop.  Instead of people having to repeat applications, they should be able to get a more integrated service at one point.  As Deputies may be aware, people may also go to their local office and process a variety of claims at the local office point, which in turn will reduce the need people have had in the past to go to a community welfare officer when waiting for a claim to be processed.</P>
        <P>The second element will be improving forms and the information technology applications.  There is a great deal of work ongoing in the Department in this respect.  A card system will be rolled out later this year with photo identification, an important improvement in the Department&rsquo;s procedures.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also mentioned carers.  There is currently an examination in the Department that is reviewing existing processes and procedures for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The Deputy and I have referred to claims based on medical evidence, and it is critical that when an application is made, all the information required should be made available to the Department to the highest possible level and standard.  Faster and clearer decisions will reduce the number of appeals and allow the appeal process to be much faster.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct in stating that a waiting time of one year is very long.  I hope that with the reforms I speak about, it will not happen.  The Department has faced an enormous increase in the numbers of claims across all fronts and it has been very taxing on the staff, which has tried to respond as quickly as possible to the significant extra demands being put on social welfare as a consequence of the economic collapse.</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 3, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am prepared to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt in this regard on the basis that it has the potential to encourage new jobs, albeit at lower rates of pay.  I hope it will encourage people off State assistance etc.  Bearing in mind what has been said by other contributors before lunch, should the fears of these speakers materialise or if hard evidence crystalises, how does the Minister envisage the Department responding?  Is she happy in the knowledge that existing employment law, for example, will safeguard the Minister and the State against malpractice by employers who may seek to take advantage of the figure of &euro;356, down from &euro;390 or thereabouts.  There would be a PRSI and wage saving, which would have a detrimental effect on employees and those whom we strive to assist in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We heard a number of important contributions from Deputies this morning airing concerns that the reduction in an employer&rsquo;s PRSI to half of what it is currently would lead to employers reducing employment or wages.  I stated this morning there are two balancing measures in this legislation; one is the restoration of the minimum wage which, in effect, raises it by &euro;1 per hour to &euro;8.65, and the second is the reduction of 50% in an employer&rsquo;s PRSI for the period to the end of 2013.</P><Col N="260"/>
        <P>The purpose of these is not simply to offer a significant financial incentive to employers to expand employment.  It is also to encourage employers to retain existing jobs.  A number of Deputies were concerned that there is no evidence concerning job creation or were sceptical about jobs growth.  The incentive for an employer to reduce earnings to avail of the reduced PRSI rate would not be as great as Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh suggested.  In the example he gave the incentive would be slightly over &euro;2 per week rather than &euro;27 per week, as he suggested.</P>
        <P>In my experience of employers, the vast majority are very decent and anxious to retain staff.  They would show much loyalty to staff and although they may face very difficult financial conditions, that would not mean they are unmindful of the equally difficult financial positions of employees.  Some employers may be unscrupulous but the majority are very decent and aware of their committed employees&rsquo; financial position.</P>
        <P>The evidence internationally suggests that in the tourism sector Ireland has lost ground in traditional markets such as the UK, partly because of currency differentials.  The number of UK visitors is substantially lower than was the case several years ago.  Offering employers an incentive by reducing PRSI costs for a limited period is not a guarantee that the industry will be turned around but it is potentially an important element in making the product more competitive to tourists, particularly those coming from the UK.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the reduction in VAT levels for products related to the tourism and hairdressing sectors is an important incentive which will help to retain employment in areas where employers are operating on a knife-edge because of other cost issues.  Many of the new jobs in international technology companies are highly skilled and the reduction in employer&rsquo;s PRSI does not apply to them.  This initiative is focused on employers who are struggling to maintain jobs and the incentives will help to ensure existing jobs are retained and expand employment levels.  We will be monitoring what happens as a result of the incentive, which is due to end at the end of 2013.  I am optimistic that we will see improvements in the attractiveness and competitiveness of Ireland from a tourism perspective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier I spoke about the gap in terms of encouraging employers.  I agree with the Minister that not all employers are greedy or disrespect their workers.  Many employers have built up loyalty to their staff by taking account of their interests but I refer to those who pay rates that are at or around the minimum wage.  There is a strong incentive to reduce wages or maintain them at low levels given that the difference between the two rates of PRSI, which was previously 2.3%, is now 6.5%.  In the past, the paperwork alone might not have justified changing pay rates but the gap is now substantial.  As I compiled these figures myself, they may not be completely accurate but I assure the Minister the difference is greater than &euro;2 per week.</P>
        <P>If this measure was intended to give a once-off stimulus to employers over a period of six months, a graduated change in the rates beginning at the level proposed by the Government could have been justified.  Instead, however, a rate of 3.9% will be applied for a period of three years, unless the Government offers a further extension of the lower rate.  I guarantee that the business class will be pressuring the Government to retain the rate beyond 2013 and they will use the same excuse that changes could lead to job losses.  Everybody is always under pressure and people must cut their cloth to measure.  The costs that could more effectively be addressed in order to assist small businesses include fuel, electricity and production.  Employers&rsquo; PRSI contributions are not as large as they should be at a time when high unemployment levels are creating a strain on the public purse.  The Exchequer is being further strained by reductions in the contributions expected from employers.  A substantial number of people who are on low wages will be affected by this measure.  Perhaps the Minister can provide figures for the precise <Col N="261"/>number but I would estimate that approximately 200,000 people would fall into this category.  The effect on the public purse of the decrease in employer contribution will be significant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of the employer job PRSI incentive scheme, which has been available for some time, as of 10 June 2011 applications were received from 480 employers in respect of 708 employees, 313 employers were awarded exemptions in respect of 429 employers and 157 employers had claims rejected in respect of 215 employees.  The numbers involved in the existing scheme are relatively low.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh suggested earlier that the 50% reduction offered in this scheme makes it more attractive but we can only speculate about this because there is no evidence to suggest that responsible employers will reduce wages as a consequence of this arrangement.</P>
        <P>Alongside the fact that the minimum wage is increasing by &euro;1, this is an attempt as part of other elements of the jobs incentive package, such as the reduction in VAT, to provide a stimulus for employment retention and creation.  If each of the thousands of small firms in the country took on an extra employee, that would produce a significant outcome for employment.  However, in the current economic situation maintaining staff is challenging in itself for small and medium sized enterprises.  This measure is targeted at specific sectors where the beneficial effects of job retention and creation will be spread throughout the country.</P>
      <TimeSt down="3" idown="3">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Government has put forward the initiative as part of the programme for Government.  We wish to encourage employers, through the initiative, to both retain and hopefully increase employment.  I recognise that this is not a panacea for all the cost issues faced by employers.  The jobs initiative is about targeted interventions.  The measure is targeted, in particular when one considers that there is a countervailing measure in terms of employees&rsquo; pay, which is the restoration of the minimum wage, being introduced at the same time.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS</P>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;4.&mdash;The provisions of <i>section 3 </i>shall apply to new jobs only.&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>The amendment relates to the previous section so I will not say too much about it.  The purpose is to ensure that the intention of section 3 would apply to new jobs only.  We debated the issue and I took note of what the Minister said, namely, that part of the measure is a retention package.  I will not delay too long on the point, but if it is a retention package it cannot be an incentive.  For it to be an incentive it must be substantial and make a major difference.  When I argued that it would create a significant difference in terms of being an incentive to reduce wages or change work conditions the Minister said there is no proof of that.  The fact that an employer can retain jobs means there is a financial incentive involved in the change.  No one is denying that times are challenging for employers but it is also very challenging for employees.  I will not press the amendment.  If we had more time I would have elaborated further on my proposal and the mechanism to ensure that at the very least if we are introducing a change to employer&rsquo;s PRSI contributions it would be tied only to the creation of new jobs.  That would be an incentive to create new jobs rather than relating to existing jobs and being an incentive to undermine the conditions of existing employees.</P><Col N="262"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be the next item on the agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Could I ask for clarification on the amendment?  Is it the case that neither the Government nor anyone else has a clue as to how many jobs the reduction in employer&rsquo;s PRSI will create?  Is it like the removal of the &euro;3 tax for travellers which is supposed to do marvels for the tourism industry?  One of the problems we have in trying to get to grips with what the effect of Government policy will be with regard to the disastrous unemployment levels is that we have no indication from the Government nor, apparently, from any agencies on which the Government will depend for information, on the impact of the proposals.  That is what I have gathered from what the Minister said.  I do not know if that is the truth of the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The jobs incentive is a stimulus package which offers incentives to employers to both retain staff and take on extra staff.  I cannot offer evidence to Deputy Higgins in advance of the measures coming into effect.  What will happen after 1 July is that the minimum wage will be reinstated and employers will have a reduction of 50% in the rate of PRSI for people earning &euro;356 per week or less.  In addition, there will be reductions in the rate of VAT, particularly geared towards tourism and personal services sectors such as hairdressing.</P>
        <P>Economic evidence nationally and internationally indicates that when one has a reduction in costs, particularly in industries where high costs have perhaps deterred customers from using the services of those industries such as British tourists returning to this country in the kind of numbers in which they used to visit, one can expect a stimulus effect in two areas, the first being an increase in the retention of the number of employees, as many unemployment difficulties relate to losing long-standing jobs in areas such as the bar trade where many different things are happening and the tourism sector, hotels and personal services such as hairdressing.  The second is that the lower rate of VAT is being introduced in those particular areas of activity.</P>
        <P>I cannot offer the Deputy evidence in advance of the measures taking effect but in the context of the amendment tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, which he now intends to withdraw, we will make evidence available through the medium of parliamentary questions and similar mechanisms as the schemes go into operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;4.&mdash;Twelve months following the passage of the Act the Minister shall report to the D&aacute;il on the impact of its operations including&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) the number of new jobs created;</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) wage trends over the period with particular attention to the scale of wage</P>
        <P LI="1">reductions to the &euro;356 level; and</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>c</i>) the number of complaints made.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="263"/>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of the amendment is to seek a report from the Minister in 12 months on the impact of the operation, the number of new jobs created, the wage trends during the period with particular attention to the wage reductions down to the level of &euro;356, and the number of complaints being made on job displacement such as the ending of contracts and people being rehired on a less favourable contract.  Employees may come under pressure from certain unscrupulous employers to reduce their wages so that they can make savings in PRSI.</P>
        <P>The amendment that was ruled out of order had a similar effect.  It related to the proposals under the jobs initiative that so many jobs would be created.  We all wish jobs to be created and we want people back in employment under the best terms and conditions.  We also wish companies well so that employers can feel confident that they are operating in a proper climate.  As legislators we need to be mindful always of the impact of any legislation we pass.  As I have continually stated in the House, it was suggested in the White Paper, Regulating Better, which was produced a number of years ago and dealt with how we do our business in terms of legislation and so on, that a regulatory impact analysis should be carried out for every Bill.  I have gone further and stated that every Bill should also state its impact in terms of addressing poverty.  We want to make sure the Bill we are discussing here will not create a downward trend in the wages of those who are currently around the &euro;356 per week mark.  We should have some indication within a year of whether the Bill is having the effect that is desired by the Government and whether it has resulted in any new jobs.  It would be no harm for the Minister, if she so wished, to add information on the number of jobs that have been retained in that period specifically due to these measures rather than because of any growth in the economy.</P>
        <P>That was the intention of the two amendments that deal with this area.  Given that amendment No. 5 involves no charge on the Exchequer, it does not have the effect of negating the Bill, which was the reason No. 4 was ruled out of order for being contrary to the spirit of the Bill.  Amendment No. 5 would provide for something that could be done; it could later be decided, at the relevant committee or in the House, whether it had had an effect.  It might also inform us, at a later date, of the long-term trend in employers&rsquo; PRSI, giving us the opportunity of reshaping it if required.  That was the intention of the amendment, and I will be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for the positive proposals he has made.  I do not propose to accept the amendments because of the nature of the Bill and the way they are phrased.  However, I accept the principle that the Deputy and other Deputies have set out, that we should have regular assessments of the results of various initiatives.  The reduction in employers&rsquo; PRSI, as set out in the Bill, is to continue until the end of 2013.  It is a fairly costly investment by the Government to support the retention of employment and the expansion of new employment.  Through the media of committee discussions and parliamentary questions, I will be more than happy to report back to the Deputy and other Deputies the progress of this measure.</P>
        <P>With regard to the effect of the measure on the cost of labour to employers, calculations done by the staff of my Department indicate that the saving to the employer will be a maximum of about &euro;9.73 per week, or about &euro;500 in a full year.  It is not some enormous bonanza for employers.  It is a small, targeted measure for particular sectors of the economy, alongside the reduction in the lower rate of VAT, which is an important measure, and the reinstatement of the national minimum wage.</P>
        <P>I will be happy to return to Deputies in some months&rsquo; time when we have information on how the measure is being received.  Various international organisations, and in fact many organisations in Ireland, such as the ESRI and various universities, are moving to what is called evidence-based policy, in which one tries to show the actual impact of measures over a period <Col N="264"/>of time.  This is, in economic terms, part of a stimulus programme.  Stimulus programmes are helpful in moving countries out of the kind of recession we are experiencing and into stabilisation and growth.  As such, I hope this measure will produce a positive impact.  One of the difficulties for the economy is that, partly because we are in a structural adjustment programme being administered by the IMF and the troika and partly because of the enormous collapse of the building and construction industry and the fall in Government revenues, the possibility of stimulus based on Government support is much more limited than I would like.  Those Deputies who follow people such as Joseph Stiglitz will know that providing stimulus is important in terms of giving space to employers and helping to restore confidence in the economy.  That is the intention of the measures that are contained in the Bill.  They are important measures and I am confident we will obtain a response.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the UK market previously.  We recently had the important visit of the Queen of England to this country and this, along with the visit of the US President, has resulted in a lot of positive publicity for the country.  Thus, we have some grounds for optimism, although, as I have said before, improving the economy, in the context of the size of the collapse in the construction sector, is a marathon and not a sprint.  I hope these measures will retain jobs and begin to get the economy moving again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to answering the key points I have included in the amendment through parliamentary questions or committee discussions, if the committee so wishes.  Maybe in future we should insert such a commitment in writing in legislation such as this to provide a guarantee that changes will be reviewed, even if only on a once-off basis rather than continuously &mdash; not every Act needs to be reviewed every year.  I welcome this.  If we had had a longer time to prepare for Committee Stage we could have come up with a wording that would have been acceptable to the Minister for inclusion in the Bill.  As I am conscious of the time and the big issues that need to be discussed in the next few sections, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

	<P>N&iacute;lim chun m&oacute;r&aacute;n ama a chaitheamh ar seo.</P>
        <P>Why is the Minister bothering to introduce a section to discontinue the dependent parent pension scheme for new applicants?  I know there are only a small number of people availing of this scheme, but in some cases it was the most suitable remedy for people who found themselves in the tragic situation of losing a son or daughter to an occupational disease or for other work-related reasons.  Why remove this allowance which may be of use to people who find themselves in such difficult circumstances?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The dependent parent&rsquo;s pension scheme is payable to the parent of a person who dies as a result of an occupational accident, provided that the parent has been wholly or mainly maintained by the deceased person.  There are only a small number of cases of this payment.  After a long and exhaustive search by the Department, the total number of such payments being made came to five.  There is no record of an application for this pension <Col N="265"/>being made since 1987.  Since then other schemes have emerged which are available to people in such circumstances.</P>
        <P>Given the development of the various supports available under the social welfare system over the years, it is unlikely that a parent who may have qualified as being a dependant under the scheme when it was originally introduced in 1967 would not be eligible in their own right for some other form of social welfare support.  In the circumstances, the scheme is considered no longer relevant in the current social welfare package of schemes.  Taking into account the very small number of people claiming the pension and the alternative income support schemes provided by the Department, it is considered reasonable to discontinue the scheme.  The dependent parent&rsquo;s pension will continue to be paid to existing recipients for the duration of their claim.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 6, dealing with the State pension transition, is the first of the sections dealing with the raising of the State pension age.  The Minister claims the logic to such a move is because people are living longer.  However, in the case of the State pension transition I question this logic.  The timeframe for the changes to the age also leave much to be desired.</P>
        <P>Over the next several years that this measure will be introduced, many people will finish employment when they reach 65 years of age.  As they will not be able to apply for the State pension until reaching 66 years, does the Minister believe they will have to go on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for a year?  Is there any move to assist employees and employers to renegotiate their employment contracts to reflect the new age for this pension?</P>
        <P>No account seems to have been taken of the problems that could arise with the introduction of this measure between 2014 and 2021.  When a person qualifies for the State pension transition, he or she can also apply for the fuel allowance.  From 2014, this will not be possible.  A person could be retired at 65 years of age but on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to make up the year until he or she qualified for the State pension.  This will exempt him or her from qualifying for the fuel allowance.  Losing an allowance of &euro;640 will have serious effects on older people&rsquo;s incomes.</P>
        <P>These measures rob people of their entitlements.  When they started work, they were told they were entitled to enjoy the fruits of their labour when they reached 65 years of age.  That includes the fruits of their contributions to the PRSI system.</P>
        <P>This is a retrograde step.  In other jurisdictions, there was a much longer lead-in time for such pension provision changes.  Our nearest neighbour introduced a similar change to the pension age at 66 years but it had a 17-year lead-in time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many groups have been surprised at how fast these changes to State pension provisions are being made and how the Government, particularly the Labour Party, has capitulated on them.  Last year, when raising the age was first proposed, the Minister&rsquo;s party colleague, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, then Labour Party spokesperson on social welfare, said it should be abandoned because it was entirely unreasonable.  SIPTU&rsquo;s leader, Mr. Jack O&rsquo;Connor, described it as an assault on State pension provision.  The Irish Senior Citizens Parliament opposes this measure, insisting any increase should be voluntary and promising to fight the Government&rsquo;s plans.  The Older and Bolder campaign favours flexibility with individual choice of staying on in employment being allowed.</P><Col N="266"/>
        <P>Age Action has warned of the potential poverty traps that may be created by these measures.  For example, losing the fuel allowance will mean a reduction of &euro;640 a year in an older person&rsquo;s income.  The Minister referred to the benefits of retrofitting houses to assist in tackling fuel poverty.  While such a programme may have some benefits, it does not address the shortfall that will be experienced by many older people.  Will all houses be retrofitted by 2014 when this measure comes into effect?</P>
        <P>Another benefit that will be affected by this measure is the household benefits package.  Again, this is a more substantial benefit, which is based on the contributions people in employment make during their working lives, and it would also be lost.  There would be no hope of those to whom I refer benefiting from either of these two benefits.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to reconsider what she is doing.  In particular, she should re-examine the position with regard to the date of 2014 which has been selected in respect of the discontinuation of the transition relating to the State pension.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>This proposal on the part of the Government to raise the pension age initially to 66 and then on to 67 and 68 is reactionary, regressive, crude, cruel and heartless.  It flies in the face of 150 years of history of the working class and the labour and trade union movements.  In times much harsher than those we are currently experiencing, brave men and women made enormous sacrifices in respect of combating the length of the working day, the working week, the working year and the working life.  The sacrifices these people made ensured that we would enjoy more civilised norms than those which applied to the eras in which they lived.</P>
        <P>According to the Government proposal contained in section 6, in a mere 30 months time &mdash; namely, January 2014 &mdash; approximately 11,000 people who are looking forward to transition retirement payments on the basis of having made their contributions and worked all their lives will not be able to retire at 65 and will instead be obliged to remain in work for another full year until they reach the age of 66.  Further provision is made to increase the age to 67 and 68 and this could affect up to 50,000 people in the future.</P>
        <P>We must ask who will be affected by these measures.  Primarily, it will be low-paid workers.  Those who are on private pensions will not be in the same position.  Naturally, the bankers and other very wealthy individuals who have massive pension funds will not be affected at all.  Those in the national media state that their role is to inform.  In that context, I do not know why they have not informed the people with regard to these changes.  In my view, those changes represent the thin end of the wedge and constitute an extremely serious development.</P>
        <P>What is proposed would be a massive imposition and hardship on workers in difficult employments.  Will construction workers, for example, be expected to remain on building sites until they reach the age of 68?  What will be the position with regard to women who clean industrial and other facilities in order to make ends meet?  What is the Government&rsquo;s stance in respect of such people?</P>
        <P>Until recently and for a number of good reasons the trend was to move in the opposite direction and try to reduce the retirement age for those who wished to retire.  I am very strongly in favour of any worker who wants to remain in employment past retirement age being allowed to do so.  However, I have no difficulty with those who might wish to leave paid employment and lead a different type of life where they might pursue leisure or other unpaid interests.  I am of the view that provision should be made for such people.</P>
        <P>Young people are intimately affected by what is proposed here.  There has been a massive reaction to similar proposals throughout Europe.  In France, Spain and other countries there <Col N="267"/>have been huge mobilisations of workers both young and old.  Young people understand that if their older counterparts do not vacate their jobs, then there will be fewer jobs for them.  This is particularly relevant in the context of the current and disastrous economic circumstances that obtain.</P>
        <P>The proposal before the House is regressive and reactionary in nature.  In addition, people are unaware of what is involved and it would not, therefore, be democratic to pursue this proposal.  People in Blanchardstown, Clonmel, Blackpool, etc., are not aware of what is intended.  They should be made so aware and this matter should be debated.  In such circumstances, I ask the Minister to withdraw the proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I also request that the Minister remove section 6, which will end, from 2014, the transition year between the ages of 65 and 66 during which the State pension becomes available and enters into effect.  This is an extremely regressive step and it is one of the meanest cuts contained in the legislation.  As I recall, it was first recommended in Colm McCarthy&rsquo;s an bord snip nua report.  I quoted Mr. McCarthy earlier in the debate but the Minister may have misheard what I said.  In the <i>Irish Examiner</i> of 7 July 2009, Mr. McCarthy stated: &ldquo;If people used to snuff it at 70 and they&rsquo;ve now decided to snuff it at 80, or 85 or 90, then something&rsquo;s got to give.&rdquo;  In my view, this approach informed Mr. McCarthy&rsquo;s intervention via an bord snip nua.  As far as he is concerned, as people grow older they should be obliged to work for longer.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree with or share Mr. McCarthy&rsquo;s views?  If she does not share them, why is she proceeding with the proposals contained in section 6?  The Study of Health and Retirement in Europe, SHARE, does a great deal of research in respect of OECD statistics, benefits, etc.  In 2008 it made the point that, as a percentage of GDP, old age benefits in Ireland are only 2.5%.  The figure for the US is double that and for Australia it is five times greater.  We are way behind in the context of old age benefits expressed as a percentage of GDP.</P>
        <P>The average age of retirement among OECD countries is 65 to 66 years.  As Deputy Higgins stated, the recent trend was to try to reduce this.  As we move towards the 2050s, people who are employed in sectors where back-breaking or labour intensive work is involved will be obliged to work for longer.  I refer to those who load materials onto trucks, nurses and nurses aides who work in hospitals and so on.  People want an end to such work rather than seeing those who engage in it being obliged to remain in employment for an additional two to three years as they approach retirement.  Anybody who reaches the age of 49 this year faces the prospect of working for an additional three years from 2028 onwards.</P>
        <P>As already stated, what is proposed is extremely regressive.  It is unbelievable that a Labour Minister is sponsoring this proposal.  I ask the Minister to withdraw the section because there is no basis for it.  As Deputy Higgins and other speakers stated, people across the world are fighting to retain current retirement ages and to improve their conditions rather than extending the period during which they will be expected to work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I differ from previous speakers in that I understand the methodology of this proposal.  I recognise the improvements in working and living conditions, the various support systems of which workers can avail and the increased longevity of the population in the last number of years.  However, like Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, I seek clarification on one point.  Those who are contracted to work until 65 years will be caught in a gap in the intervening period until they qualify for the old age pension and will have to go on jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  Can the Minister assure the House, and those people, that all allowances applicable to those who now qualify for pension at 65 will be available to people aged 65 who must go onto job seeker&rsquo;s benefit?  That is the assurance we want.  I have no problem supporting the thrust of what the Minister is saying.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="268"/>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to reiterate some of the points already made.  I take the Minister&rsquo;s point about people living longer, being healthier and wanting to work beyond the current pension age.  We all agree that someone who wants to work, is able to work and has a contribution to make should be free to do so.  However, there are worlds of difference between types of employment.  I saw my late father continuing as a construction worker in his early 60s when it was not viable for him.  However, he was neither sick nor entitled to draw a pension.  I saw the impact of a lifetime of manual work and the toll it takes on someone&rsquo;s body.  There is a clear distinction between different kinds of work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Has the Minister looked at this issue in a holistic way?  A large number of people are unemployed.  Younger people usually have greater commitments, such as mortgages, which tend to be almost paid off when one reaches retirement age.  Retraining initiatives designed to keep people from becoming long-term unemployed cost money.  Jobseekers benefits for people aged 66 will cost money.  It would be far better to have people retiring from jobs at 65 and to have those jobs coming back to people who are at an earlier stage in their work life where financial commitments are higher.  The obligations on the State, in terms of supports for mortgage or retraining would be lower.  A holistic approach is needed for this.</P>
        <P>This is a wrong decision.  It is a blunt instrument, in that it places an obligation.  I support people who want to work beyond 65 years.  I would be bored silly if I did not work and would not want someone to tell me I had to finish work at 65. Many people are like me.  However, this is a very retrograde decision.  It is blunt and places an obligation.  It does not look at working life as a whole and may end up costing the State money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">These are important policy changes.  Deputy Murphy has just referred to them.  In this country, happily, more people are living to pension age and longer in retirement.  The period for which an average pension will be paid will be greater than at present.  That is a happy fact for Irish people and for older people.  However, it has implications for how we structure pensions.  It has significant cost implications for the future of State pension provision.  For this reason, the discussions on this matter started in 2007 and were published in the national pensions framework in March 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Even before the economic crash people were thinking about the sustainability of pension liability in Ireland.  We all contribute to each other&rsquo;s State pensions through the tax and PRSI we pay during our working lives.  The State must be able to ensure that it can continue to sustain pension payments and balance adequacy and affordability.  A number of fundamental principles need to be emphasised, specifically that people need to participate in the workforce for longer and to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.  We must provide for dignity for people and adequacy of payment in retirement.  That is why facilitating an older working age was raised in a number of documents over the years during the height of the Celtic tiger period, including the Green Paper on pensions that was published in 2007.  The precise details for which we are now legislating were announced when the national pensions framework was published in March 2010.</P>
        <P>This is not just an issue for Ireland.  About half of OECD countries are in the process of increasing pension ages or have already legislated for future increases.  However, the OECD has noted that in most cases the projected increase in life expectancy is such that it will outstrip prospective pension age increases.  Recently, the OECD published country specific recommendations by the EU Commission that draw attention to the need for many EU countries to increase their retirement age.</P>
        <P>That fundamental increase arises from demographic changes.  The changes happened at the same time as this enormous crisis in the Irish economy and in the economies of other European <Col N="269"/>and non-European OECD member countries.  People are living longer.  By 2050, there will be fewer than two people of working age per older person, compared to six people of working age today.  This is a bonus of improvements in health and living conditions and is to be welcomed.  However, there are significant associated pension costs for the State.  The number of older people is increasing.  At present, 11% of the population is over 65 and we expect this to increase to between 22% and 26% between 2050 and 2060.  The percentage of older people will more than double.</P>
        <P>In contrast, over the same period the proportion of the population who are of working age is expected to decline from approximately 68% to 58%.  Life expectancy is increasing.  In the mid-1990s, life expectancy for men was 73 years and for women it was 78.5 years.  For men and women born in 2041, it will be 86.5 years and 88.3 years respectively.  State expenditure on pensions will increase from 5.5% of GDP in 2008 to almost 15% by 2050.</P>
        <P>With regard to the statistics quoted by Deputy Collins, the reason some countries spend a higher percentage of their GDP on pensions is that they have a higher level of older people in their populations.  At the moment we are blessed that we have a relatively younger population compared with many other countries, but the demographics are changing.  The Irish population is ageing, not at a rate that is as fast as in some European countries, but it is still increasing.  We need to take account of that issue and address it.</P>
        <P>Deputy Higgins suggested this was not an issue for people with private pensions or public sector pensions.  There are more than 100,000 workers in defined benefit schemes and not all of them are the kinds of well-off people he seems to think they are.  They include people who work on the production line in Cadbury and in places like Irish Distillers and Guinness.  Quite ordinary working people are in pension schemes.  The fortunes of those pension schemes have been heavily affected by the various collapses and calamities that have happened in the international markets given how those pensions are invested.  While that is an issue for another day, I would not like Deputy Higgins to imply that everything in the garden is rosy for people with private pensions.  As Minister dealing with social welfare, I only wish that was so.  I have enormous concerns for the sustainability of private pension schemes, but that is not what we are discussing now.</P>
        <P>We need to ensure that State support for pensions is equitable and sustainable and, therefore, as provided for in this legislation and as discussed for more than ten years in this House and other seminars and discussions, White Papers, pension frameworks and so on, the State pension age will be standardised at 66 in 2014.  It will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</P>
        <P>References were made to the agreement with the IMF, EU and ECB.  This commitment, which was given by the Government before the IMF came into this country and published in a pensions framework in March 2010, had nothing, as such, to do with the IMF deal.  It is to do with the demographic changes in our population.  However, given that this arrangement had been outlined by the previous Government in March 2010, it was an element included in the IMF programme for Ireland and it is a commitment entered into by the Government at the time of bringing the IMF into this country.  One of the critical objectives for the Government and certainly for me as a politician is to see the country return to financial sovereignty and full financial independence.  This is one of the elements included in the programme.  We should proceed with this reform even though I accept it is a reform many people in this House find difficult.</P>
        <P>The expenditure in 2010 on pensions for older people was just under &euro;6 billion &mdash; a very extensive commitment by the State which is paid for by people of working age and in work when they contribute their taxes and PRSI.  Owing to the change in demographics, we need a series of reforms on pension age.  These reforms have been discussed at length for almost a <Col N="270"/>decade.  I accept, as Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, that not many people were aware of this but it has been discussed at great length and all of the parties with an interest in these issues have been consulted and invited to be involved in the discussions.</P>
        <P>People who are no longer in work during the transition year will be in position to apply for a social welfare payment and will qualify under the normal qualification requirements for the payment.  I accept what Deputy Catherine Murphy said and I made reference to it earlier.  I have family members who never wanted to retire even though they worked in building and construction.  We had to try to persuade them to stop working in it because there are people who genuinely enjoy working.  Many people who worked on jobs initiatives in community centres find it heartbreaking at times that they have to retire at 65 when they would like to stay on for another year or more.  This particularly applies to widows or widowers.  During the recent general election campaign I encountered such people in my constituency.  Deputy Higgins mentioned Blanchardstown and I am sure during the campaign he met people who wanted to stay on.  I certainly received a significant number of representations from people who wanted to remain in schemes such as the jobs initiative.  Working patterns and life patterns are changing.  For the most part people are in better health and are more engaged and interested in remaining active as organisations such as Older and Bolder constantly explain.  They project a positive image of older people being much more active than might have been the case ten or 20 years ago for people in the same age category, which is all positive.</P>
        <P>Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and Cowen mentioned the issue of fuel allowances.  By the time these changes happen, the fuel poverty advisory group will have reported and, as I said earlier when answering parliamentary questions, we will seriously consider insulating the homes of older people &mdash; and those of everybody else &mdash; in order to reduce the requirements for expenditure on fuel.  As part of the jobs initiative, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has introduced a targeted scheme to improve the quality of insulation in homes, which is particularly important in old local authority estates.  The Minister is anxious that local authority accommodation, particularly houses built in the 1970s and 1980s, should be insulated to a much higher standard.  Many people who bought their houses have been doing that themselves, but in many estates houses, which are still being rented by the original tenants, leave much to be desired in terms of quality of windows and general insulation.  I hope that by the time these changes come through we will see a significant improvement in the insulation of houses and particularly those of older people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not heard anything to dissuade my opposition to the changes proposed in the section.  People who normally at 65 would receive the State transition pension will now be forced to receive jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or a supplementary welfare allowance depending on their circumstances.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The difference between what they would receive weekly if in receipt of a State transition pension and what they would receive weekly if in receipt of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is &euro;42.  That is a substantial weekly drop.  The State transition pension is &euro;230 and the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is &euro;188.  In addition, there is a fuel allowance of &euro;20 for 32 weeks.  Only a small number of people aged 65 would be entitled to the household benefits package, which amounts to another &euro;20 approximately.  This is a substantial amount of money taken from the pocket of people who have planned their lives based on a retirement age of 65 or those bound by a contract that precludes them from working beyond the age of 65.  There is quite a number in the latter category.  People whose contracts are to expire at the age of 65 will be thrown onto the dole queues.</P>
        <P>To avail of the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance, one must be seeking work actively.  Therefore, 65 year olds must seek work actively for a year.  Anyone who is 56 at present and who is <Col N="271"/>bound by a contract stipulating he must finish work at 65 will end up on the dole for two years but still will not qualify for the fuel allowance.  Pensioners are being affected substantially.</P>
        <P>It is not a question of the age profile because it is virtually impossible to make 50-year predictions on the pensioner-worker ratio and the State&rsquo;s ability to afford pensions.  There are too many volatile factors to be considered in that regard, including the levels of employment and migration, birth trends and economic growth.  The Minister and others have thrown out predictions based on these.  Having said that, it is important to be prudent.  If the State cannot afford to pay pensions it promised to pay, it should deal with this through the taxation system rather than by continually expanding the age of retirement.  If in a number of years a study concludes women are living until 89 or 90 years on average, must we continually extend the working age?  One must consider the effect on people in particular types of employment, especially more manual employment.  Irrespective of life expectancy, it must be borne in mind that people become more fragile as they get older.  Therefore, their ability to carry out quite demanding manual tasks reduces.  While people are managing to live longer, this does not necessarily mean they are living longer in good health.  I am thankful that medical developments worldwide are allowing people to live longer, but sometimes they are living longer in illness.  This needs to be borne in mind.</P>
        <P>There has been a debate on the pension framework.  It is sometimes very difficult to get those who will be directly affected to take a proper interest.  We noticed this when trying to encourage people to take greater heed of their future pension requirements.  We have not had a proper debate on how to change the system to allow people to work beyond the compulsory retirement age, if they choose to do so.  Most of the commentary I have read suggests people want to work longer if they feel well enough at the time in question.  Many others want to enjoy the fruits of their labour and have time to enjoy their time left.  If we start to change the age at which people will be entitled to the pension, they will be forced into fuel poverty, as I mentioned.  More people will be put into positions that we noted when canvassing in February.  I presume the Minister, as did I, saw quite a number of elderly people sitting in the dark, afraid to switch on the light because they could not afford their bills.  There are many people living in extreme poverty and many of those are older people.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposals on insulation and the fact the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, is to examine local authorities.  It is a living disgrace that the State, through local authorities, is providing people with substandard accommodation.  It has always been doing so.  Many senior citizens&rsquo; complexes that were due for demolition have not been demolished.  People are living in damp bedsits that are virtually impossible to heat because they have single-glazed windows.  The one call I got during a recent break was from a constituent inquiring about a Dublin City Council grant to upgrade his single-glazed windows.  The grant is not available.  Although people are trying to improve the stock of the local authority, rather than their own houses, they cannot avail of any grants.  This is ridiculous.  We need to fix the problems that exist without creating more.</P>
        <P>What is being proposed is a retrograde step; other mechanisms could have been considered.  We must remember that the jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are below the poverty line.  Therefore, anybody voting for this Bill is voting to condemn swathes of older people to poverty from the age of 65, and from the age of 66 in future.</P>
        <P>There are a number of related issues that must be considered.  Again, a short period applies.  From 2012, the number of contributions required to qualify for the contributory pension is to double.  Many are aware of this.  Some people have not been able to make the necessary contributions and will not be able to do so because they are to finish work at 65.  They will not receive a contributory pension but a non-contributory pension.  This is an added kick to them.</P><Col N="272"/>
        <P>I have tried my best to highlight to various interest groups the issues that arise.  As soon as I got a copy of this Bill and the explanatory memorandum, I circulated them to various groups who raised with me the issue of pensions.  The media have been very quiet on pensions, which is regrettable.  If they had not been, we might have had a more informed public debate and there might have been a better debate in the House.  Saying so is not a slight on the Members present but I find it very strange that, of the 166 Members, only a handful are discussing the fact that, through the raising of the pension eligibility age, pensions are to be cut by the equivalent of 16%.  That, in itself, is scandalous.</P>
        <P>Members stated during Question Time that there were different responses in other countries.  In France there was absolute mayhem and in Slovenia and other countries there were referenda.  When a substantial change was being made, there was a public debate in that the public as a whole was involved rather than just key interested parties.</P>
        <P>It is a pity we have not had that debate or the opportunity to invite representatives of pensioners, the trade union movement and others to come before a committee to make presentations.</P>
        <P>Another issue we have not mentioned to date is the fact that if we extend the pension age to 66, 67 and then 68 we are keeping people in employment for an additional three years.  That means there will be fewer jobs at the other end of the age scale because people will remain in jobs that would otherwise become available for young and perhaps not so young unemployed people.  That has not been a factor in the debate to date.  This is a step towards preventing employment opportunities for young people who could then pay their contributions to the pensions of those people who would retire at age 65 in this instance but 66 and 67 thereafter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister does not persuade with her arguments.  I said earlier that the idea of anybody wishing to stay on working should be embraced.  A certain cohort of people take that option and it is the best for them but it should be voluntary at the age when people should have a free decision on whether they wish to continue to work in paid employment or retire and take a pension.  In the past year approximately 11,000 people would have gone on to transition payments.  That was their decision but this is a slap in the face to the approximately 11,000 people who will be denied that choice when they reach the age of 65 beginning in January 2014.</P>
        <P>The argument is used throughout the European Union and repeated by the Minister that people living longer means that workers should work longer, in other words, work until they drop.  The reality is that if this brutal measure, projecting forward to when people would have to work until they were 67 or 68, were enacted and continued to be enacted, thousands of people will die before they reach the retirement age of 68.  That is a brutalisation of society by any standards.  It is a perverse policy.</P>
        <P>A pension is a portion of the wealth created in society that is committed to people who have finished their working lives.  This is the crux of the problem.  Is society capable of creating sufficient wealth to meet the needs of everybody?  That could be the case if production was organised for the benefit of society and if the distribution of that wealth was just and equal.  However, therein lies the problem with European capitalism currently and the fact that tens of millions of workers in Europe are either unemployed or underemployed and are denied an opportunity of creating the wealth that could go to creating a better society, including keeping people in a happy and comfortable position in retirement.</P>
        <P>Even in this country it relates to the way the wealth is distributed.  There is huge inequality in wealth distribution in our society which this Government is reinforcing rather than tackling. <Col N="273"/> It is reinforcing it further by bringing in reactionary and regressive measures such as the one before the House. We on the left challenge that approach.</P>
        <P>On a broader global scale, tragically, tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of people are hungry and living in poverty not because our globe could not produce enough to satisfy the genuine needs of everybody but because of the way production and distribution are organised by global capitalism.  That is the issue and therefore I do not accept the argument being made in this instance.</P>
        <P>The other issue to which the Minister referred also concerns a lesser number of workers having to create the wealth, taxes etc., for an increasing number of pensioners.  That relates to the argument made earlier.  Lesser numbers of workers with technique, technology and know-how could create far more wealth if the structures were changed.</P>
        <P>I remember, as might the Minister because we are about the same age, that in the 1960s and the early 1970s there were regular features and articles in the media that the big question facing workers in future decades was what to do with all the leisure time they will have because of the increase in the use of technology and technique just coming in at that time.  It was a good point to discuss at the time but the reality is that workers are under more pressure than ever because technology and so on have been manipulated to ensure a maldistribution of the extra wealth created and a prevention of the amount of wealth that could be created if it was released and used for the benefit of society rather than for the private profit diktats of the current system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s argument, with regard to this country in particular, about the demographic factors forcing this measure upon the Government does not hold.  The number of births and the birth rate has gone up considerably in the past 20 years or more.  For example, in 1990, according to the Central Statistics Office, there were 53,000 births here.  In 2007 that figure had increased by 18,000 to 71,000.  People did live longer but only 3,000 people lived longer in 2007; there were 3,000 fewer deaths.  In 1991, there were 52,700 births and by 2008 that figure had increased to 75,000, an increase of more than 23,000.  Similarly, I could compare 1992 with the last year for which I have figures, which is 2009 when there were nearly 75,000 births.  There has been a substantial increase, therefore.</P>
        <P>Tragically, a number of those have been forced out of this country because of the disastrous crisis.  There is also the factor that the youth who should and could be creating the wealth to sustain pensioners in a reasonable standard of living have no future here.  In view of these factors the argument for this country made by the Minister does stand up to scrutiny.  The reality is that our pensioners, like our youth and workers, are being sacrificed to the diktats of the European financial markets, the EU, the IMF and the European Central Bank.  The interests of the private bankers and speculators of Europe will be protected and their profits may not be encroached upon at the expense of our people, including those people arriving at an age in their lives when they should be able to make a decision that they want to finish their working life of paid employment and go on to a period of leisure.  They are being denied that at the behest of this Government, carrying on the reactionary policies of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party before them, at the diktats of the European financial markets.  That is the reality.  The Minister is putting the interests of the sharks and vampire banks in the European financial markets before the interests of our people, and sacrificing the interests of our people and the welfare of those of advancing years to protect these financial interests.  That is shameful and it is reactionary.</P>
        <P>Let us take the tens of billions of euro that will be committed to paying off the gambling debts of the European speculators and contrast that with the amounts necessary to sustain our pensions at 65, or even to reduce that age.  We can see that the Government has shamefully <Col N="274"/>decided to defend these massive financial gamblers at the expense of our people who are growing old.  The Minister has not addressed the human dimension of this.  I hope that by 2021 or 2028 we will have been able to change society substantially from the diseased system that we have at the moment, to a system where we can unlock the wealth and the means of creating wealth, and allow those in a position to create wealth to work instead of being in enforced idleness.  Therefore, I hope that these reactionary measures will be reversed, assuming they are passed.</P>
        <P>What about the human dimension to this?  Think about the idea of keeping a man on construction sites until he is 68 years of age.  Anyone who worked on construction sites &mdash; even some of the Deputies who came from more privileged backgrounds did so in their student days &mdash; knows how tough and wearing it is.  The idea that a man should have to do this every day in the rigours of winter is quite shameful.  Women in our constituency and in other constituencies have to tear themselves from their beds at four or five o&rsquo;clock in the morning to go into factories or offices and clean them.  They might be looking forward to going onto a State pension, but they are now condemned to do it until they are 68.  That is quite shameful.  Even as a statement of humanity, this Government should have said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this particular measure from the bureaucrats in the EU and the IMF.  It is reactionary and shameful from every point of view and I am absolutely opposed to it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing the Minister has said about this Bill has convinced me not to oppose it.  It is a mean cut, particularly in section 6.</P>
        <P>I do not understand the logic of this.  The Minister has stated that the debate started in 2008, and was based on the fact that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It started between 1994 and 1997, when we brought in a homemaker&rsquo;s credits so that women who stayed at home caring got recognition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>So in 1994 we were talking about raising the pension age to 68.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I will go through this in a minute.  It has been a debate in Irish society for almost 20 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The point is that it is being discussed now and there has not been any real debate, because I have not heard much about it in the past 20 years.  The Minister specifically stated that the debate began in earnest in 2008 under the last Government, under advice from those economists linked into the Celtic tiger idea and the trade unions linked into partnership.  The debate started at a time when there was plenty of employment.  If it began at a time of plenty employment while there was still a serious problem financing our pensions, then this is not adequate on that basis.  We should be extending the retirement age another five or six years, given the current state of the economy.  If the Government, economists and trade union officials knew that we were facing into a devastating recession, then this is just about making people work longer and we will be coming back to this in five years because we will not have the resources to pay pensions again.  There is a general feeling among people that we will not be out of this recession for at least ten or 15 years, so that is one reason I object to this measure.  It should be taken out of the Bill.</P>
        <P>If we had a society that was based on democratic socialism and on the idea of putting profits back into what is needed, our pensions could be retained.  Instead, we are facing the outcome of this Bill.  If the raising of the retirement age was not mandatory, then there would be a different debate in the D&aacute;il.  The fact that it is mandatory is the issue.  I know plenty of people in my old job in An Post who have voluntarily stayed on longer or who came back to work, <Col N="275"/>but the majority of men and women in An Post want to get out when they are 65 and earlier.  We cannot have a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach to this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the Minister&rsquo;s answer in respect of the transition period to 2014 for the fuel allowance, she stated that she hoped that the retrofit programme announced in the jobs initiative would have borne fruit and that very few people would need to avail of it.  Has she considered the situation with local authorities?  They have schemes for housing adaptation grants and housing aid for the elderly and they have often proved to be very successful, but they are now under great strain.  Waiting lists of two to three years are now the norm across the country.  In times when local authorities could raise funds through development charges and so on, they had funds which would be matched by the Government at a multiple of three to four.  That is no longer the case and it is now being said that local authorities may raise funds by means of utility charges, water charges and so on.  The amount they might raise from these charges might not compare favourably with the moneys raised previously to provide those housing grants.  Would it not be more practicable for funding from the jobs initiative to be put towards that area?  These charges had a double edged return, because they were benefiting the construction industry and so on and the housing adaptation grants would have included retrofitting anyway.  She should consider this in light the of the statement by the Minister for Finance that she is on track and that there may be funding available in the 2012 budget for increased provision in that area.</P>
        <P>To get back to the transitional period in 2014, especially for those contracted to work to 65 years of age, can the Minister give a commitment &mdash; I do not expect her to give it today &mdash; they will receive the same allowances, initiatives or State supports available to those who currently reach pension age at 66?  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, to think of somebody seeking the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance at 65 years of age is unfortunate given that he or she will have worked indoors or outdoors all his or her life.</P>
        <P>Contrary to what has been said by others, I recognise that while everything is not fantastic, there have been huge improvements in working conditions, support systems and living conditions.  People are living longer as demographics etc indicate.  I support the theory of increasing the pension age.  The Minister should not get me wrong in that regard but I want to ensure that now the decision is being taken, provision is made for those caught in the transitional period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This has been debated over the past 15 to 20 years and we are now at the stage where it will come into effect.  Those who are contracted to the age of 65 will be caught in the transitional period.  Will the Minister give a commitment, if not today, in the near future, that all allowances, supports and payments available to those who currently reach retirement age at 66 will apply to those who reach retirement age at 65 years of age in the transitional period, especially in 2014?  I do not expect the same commitment to be given to people in 2021, 2028 etc.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnHalligan"><NameTxt>Deputy John Halligan</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke earlier on this issue of forcing people to work later in life and I do not want to go over what I said in regard to farm workers, labourers and so on.  Interestingly, I spoke to someone from Waterford on the telephone about an hour ago, a supporter of mine who works in a hotel.  The lady has worked in the hotel for 32 years.  She is 60 years of age and had hoped to retire in the past number of years but her husband was made unemployed.  Her job description is to clean so many rooms.  As the Minister may know, this is how hotels work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I worked in hotels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnHalligan"><NameTxt>Deputy John Halligan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I know.  The Minister will know how difficult and stressful it can be.  In the Celtic tiger years, apparently all the hotels were full and the staff had to work the longest <Col N="276"/>hours and the hardest.  This lady said she has to clean so many rooms in her eight or ten hour shift.  She may work Monday to Friday or Tuesday to Sunday.  She described the work as back-breaking and that when she goes home, she is not in a position to do much more cleaning or otherwise because of how hard this work is.  I do not believe the Minister has grasped that many people do not realise this change is about to happen.  This lady was absolutely appalled to think she will have to work for another year doing this type of work.  That is the point I made earlier.</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister has been dealt a bad hand &mdash; I used that expression on a number of occasions &mdash; by the crowd in front of me and that we must find money somewhere.  The Labour Party election manifesto referred to making people&rsquo;s quality of life better, dignity in living and a better way forward.  I congratulated the Minister when she was in opposition on how she stood up for those less well off in society.  I appeal to her to take into consideration this lady about whom I spoke, labourers on building sites about whom Deputy Higgins spoke and small farmers who go out at 5 a.m. and do back-breaking work until sunset.  Will she take into consideration the many thousands of these people?  She cannot seriously say these people want to work one extra hour, not to mention one extra year.</P>
        <P>I do not know how the system works in the D&aacute;il because I am new to it but surely the Minister who is a member of the Labour Party and who supports quality of life, dignity in living and a better way forward for working people does not believe this is a better way forward for the many thousands of people who will have to work these crucifying hours and who do not want to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed.  It is important to say that from the early 1990s, there has been a continuous debate about how to structure pensions so everybody at work, and not only particularly wealthy people, who contribute through tax and social insurance pay for their own pensions and those of others when they come to retire.  Happily, people are living longer, which is a great advance, but it means we must structure pensions in a way that it is possible to pay for them within a reasonable framework.</P>
        <P>I draw Deputies&rsquo; attention to something positive that has developed but which is a cost for which we, as a society, must account.  Back in 1994, when I worked in this Department, one of the improvements for which I and people in other political parties were responsible was the introduction of the notion of homemaker&rsquo;s credits so people who had to, and wanted to, spend time at home caring for children under 12 years of age or for people with a disability would not be ruled out of having pension coverage.  We have built up a system of entitlements to credits, and rightly so.  That has been ongoing since 1994 and has been revamped and improved at different points over the years.</P>
        <P>In 1997 legislation was passed, to which Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred, on the structure of contributions which is due to take effect in the next few years and which will mean that ultimately over a long period of time we will move to looking at the total contributions somebody makes over his or her working life in order to determine the kind of pension he or she will get.</P>
        <P>These changes in the pension system have been ongoing for the past 20 years and all parties and people of no political party in this House have been involved at different times in these discussions.  Specifically, changes in regard to pension age and demographics have been discussed in Green Papers, White Papers and frameworks during the 2000s.  All of the parties interested and all the groups working with older people have been very involved in these discussions.  As I said earlier, the submissions made can be viewed on the national pensions framework website.  There was open and detailed discussion.</P><Col N="277"/>
        <P>The core point is that we must find a way where the kind of pension structure we want to create is sustainable and which people in work must contribute to and pay for.  People who are not in work because, for instance, they are looking after young children or people with a disability must get due recognition in the pension framework and system for the contributions they make to society.  However, there is an increase in the number of people who are ageing.  It is a happy position for Ireland that people are living longer and that they are healthier when they are older.  Of course, some people face serious and disabling illnesses, often from a very young stage in life, and there are structures within the social welfare system to take account of that.  Happily, however, the majority of older people are living for longer and are living more active and healthy lives.</P>
        <P>There are people who have specific difficulties arising from specific occupations.  Deputy Halligan referred to people in manual occupations where the work is very hard, but Deputy Higgins also said that computers were making people&rsquo;s working lives harder.  I have worked in many different jobs in the course of my working life and my impression was that although automation and computers might not have led to a decrease in the amount of paper we are using, as was promised, in many industries I hope the Deputy will acknowledge that there has been significant improvement in conditions and safety at work, particularly due to the work of the labour and trade union movement.  There are many areas where that needs to be improved but there has been a significant improvement in working conditions in this country.  I do not believe computers have made working conditions harder.  In fact, they have contributed to automation and in many employments they have made people&rsquo;s working situation easier.</P>
        <P>The proposals in this Bill were signalled as far back as 2007 and were set out in detail by the previous Government in March 2010.  They were included by that Government in the framework for the IMF, the European Union and the ECB.  This is part of a change in pension provisions and requirements not just in this country but in other European countries.  One of the proposals, which I discussed earlier today with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, is that auto-enrolment for pensions will begin to be rolled out sometime in 2014, depending on economic conditions.  If we can get more people back to work, achieve growth in the economy and a better system of contribution by more people for pension provision at an earlier stage in their working lives, we will be able to rebalance pension provision in this country.  I very much hope we will be in a position to do that.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Higgins might be aware, it is proposed in the programme for Government that the pension position of politicians, for example, should be trimmed and reduced.  I did a huge amount of work on pension reliefs to set out in detail how much they cost this society in terms of tax expenditures, and these reliefs will be significantly reduced over the years of the programme for Government.  There is a commitment to limit those reliefs by a significant amount over the term of that programme.  A number of very significant reforms have been under way for some time and all of the different organisations involved with pensions and pension provisions have been able to discuss and make submissions on them.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cowen had a query about transitional entitlements such as fuel allowances and so forth.  Frankly, I cannot make a commitment about what the situation will be in 2014.  However, if there are special needs, people at present clearly have an entitlement to make applications under the social welfare system.  I will reiterate my view, nevertheless, about what is really important for many older people, particularly those in local authority housing.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh alluded to this and I strongly agree with much of what he said.  We have houses that were built in the 1970s and 1980s in which the system and standard of insulation is far below what is acceptable.  We could make people&rsquo;s lives more comfortable and healthier, particularly in the case of older people, if we had a system of retrofitting those houses.</P><Col N="278"/>
        <P>The ESB has announced a number of proposals whereby it will be possible to get insulation work carried out on older properties which could be paid for over a period of time through regular deductions.  Local authorities could also do that.  Many people would be happy to contribute an extra modest sum of money per week to get their windows done, for example.  My colleague, Deputy Willie Penrose, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing is extremely anxious to proceed on such issues.  In the context of the current economic crisis it is a challenge to get such programmes up and running but it is something that will ultimately probably do far more than direct fuel allowances for the comfort and lifestyle of many people, particularly older people who have been, and still are, tenants of local authority houses built in the early 1970s.  While bits and pieces of work have been carried out on those houses by various local authorities, in some cases windows have not been replaced or the replacement windows of ten or 15 years ago were only single glazed.  That is an important issue we must address.  I cannot give the Deputy an absolute commitment as to how these matters will stand in 2014.  I can only offer my own views based on my detailed knowledge.</P>
        <P>I believe I have addressed most of the issues raised by the Deputies.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 not moved.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity those amendments were ruled out of order.  I understand some of the logic behind the action but as I indicated earlier in the debate, it is difficult for Members of the Opposition in that we cannot make changes, even if progressive amendments are involved, because there would be a charge to the Exchequer.  Any change to a Bill dealing with social welfare or finance in general would incur a charge to the Exchequer.  Committee Stage exists in order to raise issues outside a specific amendment.  We can usually submit the amendment again on Report Stage and have it ruled out of order but on Committee Stage we can tease out some of the issues.</P>
        <P>One of the amendments deals with fuel allowance and the need to address the issue.  Amendment No. 7 sought to ensure that those people of pensionable age, even given the changes suggested, should enjoy fuel allowance.  In this case the relevant part of the Bill is section 6 but <Col N="280"/>the amendments were stuck into section 7 for some reason.  We are debating the issue out of context as a result.</P>
        <P>I will deal with section 7, which includes the substantial change to pension age.  It deviates from the current regime enjoyed by most people whereupon reaching 66, they receive a contributory or non-contributory pension, depending on contributions.  I mentioned earlier the change which will affect a number of people relating to contributions and I will return to that.  The Minister proposes to move the age at which people would be entitled to a non-contributory or contributory pension to 67 from 66 in 2021.  From 2028 the applicable age would be 68.</P>
        <P>Without going through all the points raised when we discussed the ending of the State transition pension, I remind the House that when the proposals were first made in this House in March 2010, the Minister&rsquo;s party colleague, Deputy Shortall, while accepting the principle of raising the age, condemned the timeframe imposed.  She called the timeframe unreasonable.  I have mentioned the positions of SIPTU, Older and Bolder, Age Action Ireland and others.  We must be very careful because people will be caught in a poverty trap and there is nothing in the legislation to deal with the problem.  If there is a contract that people finish work at 65 and are unemployed for a year or two, they will be able to enjoy some other type of social welfare allowance.  I mentioned people who would be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, if they had enough contributions, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or supplementary welfare allowances.</P>
        <P>I also mentioned that there is a substantial drop in comparison to previous allowances.  With people forced to go on jobseeker&rsquo;s payments instead of a contributory pension, there is currently a difference of &euro;42 per week.  I also mentioned the entitlement to fuel allowance, and this is where the change happens.  The household benefits package gives &euro;160 for a television licence, &euro;26 per month for a telephone allowance and other amounts for electricity, for example.  The package amounts to between &euro;800 and &euro;900 per year, which means that anybody who becomes unemployed at the age of 65 or 66 years will not receive these benefits.  If the Minister is intent on proceeding with these changes, she will need to provide a safety net for those who would otherwise have benefited for the remaining one or two years.  People who are older than 65 and living alone or with somebody who is dependent on social welfare should be entitled to fuel allowance.  We do not know whether these proposals will have been implemented by 2021 but we can give further consideration to fuel allowances at that stage.  As it stands, the fuel allowance is vital given our climate and the likelihood of continued increases in the price of fuels.</P>
        <P>There has been a substantial increase in complaints about age discrimination against people in their 50s and 60s who seek employment.  Deputy Higgins noted that last year 11,000 people qualified for the State transition pension and that number is likely to increase.  Under the rules that apply to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and benefit, recipients must be actively seeking work but what incentives are on offer for employers to hire those aged 50 or older?  A significant proportion of the people on the live register are those who have worked for 20 or 30 years and are now faced with the prospect of being unemployed for the remainder of their lives.  They will certainly find it difficult to compete against younger people who may have better computer skills.</P>
        <P>There are consequences when our social welfare code is changed, particularly when it involves the pension age, and we need to ensure nobody suffers unduly.  I am opposed to the change in the pension age in any event because it should not be mandatory to retire at the age of 66 and if an individual wishes to continue working, he or she should be allowed to work a decreasing number of hours.  At present, young people entering the workforce can only work a certain number of hours per week.  The same could apply at the tail end of an individual&rsquo;s working life to ensure employers do not force him or her to work a 70 or 80 hour week.  There <Col N="281"/>is nothing to prevent that at present, other than the retirement age cut-off.  A considerable number of people would love to continue contributing to the State through some type of paid employment.</P>
        <P>By increasing the pension age to 66, the Minister is removing the element of choice which would have made the Bill more palatable to many of the people who have written to me.  One of the e-mails I received was from a public servant who was concerned about the increase for pension entitlement, which he regarded as age discrimination.  He did not see why people have to work until the age of 65 when the retirement age in France and elsewhere is much lower.  As a public sector worker, he felt he had a contractual expectation regarding his retirement age and entitlements from his employer and the State.  Being forced to retire at the age of 65 appeared to him to contradict the rule preventing him from retiring until he turns 66.  He did not want to be forced out of his job at the age of 65, especially if he will also be denied his old age pension entitlements, and he found it insulting and demeaning to be faced with the prospect of relying on the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for a manufactured interim period between leaving work and reaching retirement age.</P>
        <P>This frustration might not be expressed as clearly as that of the pensioners who took to our streets but that may change once people realise the full impact, which equates to a 16% cut in pension entitlements.  It is a retrograde step because people of that age should be encouraged to enjoy themselves as much as possible.  They have contributed hugely and it is not as if they are getting a pension out of the goodness of the Government&rsquo;s heart.  A pension is essentially a pot that has been built up over the years by the worker&rsquo;s contributions.  If one gives a shopkeeper a sum of money, one is entitled to receive what one purchases.  In this case, pensioners are entitled to receive what they contributed over their working lives.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this section given that the poverty traps created elsewhere in this Bill are not being addressed.  The measure is also contrary to the promises made to those who have worked all their lives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Birth and death rates are the two primary figures used to arrive at population levels between census years.  We have been experiencing a baby boom which, judging by reports from maternity hospitals, appears to be continuing.  One issue that must also be factored in is emigration.  It is a younger cohort of people who emigrate.  We have had a history of emigration so there are things we can assume from previous waves of emigration in the 1950s and the 1980s.  After a certain number of years people do not come back.  Essentially, that has an impact on our demographics as well.  The reason people emigrated in the past is the reason they are emigrating now, namely, a lack of opportunity.  According to the Minister, demographics underlie the dynamic that is driving the Bill in terms of the ratio of people at work paying for people who are on a pension.  If a large number of people emigrate because we are not creating jobs and we are retaining people in the workforce for longer, we are not assisting that demographic.  I do not believe that has been factored into the Minister&rsquo;s calculations.</P>
        <P>There is a different cost for welfare for people at a younger age, for example, because there are child dependents and possibly mortgage interest supplement.  It is more expensive at that point.  I do not know whether calculations have been made of the average cost for particular age segments of the population which could provide information in that regard.  It would probably be less expensive to pay someone on a pension than it would be to pay welfare to someone in his or her 30s with a couple of kids and a mortgage.  That issue must be examined before an initiative such as this is considered.  My primary point is that it should be considered on a voluntary basis.</P><Col N="282"/>
        <P>I fully accept there is a pension time bomb.  A whole raft of things must be done to address that.  It is not exclusively about looking at the State pension but about how people contribute towards a pension over their lifetime.  It will be the next big explosion unless it is addressed in a comprehensive way.  This measure is a piecemeal way of approaching it, without considering other measures.  There is a world of difference between someone who is doing manual work and someone doing non-manual work when one reaches the age of retirement.  Sometimes the body just gives up before that.  It is all very well to say people are healthier and living longer but that does not apply universally.  I do not believe that has been taken into consideration.  Far too many questions have not been answered for us to take such a significant step as proposed in the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In a short vote a majority in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has disposed of the right of workers to opt for retirement after a lifetime of work at 65 years of age.  It is a shameful decision.  I regret that more of the Deputies who came into the Chamber to vote for that, and who will probably come back to vote again to increase the pension age to 67 and 68, did not remain to engage in the debate.  I would like to hear their rationale for supporting this reactionary and regressive measure.  In particular, I would like to hear the Deputies of the Labour Party, many of whom were supported by trade unions and received trade union subscriptions, and who have grotesquely betrayed the membership of the trade union movement whose funds supported them in the general election on 25 February.  The least the Labour Party Deputies could do is come to the Chamber and justify themselves before the working class here, and as members of a party set up by the great socialists, James Connolly and Jim Larkin, who struggled all their lives to improve the welfare of workers and against backsliding by employers and the system itself.  The Labour Party they set up is unrecognisable from the Labour Party today but some of those Deputies still claim the mantle of Connolly and Larkin.  They should come and explain themselves to the working class people.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not engage with the arguments in opposition to the demographic debate nor the idea that not enough wealth could be created if we continue to allow people to retire at 65 or 66, or earlier which should be the case.  As I pointed out, the demographics show that in each of the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 a total of 18,000, 23,000 and 23,000 more people were born than in the 1997 to 1999 period.  People live longer but the number living longer was only 3,000 in the three years of 2007, 2008 and 2009 compared to, for example, 1997, 1998 and 1999.  We have a potential 20,000 extra workers compared to only an extra 3,000 more people living longer.  Therefore, that is not an argument the Government can use, unless it has accommodated itself to the idea that the scandal of tens of thousands of young people being forced out of this country every year in enforced emigration will continue.  I presume the Government would say that its policies will reverse that trend.  The Minister must engage more acutely with us on the demographic argument as it applies to the Republic of Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister correctly mentioned the difficulties of private sector workers who have paid all their lives into private pension schemes.  One must ask why there is such a monumental crisis for so many workers, and why workers have seen their lifetime contributions, or expectations in any case, wiped out.  It is because we are dominated by a financial system that is more like a casino in Monte Carlo than a rational way of organising society.  It beggars belief that we believe we live in a civilised society when the contributions workers make from their sweat and lifelong contribution are rolling around on stock exchanges and financial markets as if they were on roulette tables.  What an absolutely crazy way to set out to allegedly provide for workers in their retirement.  Rather than going along with that system and taking it as read, which the establishment of the European Union and of this society does, it should be chal<Col N="283"/>lenged.  Instead of questioning the insanity, injustice and immorality of the system, what we have is hedge fund operators &mdash; faceless, unaccountable, unelected individuals in banks and boardrooms &mdash; gambling with funds.  Rather than allowing that to dictate the ability of workers to retire with a decent pension, let us call for and work towards a different kind of system.</P>
        <P>During the two years I spent in the European Parliament, I was lectured almost weekly by the President of the Commission and the president of this, that and the other &mdash; there are a lot of presidents in the European Union &mdash; about what a great zone of democracy it was.  This is the same establishment that routinely falls on its face in front of what I call the dictatorship of the financial markets.  The Government is no different.  It is time we called upon the media, especially publicly-owned media such as RTE, to challenge and question this.  Instead of listening to the question &ldquo;Will this satisfy the markets?&rdquo; being asked of economists and others on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; after every new Government cut or attack on workers, we should hear the question &ldquo;Who are these markets, and who elected them to this pre-eminent, god-like position in our society?&rdquo;  Working people&rsquo;s lives and their ability to retire at a decent age are now dependent on gamblers in the financial system in Europe.  This is the debate that should be engaged in.  We should not just roll over and accept the <i>status quo</i>, hitting the living standards, pensions and retirement age of workers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should consider what could be achieved by our society using technology if it was organised in a different way. Of course we all welcome labour-saving devices; unfortunately, however, many elements of modern technology are used by employers to increase pressure and stress in the working lives of employees.  However, released from the strictures of the financial markets, technology could be used to create &mdash; with the workers, who are the source of added value &mdash; sufficient wealth to allow our people to retire at a reasonable age and in reasonable comfort.</P>
        <P>Another point that has not been mentioned by the Minister is the effect, on a human level, of workers being forced to stay in employment until they are 68.  Life expectancy is not the same as fitness to work, particularly, as I mentioned earlier, in an arduous job.  It is one thing for a Teachta D&aacute;la to come in here and work until an advanced age, although I am not saying Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la do not work hard, but it is a different kind of employment.  What about a nurse or teacher, not to mention even more strenuous manual jobs?  The nurse of the future, according to the Government, will be forced to stay at the coalface for 47 years.  What about teachers?  Anybody who has stood in a classroom for decades, especially in a difficult area, knows exactly the toll it takes.  This is regressive and reactionary through and through.  The Government should acknowledge the regressive nature of this provision.  I call on the Minister to recognise it for the regressive and reactionary measure it is, from both an economic and a human point of view, and to withdraw it, even at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>This section has been debated already, but I would like to expand on a few points that were made earlier.  It amazes me that, as a social democrat, the Minister for Social Protection can put this to the D&aacute;il, when it is the essence of social democracy to advance the cause of workers rather than pulling back the advances made by them over the past number of years.  I am in the same generation as many people in the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery and elsewhere in this country &mdash; the generation of 18 year olds who started work in 1978 and 1979.  It is this generation onwards that will be affected by the extension in the age at which the State pension is paid.  They are the workers who will be looking at two or three extra years of work.  It is an absolute disgrace.  These are the people who lived through the recession of the 1980s, along with the period of high prices and high mortgage interest, and stayed here when many people were forced to emigrate.  Now we are back to the same situation.  What we are getting from the <Col N="284"/>Minister, as a so-called social democrat, is more of the same austerity measures imposed by the IMF and the EU.</P>
        <P>The Minister says this measure has been talked about for nearly 20 years, from 1994 onwards, but why is it so important, all of a sudden, that it be introduced?  It is because the IMF and the EU are telling us to do so.  There should be a decent debate in society.  All the discussion has taken place in smoky back rooms with the trade union leaders, partnership members and so on, in an entirely different situation from the one we are facing now.  The Minister did not address the point, although I raised it previously, that this was being discussed in 2008 when we were at the height of the Celtic tiger boom and before we hit the recession.  At that time we had 4% or 5% unemployment, but now, when we have a quarter of a million unemployed, the provision to extend the age of eligibility for the State pension to 68 is being introduced.  This is obviously the start of a process in which the age of eligibility will be raised again in two or three years&rsquo; time because the State, based on the arguments the Minister is putting forward, cannot sustain the State pension even for a reduced number of workers over the next few years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This provision is mandatory rather than voluntary.  There are plenty of people who do want to continue working; they enjoy the work they do.  It depends on the type of work one does, whether it is office work, more labour-intensive work, or night work.  Night workers include nurses in the public sector, and a vast range of cleaners.  All these people work terrible hours and will be dependent on the State pension, but their conditions are only going to get worse over the next few years.  Under the Croke Park agreement, they will be working longer and for less money, and their conditions will not have the same level of protection.  They will be expected to work extra hours and different types of hours.  The nature of work will change over the next number of years.  It is people in their late 40s and 50s who will be affected by this.  It is scandalous, and the Minister should be ashamed of herself.</P>
        <P>I support the points made by my colleagues.  This is not a Private Members&rsquo; motion tabled by the Opposition, which the Government might not be interested in debating.  It is an amendment to the Government&rsquo;s Bill.  It is an absolute scandal that the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues are not here supporting her on this Bill.  Their role in the D&aacute;il should be questioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am somewhat bemused and wondering if someone can set me straight on what benefits arise from raising the pension age.  Unless I have missed something, there is not an unlimited amount of work available with many young people looking for work.  I am also sure there will be many over 65s in the coming years who would love to retire which could provide work opportunities for our young people.  What savings will be made by raising the State pension age?  Those who may be forced to wait for their State pension entitlements could end up on some other social welfare benefit or forced to take a job, thus preventing a younger person from getting it.</P>
        <P>There would be some economic argument for this measure if there were unlimited amounts of work available.  Unless I am missing something, there is not.  On the day he was elected, the Taoiseach said up to 2,000 people were set to leave the country every week.  In other words, he was saying, &ldquo;I am only the Taoiseach.  What can I do about it? Up to 2,000 people will leave no matter what the Government does.&rdquo;  With 2,000 people leaving every week, the Government is now going to force people close to retirement to work longer.  Will the Minister for Social Protection explain the rationale behind this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh is correctly concerned about age discrimination.  This Bill reflects the reality that older people, in general, enjoy better health and greater longevity than they did in the past.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="285"/>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is obvious the Minister never worked as a blocklayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a blessing and bonus.  It is important that people are allowed to work longer, if they so wish.  The Government will examine providing for those who wish to postpone drawing down their State pension arrangements to enable them to receive an actuarially increased benefit.  This is the case with several pension benefits structures in Ireland and Europe.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s demographics, like those in other European countries, are changing.  For the past 20 years, there have been ongoing discussions in Leinster House about how to evolve and develop pension arrangements that will be affordable for the State and can be contributed to by people during their working lives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Luke Flanagan is correct that due to the financial crash, more people are out of work.  It is the Government&rsquo;s job to get people back to work, put the country on a sound economic footing and regain economic sovereignty and independence.  I regret the latter is under the temporary control of the IMF.  I proposed measures on the floor of the House which would have averted much of the crash.  I also identified the several billion euro spent by the former Government every year in tax breaks for those with enormous pension funds.  Members will recall the case of Mr. Fingleton, who ended his working life with a pension fund of &euro;20 million, most of which had been tax-breaked by the State.  Even those who dream of winning the national lottery would not dream of the figures in some of these pension funds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a complex reform which involves extending the notion of people&rsquo;s working lives and right to work, which many people want.  Deputy Joe Higgins will know from our constituency that the number of people who have been on schemes aimed at older people, such as job initiatives, have wanted to stay on for an extra year.  My colleague, the Minister without Portfolio, Deputy Brendan Howlin, will introduce measures to change entitlements to allow people to stay on working in the public service.</P>
        <P>Deputy Catherine Murphy raised the matter of emigration.  People will live abroad to gain experience, one that was popular during the Celtic tiger.  Many Members, including me, have lived abroad.  Even Deputy Luke Flanagan worked abroad at various times in his career.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I had no choice in the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Fortunately, we were able to return.  Working abroad can be a good and valuable experience.  Many people who have developed businesses and entrepreneurship have gained experience from living abroad.  While savings will be made if young people who were in receipt of social welfare benefits emigrate, it also means we are losing people who believe the country&rsquo;s outlook is not as positive as it once was.  The best way to ensure future pension provision, whether it is private, public or State schemes, is to bring back economic recovery and restore employment.  By doing so, we can then improve and increase benefits again.  However, we cannot do this unless we turn the economy around.  It must be remembered that the unfortunate consequences of a construction bubble, like that which Ireland experienced, are long term.  They also tend to be more complex than most other types of economic recession.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Joe Higgins&rsquo;s use of statistics on the large increase in the number of births, a welcome development, and the increase of 3,000 older people per annum living longer, bears out my point on dependency.  Children, until they are 18 years of age, will be dependent on the State for education provision, public and social services.  An increase in the birth rate, while welcome in the long term, means in the short term an increase in costs for the State.  This, coupled with an increase in pensioners, means the cost falls on the smaller group in the middle, those of <Col N="286"/>working age.  In 2010, 495,000 people of pension age received some form of a State pension, a large percentage of the population.  Irish society has an imbalance in its dependency rates due to longevity and, as Deputy Higgins correctly stated, the welcome increase in the birth rate.</P>
        <P>Deputy Higgins advocates the introduction of a different system.  As Deputy Joan Collins stated, I am a social democrat.  In that context, I am of the view that we require a mixed economy &mdash; incorporating strong public and private sectors &mdash; because under such a model we can create employment and provide for social security and for social services in the areas of, for example, health and education in a balanced, progressive and democratic way.  That is the essence of social democracy.</P>
        <P>Deputy Higgins suggested that the fault in respect of this matter lies with market capitalism.  In my opinion it lies with some of the unregulated activities that occur in stock exchanges throughout the world, including those in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States.  One of the issues that arises for workers and their representatives and for people who perhaps &mdash; as Deputy Higgins professes to &mdash; admire James Connolly and Jim Larkin is to inquire about how their savings are to be used.  Are these people saving in order to allow others to play the markets with their money or are they saving for their retirement in a safe and cautious way, with less dramatic returns but with more security in the context of their funds being available to them when they reach retirement age?  The question which people in the labour movement must pose relates to how we can create structures which protect the pensions and pay and conditions of workers and which &mdash; even in the face of changing demographics &mdash; provide individuals with an assurance that they will be able to live with a degree of comfort and dignity when they reach old age.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P Just="Left">Deputy Higgins has not presented to the D&aacute;il well thoughtout proposals regarding how an alternative system would actually operate and on how we would move to such a system if it were established.  Much of what is happening on the part of the banks in the context of market failure was caused by lack of both regulation and oversight.  Much of the harm experienced in this country was brought about by tax expenditures which assisted in further expanding the construction bubble.  It was also caused by greedy banks and speculators feeding off each other.  In some instances problems were created by European and other banks lending into the Irish system at the height of the bubble.  Coming off the bubble has been a painful and difficult experience for almost every man, woman and child in this country.  It has been particularly traumatic for ordinary, middle class people.  However, we will turn matters around when we get the country back to work and when the economy begins to expand again.</P>
        <P>The Bill is concerned with providing a stimulus and presenting people with opportunities in the context of the internship scheme and the reduction in employers&rsquo; PRSI.  Other measures contained in the jobs initiative programme provide for reductions in the lower rate of VAT, particularly with regard to employment-rich sectors such as tourism.  Deputy Higgins may choose to scoff at or be rather critical about the measures to which I refer but I am of the view that it is better to put forward positive proposals.  I would be interested in discovering the kind of measures he would advocate and perhaps he will advise us in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct with regard to the position relating to demographics.  The demographics relating to both births and life expectancy are rising, which is very welcome.  As a society, we must decide how to make the kind of provision required in respect of younger people and children.  We must also decide on the type of provision which Members on all sides would wish to see being made in respect of older people in their retirement.</P><Col N="287"/>
        <P>Deputy Higgins referred to a nurse working for 47 years.  I do not understand from where he is coming in respect of this matter.  As he is probably aware, nurses are obliged to complete a four-year degree and training programme.  The indication is that by 2028 the retirement age will have risen by one year in respect of the transition year and by two further years to 68.  I do not quite know from where the Deputy obtained the figure he quoted.  However, I do not accept it.  Perhaps he might indicate from where it originated.</P>
        <P>Deputy Joan Collins referred to social democracy.  If the Deputy wishes to put forward better proposals than those advocated by social democrats &mdash; namely, a mixed economy which incorporates strong private and public sectors and a fair, equitable and not over-burdensome taxation system, particularly for those on middle incomes &mdash; then I would be interested in hearing what she has to say.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh again raised the issue of the fuel allowance.  I have made reference to this matter on at least five occasions today.  The best way out of fuel poverty is to provide, over a period, for a first-class system of insulation.  Under such a system, people&rsquo;s homes can be weatherproofed and we can thereby reduce the loss of heat.</P>

	<P>Other countries have had great success in doing what I am advocating.  Programmes to insulate people&rsquo;s homes provide high levels of employment, particularly for those who have experience in construction.  A programme of this nature would provide an ideal way to get people who have lost their jobs in the construction sector back to work.  That is why I commend the proposals of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, in respect of retrofitting.  The Government will pursue this matter very actively during its term in office.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to hear what the Minister has to say on the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of section 8 is to clarify the position arising from the enactment of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  One of the measures included in the Bill, which we have not debated extensively because <Col N="289"/>everybody strongly agrees with it, is the introduction of parallel entitlements and changes in the social welfare system for those who enter a civil partnership arrangement following the enactment of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  We have a series of changes in the social welfare code to cater for the introduction of civil partnership in the Bill and most Deputies would welcome civil partnership, including, I assume, Deputy Higgins.  The main impact for social welfare customers is that from 1 January 2011 the social welfare code has recognised all same-sex cohabiting couples, not just those who opt to register a civil partnership.  This is necessary from an equality perspective as the social welfare code already recognises opposite-sex cohabiting couples.</P>
        <P>One of the legislative amendments required to give effect to the recognition of civil partnerships in the case of recipients of the pre-retirement allowance was inadvertently given the same legislative reference as an existing provision of the scheme.  To clarify the position, section 8 re-enacts the civil partnership amendment under a new legislative reference and reaffirms the existing provisions of the scheme.  The existing provision related to a standard condition that applies to means-tested social assistance payments in general where both partners of a couple claim a social assistance payment in their own right.  For example where one partner of a couple claims pre-retirement allowance and the other one claims another social assistance payment, such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the total amount to the couple is limited to the appropriate married rate, which has been a standard provision in social welfare for a long period.  It is half of the amount that would be payable if only one partner of the couple claimed and received an increase for the other person as a qualified adult.  It simply extends the structure of recognising cohabiting and married couples of opposite sexes to people in same-sex relationships.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that clarification.  We strongly support civil partnership and the civil and human rights of same-sex partners.  I am slightly conflicted because the substance of the section is to limit the amount of welfare somebody gets.  However, in any case, I will not make a meal of it and will withdraw my opposition to the section.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has indicated her intention to ask the Chair to direct that the Clerk make a correction under Standing Order 140.  The correction is as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">On Page 10 Line 49 of the Bill to insert: &ldquo;and&rdquo; into the phrase &ldquo;if so long as&rdquo;.  The phrase will now read &ldquo;if and so long as&rdquo;.  This is correcting a typographical error and the change does not alter the meaning of the text.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P FLI="0">Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This section just clarifies the operation of the revised qualifying criteria for the payment.  The change made last year introduced a restriction on entitlement for families where the youngest child reaches 14 years.  It was a major change, which at the time I said was regressive without activation measures or the change in the economic climate.  It meant that young single families would be penalised upon the youngest child reaching 14 or in the case of a child with a disability 16.  I will not oppose the section because it clarifies and does not change the effect of the retrograde step.  I am just pointing out that this came about as a result of the change introduced last year.  There are questions to be asked about this.  It will be interesting to see how it is worked out.  The parent is entitled to the payment if the youngest child is under 14.  Pre-employment training, activation measures and supports must be in place <Col N="290"/>so people will not be penalised.  I refer not only to the allowance in question under the social welfare code.  It is vital for the State, as it plans to make progress and emerge from the recession, that all the measures to which I refer be put in place.  There is an insufficient number of training opportunities, job vacancies, and re-education and back-to-education courses.  I urge the Government to take the opportunity presented by this Bill to clarify the exact number of jobs and training opportunities that will be available.  A figure of 5,000 or 10,000 is nothing when one considers the scale of unemployment.</P>
        <P>When we were discussing the logic of the lone-parent family payment, it was stated that it acted as a disincentive to going back to work.  The vast majority of single parents I know who are in receipt of social welfare payments would love the opportunity to go back to work.  Studies show that the vast majority of payments end when one&rsquo;s child is seven, eight or nine, at which time an opportunity may present itself to enter full-time employment.  This was in the past when there was work available.  At present, however, work is not available and people will become increasingly dependent on social welfare unless the Oireachtas offers leadership and puts in place schemes such as community employment schemes and accelerates the two schemes to which I have referred.</P>
        <P>Deputy Wallace asked the Minister for Social Protection about T&uacute;s during Question Time.  There are major concerns over T&uacute;s and other schemes in my area because there is no accompanying training allowance.  There is no additionality; the payment is a straight payment.  The employer does not have an additional budget from the State to help the person taking up a position to further his education.  Proper account is not taken of the fact that people must travel to and from work.  This is also the case in respect of single parents.  If they were to avail of T&uacute;s opportunities or the internship, there would be no additionality to ensure they could benefit fully.  While I have had these concerns since last year, or perhaps earlier this year, having made my clarifications, I will not oppose the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I share some of the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns.  We all know of young mothers, and perhaps mothers who are not so young, whose only income is the lone-parent allowance.  They may be in receipt of rent allowance and in various schemes.  We all know that the disincentive is not just related to the payment itself.  There are many steps that can be taken to address the problems of lone parents.  Most lone parents are very anxious to improve their circumstances, as the Deputy would accept.  Most women, when their children enter secondary school, are anxious to re-enter the workforce, possibly after having availed of various schemes prior to that.</P>
        <P>Many steps need to be taken but, unfortunately, we are in very straitened circumstances.  Steps are being taken, however.  For instance, there is a range of education and training opportunities available through the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Education and Skills and F&Aacute;S for lone parents to improve their qualifications and skills base.  There are currently 65 facilitators in the Department working around the country.  They can be contacted through the Department&rsquo;s local officers.  Facilitators work with customers to help them to identify appropriate training or development programmes.  They also work in close co-operation with other service providers, including F&Aacute;S, the VEC and the local community and voluntary sectors.</P>
        <P>The back-to-education scheme presents a second-chance education opportunity programme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and persons with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the workforce.  For the past year or two, most of us have made the point that there is never a better opportunity to up-skill and further one&rsquo;s education than in a time of recession.  One finds that many more <Col N="291"/>people stay on in education because they are as conscious as we are that there are very few job opportunities.  It is different when one is not 18, and possibly 30 or 31, at which age one has life experience.  This is of value in itself and many regard it as such.</P>
        <P>Courses covered under the back-to-education scheme range from second level courses to third level courses.  Persons who are awarded a back-to-education allowance receive a standard weekly payment equivalent to the relevant social welfare payment prior to participation.  An annual cost-of-education allowance of &euro;500 is also payable.</P>
        <P>The back-to-education scheme currently assists some 3,220 people who are in receipt of lone-parent family payments out of a total of some 20,800 participants.  Expenditure on the scheme amounted to &euro;179.8 million in 2010.  A further &euro;198.83 million was allocated for it in 2011.</P>
        <P>Currently, all lone parents who present at F&Aacute;S employment services are provided with one-to-one guidance interviews with an employment services officer.  Lone parents are advised on suitable labour market opportunities, such as current job vacancies and suitable training or employment programme places, and they may be referred to other F&Aacute;S supports.  There is, therefore, a substantial number of supports for lone parents.  Most young women would appreciate any help they could get in finding work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill itself imposes a charge on the Exchequer because it allows the universal social charge to be deductible when assessing family income supplement.  While the Government is ruling out a charge in respect of the amendment, it is imposing one itself in the Bill.  The legislation is introducing a cut to jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance through the back door by not allowing the universal social charge to be deducted in the means testing for the payments.  It may result, for example, in a cut of approximately &euro;12 per week for families in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance.  The cut is carefully hidden.  There is no explicit mention of it in the main provisions of the Bill.  The Bill spells out clearly that the universal social charge, USC, is deductible when means testing for family income supplement but what it does not state is that it is not deductible in other cases.  That is in spite of the decision made by the former Minister earlier this year to allow for the deduction of the USC.</P>
        <P>Those on this side of the House cannot amend the Bill in this way as it is seen to be a charge on the State but the Government has introduced the Bill and there is a charge on certain individuals and certain families.  How are they to redress what amounts to a possible cut of &euro;12 for families on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance?  I ask the Minister to comment on the issue.  Will she bring forward such an amendment if we cannot?</P>

	<P>On the ruling out of order of the amendment, I assume the Deputy realises that anything that imposes a charge on the Exchequer cannot be accepted.</P>
        <P>The provisions contained in section 11 provide for the disregard of the USC when assessing entitlement to family income supplement and for the deletion of the reference to the now defunct health contribution in regard to the assessment for rent and mortgage interest supplement.  Accordingly, they provide for the arrangements which have applied since the introduction of the USC on 1 January last year.</P>
        <P>Any loss of benefits to claimants would have applied from 1 January 2011 and are not being brought about by the provisions in this Bill.  I am informed that the previous Government did not make a decision to allow the USC to be deductible when determining entitlement to a wide range of social assistance payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  It should be noted in that regard that allowing the USC as a deduction would increase social welfare expenditure as the impact of the USC on some individuals would have been compensated through higher welfare entitlements and that no provision for such increased expenditure was made.</P>
        <P>I also note that provision for the existing disregard of certain deductions such as social insurance contributions and superannuation contributions is provided for by way of regulation and that provision for the deduction of the USC from the means test has been made by way of amendment to the relevant regulations.  No such amendments were made in the period from the beginning of January to the formation of the new Government.  The Government is committed in its programme to review the operation of the USC and that review can include any means testing issues that arise.  It was a measure introduced by the previous Government but this Government is committed to reviewing it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The old health levy was deductible.  Is that not correct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes.  The difficulty was created by the Deputy&rsquo;s own party in government.  When the then Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, announced that we would move to a universal social charge implied that it would be within the structure of being similar to a universal social contribution.  In the event, when the then Minister for Finance introduced his legislation it was a universal social charge and as the former Minister, Mary Harney, stated on the night of the budget &mdash; I questioned her at length at the time, as did Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh &mdash; this is a tax.  Because it is a tax it does not interact with the social welfare system in the way that something which is contribution based would do.  The essence of the social insurance system is that it is contribution based whereas the universal social charge has the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; in its title but it is actually a tax.</P>
        <P>What we are doing in this legislation is providing for it in regard to family income supplement because family income supplement is specifically designed to help low paid families at work.  My predecessor, the former Minister for Social Protection, had it within his remit to take the actions the Deputy is now suggesting, namely, to amend it by regulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about this D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it the Minister presented a memorandum to the former Government.  I understand the outcome of that was that there were to be discussions between him and the then Minister for Finance but in the event nothing got changed or amended.  I am <Col N="293"/>introducing this amendment today in regard to family income supplement to ensure that in the case of low paid families in work in particular the USC is taken into account.</P>
        <P>Regarding the further elements of the amendment, it is not possible at this time to extend it because of the cost factors involved but also, as the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, stated, the intention of the Government in the programme for Government is to review the universal social charge.</P>
        <P>In addition, I am establishing a commission on the interaction of social welfare and taxation which will be announced in the next week or so and one of the issues to be considered by that commission is the complications around employment traps, particularly for families on low income, and issues like rent supplement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with this Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  As a representative of my party and an elected representative to this D&aacute;il I am charged with the responsibility of examining this Bill and recommending amendments where appropriate and where possible.  I am not interested in rehashing what happened eight or ten months ago.  I was not elected to talk about what happened then.  I am simply saying that the Minister is the Minister for Social Protection, and I commend her on the USC being deductible in the context of family income supplement, but why can it not be done in regard to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance?  Why will she not go further in that regard?  The Minister said she questioned the Ministers involved in this area some months ago.  If it is the case that this measure is in the context of the 2012 budget and that she cannot make a recommendation such as this because it would impose a charge on the State that is fair enough.  If it is the case that it will mean that certain families will have their income reduced by &euro;12 that is fair enough if it represents a saving for the Minister&rsquo;s Department and to the Exchequer.  All I am saying is that it is a saving I do not agree with, commend or support.  If the Minister wants to reiterate the fact in regard to social welfare rates, that is her prerogative.  That is her responsibility and her decision.  If that is the case, so be it but she should put it on the record to ensure we clearly understand it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The point I was making is that it is the construction of the universal social charge by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party in Government that is the crux of the problem.  The universal social charge is defined in the legislation as a tax.  It is not a contribution even though, understandably, when the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, first mentioned it in December 2009 in the context of budget 2010, he described it as the development of what would be called a universal social contribution.</P>
        <P>Some Deputies may recall that the ESRI did some work on the impact of such a universal social contribution.  There was a favourable response to that idea because it would have meant a rebalancing of the social welfare structures and, in the longer term, would have been a way of examining the benefits self-employed people were entitled to from the system by virtue of their contributions.  However, in the Minister&rsquo;s announcement in last December&rsquo;s budget, it was no longer a universal social contribution.  It had become a universal social charge.  When the details of the budget were announced, several Deputies in this House raised the issue that same night, including myself, Deputy Shortall and Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, took much of the debate on the financial resolution because it concerned the abolition of the health levy and the other levies.  The health levy exempted people with incomes of under &euro;26,000 per annum, widows, people with a medical card and a few other categories, but the universal social charge changed all of that.  The old health levy disappeared, as did the categories of people who were specifically exempted from it.</P>
        <P>This particular bowl of spaghetti would take an awful lot of unscrambling, and it could only be unscrambled in the form of a budget.  The effect of the universal social charge is very simple, <Col N="294"/>but to do what the Deputy is suggesting would not be possible as a budgetary measure in the context of this Bill.  I have treated it for FIS purposes.  The former Minister did not do that.  The Bill came in from 2011 and I am now including it in the calculations of FIS, because it is a tax and it should be dealt with for FIS purposes.  This will ensure that the incentive for low-paid families at work is not decreased or narrowed.  I sought to do that in this Bill.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch said, the Government is committed in the programme for Government to reviewing the universal social charge.  The measure in respect of FIS is as far as I can go in the context of this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>If it has not been fully examined and an alternative means of bringing in funding is not found by the time of the budget, will the Government look at what I am proposing for the budget itself?  If it is to be a tax, can it be dealt with by the Minister for Finance in his presentation to the D&aacute;il?  This can then guarantee that the income will not be deduced, as I said earlier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The next budget is primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance, and I will draw his attention to what the Deputy has said.  Providing for the FIS arrangement in respect of the universal social charge is as far as I can go within the parameters of this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.  I take the Minister&rsquo;s answer at face value.  I expect she will impress upon the Minister for Finance the need to go that bit further in his legislation so the budget can counteract what has evolved because of this.  I take at face value the commitments that were given before that might not have been honoured.  If the Minister is doing that now, I commend her for it.  I was not here to press her on that in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 12</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>There seems to be a bit of confusion among some of the NGOs about the purposes of this section.  FLAC and the INOU both raised concerns about this in submissions.  In the briefing we received from the officials on the Bill, they explained the purpose of this.  Sometimes it is hard to glean the exact intention behind a legislative provision.  Rather than raising their concerns, I will briefly quote recommendations from both NGOs.</P>
        <P>The FLAC submission stated the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">The reference to different classes of claimants or beneficiaries is not sufficiently clear to assure the reader that this will not involve discriminatory profiling of different categories of claimants or social groups.  Currently a decision maker can ask a claimant or beneficiary to provide information relevant to the claim.  However, if different groups of people have to provide different types or forms of information than other claimants, then this may lead to discriminatory practice... In light of this, its capacity to be applied in a discriminatory fashion and given that sufficient powers to collect information already exist, FLAC respectively submits that this provision should be deleted.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed stated the following about section 12:</P>
        <P LI="1">This section will give the Minister for Social Protection and her officials the power to collect information to be supplied by claimants and beneficiaries for profiling and activation purposes.  It is imperative that the information is collected in a manner that is fully trans<Col N="295"/>parent and that front line service staff adequately explain why it is being collected.  A proactive and well informed system that seeks to meet the needs of the unemployed people and other welfare recipients is urgently required.  Good information will be critical in developing a first class and person centred social welfare service: the Department of Social Protection must strive to ensure that the proposed new National Employment and Entitlements Service is indeed such a service.</P>
       <P FLI="0">The INOU recommends the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">Front line staff in social welfare and employment services must have the capacity and the necessary supports to engage with unemployed people and other social welfare recipients in a holistic and constructive manner.  Such official engagement must aim to give unemployed people timely access to their entitlements and the very best of advice and supports to get back to work or into worthwhile education and training options as soon as possible.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have no major problem with ensuring that all claimants across the board supply the same information, be they existing claimants or new claimants.  However, it is also imperative that the people handling the information and dealing with the claimant are doing so in a proper fashion.  Far too often we hear complaints about certain officials.  In the main, everybody is very courteous and some claimants can occasionally be obstructive in their own right and do themselves no favours.  However, when dealing with people who are in dire straits, there should be an element of courtesy and this should extend to the information being provided and supplied.  Whoever is presenting himself or herself for any kind of social welfare payment should have access to the best information possible, and he or she can be provided with a mechanism to get off social protection as quickly as possible and onto some kind of training appropriate to the person&rsquo;s needs and to the employment opportunities that are presenting themselves at the time or in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>On Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s point, FLAC has a great deal of experience dealing with people where something has been drafted in such a way that it has produced problems.  We want to avoid that kind of situation because we will end up with appeals and it becomes expensive to administer, apart from the fact it would single out particular groups.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister has had the benefit of the FLAC submission.  How does she evaluate the points it made in regard to the different types of information and how it might be handled?  Does she believe there is a possibility that it would lead to some discriminatory practices?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the other speakers, I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response to the issues raised by the FLAC submission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies who raised the FLAC submission and would like to give them some background in regard to this.  Section 241(1A) and (1B) of the Social Welfare Act, as inserted by section 9 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009, provided that new claimants of all social welfare payments could be required to provide a range of information for profiling and activation purposes.</P>
        <P>If one reads section 12, the description refers to information to be supplied by claimants and beneficiaries for profiling and activation purposes.  This relates fundamentally to getting information from people which will help identify where they could be assisted to perhaps get back into to education or to go into some kind of training or work experience.  That is basically what is at the core of this.</P>
        <P>The amendment proposed to section 12 of the Bill extends this requirement, which was introduced in legislation in 2009, to existing recipients of social welfare payments as well as new claimants.  It also moves these provisions out of section 241, which relates to claims, into <Col N="296"/>a new section 244(a) which will be titled, information to be supplied by claimants and beneficiaries for profiling and activation purposes.</P>
        <P>Profiling has been largely developed by the Department of Social Protection in conjunction with the expert assistance of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  It uses a set of characteristics combined with coefficients reflecting their relative importance to calculate statistically the probability of an unemployed person finding work early or becoming long-term unemployed.  The system, therefore, is designed to facilitate early targeted intervention for those people who need it most.  It will also introduce greater efficiency and effectiveness in the deployment of resources.</P>
        <P>When a 21 year old goes into a social welfare office to make a claim and he or she has never been in work, when one asks him or her about his or her profile and background, in particular education, one finds he or she left school at 14 or 15 years of age.  It would not be surprising that most people in the current climate would suggest that one of the options for that person would be to pursue further education because all the evidence in regard to capacity to get work indicates that the better the level of the person&rsquo;s general educational qualification, the stronger the chance he or she has of returning to employment.</P>
        <P>A profiling system has been developed and is currently being tested in the Department&rsquo;s D&uacute;n Laoghaire office.  Once the pilot is completed, the new system will be rolled out across the country.  It is intended to commence that process from the third quarter of this year.  On a previous occasion, Deputy Boyd Barrett expressed concern that there was harassment.  I asked the officials to check if, during the period of the pilot, anybody in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire office objected.  There was one objection by somebody who apparently did not understand for what the information was meant but who did not proceed with the objection to information about his or her educational achievements and previous work experience being requested.</P>
        <P>Collection of the characteristics associated with profiling for those already in receipt of a welfare payment will facilitate identification and delivery of appropriate activation interventions to be delivered and to reduce the duration of social welfare dependency.  We all know there is dreadful unemployment currently and it is really hard to get a job but there are people who have been in the social welfare system for a long time and we must positively encourage them to get back into education and work.  All the international and Irish studies show that if young men, in particular, end up unemployed for more than two years, the damage to their self-esteem, confidence and subsequent capacity to get and to stay in work is long term.</P>
        <P>Shortly after I became Minister, I requested the ESRI to publish a study it had undertaken dating back to 2008-09 in regard to people under the NEAP programme to see how they faired with the interview structure and going into F&Aacute;S training.  Some Deputies may have seen the study.  It indicated that in some cases, if people did an inappropriate course to their particular situation, their chances of getting a job disimproved rather than improved.  We all have much thinking to do because it is not acceptable that people would go on social welfare as a five year, ten year or two decade option.  It is not good for them, their families or their children.</P>
        <TimeSt down="3" idown="3">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>In regard to the FLAC suggestion that section 12(2) be deleted, I asked for the views of the Department&rsquo;s legal adviser.  Section 12(2) confers a power on the Minister to prescribe different types and forms of information to be furnished by different classes of claimants or beneficiaries.  Any such power granted to the Minister will have to be exercised lawfully.  As a matter of law, the Minister is prohibited from discriminating between categories of persons on arbitrary or capricious grounds.  However, the Minister is entitled to differentiate between categories of persons as long as any such differentiation can be justified on an objectively reasonable legitimate basis.  Treating people equally does not <Col N="297"/>equate to treating everyone in an identical manner.  In the evident that any powers under section 12(2) are exercised in a discriminatory manner, such exercise would not withstand a challenge in the courts.  There is no inherent legal difficulty with section 12(2) such as would require its deletion.</P>
        <P>The staff of the Department have coped with an enormous expansion in the number of people seeking social assistance, in particular jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and other unemployment benefits.  The staff of the Department, myself and everybody in this House are aware that people have become unemployed in the current recession who never expected to lose their jobs or lose their businesses and who did nothing to generate such an outcome.</P>
        
      
        <P Just="Left">The staff of the Department are extremely mindful of the requirement to treat people with courtesy, dignity and respect. That is borne out by most Deputies&rsquo; experience with the Department&rsquo;s staff and by the experience of most claimants.  Going to a social welfare office is a new experience for people who never expected to find themselves in that position and the vast bulk of staff in the Department treat people with courtesy and dignity despite the pressures they are under in the context of the number of claimants.</P>

	<P>Yes.  The forms have been redesigned with the assistance of the ESRI.

The general sense of the operation of the pilot to date is that the outcomes are quite satisfactory.</P>

        <P>Sections 13 to 15, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION</P>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 19, before section 16, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;16.&mdash;Participants in the National Internship Scheme shall enjoy rights and protections including but not limited to the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) A written statement of terms and conditions from the employer and requiring the approval of the Department;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) Annual leave; and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) Minimum notice before dismissal and protections against unfair dismissal.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="298"/>
        <P FLI="0">This relates to the internship scheme.  Any initiative such as this is welcome but, as I mentioned in the context of an earlier contribution relating to T&uacute;s, there must be an element of additionality when creating these schemes, even it if will be at a slight cost to the State, to ensure the full benefits of a scheme are gleaned by the participant.  As in the case of the T&uacute;s scheme I have concerns that some employers might use this internship scheme to take on people to fill a vacancy, thus displacing somebody to be employed full-time.</P>
        <P>That said, internship is a mechanism whereby people can learn, <i>in situ</i>, the benefits of a certain type of employment.  While internships are not full-time employment and cannot guarantee all the terms and conditions that apply in a contracted job, the minor changes proposed in the amendment should be included.  There should be some type of statement of terms and conditions and some type of protection to ensure an intern will not be wrongfully singled out or put in conditions not encountered by other employees in the place of employment.  There must also be a statement that they are entitled to annual leave and a requirement for notice before being dismissed or let go.  The people who undertake the internship will believe they will be in the position for a set period of time and that period should not be interfered with in any way other than through annual leave, unless something totally untoward occurs.  There should be some type of notice system to ensure a person is not given their marching orders forthwith.</P>
        <P>It is a provision to ensure there is no exploitation of interns and that no unscrupulous employers can use the system to delay bringing new jobs on stream because they can get a few months&rsquo; free work from an intern.  It will also prevent them using the system to get a few months&rsquo; work free from somebody they have in mind for a job but they use the internship as a facility before fully employing them.  There should be no displacement.  I do not believe the vast majority of employers would use it in that way but there are always one or two unscrupulous employers and for that reason we should, if possible, put the required protections in place.</P>
        <P>While there is no financial benefit under the scheme for an intern who takes up a place with an employer, a benefit from the employer could be encouraged, once it does not interfere with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or other allowance the intern receives.  That is the case if an intern takes a place in this Parliament, for example.  One is not encouraged or discouraged with regard to providing a benefit but if somebody has been of value to the employer, they should be encouraged to recognise that by paying some type of benefit or dividend to the person who has gleaned something from that placement.  Hopefully it will be something useful that they can use in the marketplace in terms of an enhanced curriculum vitae after working for an employer for a period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Usually internships are used by students to develop their curriculum vitae and to secure their qualifications.  In my recollection it has never been used to take people off the dole.  These people will not be regarded as employees except with regard to health and safety.  The scheme is open to abuse by employers.  As I continuously pointed out in the context of changes in the legislation relating to work practices in places such as the Davenport Hotel, employers immediately move in to use such changes to reduce the conditions and pay of their employees.  These schemes are open to great abuse by employers.  The people working under the schemes are not regarded as employees under the law and are open to abuse.  These internships can be used instead of employing people.  That is my serious concern.  They have the potential to be abused as a cheap labour scheme.</P>
        <P>I also cannot understand why a person who is only working for three days a week will not be able to claim social benefits for the remainder of the week.  That is very strange given that <Col N="299"/>they would usually get those benefits under the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes.  Are the people who undertake the internships removed from the live register, given that if they are interns they are not officially on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance?  These are issues I am concerned about and I hope the Minister can respond to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to Deputy Joan Collins&rsquo;s points first.  The person who applies for and accepts an internship will get an internship for a six-month or nine-month period.  While on the internship, the person will retain existing entitlements to jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  My Department will pay an additional &euro;50 per week for the duration of the internship.  The issue of three days does not apply because the intern is receiving the social welfare jobseeker&rsquo;s entitlement as well as receiving an additional sum from my Department.  That is the core of this initiative.  I advocated this initiative in opposition for three years.</P>
        <P>Before I was a D&aacute;il Deputy I worked in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  A huge number of people emerge from education and training, having finished an apprenticeship, a degree or a masters, and the critical issue that faces them in this critical time of unemployment is that if they become unemployed they cannot get jobs because they do not have experience.  They cannot get experience because they do not have jobs.  They are in a catch-22.  I am sure Deputy Joan Collins knows some fine young people who finished apprenticeships, degrees or masters but cannot make the transition to working and getting valuable work experience on their CVs.  They cannot get their foot in the door of employment because they have no work experience.  Would I prefer there were thousands of jobs available for these young people?  Of course I would but they are not there at the moment.</P>
        <P>Internships work particularly well in countries such as the United States and Germany.  Deputy Joe Higgins was in the Chamber earlier and I am sure he is familiar with the situation in the European Parliament, Belgium and other European countries.  <i>Stagi&egrave;res</i> gain extremely valuable work experience in <i>stages</i> that are often their passports to jobs.  I have been working intensively on this, particularly with employers, with a view to private sector employers offering serious, high quality internships to those who have qualifications but lack work experience.  It is important that as many employers as possible offer internship opportunities to as many people as possible so they can get a permanent job.</P>
        <P>Deputy Collins should remember that the recession will end one day.  Just as bubbles collapse, recessions end and when the recession ends &mdash; hopefully sooner rather than later &mdash; we do not want a series of people who have gone through various forms of education and training but were never able to get work experience.  Their competitors will be new people finishing apprenticeships and degrees and those who were unable to be employed will be at a serious disadvantage when this dreadful recession comes to an end.</P>
        <P>I understand and accept Deputy Collins is concerned that people should not be abused.  A national steering committee is under the chairmanship of Mr. Martin Murphy, the managing director of Hewlett-Packard, and includes Mr. Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Driscoll, the managing director of Glen Dimplex, and a number of other people from firms and industries.  We also have indications of interest from IBEC, whose members profess an interest and which has been running internship schemes for a number of years.  There is also interest from chambers of commerce.  We want the uptake to be strong.  The National Youth Council of Ireland has a representative on the steering committee and there is also a stakeholders group, including those interested in employment from the trade union or employer side, to ensure the issues arising from potential abuse are addressed.</P>
        <P>This is not employment because it is an internship.  It is intended to be valuable work experience for someone who cannot otherwise get that experience.  It is intended to be something that can be listed on a CV when people look for employment.  The level of interest from <Col N="300"/>applicants and employers interested in hosting internships means I am hopeful we can roll out a significant number of quality internships.</P>
        <P>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to specifications and sets out a number of them in his amendment.  The model developed is that the host organisation specifies what the internship is about and the career development of the person who comes in as an intern, meaning what the person will get from the internship.  The intern will make a commitment to working at the internship and developing experience.  There will be a reporting mechanism through the national employment and entitlement service.  The employment services side of F&Aacute;S is joining the Department of Social Protection.  This will be the first scheme operated by the new national employment and entitlement service.  It will bring together units in the Department.  We met at 7.15 a.m.  I apologise to Deputies for leaving earlier.  We meet every Wednesday from 7.15 a.m to 9.30 a.m to go through the details mentioned by Deputy Collins.  It would be a concern if people were abused rather than getting a valuable experience, which is what this is about.</P>
        <P>This scheme is available to the private sector, which we hope will take a strong interest in it, the public sector and the community and voluntary sector.  Much interest has been expressed by these sectors.  If the internship involves a connection with children or vulnerable or older people in the community and voluntary sector, the interns must undergo Garda vetting.  This takes a period of time but there have been meetings with representatives from the Garda vetting unit to see how we can ensure delays are kept to a minimum.  The scheme will be launched at the end of this month and will go live on the website on 1 July.  After the initial launch in Dublin, we will roll out the scheme over the remainder of the year to Cork, Galway and Waterford.  There is much positive interest in this.  A significant number of people, including the civil servants in my Department and people who have been working in F&Aacute;S and are coming into the Department, have put much positive work into it.  By the time of the launch I will be in a position to give Deputies details of the scheme.</P>
        <P>There is a restriction on numbers to ensure that the kind of abuses which both Deputies were concerned about do not take place.  If an employment has between one and ten employees, it can host one intern; if it has 11 to 20 employees, it can host two interns; and where there are 30 or more employees, it can host up to 20% as interns to a maximum of 200.  If anybody here has employed an intern in their business or had interns working with them, he or she knows there must be a very clear plan of what the intern should do and experience.  Time and effort must be put into organising an internship but in the long run it is very valuable and rewarding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For example, in media industries in Ireland there has been a significant development of internships in recent years, with many of the interns receiving relatively little pay.  Nevertheless, it is the way to break into the media.  In the case of these internships people will receive jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and an additional top-up of up to &euro;50 per week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The notion of internship is a good one but I am wary of it as there is a need for some form of control.  A builder may take on an intern to teach him or her how to lay paving brick.  One may think it is easy to lay paving brick but most people still cannot do it right after several years.  If an employer is honest and teaches that person to lay paving brick, that will be beneficial, but a builder may use that intern to carry bricks to a person who lays them.  That is different as the intern would be replacing somebody the builder would have had to pay as a labourer.  Likewise, a person may get a job in a kitchen where a chef can teach that person to cook, which would be beneficial as an experience.  However, an employer may have that intern chopping carrots and parsnips all the time, which means he or she is learning nothing but is replacing a paid employee.</P><Col N="301"/>
        <P>I am sure we agree that employers will vary so there will be employers who are straight and honest, treating the internship scheme as they should.  However, unless there is some form of control there will be many employers abusing the system.  The breakdown will probably be half and half.  I have not thought it through and I am sure it would be very difficult to control the scheme but the Government must consider how to monitor the process.  I suspect 50% of it will be abused if that is not done.</P>
        <P>The building construction industry had a brilliant apprenticeship scheme for years but it died, mainly because it was used as a form of slave labour.  If a man wanted to serve his time as a carpenter 30 years ago he would be attached to somebody who had just been given his papers as having served his five years as an apprentice.  That is how people learned to be a carpenter over five years and the system worked really well, with a good flow of carpenters coming through the system all the time.  Sadly, builders began to abuse the process and young people would not be left with a carpenter.  A person may have been with a carpenter for three or four months before being told to work a cement mixer, using sand, gravel, cement and water to make concrete.  That is manual labour.</P>
        <P>I have spent 35 years on building sites and too often I saw the apprenticeship scheme badly abused by a builder.  The scheme ended up dying a sad death because it was abused.  It was a terrible pity because we ran out of tradesmen.  In the boom between 2000 and 2006 one could not get a carpenter and one would be frightened by what we had to pay carpenters in order to get work done.  That was because they were so scarce.  We were lucky to have a flow of good workers from eastern Europe because if it had not existed, the scarcity would have been worse.  One may argue that we would have been better if those workers had not arrived as we might not have built so much.  It is a chicken and egg scenario.</P>
        <P>If the internship programme is to work well, it must be monitored.  If there is no control, 50% of it may work well but the other 50% will be abused.  Those comments come from my experience.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  Her presentation was very enthusiastic but I am not convinced because of some of the reasons raised by Deputy Wallace.  Internships are very specific and I know people who have gone from colleges in Germany to Brussels and Europe as part of their political studies.  They may work there for six months before returning home to finish their studies.  The basic requirement was to gain experience.</P>
        <P>We are telling people to take up employment for six to nine months for approximately &euro;240 per week.  When the six to nine months are completed, as the Minister indicated, we will still be in recession, so those people will go for another internship for six to nine months.  What Deputy Wallace described will happen more often than not.  It would be different if we had very skilled people in certain areas with no work.  They could get off the dole to try to develop skills or even get into another area of work.  We are talking in a recession when employers will seek to cut left, right and centre.</P>
        <P>The Minister indicated that a company with up to 1,000 employees can take on 200 internships.  An employer could easily use those interns to replace a paid position rather than develop skills.  I am not convinced by the scheme and I ask the Minister to remove the section because it does not make sense.  It is more open to abuse than anything else.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about community but that is being hammered and with so many cutbacks people are crying out for assistance.  The sector is ideal for internships as community projects might bring in people to fill positions where people have left.  There is a moratorium in the public sector so we are talking about internships.  That is great because interns can do the work of somebody else who was let go.  I do not agree with the scheme as it is the wrong way to <Col N="302"/>approach the issue.  It is being done for the wrong reasons and internships should only be used for specific short-term reasons and certain areas.  It should not be used for the position faced by the country now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I would take a fairly similar view to Deputy Wallace.  Although in principle internships are a reasonably good idea which give on the job training, a strict regime and control is required to ensure the level of abuse is limited.  There will always be abuse of that kind of system.  In Germany the welfare system was used when the economy was flat to keep people at work so such people did not need to be upskilled.  It was a good way to use the welfare system as people were ready to deploy as a trained work force when the opportunity arose.  I am not averse to the idea of internships but the initiative will aggrieve those who come out of college and are not entitled to social welfare payments, particularly where they are just above the limits for any sort of payment.  I understand it excludes people who are entitled to sign for credits even though they are in the same category as those who want to develop work experience.  Is an initiative planned for this group?</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to clarify her intentions for the evaluation process.  The evaluation could be completed quickly in order to weed out abuse at an early stage.  This would assist jobs growth, which is important because people want to be in meaningful and paid employment rather than participating in schemes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>We need a better plan for dealing with the economic crisis than hoping to get out of the recession.  Hope will not do us any good and we need to plan rather than wish our problems away.  Given the limited money left in the State on foot of the Government&rsquo;s capitulation to Europe, would it not have been preferable to use the &euro;50 being given to employers for a different purpose?</P>
        <P>If an employer gets something for nothing, he or she will think the employees are not worth anything and will treat them the same.  I am concerned about abuse because similar schemes with different names have been introduced over the years.  A close relative of mine was involved in a scheme in the 1980s which was supposed to give her work experience as a secretary.  The ideal scenario was that she would find further employment after her services were supplied to an employer for a period of six months, but it turned out that my relative was found to be more useful at hanging washing on a clothes line.  One day before the six months concluded, she was informed that she was no good at hanging washing even though she was supposed to be doing secretarial work.  She subsequently left the country because she was sick of the place and did not like the way everyone she knew was being treated.  I would hate to see us going down that road again.  This scheme has massive potential for abuse and it will have to be policed.  I find it hard to see how that will be done.  In theory, it is a good idea for getting people back to work but I am worried about the controls.</P>
        <P>Participants in the T&uacute;s scheme receive an additional &euro;20 per week for working 19.5 hours.  Why will people get &euro;50 per week under the internship scheme?  Is it because people on the T&uacute;s scheme are less worthy or a lesser sort of people?  Why are they not entitled to an equal top-up given that it costs them just as much to live in this country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>

There are no jobs for these people because of the policies pursued by this Government and its predecessor.</P>
        <P Just="Left">She has not convinced me that safeguards are being built into the internship scheme to assist people in gaining employment while avoiding the danger of it becoming a cheap labour scheme.  I fear it could facilitate a growth in unemployment by using the guise of training to put people into jobs that otherwise would be properly compensated.  What will be done to ensure an adequate level of training and up-skilling is provided?  How will staff resources be allocated from her Department and the companies concerned to oversee the scheme?</P>
        <P>It is frightening that 20% of a company&rsquo;s workforce could be employed as interns.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmKeaveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Colm Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Over the course of last weekend I had the opportunity to meet representatives of a number of small businesses and on Monday a presentation was made by the traders and chamber of commerce in my hometown.  I rarely meet these individuals on other occasions.  We discussed their obligations in terms of getting the economy up and running and the role they can play in the internship scheme.  This is an opportunity to give hope to young people, particularly in parts of rural Ireland which are suffering the scourge of emigration.  There are no jobs in these areas and we need to see growth.  This initiative is aimed at stimulating a bottoming out of the collapse of the economy and getting people back to work.  The employers I spoke to who were involved in retail businesses, confectionaries and coffee shops are delighted to be given opportunities to take on young graduates.  They are prepared to take the risk in the belief of being in a position to retain an invaluable person if growth returns at the end of the cycle.</P>
        <P>As a new philosophy, it is difficult for us to get our heads around it but we cannot afford the human cost of doing nothing.  Deputy Luke &ldquo;Ming&rdquo; Flanagan will identify with me when I note that many of the Dublin Deputies do not understand the scourge of emigration in the same way as in rural Ireland.  We see it in our schools, which children are leaving to follow their parents to America, our football teams and our communities.  This experience is lost in the density of urban areas, where the scourge of unemployment can be hidden by the density of the population.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to hear the Department will play a role in monitoring the scheme.  The resort to third party procedures exists in the event of displacement.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that the Department is resourced and monitors the situation and that we arm third party procedures in this country such as the Labour Relations Commission so as to ensure that displacement does not take place and people would not be pushed out the door in order to gain access to cheap labour.</P><Col N="304"/>
        <P>The payment of &euro;50 is a great opportunity for people to supplement their income.  I accept it is a risk.  We are investing in people but the risk is worth it if we can get people back to work, especially young people who are crying out for experience.  They want experience in this country not in New York.  They want to play their part in getting the country back to work.  We all want to see light at the end of the tunnel.  Nobody has a unique right to have control of that argument.  We all want people to get back into sustainable employment but we must start somewhere.  The notion that we would do nothing is a huge risk&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We will get good value for money in penetrating the local economy, getting people back to work and giving light at the end of the tunnel to people who do not have hope.  Those are the people who will have to leave this country taking their children with them.  Emigration is devastating rural areas.  This type of scheme has been broadly welcomed by communities.

	<P>I am sorry to have to disagree with my colleague, Deputy Keaveney, but the scourge of unemployment is noticeable in urban areas.  On one road in my area, five young people have emigrated.  On Friday of last week an elderly gentleman and his son came to my clinic.  The man said there is nothing for his son but emigration.  We are all feeling the pain across the country.</P>
        <P>Young people have said to me that they want some way to help them keep their skills up to date.  They want to grow, learn and to get experience.  The internship provides an opportunity for that.  It is innovative and has been broadly welcomed.  We must be careful to monitor the situation.  I take on board what people are saying but it is wrong to rubbish every positive proposal.  We must try new mechanisms to keep young people in this country and keep their skills updated so that when the upturn comes they are in a position to take up jobs.  I very much welcome the proposal for the internship programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been an interesting debate.  I learned a little more than I knew previously.  It was interesting to hear interns being called internees.  As far as I am aware there is only one internee and he was sitting behind me in the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Did he not do well?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmKeaveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Colm Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Look where he is now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Did he not do well?  He served a very interesting internship.  Like interns, internees have very few rights as well.  The purpose of the amendment was to try <Col N="305"/>to ensure, even though it is specified in the legislation interns are not employees, that interns should still get as much protection as we can afford to give them so that the rights and conditions we have managed to secure over the years for employees are fully reflected for them.  Such an arrangement would, hopefully, provide additional protection against any type of exploitation.  The intention was not to introduce any type of restriction which would make the scheme unworkable.</P>
        <P>The scheme has a purpose.  The additional payment of &euro;50 is welcome.  I was not fully aware of that previously.  However, I question the adequacy of it for a person travelling to work on a full-time basis and needing to get lunch every day.  Many people would even give up &euro;50 of the meagre jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if at the end of their internship they were guaranteed a job.  I reiterate my call to impress upon employers if at all possible that they are not prevented from topping up the payment or offering a lump sum at the end of an internship to those interns who have played a positive role and have contributed to a business.</P>
        <P>I support the call for people who are signing on for credits to also be allowed to avail of the opportunity to participate in the scheme as, often, they are the very ones who will emigrate because they cannot get jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance because the household income is taken into account.  Young people whose parents work are often the ones who will emigrate because they may have some money behind them.  Some of them are students who have graduated from college.  We must ensure that everyone in society who is on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, whether they are signing for credit or a payment should be able to avail of the scheme.  The social welfare trap that exists must be closed off.  There are many such loopholes.  I have spoken to the Minister about one or two others that are not relevant to the debate.</P>
        <P>I accept that there should be an ongoing evaluation process to see whether an internship has been successful to ensure that we have a system that reflects the best possible practice so that one does not have abuse.  Employers who abuse the system should be blacklisted from participation in the scheme.  The message should go out strongly from the start that abuse will not be tolerated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">To reassure Deputies, the host organisation which identifies a potential internship opportunity must nominate a suitable mentor from within the organisation, such as the HR department, if a company is large enough to have one, to oversee the process.  Companies must apply to the national employment and entitlements service to have the internship recognised.  They will have to make an application and describe the purpose of the internship, what it will be about and what it will contribute to the person&rsquo;s learning and work experience in the course of the internship.</P>
        <P>Individuals who are interested in taking up internships will apply to host organisations and the latter will make a selection subject to the eligibility criteria.  In order to participate on the programme the host organisation and interns will have to sign a standard internship agreement before commencing the programme.  We are trying to limit the paperwork so that it is not too top heavy in terms of administrative burden.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputies who are concerned about abuse that there must be a structure.   Someone who is going to employ an intern must put some thought into what an intern will achieve and learn in terms of experience from the process.  Throughout the internship there will be regular contact and a log summary will be provided of what career development has taken place in terms of the person&rsquo;s learning experiences.</P>
        <P>Deputy Wallace has experience both in training apprentices and as an employer.  I accept there are employers who will abuse any situation but the response so far from employers has been extremely positive for the reasons Deputy Keaveney outlined which is that in many areas <Col N="306"/>people want to provide opportunities to young people who are stymied.  International research by the most renowned academics on getting people back to work classifies the outcomes from internships in an entirely different manner to the outcomes from other work experience schemes.  Internships have positive outcomes for people who take part in them, particularly if they are well designed.  That is what we are working towards.  We will be monitoring it carefully.</P>
        <P>In the jobs initiative, we provided 6,000 places on F&Aacute;S specific skills training courses, an extra 3,000 places in the back to education scheme, an extra 1,000 post-leaving certificate places, 5,900 places on the third level springboard scheme and up to 5,000 places on the national internship scheme, which we were just talking about.  People may say these are not the same as full-time permanent jobs, but we must start somewhere and give people opportunities.  In particular, we must ensure the skills of those coming out of training at this time do not grow cold.  Internationally, all of the academic literature shows that when properly done, high quality internships can produce a valuable experience for the people who do them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have one or two queries, although I have no problem with this section but rather with the next section.  Section 17 states that &ldquo;an officer of the Minister authorised by him or her for this purpose, or ... the Executive ... may, subject to the conditions and in the circumstances that shall be prescribed, defer, suspend, reduce or cancel repayment of any such amount&rdquo;.  When is it intended to prescribe the conditions or circumstances mentioned here?</P>
        <P>The same subsection also mentions that the HSE may carry out this function in the case of supplementary welfare allowance.  In September, when the community welfare officers are transferred to the Department of Social Protection, will this provision need to be changed to reflect the transfer of the function of distributing supplementary welfare allowance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Community welfare officers will be transferring from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection, and those arrangements should be completed, as the Deputy mentioned, by the end of September.  The position of community welfare officer will still exist even though, because people will have payments processed in their local offices, the need for supplementary payments should decrease over time, and community welfare officers will spend more time dealing with exceptional needs cases.  That is certainly the intention.  I do not think there will be any requirement for changes in the legislation in the short term.  However, it is important the arrangements for recovering fraudulent social welfare overpayments are in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>My question relates to the repayment of amounts due.  Section 17 states that when a person is required to repay a certain amount, the repayment may, subject to conditions, be deferred or suspended in circumstances that shall be prescribed.  It states there will be conditions or circumstances under which the repayment can be reduced or suspended.  Is it intended to prescribe these shortly after the legislation is passed, or is it an ongoing process depending on circumstances?  It was not a question about community welfare officers themselves; it is just that the HSE is mentioned in the case of supplementary welfare allowance, and I am inquiring as to whether the Department should also be mentioned, so the phrase <Col N="307"/>would read &ldquo;the Executive or the Department of Social Protection, in the case of supplementary welfare allowance&rdquo;.  I presume the supplementary welfare allowance budget will also transfer to the Department and away from the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 21, line 33, after &ldquo;payment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;obtained as a result of conscious fraud&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an important change to the way the Department goes about recovering overpayments.  The section deals with fraud, although it is not even fraud, as it states: &ldquo;Repayment of amounts due arising from false or misleading statements or wilful concealment of facts.&rdquo;  To date, in the case of repayment of moneys owed or wrongly claimed by an individual, if the person is entitled to another payment, that payment is deducted from the overall amount.  For example, in the case of a person who is in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance with an allowance for a child, but who actually has no child, the arrangement currently is that he or she pays back the amount given in respect of the child; however, after this change, the person will pay back everything from the start.  The section states: &ldquo;the amount to be repaid in such circumstances shall not be reduced by the amount of any other payment...to which the person would otherwise have been entitled in the period to which the overpayment relates&rdquo;.  There is a danger here.  I am not saying the Department should not pursue the person for the amount obtained fraudulently; in any case, if there is a conscious fraud involved, the Department should be going to the courts, which I do not think it has done often enough.  There are many cases in which there is overpayment due to a failure to disclose information.  However, if the disclosure had not been made for two years, for example, the amount to be recovered by the Department would be so substantial that it would never be recoverable in the case of a person who was genuinely dependent on social welfare but should have been receiving a single payment only.  Such a person is entitled, as soon as the fraud is discovered, to claim again for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, but he or she would be subject to a charge and a fine as well as the repayment.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This could come to a substantial and daunting amount which may never be realisable.</P>
        <P>We have to be realistic but the provisions in this section make no exceptions for cases where there may be an inability to pay or no possibility of ever recovering the moneys. While we need to tackle the level of social welfare fraud, we must ensure we do not pursue cases of overpayment on the part of the Department or, as has happened, cases where data on particular applications has not been recorded properly.  I admit the Department has put in place much better systems to counter these problems.  However, I know of 700 cases of rent assessment which were not dealt with by Dublin City Council for several years.  Subsequently, each of the claimants received bills for arrears and notices to quit their council housing.</P>
        <P>Similarly, it is unfair to request the repayment of &euro;20,000 from someone who has been on social welfare for several years.  If someone is entitled to a payment, even retrospectively, then they should receive it.  This section, however, removes that entitlement as a punishment for wrongdoing, a step too far.  FLAC, the Free Legal Advice Centres, and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU, have raised similar concerns as to how this section will operate.  We need to be careful.  There are times when there are misunderstandings between <Col N="308"/>officials and applicants.  I would like to see a campaign similar to that of the Plain English group for some social welfare forms.  With more communication between various Departments and community welfare officers, material requested of claimants should only have to be given once rather than several requests made for the same information from various sections.</P>
        <P>I am not opposed to the Department claiming back and fining individuals involved in social welfare fraud.  However, I am concerned that the provisions in this section may be taking it a step too far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s amendment.  Whether intentionally or not, section 18 implies all overpayments are due to fraud.  That is not always the case.  The amendment&rsquo;s proposal to insert the term &ldquo;conscious fraud&rdquo; is worthwhile.  FLAC has made a submission to us about this section, going so far as to say the section &ldquo;should be deleted as it has the potential to impose a punishment tantamount to a fine on the basis of a decision by a deciding officer rather than by due judicial process&rdquo;.  This amendment would overcome this problem.</P>
        <P>For example, a person on a lone-parent allowance may not have intentionally given misleading information for a claim while, at the same time, being eligible for family income supplement.  The difference between the two should be the amount repaid rather than the entire payment.  I hope the Minister takes on board this well-meant amendment which addresses an issue which could be divisive and dangerous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>These are the most punitive and draconian changes contained in the Bill.  Many people have difficulties dealing with bureaucracy and filling out forms.  If a person is suspected of fraud, he or she is entitled to due process and any due benefits.  I know from my job that anyone suspected of fraud would be suspended with pay because no one can be left without access to money.  Social welfare fraud is essentially a separate issue and should not be dealt with in this legislation.  This section basically means a person is guilty before they can prove their innocence.</P>
        <P>While there is an appeals process, the section will leave a person with no means of income pending their appeal.  Recently the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, stated she receives a large number of complaints regarding the time it takes for social welfare benefits to begin and the time taken in determining appeals.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will delete this section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Our proposal to delete this section is preferable to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s amendment because it is hard to define &ldquo;conscious fraud&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; is bandied around too much in debates on social welfare legislation when we do not hear it too often in debates on white collar crime and the like.  When this section is added to previous statements by the Minister of her intention to engage in lifestyle scrutiny of social welfare recipients, it sets the wrong tone for many of our citizens &mdash; unfortunately a growing number of them &mdash; in receipt of social welfare.</P>
        <P>This section is too heavy-handed.  In most cases where an error or overpayment has been made, it is often just an innocent mistake due to a lack of sufficient information submitted by the recipient or an erroneous application for a benefit when he or she could have availed of another one.  To claim any problems with this section can be overcome by an appeals process is not good enough.  There are backlogs in processing appeals already.  Why would the Minister add to an already overburdened process when deciding officers have a discretionary role covered by statute?  They are adequately equipped and trained to distinguish between someone <Col N="309"/>who is willfully playing the system and trying to defraud it and a person who makes a mistake.  All we are asking is that the <i>status quo</i> be maintained and that the staff in question be allowed to do their job properly and be in a position to decide &mdash; in line with the training they have received and the experience they possess &mdash; if someone is playing the system or if he or she made a genuine mistake.</P>
        <P>If a person is entitled to a payment from the State and if he or she has been overpaid in respect of another benefit, it is common sense to offset one against the other.  The only way we can eliminate this anomaly from the legislation is by removing section 18 in its entirety.  We will push the matter to a vote because the section must go, particularly in light of the problems to which it will give rise.  I appeal to the Minister to remove the section or we will obliged to seek a division.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The sad reality is that social welfare fraud exists.  Every euro lost through such fraud represents money taken from the purses and pockets of those who really need social welfare support.  I am shocked that some Deputies appear to find the notion of social welfare fraud something which should just be condoned and almost endorsed.  That is entirely unacceptable.  We are in the middle of a serious economic crisis and, unfortunately, vast numbers of people are unable to find work.  Many individuals are working on a part-time basis at present.  The notion that defrauding the social welfare system is acceptable is entirely and utterly objectionable to me, as Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>No one said it is acceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>People who work hard for low wages and who pay PRSI are paying for the social welfare system.  It should not be the case that others should be allowed to defraud that system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister indicate who said that should be the case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The social welfare system is a social contract.  The viability of that contract depends on ordinary people being confident that the system is not being milked, abused or scammed by a very small number of individuals.  The number of those involved in social welfare fraud is not that great.  Unfortunately, those people who are involved in such activity completely destroy the confidence of others in the validity of the system.  Those who scam the taxation system do the same in respect of people&rsquo;s confidence that said system is fair and above board.  As everyone is aware, bankers have destroyed confidence in the banking system as a result of their activities.</P>
        <P>Those who commit social welfare fraud are prosecuted.  In view of the crisis in which the country finds itself, I would have hoped that the Deputy would respect those people who have worked for 30 or 40 years and who have contributed to the system.  These individuals want a good social welfare system and they are prepared to pay their taxes and PRSI to ensure that there is such a system.  They do not want others to take a soft ride on the basis of the tax and PRSI contributions they have made out of their hard-earned wages.</P>
        <P>I invite the Deputy to reconsider this matter.  Any level of fraud in the social welfare system, even if it is quite small, is significant.  In the past two weeks, TV3 aired a programme relating to social welfare fraud.  Five different individuals appeared on the programme &mdash; their faces were pixilated to disguise their identities and I presume their voices were distorted &mdash; and indicated that they had been in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for up to four years.  They took great pleasure in explaining to the interviewer the various ways in which they are milking the system and scamming the rest of us.  Such behaviour is unacceptable.  The level of fraud of <Col N="310"/>this nature is small but it is terribly significant in the context of people&rsquo;s confidence in the social contract.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not make any apologies for seeking, in this Bill, additional and stronger powers to reduce the level of social welfare fraud.  Such powers will increase the confidence of those who pay tax and PRSI in the system.  I make similar remarks in respect of those who are scamming the taxation system and bankers.  Whether it is in the areas of business, taxation or social welfare, this country cannot afford a culture of fraud wherein the cute individual always gets away with playing the system while ordinary people are obliged to make honest contributions.  We need a culture change in this regard.</P>
        <P>The references in the legislation are to fraudulent overpayments.  Let us be clear: fraud means obtaining something to which one is not entitled.  We are seeking, by means of this section, to ensure that there will not be a type of double benefit in respect of fraud.</P>
        <P>I respect a great deal of the work done by FLAC.  However, it has alleged that section 18 has the potential to impose a punishment tantamount to a fine on the basis of a decision made by a deciding officer rather than by due judicial process.  The preliminary view of the Department&rsquo;s legal officer is that the proposed power prohibiting the offsetting of one social welfare payment against another would not be interpreted as the imposition of a fine in the sense alleged by FLAC.  Following a finding of fraud, rather than having a fine imposed by a deciding officer my understanding is that the latter will be in a position to suspend other payments by the Department, presumably until such time as the money is repaid.</P>
        <P>From first principles, it would seem somewhat irregular that a person could be found to have defrauded the social welfare system &mdash; and consequently be in debt to and be obliged to repay money to that system &mdash; while continuing to benefit from other benefits available under the same system.  There is a credibility gap in respect of this matter.  If, as one of the Deputies stated, an individual has dependent children, the Department would take such circumstances into account.  However, the House must ensure that members of the public who pay tax and PRSI will have confidence that their contributions will be used to the benefit of those who require and who are entitled to the support offered by the social welfare system.  I make no apologies for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not denied that social welfare fraud exists, nor have I ever condoned it.  On various occasions I have taken the opportunity in this House to encourage the Department to use its existing powers and to train its staff to pursue those who defraud the system.</P>
        <P>No one in this Chamber opposes the other measures in the Bill which are, I hope, designed to tackle some of the elements of fraud.  I refer, for example, to section 13, which relates to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and social welfare inspectors working together on checkpoints.  Sections 14 and 15 relate to public service cards and the provisions they contain will be useful in tackling a type of fraud which may arise in the future.</P>
        <P>Section 18 is quite specific in the context of what is intended.  It is not the case that the Department is trying to recover just the money it is owed by those who commit fraud.  It refers to &ldquo;Repayment of amounts due arising from false or misleading statements or wilful concealment of facts.&rdquo;  Not all of this would equate to fraud in a court of law.  Section 18 states that where a person is required to repay an amount of any payment, the amount to be repaid  in such circumstances shall not be reduced by the amount of any other payment referred to in the section and which the person would otherwise have been entitled to.</P><Col N="311"/>
        <P>No one is denying that the Department should recover the full amount of a fraudulent claim or a fine that has been imposed.  The section would mean an amount to be paid could not be reduced by taking into account the payment a person was entitled to.  The Minister mentioned a period of four years.  A person who was on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for four years and received a fraudulent payment for the last two of those four years would have to repay a substantial amount of money.  If the person was fraudulently claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, he or she should have to pay it back in the same way as a person in a bank or any other institution who robbed or fraudulently obtained money and was found by a court to have done so would have to pay the money back.  If a person is entitled to a certain part of the payment, he or she has that entitlement and it cannot be taken away, except by a court of law that has found fraud.  Before an incident goes to court, a departmental inspector decides whether the person has misled the Department and wilfully concealed facts.  If an inspector has found fraud and the amount is substantial the person concerned should be brought to court and charged with a criminal offence.</P>
        <P>The culture will not change among that cohort of people unless they are made to feel the full extent of the law.  I am concerned that this measure has not been discussed in sufficient detail and that the full advice regarding the effect of this change in legislation has not been gleaned.  I thank FLAC for highlighting this issue.  I had marked it down on the day we were briefed by departmental staff.  My note in the margin highlights the words &ldquo;demonstrably, knowingly defrauded&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>My preference is that the section should be opposed.  If that is not going to happen, the words of my amendment should be inserted.  A small caveat might prevent serious hardship being imposed on people who were not knowingly involved in fraud but who, for some reason or other, misled officials.  They may not have been aware they were misleading officials.  The problem may have arisen from the way they presented themselves or through a misunderstanding that could have been sorted out at an earlier stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Overpayment or fraud should be spotted as early as possible so that amounts of overpayment do not build up.  This can cost the State large sums and the person involved cannot realistically pay the money back.  There is no point in seeking the repayment of &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 from a person who has absolutely nothing.  Circumstances must be taken into account.  Every attempt should be made to recover money for the State but we must also be realistic about people&rsquo;s circumstances.  Mechanisms need to be found to recover money without undue hardship on families.  There has been discretion in the past.  Most officials have worked with people in these circumstances and the State has recovered large amounts of money over the years.  That has meant there has not been as high a level of fraud as in other countries.  The Department has been aware of it and has acted on an ongoing basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I realise it is late and the Minister has been in the House for a long time.  She may be a little tired and not listening to precisely what is being said on this side of the House.  I have heard no one in the Chamber condoning fraud of any character.  To imply that is disingenuous.  Fraud, even only one occurrence, would not be condoned by anybody.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The point being made on this side of the House is that there is already a facility and power to deal with cases where fraud occurs.  The Minister made the point that she is only referring to claims where a person got something he or she was not entitled to.  None of us is saying people should keep such money.  However, there are many reasons that an overpayment occurs.  There need not be a wilful intent to withhold information.  There may be a lack of understanding or an incompletely filled out form.</P>
        <P>The Department has staff employed by the State who have a lifetime of experience in dealing with these cases.  They are best placed to investigate these instances.  Rather than adequately <Col N="312"/>staffing departmental offices and equipping staff, we have a ludicrous public sector recruitment embargo while those offices are struggling to keep up with the level of claims and to monitor form filling, applications and claims.  The Government would be better served by lifting the employment embargo, adequately equipping departmental offices, increasing the numbers employed there and empowering them to do the job for which they already have a legislative basis.</P>
        <P>Where someone is overpaid under one heading even though he or she may be entitled to a payment under a different heading, section 18 disallows the deciding officer from offsetting one against the other.  No matter how one dresses that up, it amounts to a fine or penalty and the person is forced to repay more money than he or she owed.  The Minister seems to imply that taxpayers and citizens see the root cause of the problems in our social welfare system as the recipients of social welfare.  The Minister later contradicted herself by saying there is only a very small number of fraudulent claims, which is the case.  The Minister should empower her people to deal with the small amount of fraud, based on existing legislation.  She should not take money from people on the double and treble and force her staff to waste resources by being tied up in unnecessary appeals, which could be avoided if there were adequate resources on the front line.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with  most of what Deputy Clare Daly said.  I agree 100% with the Minister that we should not tolerate fraud.  If there is fraud, the problem should be addressed.</P>
        <P>I reiterate a point I made in the House last week.  Interesting research was carried out in Britain in 2009 where it was discovered that between &pound;1.5 billion and &pound;2 billion was lost in welfare fraud.  It was also found that tax evasion, tax loopholes and the use of offshore accounts had cost the Exchequer &pound;80 billion, from the top end of business.  Neither form of fraud should be tolerated.  I know from experience that if workers collect dole while working and cheat the system, it is demoralising for guys who are in work.  Likewise it is demoralising for the State to see the richest people in our society not carrying their fair share and cheating the system in a very sophisticated way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the things I was going to say have been said and I will not repeat them.  The explanatory memorandum states: &ldquo;Sections 17 and 18 provide that where a fraudulent social welfare overpayment occurs&rdquo;.  It does not state &ldquo;proven&rdquo; and the point is there needs to be due process.  If somebody is suspected of fraud due process in court needs to be followed and in the meantime that person should continue to receive his or her social welfare benefit.  As Deputy Clare Daly said the workers in that area are sufficiently experienced to understand where people are in their own lives.</P>
        <P>A certain tone is being set by the Government and particularly in the Fine Gael ranks with the suggestion in newspapers over the weekend of deadbeat dads having to do national military service.  Someone then came on radio to clarify that it was not national military service but national service.  It has also been suggested that lone parents with more than three children should not get paid, which is similar to the provision the late Deputy, Brian Lenihan, introduced in the budget reducing child allowance for the third child.  There is definitely a tone coming from the Government that the direction of the debate is going down to an attack on the lowest paid and those on social welfare.  If that is the direction it is heading, the Government should beware because we will not tolerate it.</P>
        <P>Section 13 extends the powers of social welfare inspectors to investigate employers, contractors and subcontractors who are found to be employing people.  However, it does not suggest <Col N="313"/>that the businesses will be closed if they are suspected of employing people working in the black economy.  This must be removed and due process regarding fraudulent claims should take place in the courts.  If the person is found guilty then the money should be taken from him or her over a period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify that when I quoted the FLAC recommendation that the section be deleted, I was not necessarily supporting it.  I was merely stating that without the relevant clarification that is the extreme change one might seek.  If a person is in receipt of, for example, &euro;250 when he or she should have been in receipt of &euro;200, the Department can claim the &euro;50 but it cannot claim the &euro;250.  Will the Minister confirm that will be the case?  If that is the case, I have no difficulty with the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is another side to this argument.  There are good and bad people in all walks of life.  There are good and bad people signing on just as there are good and bad people working in the social welfare system.  Will everybody be treated equally here?  I deal with many people who tell me they have dealt with a bad social welfare official who neglected to advise them of their full entitlements and they did not hear of such entitlements until it was too late.  When they subsequently went back to the person working in the office, they were advised they could not get back-pay as they should have known about it and applied for it, even though the official knew about it in the first place.  If the Department is going to nail people for accidentally receiving overpayments, will we do anything to these people who do not advise claimants of their full entitlements?  At times it is nearly as if they were handing out their own money and were on a bonus scheme for not advising people about entitlements.  I get such reports from many people and I would like the Government to pursue those people also.  If we are going to chase the small guy, we should also chase the big guy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The staff of the Department of Social Protection receive a great deal of training and there is a culture of giving people advice, publishing a considerable amount of information on the Department website and making information available in particular through citizens&rsquo; information centres and MABS for people who are in difficulty with mortgages.  Regarding citizens&rsquo; information structures, I was very happy recently to have launched a new system of advocates for people with a disability to ensure they get the relevant information on their entitlements in dealing with the social welfare system.  If some of the people the Deputy has met have a bad experience, I will certainly convey that back to the Department, but the Department invests a great deal in training and information for people who wish to avail of social welfare support.</P>
        <P>The core issue here is confidence in the social welfare system.  There are a small number of modest measures in the Bill that address fraud with a view to limiting it and maintaining confidence in the social welfare contract.  Someone who starts work at 18 and pays PRSI until he or she retires is entitled to feel confident that money goes to people who require that support.  That is the political contract we have as a society.  The number of people who make fraudulent claims is probably exaggerated.  I saw the recent British reports to which Deputy Wallace alluded.  However, they are none the less extremely important in undermining confidence in the system.  There is a widespread belief that the black economy is back in business in a way that has not been seen since the 1980s.</P>
        <P>Section 13 extends the powers of social welfare inspectors to investigate employers, contractors and subcontractors who are found to be employing people and to investigate those workers and provides for more practical arrangements where social welfare inspectors form part of multi-agency checkpoints with garda&iacute; and customs officers.  This has been done along the Border and regarding specific occupations from time to time.  It is an important issue for the <Col N="314"/>Department, the Garda and Customs and Excise to send out a message that we are serious about preventing fraud.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for the amendment in which he proposes to insert the term &ldquo;obtained as a result of conscious fraud&rdquo;.  However, the substance of the amendment is already covered in section 18 and therefore I do not propose to accept the amendment.  The provisions of section 18 need to be read in conjunction with section 17.  Section 17 provides that where a person is required to repay any social welfare overpayment, the amount of that overpayment may be deferred, suspended, reduced or cancelled, subject to the conditions and circumstances specified in regulations.  My Department is obliged to make every effort to recover the full amount of any overpayment that occurs.  Depending on the particular circumstances of any case, arrangements may be put in place for that repayment of the overpayment to be a single payment, by way of regular repayments or by way of regular deductions from a weekly social welfare payment.  In certain circumstances, for instance where an overpayment occurs following an administrative error on the part of my Department which the claimant could not reasonably have been expected to have noticed, the overpayment may be reduced or cancelled in order to be fair.</P>
        <P>Section 18 refers to an overpayment that arises from the fraudulent claiming of a social welfare payment.  I do not understand what difficulty Deputies could have with the proposal that a person should not be able to offset the amount to be repaid against potential social welfare benefits for which he or she might have qualified during the period to which the overpayment relates to prevent him or her from playing the system.  It is quite a reasonable provision.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh attempted to address it using slightly different wording, that is, by using the term &ldquo;conscious fraud&rdquo;.  According to my legal advice, I am not sure that term would be the appropriate legal term.  I am not a lawyer and I am relying on the legal advice I have received.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Social Protection, I must reiterate the importance of prosecuting perpetrators of fraud.  As I stated, we prosecute those responsible for fraud in respect of social welfare and taxation and we are able, as a society, to take action against actions of bankers that have resulted in enormous losses to the State.  Business fraud, white collar crime and impunity are not acceptable, but neither is social welfare fraud.  I want that message to go out as clearly as possible from this Chamber.  I recommend section 18 to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <P LI="1">In page 22, paragraph (<i>b</i>), line 24, after &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the Local Authority Franchise Offices&rdquo;.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P FLI="0">This amendment is to facilitate, hopefully in the near future, the franchise office in local authorities to use the PPS number to register electors.  Currently, somebody must fill in a registration form and the registers are continuously out of date as a result of people moving house or whatever.  If we facilitate in some way the use of an individual&rsquo;s PPS number as our electoral number it would make for a much more accurate electoral register throughout the country.  It will allow the staff on polling day to record people&rsquo;s votes and ensure the register is as accurate as possible.  It is only a mechanism; it does not mean this would happen overnight.  It would merely facilitate a debate at some stage and might require an electoral amendment Bill to be proposed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I am aware that other parties have considered this and there appears to be some agreement that we need to ensure that changes are brought about and that our electoral register system is brought into the new century, especially with the advent of new technology.  It would be a reasonable change and would not add any additional costs at this stage to the State.  I am interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view on it but it would be even more interesting to hear what the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government would have to say about the system I propose.</P>

    <Title>National Asset Management Agency</Title>
      <Speaker pid="TomBarry"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Barry</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Minister to establish an agricultural review board within the National Asset Management Agency.  The importance of agriculture to the Irish economy cannot be underestimated.  While previous Governments took their finger off the pulse in respect of the importance of agriculture, we are now back to basics once again.  Agricultural value added products are a key part of our exports.  If treated properly and maintained over the next few years, they have the potential to grow our exports by &euro;1 billion per annum.</P>
        <P>However, many agribusinesses were targeted by banks.  They were targeted because they had good cash flow during the boom years, but they also did not have much leveraging on their assets.  The buzz phrases at the time were about diversifying portfolios and leveraging assets.  However, now we know the real truth of what was going on.  Many of these businesses got into property and so on because they were tied within quotas and growth restrictions within their own industry.  We now have a situation where these businesses have a two-tier business model.  They have a core agricultural part that is profitable, and an unprofitable property part.</P>
        <P>Agriculture is cyclical.  It has peaks and troughs.  NAMA could learn some of the lessons from agriculture before it begins to dispose of its assets.  Many people in agricultural communities know how to manage property over generations.  Disposing of assets quickly is certainly not the way to do this.  If NAMA officials think that there is a quick fix method to disposing of its property, then they are sadly mistaken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have heard complaints about how NAMA was dealing with its property portfolio, and it often sounded incredible.  However, I was horrified to learn how it was dealing with a large piggery containing up to 30,000 pigs.  NAMA froze the agreed facilities of this operation and changed its trading terms.  A person who cannot feed his animals cannot sell his product and will have a welfare issue down the road.  This is unbelievable.  As I dug into the issue, further questions came up.  I ask the Minister to consider amending section 221 of the NAMA Act to allow constructive representation from people like myself and other Members of the House.  NAMA is independent of politics by legislation, and this is a terrible mistake.  I also urge the Minister to consider the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for NAMA, because at the moment nobody seems to be responsible for what is now &euro;70 billion of State assets.  If NAMA is not taken under control, there might yet be a tribunal over it.  It is too serious for there to be no control over it.</P>
        <P>By their very nature, piggeries create indigenous employment.  Everybody wants to see indigenous employment, because it is the ultimate in buying Irish.  Piggeries purchase a lot of grain from our cereal industry and keep many other family farms and businesses going.  They displace imports, and food imports cost &euro;5 billion over the last few years.  That is incredible.  While we must increase our exports, we must also be conscious of reducing our imports to make ourselves more competitive in the longer term.  If we lose our indigenous pigmeat production, we will be at the mercy of imports.  If we are at the mercy of imports, we will have no control over the price inflation that will take place.  Once foreign producers know that we are dependent on importing pigmeat, the price will increase.  The consumer will not thank us for having a more expensive shopping basket.</P>
        <P>We are at the end of the supply chain in Ireland and it is absolutely imperative that NAMA understands the food industry.  It will have to deal with food businesses.  NAMA cannot act <Col N="318"/>with impunity.  I urge the Minister to create a review board immediately, so that any agricultural issue that comes before NAMA is dealt with in a knowledgeable and constructive fashion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall)</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Barry for raising this issue tonight.  I am responding to this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coveney.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance does not consider it necessary to establish an agricultural review body within NAMA, although I understand that the agency has agreed to review its procedures where farming assets involving livestock are concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Incidentally, the NAMA board has established four statutory committees under section 32 of the NAMA Act: an audit committee, a credit committee, a finance and operating risk committee and a risk management committee.  It has also established two advisory committees under section 33: a planning advisory committee and a Northern Ireland advisory committee.</P>
        <P>NAMA has acquired the property loans of about 850 debtors.  The loans of the largest 180 debtor connections, accounting for &euro;61 billion of debt, will be managed directly by NAMA.  The rest will be managed by the banks under delegated authority.  It is expected that nearly all, if not all, debtors who have farming interests or a significant interest in agribusiness will fall into the latter category and will be managed by the banks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the particular case which has prompted the Deputy&rsquo;s motion, the loans had been advanced for agricultural purposes and the property development element was not material.  NAMA did not consider it appropriate that it should manage the loans.  Section 84(1) of the NAMA Act provides that NAMA is not obliged to acquire each and every loan, even where loans are eligible under the legislation.  In this instance, the loans had been acquired under expedited transfer and therefore in advance of due diligence being carried out.  When the purpose of the loans became apparent, the NAMA board made a decision to reverse the transfer and the Minister understands that the loans were re-acquired by the bank concerned.</P>
        <P>In regard to the suggestion that NAMA is shutting down viable businesses, NAMA has assured the Minister that it is committed to contributing to the objectives of the National Asset Management Agency Act which, among other things, requires it to contribute to the social and economic development of the State, in addition to protecting the interests of the taxpayer by ensuring that the value of any assets securing its loans is not diminished.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, as part of the business plan process and ongoing management of the debtor relationship, NAMA is actively engaging with debtors to get their assets to produce income and is approving decisions relating to the underlying security, including lease agreements between the debtor and third parties where it makes commercial sense to do so.  There is no reluctance on the part of NAMA to approve commercially viable arrangements.</P>
        <P>NAMA has assured the Minister that it is a particular priority for the agency, where it has acquired loans, to minimise the adverse impact on the viability of any business or on the sustainability of any jobs that may be at stake.  NAMA fully recognises the importance of ensuring the continued viability of businesses, which can generate cash flow to repay debt and provide sustainable employment.</P>
        <P>NAMA has advised that it is currently developing sectoral policies which will govern its strategic approach towards key sub-sectors in its loan portfolio.  These policies will be publicised after the completion of the debtor business plan process.  In that context, NAMA has advised that it has now reviewed the business plans of the largest 40 debtors whose loans it has acquired and that the business plans of most other large debtors are currently at advanced stages of preparation.</P><Col N="319"/>
        <P>A debtor&rsquo;s business plan essentially consists of individual asset plans for each of his properties.  For those debtors who can satisfy NAMA as to their viability, the agency will agree specific asset plans for each of their assets.  Those plans may, among other options, involve disposals or completions.  In determining a plan for any asset, NAMA will assess the supply and demand for similar assets in the same area or region.  In particular, the agency will also be very mindful of whatever planning policies have been set by the local authority in each instance.</P>
        <P>NAMA will not normally directly manage the loans of debtors who have farming interests or a significant interest in agri-business nor will it seek to shut down viable businesses.  Under these circumstances, the Minister does not consider it necessary to establish an agricultural review body within the National Asset Management Agency.  NAMA has, however, agreed to conduct a review of its procedures where farming assets involving livestock are concerned.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>

    <Title>Local Authority Charges</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DerekNolan"><NameTxt>Deputy Derek Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is quite a technical issue but I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, will bear with me.  It concerns rate collection by Galway City Council, of which I was a member, and rebates given to owners of vacant properties.  If there are vacant units in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, rates are charged but there is a 50% rebate &mdash; in other words, 50% rates are paid on vacant properties.  In Galway and Waterford cities, the two other urban councils, a 100% rebate is given.  That means there is a discrepancy between Dublin, Cork and Limerick and Galway and Waterford.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The city council in Galway still must provide services for those vacant buildings, maintain the roads and footpaths outside them and spend money on the upkeep of the area surrounding them.  The effect on Galway City Council of the 100% rebate is financial in that the city loses out on approximately &euro;1 million in rates revenue each year.  As a former member of the city council for two years and as a member of the corporate policy group, &euro;1 million would go a very long way in Galway city.  Just this week &euro;800,000 was granted by the Government under the jobs initiative and it will upgrade eight road junctions and will provide a CCTV control unit, a greenway and a pedestrian way and major traffic movement incentives across the city.  That is on a one off basis.  Some &euro;1 million per annum by applying the legislation to Galway and other urban areas would go a long way.</P>
        <P>The other benefit would be to other ratepayers in the city who would see their rates bill being shared not only with other businesses which are operating but with empty units.  There would be a greater contribution to, and burden sharing of, the rates bill.  It would also have the effect of increasing business activity.  In Galway, some landlords keep rents high and do not let units because they want to ensure rents stay high.  Forcing those empty units to pay rates would encourage the owners to let them at lower rents and it would have an impact on rents in the city in that it would bring them down.  It would also bring more people into the city because more people would use the shops or businesses which would open and it would generate economic activity.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that ratepayers in Galway city, businesses and the business community, are very much in the favour of the extension of this legislation and would like to see this change as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Galway is one of the gateway cities and is a regional capital but we are subject to different legislation from Cork, Dublin and Limerick.  There is no reason that legislation should not be extended to the other two major urban areas, namely, Galway and Waterford.  I understand why it might not apply to rural county councils because they have not suffered the same loss <Col N="320"/>in terms of units closing down and they are dependent on the regional cities, the centres of business and activity, to generate business and they are commuter belts for those cities.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister bring forward legislation to bring parity to Galway City Council and Waterford County Council?  I have seen previous responses from the Department which acknowledge the discrepancy and the problem but state that it is not willing to bring forward legislation to solve the problem.  At a time when resources and funding are scarce, if legislation could generate significant income for a city council or for any State or public authority, we should not shy away from introducing it as it would not cost very much.  I ask that we resolve the funding issue, the discrepancy and the inactivity in the Galway city area and that legislation on this matter be brought forward as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and I thank Deputy Nolan for raising it.</P>
        <P>Commercial rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of local services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  All commercial rates collected within a local authority area are spent exclusively in providing services in that area.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</P>
        <P>Rates are a local property tax levied on the occupiers and, in some cases, the owners of fixed commercial properties.  Under current legislation, the owner rather than the occupier may be liable for commercial rates if the property in question is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sections 14 and 23 of the Local Government Act 1946 provide that where a property in a county council or urban area is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for payment of rates.  However, the owner is entitled to a 100% refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes.  These are where the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment.</P>
        <P>A small number of urban local authorities have historically had separate legal provision enabling a refund of 50% of rates on vacant properties.  This separate legislation governs refunds in Dublin, Cork and Limerick &mdash; section 71 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1930; section 29 of the Limerick City Management Act 1934; and section 20 of the Cork City Management (Amendment) Act 1941, respectively.  While the same criteria for refunds apply, 50% of the rates paid is refundable to the owner of vacant premises in these cities.  No such separate provision exists for Galway or Waterford City Councils, meaning they are, as are the majority of local authorities, subject to the provisions of the 1946 Act.  Any proposal to alter the existing rebate system would require legislative amendment on a nationwide basis.</P>
        <P>The Minister is acutely aware of the pressures on small and medium-sized businesses and the challenging economic environment in which many property and business owners operate at present.  In this context, the Government is focused on reducing the costs of doing business to support competitiveness and employment in the economy and to protect the interests of communities.  A move to a standardised commercial rates rebate of 50% for vacant properties <Col N="321"/>would not be in keeping with this focus and would add to the costs for relevant property owners who may be challenged economically as they seek suitable tenants for vacant commercial properties.</P>
        <P>In view of this, it is not the intention of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, at this time to amend the current commercial rates legislation relating to the refund of rates for vacant commercial properties.  He will, however, continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review and is determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and certain costs in the local government sector.  I thank Deputy Nolan for raising the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>Late last year the McNamara Construction building empire collapsed as a result of huge debts.  The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, instigated the collapse by putting McNamara Construction into receivership.  The ripples from that event have spread far and wide.</P>
        <P>In Donegal North-East, Letterkenny hospital and the people of Donegal have long and eagerly awaited the provision of an extension for a new accident and emergency ward with three modern floors above it.  Indeed, recently I had the opportunity to tour the premises with the assistant manager, Mr. Paddy Rooney, and to see the huge potential of that building.  The decision on McNamara Construction means that the project has stalled.  It should have been completed by spring this year but we now understand from the management of Letterkenny General Hospital that it will not be completed until spring 2012.  Furthermore, many of the subcontractors have been left in a desperate financial situation.  These are small businesses which, although they were subcontractors, presumed they were in safe hands financially because they were carrying out a public contract.  They have been left in a mess.</P>
        <P>Before the general election, the candidates or Deputies of at least one of the Government parties assured the electorate that they would deal with this issue, but the Government has been in office for almost 100 days and there is still no resolution.  It is time for the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, and the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, to intervene urgently.  There have been knock-on effects.  There is a spill-over of patients on trolleys into the coffee dock of the hospital, clinics have been cancelled and there is talk of ward closures.  There were a number of quotes reported in the media today from the front-line staff.  Nurses said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the staff or the facilities to cope; simple as that.&rdquo;; &ldquo;The situation is intolerable and cannot continue.  Morale is very, very low.&rdquo;; &ldquo;We are at breaking point.  We do our best with what we have but there is only so much we can do.&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Many of us are at breaking point.&rdquo;.  That is the response of the nurses, the people whom we trust to work on the front line.  They are being failed by the Government in this matter.  It must be tackled.</P>
        <P>I raised this issue with the chairman of NAMA, Mr. Frank Daly, at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly recently.  He is a decent and honourable man and he spoke about the difficulty and pain of sending a company, in this case a building empire, into receivership and how there would have to be pain.  In this case the people and subcontractors of Donegal North-East are feeling the pain.  I urge the Government to do the decent thing.  It can hide behind legalities and talk about this and that, but the fact remains that the subcontractors, working on a public contract, have not been paid.  They are owed tens of thousands of euro each.  They are on the verge of collapse.  More important than that shameful episode is the fact that there will be a one year delay, at least, in delivering this critical public infrastructure.  It is currently lying empty and not delivering the services that are required.</P>
        <P>I wish to express my serious concern about the demands of the HSE for further cuts at Letterkenny General Hospital.  It has gone to the well many times with its demands for cutbacks <Col N="322"/>and the well is now thoroughly dry.  There have been cuts of &euro;3 million in Letterkenny General Hospital in the last year.  I urge the Minister of State and her colleagues to avoid impacting on front-line services and to guarantee to me and other representatives of the people of Donegal that they will provide the necessary resources so front-line staff will no longer be obliged to offer the quotes we have read in recent days.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue as it provides an opportunity to update the House on the matter and to outline the background to the current situation and the action taken by the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including the construction of health care facilities such as the new accommodation at Letterkenny General Hospital.  The Minister for Health is not a party to the construction contracts and has no legal standing in the matter.  The delay to the construction is a result of the legal complexities of the receivership process.  The HSE is doing its best to expedite matters.  This is a difficult situation which has arisen through no fault of the HSE.</P>
        <P>The project at Letterkenny General Hospital will deliver a new accident and emergency department and a new medical assessment unit with an additional 29 beds.  A total of 72 replacement beds will be provided in the medical ward block over the accident and emergency department and the medical assessment unit.  Following the appointment of a receiver, the Health Service Executive took control of the construction works and terminated the contractor&rsquo;s obligation to complete the works under clause 12 of the contract.  Notwithstanding this, the contract terms remain in force and the HSE is legally bound by these terms.  The HSE must at all times operate within the terms of the contract.  There is no basis on which it can be asked to do otherwise.</P>
        <P>As is best practice, an insurance bond is an important condition contained in this construction contract.  The purpose of an insurance bond is to ensure a construction project can be delivered to the satisfaction of the contracting authority in the event that the contractor is not in a position to complete the project.  This is a complex legal procedure and all parties are bound by the conditions of the bond.</P>
        <P>The executive and its legal advisers are working with the insurer, sometimes called the bondsman, to ensure the completion of the project.  Subject to contract and legal constraints, the HSE will, where possible, take into account the interests of subcontractors but, under the legal circumstances now prevailing, cannot give guarantees in this regard.  In accordance with the terms of the bond, the insurer is entitled to nominate a contractor who will complete the project to the satisfaction of the HSE.</P>
        <P>Discussions with the insurer are well advanced and the most recent meeting of parties took place late last week.  The HSE now awaits the formal proposal from the insurer as to arrangements for completion of the construction.  When contracts have been signed and construction commences on site, the best estimate of the HSE at this stage is that the remaining construction work could be completed in approximately 12 weeks.  Following this, the building must be equipped and commissioned, which the HSE estimates could take a minimum of six to eight weeks.</P>
        <P>I wish to assure the House regarding the management of the accident and emergency services at Letterkenny.  The management of Letterkenny General Hospital states that the admission of patients presenting as emergencies is undertaken as promptly as possible and any delays in the emergency unit for admission to a bed are minimised.  This focus on managing the emergency workload is reflected in the excellent rating on HealthStat that Letterkenny General <Col N="323"/>Hospital continues to receive when compared with peer hospitals.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and assure him everything possible is being done by the HSE to ensure the project is completed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue.  I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, is in the Chamber as she has responsibility for the primary care sector in the Department.  The proposal to end the GP service at the north-east doctor on call, NEDOC, centre in Cavan after 10 p.m. each night is the cause of serious concern throughout a very large part of County Cavan.  The centre is located on the grounds of Cavan General Hospital and is centrally situated to provide an out-of-hours GP service.  Over the past 24 hours I have had numerous calls from the public, from people who availed of the GP services, from elderly people worried about this development and from parents who had to bring children to the centre for treatment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">NEDOC covers a huge geographical area from the outskirts of Dublin city to west Cavan, west of Bawnboy village and as far as Carrigallen, County Leitrim.  It embraces counties Monaghan, Meath, Cavan, Louth and that part of County Leitrim.  There are four treatment centres at Cavan, Castleblayney, Drogheda and Navan.  The proposed restructuring of the service from the end of this month will mean there will be no duty doctor's service at the Cavan centre after 10 p.m.  Such restructuring will reduce the number of doctors working at night from four to three, with the Cavan centre alert losing this vital service.</P>
        <P>I understand the board of directors at NEDOC has been liaising with the HSE for months and outlining the need to adequately fund the scheme and retain the current complement of doctors in order to continue the existing night service.  The medical people and particularly the doctors have always stated that four doctors should work at night in order to ensure patient safety and the quality of the service.  We are talking about dividing four counties into three.  Cavan and Monaghan are large, rural counties.  If this proposal is allowed to proceed, it will place a further burden on doctors in County Cavan to travel long distances to provide night services from the other centres on a rota basis.  Doctors are busy in their practices.  An inevitable consequence will be increased patient referral to accident and emergency units and the increased use of ambulances.  An important consideration is the additional cost to patients getting to the treatment centres.  Not every family has a car.  Many elderly people depend on family members to bring them to treatment centres.  If this proposal is enacted, certain parts of County Cavan will be more than one hour from the nearest treatment centre.  That would be unacceptable to the people.</P>
        <P>It is ironic that in the recent HSE report on services for 2010, the progress made in the past year in providing more services in the community was mentioned.  I trust the drive to provide more services away from our hospitals, in the community, will be continued and intensified.  If this proposal is allowed to proceed, it flies in the face of the policy, which has so many attributes.  I implore the Minister of State to intercede with the HSE to ensure the current level of services provided at night by GPs is continued.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of GP out-of-hours co-operatives throughout the country is an essential part of our health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that, to the greatest extent possible, care needs are met in the primary care setting.  Out-of-hours co-operatives are now in place in all HSE areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties.  The service can be accessed through a single lo-call telephone number in each region and caters for both public and private patients.</P><Col N="324"/>
        <P>Out-of-hours co-operatives allow GPs to manage the provision of urgently needed care for their patients while their surgeries are closed in the evenings, at weekends and on public holidays.  The co-ops also afford GPs reasonable, off-duty arrangements. While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in these co-ops, under the GMS contract, GPs have a responsibility to enable contact to be made with them or a locum for emergencies outside normal practice hours.  As matters stand, it is a matter for the GPs how they arrange this cover.  I accept that this is not entirely satisfactory and this is a matter of concern to me.</P>
        <P>The NEDOC GP out-of-hours service has been in place for the past ten years and facilitates a pooling of resources and a rota arrangement.  The GPs provide the service with appropriate supports from the HSE, with the aim of providing a quality service to the patients in the north east, outside of normal surgery hours, in respect of urgent, non-routine cases.  GPs put in place a revised rota from March, which includes a GP in each of four treatment centres during core hours and a number of GPs available with cars to attend home visits.  Since March, there have been four GPs available on the 11 p.m to 8 a.m shift, seven nights a week, known as the red eye shift.  NEDOC has indicated in recent days that it intends to reduce cover on the red eye shift to three GPs with effect from July.  It has also indicated it intends to reduce some core hours during the summer months and these will be restored during the busier winter period.</P>
        <P>The HSE is awaiting the revised rota from NEDOC and will evaluate this against activity.  The budget for the NEDOC service in 2010 was &euro;7.735 million, while the national budget for GP out-of-hours services in 2010 amounted to in the region of &euro;98 million.  The HSE completed a national review of GP out-of-hours services in March 2010.  This was the first national review to be undertaken since the commencement of publicly funded GP co-operatives in Ireland in 1999 and provided an opportunity to consider the nine national GP co-ops and the four extended hours services.</P>
        <P>The review makes 13 recommendations designed to strengthen and standardise the service across the country.  These include the recommendation that all co-ops move to a nurse triage system.  This recommendation was implemented in NEDOC in March.  Trained nurses provide the triage service supported by computer-assisted decision making software.  The progress in the establishment of GP co-ops since 1999 is considered by the HSE to be a highly significant quality initiative for patient care, general practice and the health service as a whole.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the issues raised by Deputy Smith.  I ask him to communicate with my office and provide me with details on where complaints have arisen, the numbers and the times.  I will personally follow up on these complaints.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>   if there are any red line issues in her Department.   </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of red line issues arises in the context of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling Ireland&rsquo;s economic crisis and, in particular in the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure currently underway.  The Government has not singled out any single programme, scheme or service in the social welfare area or anywhere else that is 100% guaranteed to continue indefinitely in exactly its current format.  To that extent, there are no red line issues in any department given the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.   The appropriate level of overall expenditure by my Department will be considered in the context of Budget 2012 and subsequent Budgets. This consideration will be informed by the commitment in the Programme for Government to maintain social welfare rates. The outcome of those deliberations will determine the extent to which the full range of current schemes and services can be maintained at current levels. </P>
        <P>While the payments made by my Department have very positive economic and social effects, there is an ongoing necessity to curtail expenditure in 2012 and in later years. This is necessary for many reasons, not least so that we can continue to make social welfare payments at appropriate levels, sustaining social cohesion and treating people with dignity.  The Comprehensive Review of Expenditure currently underway in all government departments and agencies will form the basis towards achieving this objective. Draft Reviews will be submitted to the Steering Committee in July and they will be finalised over the summer.  The Review will then be considered by the Government in September.</P>
        <P>The objectives of the Review are to inform the best use of resources and to guide us in achieving the Government&rsquo;s public Service Reform objectives.  Better use of resources will enable us to meet overall fiscal consolidation targets; re-align spending with Programme for <Col N="326"/>Government priorities and target resources at most effective programmes and set new objectives.</P>
        <P>All Government departments and agencies will be covered by the Review, with each department preparing a comprehensive assessment and review of Programme savings and the identification of efficiencies and reforms.</P>
        <P>The Government will also establish a Tax and Social Welfare Commission to examine entitlements of self employed and the elimination of disincentives to employment including the interaction between the taxation and the welfare systems to ensure that work is worthwhile. In particular, it will examine family and child income supports, and a means by which self-employed people can be insured against unemployment and sickness.  The Commission&rsquo;s report will upon completion be made available to the Government for consideration.</P>
        <P>Any changes to the wide range of schemes and services provided by my department, including the levels of welfare payments, will be informed by the overall Government wide options identified in the Review to better and more efficiently target scarce resources.</P>

	<P>The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department.  A key objective of the Department&rsquo;s control strategy is to ensure that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time.  A four-pronged control strategy has been adopted by the Department, namely;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />the  prevention of fraud and error at the initial claim stage;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />early detection through effective review of claims in payment;</P>

        <P FLI="0">Control savings are an estimate of savings from various control activities across all the social welfare scheme areas.

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 54 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed in the Programme for Government to developing a carers&rsquo; strategy.  It will consider how best to progress the development of the strategy, taking into account the prevailing economic realities and the work that was carried out previously. The Department of the Taoiseach chaired an interdepartmental group in 2008 which undertook work, to develop a National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. The Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Health and Children, and Social and Family Affairs, as well as the Health Services Executive (HSE) and F&Aacute;S were represented on the group.</P>
        <P>As my Department is responsible for providing income supports for carers, it will of course have a role in developing and implementing a strategy. However many of the issues of most concern to carers are the responsibility of other Departments, in particular the Department of Health. As the strategy has not yet been developed it is not possible at this time to give any estimation as to the plans for implementation, however it will have to be developed within existing available resources.  In developing and implementing the strategy, the Government will take account of our IMF and EU commitments, as well the outcomes of the comprehensive review of expenditure currently being undertaken by each Department.</P>

        <P>The Jobs Initiative recently announced by the Government contains additional labour market activation measures that aim to provide unemployed people with enhanced opportunities to maintain and develop their skills and competencies while also offering the possibility of securing valuable work experience. These measures will assist those seeking employment to maintain their links with the labour market while also improving their prospects of securing employment.</P>
        <P>The Jobs Initiative contains an additional 20,900 education, training and work experience places for the unemployed.  A key element of that initiative is the introduction by my Department of the National Internship Scheme (NIS) which will provide 5,000 places for internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months in organisations in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors. These opportunities will provide participants with valuable work experience that will develop their skills and enhance their career prospects. The national internship scheme will be launched in July. In addition, from July 2, the rate of PRSI on jobs paying up to &euro;356 per week will be halved to 4.25%, up to end 2013.</P>
        <P>These measures and others announced as part of the jobs initiative, complement ongoing development in the labour market policy area. The 5,000 NIS places, for example, are additional to the 5,000 places announced under the T&uacute;s community work placement initiative in last December&rsquo;s Budget. My Department also operates a range of employment support measure designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.  Supports available include the back to education allowance, the back to work schemes and employer job PRSI incentive scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition to these employment support measures, my Department is responsible for the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) which is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s labour market policy. The Department is currently in the process of revising the NEAP to achieve a more efficient organisation, targeting and use of resources as well as increasing the mix of appropriate interventions to be targeted at identified cohorts in order to improve an individual&rsquo;s employability by providing them with a path to employment. This includes increasing activation activity, including the numbers referred through the NEAP process, increasing the frequency and intensity of the intervention to individuals throughout their unemployment and the provision of appropriate State unemployment supports.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government states that a new National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES) will be established under the management of the Department of Social Protection. The objective is to integrate all employment and benefit support services in a single delivery unit which will provide a &lsquo;one stop shop&rsquo; for people wishing to establish their benefit entitlements, seek employment and / or seek advice about their training options. The focus is very much on the individual, his / her right to a payment and the corresponding responsibility to engage in employment, training or upskilling, as appropriate. This should improve a person&rsquo;s life chances. A number of streams of work are already underway which will facilitate the <Col N="329"/>establishment of the integrated service including the transfer of the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to the Department of Social Protection and the secondment of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive at the beginning of this year. The transfer and integration of the employment and community employment services of F&Aacute;S to the Department is also underway and it is envisaged that the integration of staff will commence later this year.</P>
        <P>The measures announced under the Jobs Initiative, together with ongoing and planned further development of a range of activation and employment support measures, will have a significant impact on the Live Register, particularly in so far as they prepare unemployed people for jobs that will be generated as the economy improves.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>

	<P>My Department is establishing a new National Employment and Entitlements Service, as provided for in the Programme for Government, which will integrate employment and benefit payment services within the Department. In establishing and developing the National Employment and Entitlements Service the Department has set out to design the new service based on a case management approach with the objective of providing a more customised and personal service to customers. In line with international good practice, this new service will focus primarily on activation. The objective is to encourage and enable customers to embark on developmental pathways appropriate to their needs; pathways to employment and/or training and/or personal development.  A key feature of the new service will be that customers will be expected to engage with these options in order to retain their entitlement to full benefit payments.  </P>
        <P>As part of the process of developing and implementing this new business model the Department has commenced a major and comprehensive programme of change management entailing the integration of services previously, or currently, provided by other agencies &mdash; including both the Employment Services and Community Employment Programmes of F&Aacute;S and the Community Welfare Services (CWS) of the HSE.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the timeline for the development of the National Employment and Entitlements Service the assignment and integration of functions and the full transformation to a case management approach focused on activation, will be a multi-annual programme of work.  However, significant progress has already been made and many aspects of the new service will be delivered within the coming twelve months. The administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has already been transferred to the Department of Social Protection with the secondment of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive at the beginning of this year. The intention is to have the staff fully transferred into the Department by the end of September this year.  This will enable the Department to integrate the payment of all benefits into one organisation simplifying customer processes.</P>
        <P>Planning for the transfer and integration of the Employment Services and Community Employment Services of F&Aacute;S to the Department has already commenced and it is envisaged that the transfer of staff will commence later this year. Again this will enable us to simplify and integrate the delivery of employment support services to customers.</P><Col N="330"/>
        <P>Even in advance of integration, F&Aacute;S and the Department are already working on a number of pilot projects in relation to the development of case management, the identification of those who are most at risk of falling into long-term unemployment, and the provision of appropriately tailored responses to their needs. These pilot projects will be completed and evaluated in the coming months after which approaches will be developed for their roll-out nationwide as part of the National Employment and Entitlements Service.  A key objective of the Government in relation to the new service is that it will offer users a high level of personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment.  This will be achieved through the use of proactive approaches and modern case management systems.</P>
        <P>As part of such an approach, F&Aacute;S and the Department are collaborating on the development the National Internship Scheme.  This scheme which will provide 5,000 internships of up to nine months duration will be launched on 1 July 2011. Participants will retain their social welfare entitlements and will also receive a &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; of &euro;50 per week. The scheme, which will be the first public manifestation of the National Employment and Entitlements Service, is already receiving strong support from the business community and potential participants.</P>
        <P>As regards the Community Employment scheme, the aim of the scheme continues as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment and/or further education and training. The programme will continue to be managed towards this objective in order to meet the needs of participants and the community. It should be noted that responsibility for skills training undertaken by F&Aacute;S currently resides with the Department of Education and Skills. The future development of the training and skills services of F&Aacute;S is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.</P>

        <Quest>   the number of cases for carer&rsquo;s allowance currently on appeal and awaiting decision whether by way of oral hearing or otherwise; the average time for cases on appeal to be dealt with; when it is expected that the backlog will be cleared; if further staff resources are required; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[15320/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that there are currently 2,395 carer&rsquo;s allowance cases on appeal and awaiting decision. The average waiting time for carer&rsquo;s allowance appeals dealt with by way of a summary decision in 2010 was 26.9 weeks, while the average time to process an oral hearing was 47.3 weeks. These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the deciding officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s inspectors and medical assessors, that is deemed necessary. As can be seen from the figures, a considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. In order to be fair to all appellants, all appeals are dealt with in chronological order.</P>
        <P>The annual intake of appeals has increased from 14,070 in 2007 to 32,432 in 2010, an increase of 18,362 (130.5%) and currently it appears that another 30,000 will be received during 2011. The need for additional resources to deal with this very significant increase has been recognised by the Department. In this context, 9 additional Appeals Officers have been assigned to the <Col N="331"/>Office in recent weeks. These assignments will augment the 3 appointments made in 2010, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers serving in the office to 29.</P>
        <P>I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals conducts its business is under constant ongoing review and the processes are continuously being enhanced to achieve better outputs, in particular to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.</P>

        <Quest>   if there are estimated numbers for those who will transfer from rent supplement to the rental accommodation scheme in the lifetime of this Government; if she has talked to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government regarding the challenges that local authorities will encounter in sourcing sufficient RAS houses to satisfy the need; the outcome of those discussions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. At the end of December 2010 there were 97,260 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 63% in the last three years. The rental accommodation scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Details of these cases are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities through the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including: the traditional social housing, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, the RAS.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2007, there were 32,123 rent supplement recipients who were in payment for 18 months and while the number decreased to 31,667 at the end of 2008 it increased again to 35,133 at the end of 2009. There are now 48,073 currently in payment for 18 months or more. Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government show that at the end of April 2011, a total of 33,554 transfers from rent supplement to local authorities have occurred since 2005. Of these 19,074 were housed directly under RAS and 14,480 were accommodated under other social housing options. The target number of transfers to local authorities set by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for 2011 is for 5,500 tenants to transfer.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware the Programme for Government contains specific commitments in relation to the rent supplement scheme including to progressively reduce reliance on rent supplement, with eligible recipients moving to the rental accommodation scheme. In this regard I and my Department are working closely with the Minister for Housing and Planning and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to accelerate the rate of transfer of long-term rent supplement claimants to RAS and other sources of local authority provided housing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The social security rights of people moving around the EU are governed by EU Regulations 883/2004 and 987/2009. These Regulations, which have been in existence in one form or another since 1959, are designed to co-ordinate the social security systems of the various Member States so that people and their families are not disadvantaged when they move within the EU. A key principle of the coordination system is that persons moving to different Member States are subject to the same obligations and enjoy the same benefits as the nationals of those Member States.  With few exceptions, it is the country of employment which receives the social security contributions and which is generally responsible for the payment of benefits. Commitments in the Government Programme centre around the payment of child benefit for non-resident children.</P>
        <P>Irish child benefit is classed as a family benefit under EU Regulations and there are specific rules governing the payment of these benefits. EU nationals who come to work in Ireland, and who pay Irish social security contributions, are entitled to receive child benefit in respect of their families, even if the family resides in another EU Member State. The equality provisions of the Regulations require that these payments are made at the same rates applicable to a person whose family is resident in Ireland. These provisions are seen as important in an EU context for the role they play in encouraging and facilitating the free movement of EU citizens.</P>
        <P>The normal procedure for amending EU legislation is that a formal proposal is put forward by the EU Commission and this is then discussed and refined at various working parties and groups before being approved by a Council of Ministers. The proposal is then considered by the European Parliament in consultation with the Council.  In order to make progress on the commitment in the Programme for Government it is necessary to enlist the support of other countries and the EU Commission.</P>
        <P>I met EU Commissioner Andor on his recent visit to Dublin and took the opportunity to formally raise the child benefit issue with him.  I have also raised this informally with Ministers from other EU countries, and will continue to do so through bilateral contacts at meetings such as the forthcoming EPSCO Council meeting.</P>

	<P>The Government discussion paper, &ldquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents&rdquo;, which was published in 2006, proposed that the category of lone parenthood would be abolished. Instead, a parental allowance would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner) with young children on a low income. Since the launch of the discussion paper, extensive consultation has taken place with relevant stakeholders and lone parent representative groups. Discussions have also taken place in the Seanad and at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs. Work has also been undertaken with other relevant Departments and Agencies on the non-income issues raised in the paper &mdash; namely, education supports, child care, training and employment.</P>
        <P>Changes in recent Budgets, including increases in the One-Parent Family Payment&rsquo;s (OFP&rsquo;s) earnings disregard and the streamlining of increases for qualified children are in line with the recommendations contained in the paper.</P>
        <P>While it has not been possible to progress the proposals as outlined in the discussion paper, due, in part, to current economic conditions, these proposals have informed deliberations regarding the reform of the OFP scheme and continue to inform considerations regarding future policy in respect of lone parents.</P>

	<P>The Jobs Initiative introduced a package of measures to assist in employment generation, provide opportunities for those who have lost their jobs and generate confidence in the economy. The various tax changes announced in the Jobs Initiative are being carried in the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011. These measures include reductions in VAT and the Air Travel Tax and the introduction of a levy on pension schemes. As the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011 is a Money Bill, it cannot include non-Money Bill items, such as the increase in the national minimum wage.</P>
        <P>The increase in the national minimum wage and a number of other legislative amendments of a non-Money Bill nature arising from the Jobs Initiative are being progressed in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011. These other items include the reduction in the lower rate of employer PRSI, which involves amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and the National Training Fund Act 2000. The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011 also contains amendments to certain employment legislation to facilitate the introduction of the new Internship Scheme. The national minimum wage will be restored to its previous level of &euro;8.65 an hour from 1 July.</P>

These internship opportunities will provide participants with valuable work experience that will develop their skills and enhance their career prospects in a specific area. Under the scheme, eligible participants will receive a weekly top-up of &euro;50 over and above their existing social welfare entitlements. This top-up will be paid by the Department of Social Protection. The purpose of the &euro;50 per week top up is to incentivise individuals to participate in the scheme and to cover their participation costs.

	<P>The back to education allowance (BTEA) is one of a range of activation supports and policies with the objective of assisting social welfare recipients to improve their life chances by facilitating access to employment, work experience, education and training. The focus of BTEA is to assist those who are most marginalised and distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>The BTEA scheme can offer participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.  On May 10th, as part of the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative, 20,900 new and additional places were announced in training, education and work experience programmes.</P>
        <P>As part of this Initiative a new fund, entitled Springboard, which is being managed by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, will provide education and training opportunities to support unemployed people. The primary objective of Springboard is to help unemployed people to remain as close as possible to the labour market by accessing part-time flexible higher education and training opportunities to upskill or reskill in areas where sustainable employment opportunities may arise as the economy recovers.  The target group for this programme includes unemployed people with a previous history of employment who already hold a higher level qualification at NFQ Levels 6 to 9, who may also require additional upskilling or reskilling in order to re-enter employment.  Included in this initiative will be part-time Masters courses and, via the part-time education <Col N="335"/>option, unemployed people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments will be facilitated in retaining these, subject to continuing entitlement, within the broader back-to-education framework.  The BTEA, in conjunction with other employment support schemes, will be monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>The national internship scheme is a Government scheme which will be administered by the Department of Social Protection in line with relevant government accounting and procedural practices.   I have appointed a Steering Group chaired by Mr. Martin Murphy, Managing Director of HP Ireland. The Steering Group contains representatives from Glen Dimplex, Harmonia Publications, the National Youth Council of Ireland, my Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and F&Aacute;S.  None of the individuals on the Steering Group is being paid for being a member of this Group. </P>
        <P>The Steering Group has responsibility for advising me on the implementation of the national internship scheme with a particular focus on securing the support of the business community and employers. In order for the internship scheme to be a success, the participation and support of the business community is required. The Steering Group will therefore play a leading role in promoting the scheme to this sector.</P>
        <P>While the Steering Group advises me on certain aspects relating to the national internship scheme, I, as Minister for Social Protection, and my Department has responsibility for the associated policy, decisions, implementation and governance of the scheme.</P>

	<P>The Department has developed, in conjunction with a number of other Departments, the specifications for a Public Services Card (PSC) under the Standard Authentication Framework Environment, or SAFE, programme.  The specification provides for identification features, including a photograph.  The aim is to develop a card that acts as a key for access to public services in general, identifying and authenticating individuals as appropriate and where required.  Formal sanction to proceed with the project was received from the Department of Finance at the end of 2009.  A contract was agreed with Biometric Card Services (BCS) as the managed service provider from early January 2010.  The contract is for a complete managed service for the production, maintenance and distribution of the PSC.  In summary this entails:</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />Production of the card</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />Personalisation of the card</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />Delivery of the card</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />Provision of help-desk functionality</P>
        <P>All to be undertaken under strict and secure conditions.</P><Col N="336"/>
        <P>The card was designed and production planning carried out during 2010. In addition, a secure card personalisation and distribution centre was constructed in Bray, Co. Wicklow during the year and a specimen PSC was personalised on this site on 8th December 2010.  Issue of a PSC requires enhanced and secure client registration processes supported by enhanced ICT solutions. It has been necessary to develop a technical infrastructure within the Department to support the client registration as well as the management and administration of the cards.  Development of some this infrastructure is being undertaken by internal resources and this work began last year.  Procurement for the remainder was finalised early this year and development work is currently ongoing.  In addition, further procurements related to photographic processing have been in progress and an RFT for photographic matching will issue shortly. It is anticipated that the full suite of this functionality will not be available until the autumn of this year at which time the Department will commence the production issue of the card.</P>
        <P>However, new functionality aimed at further improving the identity registration and verification process is expected to be ready earlier than that.  A pilot of this functionality is expected to begin in a small number of offices in the next few weeks.  It is intended that initial registration will involve customers of the Department and will take a number of forms: face to face at DSP Local Offices, through utilising data already held by the Department in relation to the All Ireland Free Travel Scheme and through utilising relevant data already held by the State (e.g. photographs and signatures held by the Passport Office). Productive discussions have been held with a number of agencies in this last regard.</P>
        <P>Customers of the Department will be contacted to arrange for capture of the data required to produce and issue a PSC to them. The overall timeframe for completion of initial deployment of a Public Services Card is dependent on the rate at which it will be possible to securely register all of those to whom it will be issued.  Initial registration will be carried out in the Department.  Other options that may exist for external registration are being explored.</P>
        <P>The Public Services Card will replace cards currently in use, such as the Social Services Card and the Free Travel card, with highly secure cards.  Other Departments and agencies will also be in a position to use the card and the infrastructure that will support it.  The final cost of the project will depend on the actual number of cards issued.  However, the current estimated cost is some &euro;24 million for around 3 million cards (i.e. about &euro;8 per card including delivery).</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 59 together.</P>
        <P>The need for reform of the Joint Labour Committee system was clearly signalled in the Programme for Government. A very detailed report, the Independent Review of Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreement Wage Setting Mechanisms, setting out a reform mechanism was finalised in April of this year and circulated to members of the <Col N="337"/>Government in the usual way.  The relevant stakeholders will now participate in a consultation process on the report and the Government does not have a pre-determined outcome to this process. The outcome of the consultation process will be brought to Government and any changes in this area will be decided collectively by the Government. In that context, the Government will consider the impact of the reform proposals on workers with a view to achieving balanced reform which produces good outcomes for employment and social protection.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, I have asked my officials to examine the broader impact of the report on low paid workers and the social protection system generally and how reduced pay levels could possibly lead to an increased reliance on the social welfare system.  This assessment will assist the Government&rsquo;s deliberations on the proposed reforms with a view to achieving balanced reform for all those affected.</P>

	<P>The role of the Citizens Information Board is to support the provision of information, advice and advocacy on a broad range of public and social services.  To this end, the Citizens Information website, www.citizensinformation.ie, was developed to meet customer demands for fast, easy access to comprehensive information on rights and entitlements. The website covers a broad range of subjects including social welfare, travel and recreation, employment rights, buying a home, moving abroad, education and much more.</P>
        <P>Information for people with disabilities is integrated into the main categories on the website homepage.  For example, information on disability allowance can be found in the &ldquo;Disability and Illness&rdquo; section in the Social Welfare category, and information on the motorised transport grant can be found in the &ldquo;Transport and Disability&rdquo; section in the Travel and Recreation category.</P>
        <P>There are also a number of documents that aim to cut across the website&rsquo;s categories and provide an overview of a particular area such as the &ldquo;Caring for a child with a disability&rdquo; and &ldquo;Working with a disability&rdquo; documents.  A checklist is also included which references relevant information in the areas of social welfare, transport and mobility, work, education and training, health services and taxation.  The publication &ldquo;Entitlements for People with Disabilities&rdquo;, which was updated in 2010, and a new publication &ldquo;Entitlements for children with disabilities&rdquo; are also available on the Citizens Information Board website www.citizensinformationboard.ie.   In addition, the www.assistireland.ie   website is a comprehensive, online database of assistive technologies and suppliers.</P>
        <P>In order to further improve access and provide multiple paths to information on the website, the Citizens Information Board is currently working on the development of checklists for various categories of people, including people with disabilities.  I am satisfied that the checklists will help people to navigate the site by having an overview of all potential entitlements relevant to their particular circumstances and a link to the relevant sections of the website.</P>

	<P>T&uacute;s is a community work placement initiative which will provide up to 5,000 short-term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  Some &euro;30 million has been provided in the Department&rsquo;s Estimates in 2011 to fund the roll-out of the initiative.  This initiative is delivered through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas.  General rules and conditions are currently being concluded with these companies to ensure that work placements offered by the not-for-profit, voluntary and community sectors are evaluated to ensure that there is no duplication or displacement of services offered by either the public or private sectors.  It should be noted that these companies have considerable experience in determining these matters in respect of other Exchequer and European funded programmes.  The boards of the companies include representatives of the local authorities, business, trade unions, State agencies and the community and voluntary sectors which provides significant additional safeguards.</P>
        <P>In these circumstances, I do not consider that this work placement initiative, or indeed, other similar initiatives in the private or public sector would have the effect of driving down wages or could impact on the qualification levels of staff needed to provide services.  Given the random nature of the T&uacute;s selection process, it is likely that good numbers of  well qualified persons who are unemployed may be afforded opportunities to apply their skills across very different service providers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The rules which determine eligibility for FIS do not distinguish between public sector workers and private sector workers. There are currently approximately 24,410 people in receipt of a weekly family income supplement (FIS) <Col N="339"/>payment of which 2,517 (10%) are recorded as public servants.  During 2010 the number of public servants in receipt of FIS ran at approximately 11% of the total number of recipients. Exact figures on the numbers of public service workers in receipt of FIS prior to 2010 are unavailable but a previous manual random sample analysis estimated that approximately 10% of FIS claims related to those working in the public service. There is therefore no evidence of any significant increase in the level of recourse by public servants to FIS.</P>
        <P>The numbers of public servants eligible for FIS is influenced by several factors.  Notwithstanding pay reductions other factors such as incremental wage increases or reductions in the number of qualified children, together with any changes in work sharing/family friendly working arrangements can combine to reduce recourse to FIS.</P>

        <Quest> the reason she will not conduct and publish a cost-benefit analysis of using the PRSI system not only to collect the auto-enrolment pension contributions that are proposed by the national pensions framework but also to manage that money and make payments rather than handing those responsibilities over to the private pension industry in view of the inefficiencies that are typical of it. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Increasing pensions coverage, particular amongst the lower paid and those with gaps in their employment, is a priority for the Government.   The introduction of an auto-enrolment system is one of the best ways in which we can do this.   An inter-departmental/agency group, chaired by the Department of Social Protection is developing the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to introduce a number of pension reforms in the National Pensions Framework, including auto-enrolment.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged at this stage that contributions for an auto-enrolment system will be collected through the PRSI system.  In developing the various aspects of the system we will of course be considering the costs and benefits associated with the options available.  There will be a limited number and limited types of funds available under the scheme.  The Government will decide how these participating investment funds will be selected and managed.  It is expected that a competitive process will be run by the State which will also ensure that charges are kept to a minimum. The competitive process won&rsquo;t necessarily be confined to the private sector. It could include State organisations such as, e.g., the NTMA. No decision has been made as yet.   It is intended that the auto-enrolment scheme will be introduced in 2014 but only if it would be prudent given the economic conditions prevailing at that time.</P>

	<P>Workers whose weekly earnings are above &euro;38 and below &euro;356, and for whom employers pay PRSI contributions at the rate of 8.5%, fall into PRSI Sub-classes AO and AX.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to halve the lower 8.5% rate of PRSI up to end 2013. This commitment is being implemented with effect from 2 July, 2011.  A lower rate of employers&rsquo; PRSI for workers earnings below &euro;356 per week has been in operation for a number of years.  There is no particular evidence to suggest that the existence of a lower rate of PRSI encourages employers to reduce wages to come within the qualifying criteria that attract the lower rate.</P>

	<P>Earlier this year members of the Green IFSC Steering Group, a sub-committee of the IFSC Clearing House Group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, were tasked with developing a detailed business plan for the delivery of an Initiative to secure a leading position for Ireland as the world moves towards a low carbon global economy.</P>
        <P>This Initiative seeks to build upon the reputation of the IFSC as a leading global financial centre and to develop Dublin as a global hub for green finance.  Green Finance refers to capital markets, investment banking activities and related advisory services which support the development, finance and promotion of a low-carbon economy. This includes funding of renewable energy generation, energy efficiency and in a wider context waste, water and weather management. The value of carbon as a pricing mechanism for this activity is at the core of green finance and the Green IFSC Steering Group have identified a central role in the carbon markets as pivotal to the success of this initiative.</P>
        <P>Playing to the existing strengths of the IFSC the initiative proposes to translate and extend these skills into the carbon market and develop Dublin as the world leader in not just the management of carbon but as an innovation hub for associated carbon mechanisms and the next generation of green financial management instruments.  Central to this strategy is the creation of an International Carbon Standard and Registry for the voluntary carbon credits market.</P><Col N="343"/>
        <P>The business plan is currently being reviewed by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. Until that review is complete and considered by Government no work with my northern counterpart has taken place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s aid programme, administered from within the Department of Foreign Affairs by Irish Aid, is sharply focused on the reduction and eventual eradication of global poverty and hunger.  Our partnership with Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) represents a very important element in this effort, reflecting the broad support among Irish people for the development programme. </P>
        <P>In 2010, the Government, through Irish Aid provided over &euro;125 million for the development work of NGOs.  This NGO funding is administered through a range of funding schemes covering long term development, emergency and recovery assistance and development education.  Significant recipients of such grants include Concern, Tr&oacute;caire, GOAL, Self Help Africa, Irish Fair Trade Network, Christian Aid, Oxfam Ireland, World Vision, Action Aid and Plan Ireland.  These organisations received a combined total of over &euro;77 million for their development and humanitarian work in 2010. As valued partners of the development programme, all these organisations are due to receive grant allocations of a similar size in 2011.  Decisions on final disbursements for 2011 are dependent on appraisal and approval processes which are still underway.</P>
        <P>Additional funding is provided to NGOs under the development programmes from the nine priority countries for Irish Aid, where we have a commitment to long-term strategic assistance. Furthermore, a small grants programme is administered by eleven Embassies accredited to countries where Irish Aid does not have a bi-lateral development co-operation programme. In total, Irish Aid provides grants to over 200 NGO partners.</P>
        <P>The following table provides a list of those organisations which received significant funding (over &euro;100,000) in 2010 from funding schemes administered by Irish Aid headquarters and amounts confirmed to date for 2011.</P>

        <P>There are nine Programme Countries for the aid programme, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  Irish Aid administers specific budgets for long term development assistance in these countries, on the basis of detailed development plans focused on the reduction of poverty levels.  The Programme Countries are:  Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Zambia and Timor Leste.   Additional funding is <Col N="346"/>also provided through development Non-Governmental Organisations, missionaries, the multilateral and UN systems, and in response to humanitarian emergencies.</P>

	<P>There is no formal proposal active at this time to amend the Treaties in the area of leadership of the EU.  I have however noted recent media reports of an idea put forward by Mr. Tony Blair that there should be a directly-elected President of the European Union.  This is certainly an interesting contribution to debate on the EU&rsquo;s institutional framework and its evolution.  Similar ideas received some consideration in the Constitutional Convention which eventually led to the Lisbon Treaty.    A formal proposal and debate on an elected EU leader is unlikely in the immediate future.  The EU is now in the process of bedding down the various reforms to the functioning of the Union brought about in the Lisbon Treaty.  These included provision for the election for a two and a half year term, renewable once, of   a full-time President of the European Council.  President Herman van Rompuy, who will visit Ireland on 17 June, has made an excellent start as the first holder of that office. </P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that this case was discussed in the House as a matter for adjournment on 11 May 2011, and on that occasion I took the opportunity to give details of the consular assistance which had been offered to the family of the Irish citizen by my Department up to that point. I also publicly extended my sincere condolences to the family involved and assured them of my personal interest in the case.    Since then, officials from my Department have met with family members. My Department has maintained ongoing contacts with them in order to facilitate their dealings with the German authorities on their case, and to facilitate their campaign to have the investigation into the tragic death of their son and brother reopened. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the Embassy of Ireland in Berlin, has been liaising with the German authorities since we were notified of the case. My Department will continue to provide all possible consular assistance to the family and will continue to facilitate their dealings with the relevant German authorities in the pursuit of their aims. </P>
        <P>It is the understanding of my Department, at this point, that the family wishes to submit the findings of the Deputy State Pathologist to the office of the State Prosecutor in Baden Wurttemberg. Our Embassy in Berlin will assist with the submission of these documents, and will ensure that they are forwarded, under cover letter to the relevant authorities.</P>
        <P>I expect the German authorities to deal with all the operational matters involved in the investigations.  As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department is not in a position to intervene in the German legal process and we have advised the family to take professional legal advice on their current position and on the legal avenues that may be available to them in the pursuit of their case.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through our Embassy in Berlin, and our Consular Section in Dublin, will continue to provide all possible consular assistance to the family, and will continue to facilitate their dealings with the relevant German authorities in this difficult case.</P>

	<P>The EU Council of Ministers, in various formations, has addressed the serious and unfolding issues related to the E. coli outbreak in Germany.  On 31 May, the issue was discussed at an informal meeting of the Council of EU Agriculture Ministers in Hungary. </P>
        <P>On 6 June, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Council was briefed by the European Commission on steps being taken, including to ensure the sharing of relevant information on a real time basis.</P>
        <P>On 7 June, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr Simon Coveney T.D., attended an emergency meeting of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg called to deal with the food safety and market implications resulting from the E. coli outbreak in Germany. Minister Coveney and his Department are in regular contact with their European counterparts and are continuing to monitor the situation. The German authorities have recently linked the infections with the consumption of organic bean sprouts from one local German producer. The German authorities have confirmed that none of the bean sprouts from the producer in question have been exported from Germany. On this basis, on 10 June, a previous warning against the consumption of tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce was rescinded. On 12 June, German authorities confirmed that samples of organic bean sprouts tested positive for the outbreak strain of E. coli<i> </i>  (VTEC) O104:H4. This is considered to be another piece of evidence suggesting that organic bean sprouts have to be considered as an essential source for the E. coli infections.</P>
        <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is continuing to monitor this situation and provide up-dates as necessary. It has indicated that there have been no reported cases in Ireland of human illness associated with the German outbreak strain of E. coli (VTEC) O104:H4.</P>
        <P>The EU Council of Ministers as well as the European Commission and the relevant European entities engaged in this area, such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA), will continue to work closely with relevant Member State authorities in addressing this situation.</P>

	<P>Addressing the situation of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements with the United States are important priorities for the Government in its relationship with the US Administration and Congress.    The Taoiseach and I discussed the question of Irish immigration with President Obama when we met with him on 23 May in Dublin. Responding to our concerns, the President expressed his interest in achieving progress on immigration issues. </P>
        <P>Most recently, I raised these issues with Senator Patrick Leahy, Chair of the Senate Judiciary committee when I met him in Dublin on 3 June.</P><Col N="350"/>
        <P>I also discussed the issue of Irish immigration with Secretary of State Clinton during our meeting on 18 March and with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and the Coalition of Irish Centres in New York on 16 March. The Taoiseach raised the issue of the undocumented and the potential for the continued development of Ireland&rsquo;s migration arrangements with the US with President Obama during his St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to Washington. The Taoiseach also met with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform on 5 May when in New York.</P>
        <P>Acting on my behalf, the Embassy of Ireland in Washington continues to engage with leaders in Congress, from both parties, on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged by President Obama&rsquo;s continued commitment to addressing the question of immigration reform. Speaking on 10 May, the President, in an address dedicated to the issue of immigration, reiterated his call for comprehensive reform of the system, and particularly called for the passage of the DREAM Act. Under the DREAM Act qualifying undocumented young people seeking to go to college or join the US military, and who were brought illegally to the US as children, would be eligible to seek regularisation of their status.</P>
        <P>I am very aware of the difficult situation facing those who are undocumented and living in the USA, as well as the distress caused to families in both Ireland and the US. The most realistic long term solution for our undocumented citizens remains through comprehensive immigration reform.</P>
        <P>The inclusion of Ireland in an amended reciprocal E3 visa scheme, which would allow Irish people with a certain level of education to work in the US on a two year renewable visa, is the most effective way of creating new opportunities for Irish citizens in the USA. The introduction of such a scheme, which has attracted support from a number of members of Congress from both parties, will require the passage of legislation in Congress.</P>
        <P>The successful passage of E3 visa legislation would strengthen the human bridge between the two countries, which underpins our excellent existing bilateral relations, and provide a mechanism for Irish nationals seeking to work in the USA in the future. We continue to press for such a scheme, including with members of Congress. It is the case, however, that the E3 would not provide a solution to the undocumented Irish in the US.</P>
        <P>I am very aware of the enormous political challenges that face efforts to pass any immigration related legislations at the current time, including the E3 proposal.</P>
        <P>I and my Department, and particularly the Embassy in Washington, will continue to work very actively on the issue with the US Administration, Congressional leaders and Irish immigration reform advocates.</P>
        <P>We are also providing practical assistance to Irish community reform advocates and organisations providing key welfare, information and immigration advisory services to the more marginalised members of the Irish community in the USA, including the undocumented. In 2010, through the Emigrant Support programme, &euro;1,292,306 was provided to the main welfare and reform advocate organisations across the USA.</P>

	<P>As I have previously stated, the Emigrant Support Programme, administered by my Department, provides funding to non-profit organisations and projects to support Irish communities overseas and to facilitate the development of more strategic links between Ireland and the global Irish<i>.</i> <Col N="351"/>The strong emphasis of the Programme is on supporting culturally sensitive, frontline welfare services, which are targeted at the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities, including the elderly and homeless.    These services have made a substantive difference to the lives of Irish people living abroad, particularly in Britain and the United States, through reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their local, statutory entitlements.   Since 2004, approximately &euro;58million has been awarded to support Irish organisations in Britain. Last year alone, some 128 British-based organisations received over &euro;8.1 million under the Emigrant Support Programme.  </P>

In addition, many other Irish welfare organisations receive significant funding for projects of benefit to homeless Irish persons.</P>
        <P>My Department, in consultation with the Emigrant Services Advisory Committee, is currently assessing applications for funding under the 2011 grant round for projects based in Britain and organisations will be notified of the outcome in July.  Despite the difficult budgetary situation facing the country, I am determined to maintain a significant level of funding for frontline services in Britain and elsewhere that address the needs of our most vulnerable emigrants.   A full list of all organisations funded through the Emigrant Support Programme since 2006 is available on www.dfa.ie.</P>

	<P>The Department operates the &ldquo;Travel Pass&rdquo; (also known as the &ldquo;TaxSaver Commuter Ticket&rdquo;) Scheme put in place by the Finance Act 1999 as an incentive to encourage the use of public transport by staff travelling to and from work.    This scheme allows an employer to incur the expense of providing an employee with a monthly or annual bus/rail pass, without the employee being liable for benefit-in-kind taxation. Employees participating in the scheme benefit from reduced tax and PRSI payments and may avail of a salary sacrifice option to pay for their tickets. </P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the Department also operates the &ldquo;Bike-to-Work&rdquo; scheme provided for by the Finance Act 2008. This scheme exempts from income tax the benefit-in-kind arising from the provision of a bicycle and related safety equipment by an employer to an employee, where the bicycle is used by the employee for travel to and from the workplace. A salary sacrifice option may be availed of for this scheme also.</P>
        <P>Currently, there are 147 staff members availing of the Travel Pass and 41 availing of the Bike to Work scheme. In relation to travel on official business, the Department (including its Missions abroad) complies with the relevant Department of Finance instructions regarding travel for official business. These provide that the cheapest practicable mode of conveyance be used and that public transport is used as far as practicable. Taxis or cars may be used only when no suitable public transport is available.</P>

	<P>A passport application for the person in question was submitted in December, 2008.  In accordance with the provisions of the Passports Act, 2008, this Department must be satisfied that an applicant is an Irish citizen before issuing him with a passport.   As the applicant was born in the State in September 2008, his entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by Section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended (the 1956 Act).  The 1956 Act provides that a person, who is born in the State on or after 1 January, 2005 and does not have a parent who is either an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for a passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three of the four years preceding the birth of the child.</P>
        <P>This Department assesses such applications in line with guidelines provided by the Department of Justice and Law Reform, which is responsible for matters of citizenship and immigration.  In accordance with these guidelines, the proofs of lawful residence, which are accepted and considered in connection with passport applications, are immigration stamps in passports or the registration cards/books which are given to persons registering with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  These are official documents, which can be objectively verified and are relied on by the Department in the processing of passport applications.</P>
        <P>In line with the requirements of the 1956 Act, the lawful residence in the State of the applicant&rsquo;s mother in the four year period preceding her son&rsquo;s date of birth was examined.  Based on the evidence of immigration stamps in her passport, the total amount of reckonable residence did not meet with the statutory requirement of three years.  As the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship had not been demonstrated, the Department could not issue a passport to him.</P>
        <P>The Department wrote to the applicant&rsquo;s mother on 8 January, 2009 to explain its decision.  She was also contacted by telephone that day by officials from the Passport Service.  In this conversation she gave an undertaking to the Passport Service that she would contact the Garda National Immigration Bureau and obtain evidence from them that she had the required amount of residence in the State.  Since then, no further evidence has been provided by the applicant&rsquo;s mother.</P>
        <P>I regret therefore that, as the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship has not been demonstrated, this Department remains unable to issue a passport to the person in question at this time.</P><Col N="354"/>

The deaths which according to estimates now number more than 1,200 and detentions, and the torture and intimidation of peaceful Syrian citizens, are completely unacceptable and a violation of the Syrian Government&rsquo;s responsibility and international obligations to protect its citizens.  Ireland and the EU have condemned this violence and called for restraint and dialogue, and have enacted sanctions against Syria to persuade it to change its approach.  However, the particular case raised by the Deputy has now been revealed to be a hoax, with an Edinburgh-based US Middle East activist admitting to have written the blogs in question.</P>

	<P>The Valuation Act, 2001 which came into effect on 2nd May, 2002, provides for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial property.  The Commissioner of Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters under the Valuation Act 2001 which includes the implementation of the revaluation programme on a nationwide basis.</P><Col N="355"/>
        <P>The revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed in 2009 and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown was completed in 2010.  The revaluation of the Dublin City Council area commenced with the signing of the valuation order on 5th May, 2011.  This will entail the valuation of circa 25,000 properties and the new list will be published in December 2013.</P>
        <P>It is intended to roll out the programme to further local authority areas later in 2011 and the necessary process of consultation, as provided for under the Act, is under way with the local authorities of Waterford, i.e. Waterford City and County Council and Dungarvan Town Council. Preliminary work is also under way on the revaluation of Limerick City.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to say at present when the national programme will be completed.  A timeframe of 10 years overall had been envisaged, but progress has been slower than expected, and the position has been complicated further by the difficult conditions in the property market in recent years. Nevertheless, the launch of the major project in Dublin City is a significant advance and the Commissioner has indicated that he is actively reviewing options which might hold potential for accelerating the delivery of the revaluation programme.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the work of  the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt.  This Group published its final Report in November 2010.  All of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations are listed in Chapter <Col N="356"/>2 of the Report which can be accessed at www.finance.gov.ie.  The Group&rsquo;s Report contained the following recommendation: </P>
        <P LI="1"><i>&ldquo;The Group notes that, for some mortgage holders, who are in negative equity, trading down would produce a reduction in the mortgage debt and more affordable monthly payments. The Group recommends that further consideration  should  be given by lenders to facilitating trading down by borrowers in this situation. Such options would have to meet relevant prudential standards, with appropriate controls in place, and be made in the customers &rsquo; best interest&rdquo;.</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">Trading down means selling a current property and buying a cheaper one. Trading down may be an option to reduce the level of mortgage repayments, resulting in more affordable monthly repayments.</P>
        <P>This recommendation is aimed at helping mortgage holders remain as homeowners while reducing their level of repayments.  It may also help mortgage holders who are in negative equity and who may wish to move home, for example, to take up new employment opportunities. There is merit in facilitating house moves by those in negative equity in certain situations and subject to certain criteria set down by the Central Bank.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, these are matters for lenders and for the Central Bank to decide upon.  Any lender planning to provide a negative equity type product must notify the Central Bank in advance to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and proper controls are put in place. The Central Bank must be satisfied that such a product meets relevant prudential standards and does not lead to consumers being over exposed.</P>

Annex III of the VAT Directive lists the goods and services to which Member States may apply a reduced rate.  In addition, Member States can retain the reduced rated provisions which they had in existence on 1 January 1991.  As architectural services are not contained in Annex III, nor did a zero or reduced rate apply to such services in 1991, a reduced rate cannot now be applied to such services.</P>

	<P>I would point out that the VAT rate applicable to construction and maintenance services, including energy reducing services therein, is 13.5% and such services have applied at a reduced VAT rate since the introduction of VAT in 1973.</P>
        <P>The supply of certain environmental products, such as insulation materials, wind turbine equipment, wood pellet boilers and solar panels, are chargeable at the standard VAT rate of 21%.  However, the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% may be applied to such products where they are provided under a single supply and install contract where the VAT exclusive cost of the goods does not exceed two-thirds of the total VAT exclusive charge to the customer.</P>
        <P>EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, does not permit reductions in VAT, for environmental or other reasons, that would create a distortion of competition between similar goods or services.  The EU Commission undertook a study of the possibility of using reduced VAT rates as a tool to support the climate change agenda. While Ireland expressed support for such a study, the EU Council of Finance Ministers decided in 2009 not to allow reduced VAT rates as a tool for achieving environmental policy objectives.  In general it was considered that if assistance was required, providing it through direct expenditure measures was the better approach to adopt.</P>
        <P>In this context, the recent Jobs Initiative made provision for encouraging energy reducing services in the construction industry through the investment of an additional &euro;30 million in 2011 in the national home retrofitting scheme.</P>

Gold is valued at the closing market price and securities at mid-market closing prices at year-end.

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the following is the position in relation to the classification of the taxpayer&rsquo;s vehicle.</P>
        <P>The purpose of VRT classification is to decide the applicable rate of VRT.  Vehicles are therefore classified for VRT only in response to a declaration for registration or a declaration of conversion of a registered vehicle to a higher VRT category.  The Revenue Commissioners, when registering the vehicle in 2009, classified it as VRT category A, the category which attracts the highest rate, and assigned it the body type &ldquo;minibus&rdquo; from a list provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Those decisions reflected the fact that the vehicle was a Volkswagen Transporter with seating for six, including the driver, and did not meet the requirements for classification as a VRT category B &ldquo;crew cab&rdquo;. The decisions were upheld on appeal and accordingly the VRT classification will not be reduced.</P>
        <P>The term &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; means the modification of a vehicle in such manner that it no longer retains all of the characteristics of the vehicle category under which it is certified for type-approval purposes.</P>
        <P>The United Kingdom vehicle registration certificate, presented to the Revenue Commissioners in 2009 in support of the declaration for registration, indicates that the vehicle is certified as EU type-approval category M1 (designed and constructed for the carriage of passengers and comprising no more than eight seats in addition to the driver&rsquo;s seat), with nine seats, including the driver&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners would be prepared to consider a declaration of conversion by the owner, supported by a declaration by a Suitably Qualified Individual, to the effect that the vehicle, with the reduced number of seats, now has the characteristics of a different EU vehicle category, e.g. EU type-approval category N1 (designed and constructed for the carriage of goods and having a maximum mass not exceeding 3.5 tonnes).  The relevant declaration form and template are available on the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s website www.revenue.ie.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is already a comprehensive licensing system in place for moneylenders.  Moneylenders have to apply to the Central Bank annually to have their licenses renewed.  Section 93 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (as amended) sets out the Central Bank&rsquo;s powers in relation to the grant or refusal of a moneylender&rsquo;s license.  The appropriate moneylending application form (new or renewal) must be completed and returned to the Central Bank with a number of items, for review and consideration.</P>
        <P>In addition to the licensing system, the Central Bank has in place a <i>Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders</i> (the Code).  The Central Bank has power to impose sanctions on moneylenders for a contravention of the Code.  The Code sets out General Principles with which a moneylender must comply.  For example, a moneylender  must act honestly and professionally, with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of  consumers.  The Code also places requirements on moneylenders in relation to the provision of information to the consumer, preservation of a consumer&rsquo;s rights, knowing the consumer, suitability, unsolicited contact (cold calling), disclosure, errors, handling complaints, consumer records, unsolicited credit facilities, arrears and guarantees, debt collection and the contents and presentation of advertisements.</P>
        <P>On 18 February 2011, the Central Bank published the results of a themed inspection of licensed moneylenders. The inspection showed a high level of compliance with the requirements of the Code among firms. Inspections were conducted in 11 of the 46 licensed moneylenders currently operating in Ireland. The inspections focused on whether consumers were being charged in accordance with the moneylenders&rsquo; authorised APRs (Annual Percentage Rates) and costs of credit as set out in the moneylenders&rsquo; licenses. It also examined whether firms had their licenses on display and, if they indicated the high-cost nature of loans on loan documentation issued to consumers, as required by the Code. Overall the inspections found a high level of compliance with the requirements and that consumers were been charged in accordance with the moneylenders&rsquo; authorised APRs and costs of credit. In addition, firms had their licenses on display and indicated the high-cost nature of loans on loan documentation issued to consumers.  I would expect that, in future, the Annual Regulatory Performance Statement of the Central Bank will refer to the regulation of moneylenders.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Joint Administrators of Quinn Insurance Ltd (QIL) recently indicated that there was likely to be a call of about &euro;600m on the Insurance Compensation Fund as a result of the solvency deficit in that company.  Currently, there is &euro;30m in the fund with a further &euro;10m expected to be paid into it shortly on completion of the PMPA administration. Consequently, this means that there is a significant shortfall in the fund which will have to be addressed through the application of a levy by the Central Bank under Section 6 of the 1964 Insurance Act.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that I am aware of the particular difficulties around the application of the levy to the health insurance sector because of the fact that a significant portion of this market is held by a company which is not regulated by the Central Bank.  I am currently reflecting on this matter and a number of other levy related issues and will make a decision on these matters shortly.</P>

	<P>I believe the scheme which the Deputy is referring to is the scheme of registered holiday cottages.  The relief given is in the form of capital allowances rather than section 23 relief. These registered holiday cottages could be built outside the seaside resort areas, but the relief was terminated in 2008.  Any expenditure incurred after 31 July 2008 gets no capital allowances thus at the present time no new builds of such schemes can avail of the relief.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the particular provision the Deputy is referring to is the meaning of &ldquo;industrial building or structure&rdquo; in section 268 TCA 1997 in subsection (3).  In order to be registered in the register of holiday cottages I believe F&aacute;ilte Ireland require 8 or more cottages to be constructed in addition to other ancillary facilities.  Inside the seaside resort areas there was also provision for relief for listed holiday cottages.  These could have been single units.  In essence F&aacute;ilte Ireland draws a distinction between &ldquo;registered&rdquo; and &ldquo;listed&rdquo; cottages.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no role in determining the number of cottages in such schemes as the number is not in the tax legislation.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy can appreciate it is a commercial decision for any Bank as to what customers it wishes to deal with.  A balance must be maintained by the Government between support provided for individual banks and financial service providers generally through the bank guarantee scheme, other financial support incentives and broader public policy provisions, while at the same time, ensuring that the day-to-day running of these institutions has regard to competition, market conditions and the need to develop stable commercial enterprises to meet the long term credit needs of households and businesses in the Irish economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code (the Code) is applicable to all entities which the Central Bank regulates (regulated entities).  The Code requires, among other things, that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation it acts: honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market and with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of its customers.</P>
        <P>Any breach of the Code may be considered under the Central Bank&rsquo;s Administrative Sanctions Procedure.  If the customer falls within the definition of &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; for the purposes of the Code he or she is entitled to additional safeguards under the Code. For example, where a regulated entity intends to amend or alter the range of services that it provides, it must give notice to affected consumers at least one month in advance of the amendment being introduced.</P>
        <P>If a regulated entity no longer  wishes to do business with a customer, it should explain why not and give the customer ample time to make other arrangements.  If a consumer feels that he or she has been improperly treated, or that he or she has grounds for complaint for some other reason, then a complaint can be made directly to the regulated entity using the regulated entity&rsquo;s formal complaints system.  If the complaint has not been addressed to his or her satisfaction, the consumer may refer the complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman, who deals with individual consumer complaints.  The Ombudsman will adjudicate on the complaint on the basis of the regulatory requirements on the regulated entity.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of the Code a &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; is any of the following: a natural person acting outside his or her business, trade or profession; a person or group of persons but not an incorporated body with an annual turnover in excess of &euro;3 million; incorporated bodies having <Col N="362"/>an annual turnover of &euro;3 million or less in the previous financial year; a member of a credit union.</P>

        <P>VAT is charged on the supply of goods and services and as such the rate of VAT applying will depend on the economic activity and not the businesses producing those goods or services.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 153  together.</P>
        <P>To date, Ireland&rsquo;s nominal borrowings are &euro;23 billion under the EU/IMF Programme.  The details are set out in the table below.  Under the arrangements governing the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), part of the loan to a borrower is retained by the EFSF for credit enhancement purposes.  This credit enhancement is to ensure that the EFSF retains its top AAA credit rating and, thereby, minimises the cost of funds it borrows.  Under the first and only disbursement to Ireland to date, some &euro;600m was retained by the EFSF thereby reducing the loan of &euro;4.2 billion to a net disbursement of &euro;3.6 billion.</P><Col N="364"/>

Disbursements in each quarter can only take place after the IMF Executive Board, the Eurogroup and ECOFIN have approved the compliance reports prepared, respectively, by IMF Staff and the European Commission Services.  The actual disbursements take place in the period following the respective meetings.  Disbursements from the EFSF and EFSM are somewhat dictated by the timing of their market interventions and discussions around this are held with the NTMA as appropriate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The agreed EU-IMF Programme provides for a recapitalisation, fundamental downsizing, restructuring and reorganisation of the Irish banking sector. The aim of the process is a smaller banking system, which will be capitalised to highest international standards with renewed access to normal market sources of funding. This will enable the Irish banks to reduce their reliance on euro system and Central Bank funding mechanisms. This position is supported by our external partners.</P><Col N="367"/>
        <P Just="Left">I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the supportive statement issued by the Governing Council of the ECB following the publication of the PCAR and PLAR in March 2011.  The Council stated that the euro system would continue to provide liquidity to banks in Ireland and it would accept securities under Irish Government guarantee, irrespective of the credit rating.  These positive moves are recognition by the ECB of Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to deal with the banking crisis and clear evidence that the ECB&rsquo;s commitment is not merely short term.</P>
        <P>I wish to confirm to the Deputy that the Irish authorities will continue to make the strong case to the representatives of the Troika, including the ECB, of the benefits to the stability of the Irish banking system from the clarity and support that has already been provided by the ECB on the availability of official financing and to reiterate our assessment of the further strengthening of the Irish banking system that could be achieved through further clarity and certainty on this issue.</P>

	<P>I am aware that there are significant financial consequences for a number of credit unions resulting from the recent offer by Irish Life &amp; Permanent and I am aware of the background to the initial purchase of the bond in question.  It is Government policy to achieve appropriate burden-sharing from holders of subordinated debt in Irish Life &amp; Permanent and it is appropriate that these measures are applied on an equal basis between all such holders of the instruments.  There is a clear imperative to minimise the costs to the taxpayer of the Irish Life &amp; Permanent recapitalisation and to do so in a way which recognises the risk-bearing nature of the instruments in light of their subordinated position in Irish Life &amp; Permanent&rsquo;s capital structure.</P>

	<P>General Government debt is the standard measurement of gross indebtedness used for comparative purposes within the EU. General Government debt includes the National Debt as well as Local Government debt and some other minor liabilities of Government. Due to the fact that General Government debt operates on an accruals basis, the &euro;31 billion in Promissory Notes committed to financial institutions in 2010 was also added in full to the stock of General Government debt in 2010. </P>
        <P>General Government debt is a gross measure as it does not allow for the netting off of cash balances, which have been built up considerably in recent years and consequently greatly increased our level of General Government debt.</P>
        <P>The recently published Stability Programme Update (SPU) forecast that the gross General Government debt to GDP ratio will be 111% at end-2011, increasing to 118% by end-2013 before decreasing to 111% of GDP by the end of the current forecast period. However, net debt will be lower. Taking account of the funds held in the discretionary portfolio of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), which are estimated to amount to approximately &euro;5 billion at end-2011, and other liquid assets, it is estimated that net General Government debt will be approximately 98% of GDP at end-2011.</P>
        <P>The latest estimates for General Government debt, in both gross and net terms, for the years 2011-2015 are set out in the table below. The gross debt estimates are the forecasts from the SPU. While net General Government debt is not usually an indicator which is forecast, the estimates in the table below have been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions regarding the value of the discretionary portfolio of the NPRF and other liquid assets. One such assumption is that the value of the discretionary portfolio of the NPRF is approximately &euro;5 billion at the end of each of the years in the forecast period. Any changes in the assumed value of the discretionary portfolio of the NPRF and other liquid assets would impact the net debt estimates.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">It should be noted that the classification of companies into the &lsquo;financial&rsquo; sector is done by reference to the primary area of economic activity reported by the company and the taxes collected are allocated to the category without reference to the precise economic activity which generated them. While this information is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level. This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Information in relation to cumulative tax losses being carried forward by financial institutions is derived from corporation tax returns filed for the year 2009, the first year for which this information is available. The available information is the amounts of unused losses and capital <Col N="370"/>allowances that are available for carryover to years following 2009 and is estimated at &euro;34,306 million. For technical reasons, it was necessary to derive as an estimate an amount of approximately &euro;1,003 million for losses and capital allowances that was used in the computation of group relief to be offset against the gross amount of unused losses and capital allowances figure before arriving at the net total of  &euro;34,306 million. It is not possible to separately identify the amounts of unused losses from unused capital allowances in tax returns.</P>
        <P>The 100 largest financial institutions have been identified as those companies in the financial sector with the 100 largest amounts of cumulative tax losses available for carryover to years following 2009.</P>
        <P>The available information from the 2009 tax returns is the amount of unused losses and capital allowances that are available to the top 100 financial institutions for carryover to years following 2009. The amount of such unused losses and capital allowances, taking into account an estimate for any losses and capital allowances that are used in the computation of group relief, is estimated at &euro;34,039 million.  It is not possible to separately identify the amount of unused losses from unused capital allowances in tax returns. In relation to a distribution by range of tax loss of the number of financial institutions carrying tax losses forward<b>, </b>  the information requested is set out in the following table. However, because of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers, the breakdown by bands of losses is provided in a less detailed format than that requested by the Deputy.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The figures in the table are based on the amounts of unused losses and capital allowances as derived from the 2009 tax returns as being  available for carryover to years following 2009 before deduction of any losses and capital allowances that are used in the compilation of group relief. For technical reasons, it is not possible to provide a breakdown at company level of unused losses and capital allowances that are surrendered to other companies within a group structure and then claimed as group relief. An estimate of this figure for all financial institutions is &euro;1,003 million.  It is not possible to separately identify the amount of unused losses from unused capital allowances in tax returns.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that Ireland follows the international norm in that losses incurred in the course of a business are taken into account in arriving at the appropriate amount of tax that a company should bear. Under existing legislation, companies are entitled to carry forward unrelieved trading losses for offset against trading profits in future accounting periods until the losses are fully relieved.</P>
        <P>However, special arrangements apply in the case of financial institutions, in the context of dealing with impaired loan assets. In this regard, provisions were included in the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 to limit the amount of relief that can be claimed by participating institutions for losses carried forward from earlier years. This measure, which is provided for in section 396C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, has the effect of restricting the amount <Col N="371"/>of a participating institution&rsquo;s group trading income which can be reduced by losses brought forward from earlier periods to 50 per cent of such income. The measure will ensure that, when the institutions return to profitability, a minimum of 50% of their trading income will remain chargeable to tax in an accounting period notwithstanding claims for relief for losses carried forward into that period.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that an estimated 9,600 persons are working in the Republic of Ireland who have given their address as being in Northern Ireland and in respect of whom income tax returns for the tax year 2009 have been received by way of either P35 end-of-year returns filed by employers in respect of their employees or income tax form 11 returns which are required where non-PAYE income is greater than &euro;3,174.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to identify from the Revenue records how many of these cases have been in receipt of a repayment of income levy for 2009 or 2010.</P>
        <P>However, an individual, whether resident or non-resident, would have qualified for a repayment or exemption of income levy if he or she:  &mdash; proved to the Revenue Commissioners that his or her income for 2010 did not exceed &euro;15,028;  &mdash; was able to show that, by virtue of section 45 of the Health Act 1970 or Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71, he or she had full eligibility for services under Part IV of that Act; or  &mdash; if aged over 65, had an income that did not exceed &euro;20,000/&euro;40,000 per annum for single/married persons respectively.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot say what the precise impact of the pension levy will be on Defined Benefit schemes or other schemes, as this depends on whether and to what extent pension fund trustees and Life Offices decide to pass on the levy to active, deferred and retired members of schemes, given the particular circumstances of the pension funds or pension plans that they are responsible for. In that regard, I take the view that there is scope for the pensions industry to absorb the impact of the levy from fee income and charges and I have written to them in that regard.</P>
        <P>While the pension levy provisions in Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011, as recently passed by the D&aacute;il, provide an option to insurers and scheme trustees to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme on foot of the payment of the levy, amendments which I introduced at Committee stage ensure that should that  option  be taken, it must essentially be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members. In no case may the reduction in an individual member&rsquo;s or class of members benefits exceed the member&rsquo;s or class of members share of the levy on the assets attributable to the scheme&rsquo;s liabilities in respect of the member&rsquo;s or class of members benefits.</P>

        <P>Conservation works are continuing at St. Columba&rsquo;s Church. Works include the restoration of the interior including pews and flooring, certain electrical works, and access paths into the graveyard.  Following completion of these works, limited public access will be arranged.</P>
        <P>There is existing difficulty with safe vehicular access to Durrow Abbey Estate. The Office of Public Works does not have responsibility for, nor the budgetary resources to carry out the road re-alignment that is necessary for safe access and egress to and from the Estate.</P>
        <P>Until the road issue has been fully resolved, limited public access only can be offered in the short term. An indicative time-scale for the completion of the project is dependant on the required resources being available, with due consideration to other priorities within the Office of Public Works.</P>

The new scheme does not make specific provision for any enhanced pension arrangements, such as added years, for new entrant senior Civil Service appointees.  The scheme treats all such appointees in the same way, that is, their pension will accrue annually based on the pensionable salary for each individual year and will be aggregated to produce a pension on retirement.  However, the Top-Level Appointments Committee (TLAC) terms, including added years, continue to apply to existing Secretaries General where appropriate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 to 137, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Arising from amendments introduced on Committee Stage to the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011 (as now passed by the D&aacute;il), a number of changes have been made to the way in which it is proposed that the pension levy will operate. The main changes are considered necessary to facilitate a more efficient implementation and collection process for the levy and to minimize the administrative cost burden on pension funds.</P>
        <P>There will now be a single valuation date of 30 June, in relation to most pension funds&rsquo; assets, in each of the four years of the levy. There will also be a single payment date of 25 September for each of the four years as opposed to two payment dates in each year as originally envisaged. For 2011, for example, the levy for this year will have to be paid by 25 September next.</P>
        <P>The stamp duty levy of 0.6% will be applied to the market value, on the valuation date, of assets under management in pension funds and pension plans approved under Irish tax legislation. I cannot say what the precise impact will be on individual funds or schemes, as this depends on whether and to what extent pension fund trustees and Life Offices decide to pass on the levy to individual members, given the particular circumstances of the pension funds or pension plans that they are responsible for. In that regard, I take the view that there is scope for the pensions industry to absorb the impact of the levy from fee income and charges and I have written to them in that regard. In my view, applying a temporary levy to pension fund assets is less damaging economically than raising other taxes. The pension fund levy is a reasonable temporary contribution from these funds to assist in the Jobs Initiative and to boost the economy at this time of national need.</P>

While operational up until the 1980s, the mill powered a wide range of operations, including blacksmithing, wood, and stone cutting and laundering. The mill is presently not publicly accessible.</P>
        <P>A Conservation Plan was commissioned and was carried out by Shaffrey Associates, conservation architects. The Conservation Plan will enable the Office of Public Works to plan a schedule of conservation works.

The site could be made accessible to the public in a limited way at a future date, pending the satisfactory completion of works and safe public access to the site.</P>

In addition, environmental consultants were appointed by OPW to carry out an Environmental Impact Statement, and to work in tandem with the engineering consultants in identifying environmentally acceptable measures.</P>

        <P>As to the pension levy being introduced to fund the Jobs Initiative, the levy will apply to funded pension arrangements whether in the private sector or the State sector.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.</P>
        <P>At this point, no funds have yet been drawn down under the bilateral facilities. The UK facility was signed in December 2010. The interest rate on the amounts drawn down will be based on the Sterling pound mid-market semi-annual swap rate at the time of drawdown plus a margin of 2.29%.  At the time that the UK loan facility agreement was signed the overall interest cost was calculated at about 5.9%, similar to the blended rate calculated by the EU Commission from the troika at that time. The actual rate will depend on the market rates prevailing at the time of disbursement.</P>
        <P>The Danish and Swedish loan facilities have not yet been signed but are near completion. The interest rate on each will be based on the 3-month Euribor interest rate, a market reference rate of good standing, plus a margin yet to be agreed.</P>
        <P>I have not formally raised the issue of an interest rate reduction with the UK Government to date. My priority is on securing an interest rate reduction for Ireland at EU level first.</P>

        <Quest> the date on which he became aware that any reduction in the interest rate on the EFSF and EFSM funding under the EU and IMF programme would only apply to funds not yet drawn down; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The assessment of the impact of changes in the interest margin on our EU loans is based on a number of assumptions about the level of the reduction, the date on which it applies and the amount of the loan to which it applies. Each of these elements has been changing in the past number of months.  Because of this, the figures provided for any interest rate reduction have been qualified by statements to the effect that they are illustrative and that we will not know the precise position until the actual arrangement is finally agreed.   Also, a decision to grant a reduction in the interest margin is a political one at EU level and is decided on a case by case basis. No change has yet been agreed for Ireland.</P>
        <P>In mid-May, the Eurogroup decided on the margins for the EU financial assistance to Portugal which &mdash; if applied to Ireland&rsquo;s EU funding &mdash; would amount to a reduction of 0.6%.  This crystallised the level of reduction likely to be available to Ireland.  My understanding at that time also <Col N="381"/>was that the benefit of any reduction would not apply retrospectively.  More recently, I have received clarification that, if we were to get the benefit of the arrangements that apply to Greece, retrospection would not apply to any interest payments made before the decision.</P>
        <P>There is, therefore, a range of options in terms of the value of a reduction and this depends on the terms granted, which are decided on a case by case basis.  The following estimates of the likely impact illustrate the extent of this range.  If the same interest rate reduction as Portugal&rsquo;s is applied (i.e. the equivalent to 0.6% off Ireland&rsquo;s margin) to the coupons on future disbursements from the EU funds only (i.e. all the funds available to us under the EFSF and the EFSM) then the savings would be approximately &euro;150 million per annum.  Similarly, if the same interest rate reduction as Portugal&rsquo;s (i.e. the equivalent to 0.6% off Ireland&rsquo;s margin) was applied to all future coupons on those EU funds (EFSF and EFSM) then the saving could be up to &euro;240 million per annum. The upper end of this range of options referred to earlier would be a 1% reduction applied to all future coupons for both the EU funds and the bilateral loans, which would provide savings of the order of &euro;450 million per year, assuming all the funds are drawn down and that the recent Portuguese decision on the cost of funds would not be applied in the Irish case.</P>
        <P>The value of any interest rate reduction granted to Ireland will be known if and when a decision is taken on granting such a reduction, and on the terms and conditions on which it is to be granted.  We will continue to press our case for such reduction. Although no decision has yet been made on an interest rate reduction for Ireland, based on the latest information available as set out above, any benefit is unlikely to be at the higher end of the range outlined above.</P>

        <Quest> if the 0.25% increase in ECB interest rates on 7 April 2011 has had an impact on the interest rate charged on the separate funding elements of the EU and IMF programme; the interest rate that applied before and after the rate increase for each of the separate elements, IMF, EFSF, EFSM and bilateral loans; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>There is no automatic linkage between ECB interest rate changes and the interest rates charged by the EU and the IMF on their various loans to Ireland. In the case of the IMF, the Special Drawing Rights (SDR)  interest rate is somewhat influenced by a European 3-month collateralised lending rate, EUREPO, which is correlated, but not linked, to the ECB interest rate. The other elements of the IMF&rsquo;s SDR interest rate are the returns on 3-month U.S. Treasury Bills, three-month U.K. Treasury Bills and three-month Japanese Treasury Discount Bills. However, this SDR interest rate is a minor component of the overall cost and most of the IMF interest rate to Ireland is made up of surcharges. The NTMA has converted the interest rate liabilities to the IMF to fixed rate euro borrowings thereby averting any minor influence that ECB interest rate changes may have on the IMF interest rate for borrowings already entered into.  In the case of new borrowings, the level of short term interest rates is one of a number of factors influencing the level of long term interest rates and through this the cost of borrowing.</P>
        <P>In the case of the EFSF and EFSM, the interest rates charged to Ireland on existing borrowings are fixed and, therefore, not directly influenced by ECB interest rate changes &mdash; any influence is indirect. With respect to their future lending to Ireland, it is not possible to say to what extent ECB interest rate changes will have a bearing.</P>
        <P>Information on the existing disbursements to Ireland, including interest rates, is set out in the following table. These interest rates will not be affected by ECB interest rate change of 7 April 2011.</P><Col N="382"/>

	<P>Under the Euro Area Loan Facility agreed for Greece in May 2010, stability support in the form of a joint Euro area/IMF financing package of &euro;110 billion is being provided to Greece over a three-year period.</P>
        <P>Ireland contributed &euro;345.7 million (net of a 50 basis points service charge) in respect of the first two tranches of the loan in 2010. Ireland withdrew from further participation in the facility when the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland was negotiated.</P>
        <P>Interest payments on the loan in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the facility are due quarterly. The principal is repayable quarterly over two years starting in 2013. Interest is calculated on the full amount of the loan (i.e. including the 50 basis points service charge). The rate of interest is three-month EURIBOR (the average rate at which euro interbank term deposits are being offered by one prime bank to another within the EMU zone) plus 300 basis points (3 percentage points) for the first three years and three-month EURIBOR plus 400 basis points (4 percentage points) thereafter.</P>
        <P>The next interest payment is due on 15 June 2011 and the interest rate that will apply is 4.173%.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s position with regard to the credit union sector is set out in the Programme for National Government 2011-2016 which recognises the importance of credit unions as a volunteer cooperative movement and distinguishes between them and other financial institutions. The Government has established a Commission on Credit Unions to review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for credit unions.

All credit unions are required to maintain a minimum Total Regulatory Reserve of 10% of total assets.  Credit union reserves are generated from the retained earnings of credit unions and do not include dormant accounts.  Credit unions are currently not subject to the dormant accounts legislation.  Accordingly, accounts in credit unions that have not been reclaimed by the owners for at least 15 years are not transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund.</P>

        <P FLI="0">On the issue of losses, Ireland follows the international norm, in that losses incurred in the course of a business are taken into account in arriving at the appropriate amount of tax that a company should bear.  Under existing legislation, companies are entitled to carry forward unrelieved trading losses for offset against trading profits in future accounting periods until the losses are fully relieved.  However, special arrangements apply in the case of financial institutions, in the context of dealing with impaired loan assets. In this regard, provisions were included in the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 to limit the amount of relief that can be claimed by participating institutions for losses carried forward from earlier years.</P>
        <P>This measure, which is provided for in section 396C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, has the effect of restricting the amount of a participating institution&rsquo;s group trading income which can be reduced by losses brought forward from earlier periods to 50 per cent of such income.  The measure will ensure that, when the institutions return to profitability, a minimum of 50% of their trading income will remain chargeable to tax in an accounting period notwithstanding claims for relief for losses carried forward into that period.</P>

	<P>For a variety of reasons, including political and commercial, it is important that exchanges between governments and reporting by diplomatic missions take place in confidence.  In conjunction with my colleagues in Cabinet, I do not believe it to be good practice to comment on matters contained in leaked documents which have no official standing.  In the most general terms, however, it is a fact that any and all early estimates of NAMA discounts were based on a top-down aggregate estimate of the potential discount that the institutions would face and it was always made clear that the actual valuations would be determined on a loan-by-loan basis as the transfers occurred.  I can confirm that the information given to the D&aacute;il by the then Minister for Finance was based on the information and advice available to the Department of Finance at the time.</P>

This provision was included on the basis that the State was still responsible for the welfare and protection of children who were transferred to a laundry from a state regulated institution.  The Redress Board makes awards in accordance with the Act, which are fair and reasonable having regard to the unique circumstances of each applicant.   In accordance with the legislation, the Redress Board is independent in the performance of its functions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no immediate plans for the introduction of a student loan scheme.  As the Deputy will be aware where full-time undergraduate students meet the eligibility criteria of my Department&rsquo;s free fees schemes, the exchequer meets their tuition fee costs.  Financial support is also available to students at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in the form of student grants.  In addition, Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended by Section 11 of the Finance Act 2011, provides for tax <Col N="391"/>relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U. Member States and in non EU countries.  Detailed information on all financial supports for students can be found on the website www.studentfinance.ie.</P>
        <P>The implementation issues associated with introducing a student loan scheme were previously assessed by the Department of Education and Skills in the context of policy options for new forms of student contribution.  A July 2009 technical report on these policy options, including the introduction of a loan scheme, is published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Future demand for participation growth in higher education needs to be reconciled with limitations on public resources and a need to protect and enhance core quality. Although the nature of these difficult trade-offs are described in the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, the strategy also identifies the need for more detailed analysis. In this regard, I have asked the Higher Education Authority to undertake further work on the sustainability of the existing funding framework over the course of this year.  This work will inform consideration by Government of policy options in relation to future funding of the sector.</P>

Voluntary contributions by parents of pupils in such recognised schools are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition.  The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management; however their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.</P>

This Review identified that, in 2008, the annual unit cost per pupil for the  provision of school transport was some &euro;1,000, &euro;950 and &euro;7,000 for primary,  post primary and children with special educational needs respectively.

	<P>The gross expenditure provision for 2011 for my Department of &euro;8.91 billion  contained in the 2011 Revised Estimates Volume does not readily compare with  recorded expenditure of &euro;8.705 billion in 2007. This is mainly due to: (a) the transfer in 2010 of certain functions in relation to Skills Development  from the former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to my Department  (provision of &euro;164 million in 2011); (b) the transfer from 2011 of responsibility for Nursing Education from the  Department of Health to my Department (provision of &euro;56 million in 2011); and (c) the transfer in 2009 of responsibility for certain Youth Organisations and  Youth Activities from my Department to the Office of the Minister for Children  and Youth Affairs (expenditure of &euro;58 million in 2007).   When account is taken of the above, equivalent estimated expenditure in 2011  for my Department of &euro;8.690 billion compares to expenditure of &euro;8.647 billion  in 2007 &mdash; an increase of 0.5%. </P>
        <P>Reductions in expenditure arising from a range of measures introduced in recent  Budgets, including reductions in pay rates, reductions in rates of grants and  other savings measures across various programmes, have been offset, in large  part, by the additional costs associated with increases in student numbers at  first, second and third levels during the period.</P>

	<P>Mock examinations are not part of the State examinations system. The decision to organise and/or charge for mock examinations is made at school level, and my Department does not have role in the matter. Schools are provided with capitation and school services grants to meet their running costs.  </P>
        <P>Post-primary schools receive school services grant of &euro;201 per pupil plus a capitation grant of &euro;328 per pupil. DEIS schools also receive additional funds for targeted interventions to improve educational outcomes for students at risk.</P>
        <P>It is important for schools to be sensitive to the financial pressures on families, and to use the State funds provided to optimum effect. However, my Department is not in a position to make additional funds available to schools in the current climate.</P>
        <P>Ideally, mock examinations should be marked by teachers as part of their ongoing work in schools. While schools in the Free Education Scheme may seek voluntary contributions from parents, they may not charge fees for teaching and  learning activities scheduled as part of the school day, or exclude students from such services for non payment of a fee.</P>

        <P>The previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green party Government introduced three changes to the  student grant schemes, which began to take effect of January of this year when  the overall rate of grant <Col N="393"/>was reduced by 4%.  Therefore, all qualifying  students either on a course or commencing a course from January of 2011 will  receive the reduced rate of grant.</P>
        <P>The automatic entitlement of mature students to the non-adjacent rate of grant  was removed effective from September 2011.  This applies to all mature students  either commencing a course in September 2011 or continuing on a course at that  time.</P>
        <P>Finally, the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant  was increased for 24kms to 45kms.  Again, this takes affect from September 2011  and it will it apply to all new students and to those continuing on courses  equally.</P>

	<P>From September 2010, the previous Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; Green Party Government removed  eligibility for all new applicants in receipt of the Back to Education  Allowance (BTEA), and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses, for  student maintenance grants. However, the cost of the student services charge and tuition fees payable to colleges continues to be met for eligible students by the Exchequer on their behalf.  </P>
        <P>I understand that the reason it was decided to discontinue the practice of  allowing students to hold both an allowance and a grant simultaneously was  because this represented a duplication of income support payments. I regret  that the economic circumstances of the country are such that I am not in a  position to reverse this change.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that students including mature students in receipt of  the BTEA or VTOS allowances and the maintenance grant prior to 2010 continue to  be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course provided  they meet the terms and conditions of the relevant grant schemes.</P>
        <P>It might be of assistance to the student in question to know that the Student  Assistance Fund at some &euro;5m continues to be made available through the access  offices of third-level institutions to assist students, including mature  students, in exceptional financial need. The access offices themselves will also provide support and advice to students to enable them to continue with their studies.</P>

	<P>Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) is managed by the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) alongside the School Completion Programme (SCP) and the  Education Welfare Service (EWS) as part of the Integration of Education  Services Project. The aim and rationale for the Integrated Service is to  provide more effective services for children who have difficulties  participating in school; improved engagement with other agencies and services  working with children and families; more effective policy making with an  increased emphasis on planning, outcome measurement and the gathering of  evidence on the impact of interventions.  </P>
        <P>A number of children&rsquo; services, from various sectors, including the National  Education Welfare Board are being brought together under the responsibility of  my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Responsibility for  SCP and NEWB, together with their budgets <Col N="395"/>have transferred to the Department of  Children and Youth Affairs with effect from 2 June 2011. While responsibility  for the future direction of Home School Community Liaison has also transferred,  the allocation of HSCL coordinator posts will remain the responsibility of my  Department as these are teaching posts in schools, deployed to undertake full  time HSCL duties.</P>
        <P>The current provision of Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) Services, will  remain in the 200 post primary and 345 urban primary schools participating in  DEIS.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</P>
        <P>The NCSE issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for SNA support for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.</P>

A person wishing to apply for a training phase exemption from an apprenticeship  programme must secure employment as an apprentice with a F&Aacute;S approved employer for the  relevant trade and his or her employer must register the apprentice with F&Aacute;S within two weeks of taking the  person into his employment as an apprentice </P>

	<P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement  an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. Under section  15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to  disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that  principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a  school of the parents choice are respected.  </P>
        <P>In certain circumstances a parent may wish to transfer a child from his/her  existing school to another and it is open to any parent to seek to enrol a  child in another school if the parent so wishes. However, my Department has no  evidence of such school transfers occurring on a scale that impacts adversely  on school planning or staffing.  The Deputy may be aware that separately I have just launched a discussion paper  on school enrolment. The document, &ldquo;Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework  for School Enrolment&rdquo; contains suggestions on how to make the process of  enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent and I am inviting  education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my  Department by the 28th of October.</P>

	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers has applied to my Department for large scale capital funding for an extension. The application has been assessed in  accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building  projects and was assigned a band 1 rating. Enrolments at the school have  remained fairly static over the past number of years and the school has not  experienced the rapid increase in enrolments that was anticipated and that has  occurred in other schools around the county.   The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in  the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme with due regard to the level of additional school provision which  will be required at both primary and post primary level to meet demographic  increases. In light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all  assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie. </P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the enrolment of a child in a school is a  matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of  Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing  applications for enrolment in schools. The National Educational Welfare Board  (NEWB) is the statutory agency which assists parents who are experiencing  difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will try to  help parents to find an alternative school placement if their child has been  unable to secure a placement to date.   Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform  parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal  that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where an appeal under  Section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General may direct a school to enrol a  pupil.  The Deputy may be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE),  through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is  responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational  needs supports. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating  such support.  The SENOs co-ordinate special needs education provision at local level and  arrange for the delivery of special educational services. They act as single  points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs.  Another specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational  placements for children with special educational needs.   All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may  also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special  educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.   In considering applications for teaching and SNA support for individual pupils,  the SENOs take account of the needs identified in the professional reports and  decide whether the circumstances come within the Department&rsquo;s criteria. They  then consider the resources available to the school to identify <Col N="400"/>whether  additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to  meet the needs of the pupil from its current level of resources.   Finally, I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the home tuition scheme provides  funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number  of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was  extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable  educational placement. Home tuition support may therefore be made available for  a child for whom there is no school place available, subject to the scheme&rsquo;s  criteria.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201, 216, 219, 227 and 228 together.</P>
        <P>I regret that the economic circumstances of the country are such that I am not in a position to reverse any of the changes to the student grant measures announced in Budget 2011 by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government. These changes included the removal of the automatic entitlement of mature students to the non-adjacent rate of grant and an increase in the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant.  It is estimated that some 30% of the student grant cohort or some 21,600, are mature students and all of these would currently be in receipt of the non-adjacent rate of grant. From next September, mature students who reside 45 kilometres or more from their higher education institution will continue to be eligible for the higher rate of grant. Those on particularly low incomes will also continue to receive a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; in the special rate of grant. In addition, third level students in difficult financial circumstances will have access to the Student Assistance Fund.  I understand the concerns of students with regard to the changes to the student grant schemes for the 2011/12 academic year and I will take account of these in considering any future changes as part of the budgetary process for 2012 and beyond, having regard to the position of the public finances.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In December 2010 the European Commission approved the Irish application for European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) co-financing assistance in support of workers made redundant at the SR Technics aircraft maintenance facility at Dublin Airport in 2009. The EGF application was for a total of &euro;11.46m, of which the approved EU contribution is &euro;7.45m.  Funding for the EGF programme measures is provided by my Department to relevant intermediate bodies and service providers who facilitate the delivery of the guidance, training, educational and enterprise supports as set out in the approved European Commission decision on the EGF application. Relevant service providers such as F&Aacute;S, City and County Enterprise Boards (CEBs), Vocational and Education Committees (VECs) and higher education institutions and colleges have, since March 2009, provided the former SR Technics workers with a range of occupational guidance, training, educational opportunities and enterprise supports.</P>
<P LI="0">To date these supports include the provision of:&mdash;</P>
<P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Almost 850 F&Aacute;S training places and a specialist F&Aacute;S redundant aircraft mechanic apprentice training programme in conjunction with the Department of Defence and Air Corps</P>
<P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Over 140 places higher education supports including almost 100 full-time courses as well as customised VEC courses</P>
<P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />CEBs guidance and mentoring supports to almost 100 workers and grant support to 33 workers.</P>
<P FLI="0">Ireland is required to use the EGF financial contribution received from the EU budgetary authorities before 9 October 2011 and must send its final report for the execution of the financial contribution to the European Commission not later than 9 March 2012. The full range of EGF co-financed services will continue to be provided to eligible participants until the EGF implementation period expires on 9 October 2011.  In this context, it is not yet possible to provide a detailed breakdown of expenditure on the EGF programme in advance while new or additional claims from various service providers are still awaited or are being processed and any relevant reconciliations between national and EU funding still need to be assessed and verified. However, on foot of claims received from a certain number of these providers, my Department has paid out a total of &euro;538,626 to date for enterprise supports and third level programmes under the SR Technics EGF programme.  Further, the Department last week contracted with WRCsec consultants for administrative and technical support services in the preparation of the SR Technics EGF programme final report. Their work will focus on delivering the reporting requirements, <i>inter alia</i>, for financial and management information data across all service providers.</P>

I am pleased to inform the Deputy <Col N="402"/>that 24 primary and post primary schools were successful under this year&rsquo;s Scheme.  Details of the successful applicants under the 2011 Summer Works Scheme were announced on 30th March 2011 and are published on the Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.education.ie</i>. &euro;41.2m will be made available under the scheme this year and will see major improvements in the 453 primary and post primary schools around the country, including Co. Kerry, that have been successful in their applications for funding.  I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that a further 5 schools in County Kerry were successful under the Jobs Initiative announced on 10 May 2011, details of which are also published on the Department&rsquo;s website. &euro;40 million will be made available through the Jobs Initiative to fund 374 primary and post primary school building projects. These funds will allow schools to carry out small and medium scale building works such as special needs access, toilet facilities, roof works and window replacements. It is envisaged that the investment will also create 2,400 direct and 480 indirect much needed jobs in the construction sector. My Department has no plans to allocate further additional funding in the current year. I have listed all successful applications for Co. Kerry under both Schemes for the Deputies&rsquo; convenience.</P>

	<P>I have taken no decision in relation to the introduction of a capital assets test for student grant purposes.  I have made it clear, however, that I want to ensure that the objective of the student grant schemes is met. This objective is the most equitable distribution of the available resources in favour of those who have the greatest level of need and who clearly comply with the terms of the student grant schemes. As the current system deals with income alone, it allows people with accumulated wealth &mdash; be they unemployed, employed, self-employed or retired &mdash; to obtain grants which were designed as a State support for those with insufficient means to ensure access to higher education for their children. It is intended that a single student grant awarding authority will be in place from 2012. This will enable fundamental reform of the student grants administration process and will allow for improvements to the way in which grant assessment is carried out. This development, together with improvements in the administration of means testing generally, will inform further consideration of the introduction of a capital assets test for student grants.</P>

	<P>It is the intention of my Department to provide the school to which the Deputy refers with a new building. In this regard, agreement has been reached to provide the new building on a V.E.C. owned site.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including the project in question, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time. In this regard, the position with all applications for large scale capital funding may be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website.  In the meantime, my Department replaced all of the existing accommodation at the school and it is now operating from new temporary accommodation since September 2009.</P>

	<P>The Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy was launched in 2006, following wide ranging consultation with stakeholders including Traveller representatives. It covers all aspects of Traveller education from preschool to further and higher education. A core principle of the strategy is that allocation of resources is based on &lsquo;individual educational need&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;Traveller identity&rsquo;. My Department&rsquo;s aim is to prioritise the available resources to maximum effect across the education sector to enhance educational outcomes for all children and adults including Travellers.  In the context of The National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 and in keeping with the report, the Government has taken a decision to provide educational teaching supports to Traveller students on the same basis as other students in schools. This means that Traveller students who require additional tuition will receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools. All schools should select students for learning support on the basis of priority of need.  Under the National Recovery Plan, the Resource Teaching posts for Travellers and the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers (VTST) will be withdrawn, effective from 31 August 2011.  In order to assist schools, with high concentrations of Traveller pupils, limited alleviation or adjustment measures are being provided. As such, alleviation measures are being concentrated on schools which had 33 or more pupils supported by RTT posts. Furthermore Traveller enrolments have been included in the valid enrolment for the purpose of allocating additional staffing under DEIS from the 2011/12 school year.  While responsibility for the National Education Welfare Board (NEWB) has transferred to my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the two Departments will work together to ensure that the services in the NEWB, including the School Completion Programme, Home School Community Liaison and the Education Welfare Service will have a renewed focus to more effectively target and support all children at risk, including Traveller children. All Further Education programmes are open to Travellers and include both full time programmes (Post Leaving Certificate programme; Vocational Educational Opportunities Scheme; and Youthreach) and part time programmes (Back to Education Initiative; and Adult Literacy and Community Education).</P>

Such initiatives include:  Cycle-to-work scheme: The Cycle-to-work scheme for staff is in operation in my Department since 2009. To date 164 staff members have availed of this scheme.  Travel pass scheme: The travel pass scheme for public transport is also available to Department staff. The Scheme allows staff to purchase an annual travel pass for bus, DART, train or Luas by tax free salary deductions. Currently 106 staff avail of this scheme.  Business travel policy: My Department&rsquo;s policy in relation to the claiming of travel and subsistence expenses specify that all travel should be by the shortest practicable routes and by the cheapest practicable mode of transport. Officers are encouraged to use public transport whenever practicable, with private transport to be used only in limited circumstances, viz. (a) When there is no suitable public transport available;(b) Where public transport is available only at equal or greater expense; (c) Where the use of public transport would result in the loss of official time which it is necessary to avoid. In addition, my Department promotes the annual European Mobility week and supports the &lsquo;car free day&rsquo; by encouraging staff who regularly drive to leave their cars at home.</P>

	<P>Changes to school transport services were announced in the 2011 Budget by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the scheme.  It is important to stress that there are a number of dimensions to the cessation of the Closed School Rule (CSR).  The first of these, which will be implemented from September 2011, involves the uniform application of the distance criterion to all pupils travelling under the primary transport scheme, including those travelling under the CSR. This means that children residing less than 3.2 kilometres from their school of amalgamation will be deemed ineligible for school transport. In such cases, these children may apply for concessionary transport. The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date. This second element will restrict school transport eligibility for those pupils entering in September 2012, to pupils who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school. </P>

	<P>Changes to school transport services were announced in the 2011 Budget by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the scheme. Given the major financial constraints facing the country, I regret that I cannot reverse the changes to school transport as announced by the previous Government in Budget 2011. We all have to understand the legacy of economic mismanagement which the last Government gave to the country.  It is important to stress that there are a number of dimensions to the cessation of the Closed School Rule (CSR).  The first of these, which will be implemented from September 2011, involves the uniform application of the distance criterion to all pupils travelling under the primary transport scheme, including those travelling under the CSR. This means that children residing less than 3.2 kilometres from their school of amalgamation will be deemed ineligible for school transport. In such cases, these children may apply for concessionary transport. The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date.</P>
        <P>This second element will restrict school transport eligibility for those pupils entering in September 2012, to pupils who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school.  Available statistics, based on sampling undertaken as part of the Value for Money Review, indicate that the impact of this change will be limited as the majority of pupils categorised under the CSR are in fact attending their nearest school and will not be affected by this change.  Before implementing this second main change which is proposed for 2012, my Department has requested Bus &Eacute;ireann to conduct a detailed analysis of the &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; impact for individual schools and the rural communities they serve. This analysis will be based on the most up to date information available on current school transport usage patterns and I expect to have this information available to me this summer. I will then have an opportunity to carefully examine the likely affects of this change well in advance of the 2012 implementation date.</P>

The document is one of a large suite of guidance documents published by my Department. This particular document is provided to assist school authorities with the engagement of consultants and to ensure that any consultants employed are competent and qualified in the appropriate disciplines to carry out the works that they are appointed to do. This document also provides for the appointment of other consultants depending on the nature of the works to be grant aided.  As these guidelines provide a balanced approach by allowing access for smaller firms while also ensuring that appropriate consultants are engaged for small works I do not propose to make any changes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 and 226 together. </P>
        <P>These changes derive from decisions of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government to implement recommendations in the School Transport Value for Money review relating to the primary school transport system and the need to obtain savings under the four year national recovery plan.</P>
        <P>The decisions announced cover the uniform application of the distance requirement, cessation of the Closed/Central School Rule (CSR), the minimum number of eligible children required to establish and retain services and the introduction of charges for eligible primary pupils.</P><Col N="410"/>
        <P>In the case of the cessation of the Closed/Central School Rule (CSR) there are broadly two aspects to this change. The first of these, which will be implemented from September 2011, involves the application of the distance eligibility criterion to all children travelling under the primary school transport scheme, including those travelling under the CSR. This change to school transport provision means that the distance eligibility criterion will be applied uniformly and equitably on a national basis. The practical impact is that children categorised for transport under the CSR who reside less than 3.2 kilometres from their school of attendance and who are availing of free transport to that school will lose their transport eligibility. In such cases, these children may apply for concessionary transport at an annual charge, currently of &euro;200 per pupil, subject to a family maximum of &euro;650 per annum. The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of children commencing their primary education from that date. This second element will restrict school transport eligibility for those children entering in September 2012, to children who meet the distance eligibility criterion and who are travelling to their nearest school. A sample survey undertaken as part of the Value for Money Review, on transport arrangements for pupils availing of transport under the CSR, showed that the majority of pupils are in fact attending their nearest open school, so this change will not have any practical impact on these pupils.</P>
        <P>In relation to this second change scheduled to be implemented in September 2012, Bus &Eacute;ireann is currently conducting a detailed analysis of the &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; impact of this for individual schools and the rural communities they serve. This analysis will be based on the most up to date information available on current school transport usage patterns and I expect to have this information available to me this summer. I will then have an opportunity to carefully examine the likely effects of this proposed change well in advance of the 2012 implementation date.</P>
        <P>A further change which will take effect in September 2011 is the increase from 7 to 10 in the number of eligible pupils, residing in a distinct locality, required to retain or establish a school transport service.  In general, this means that the minimum number required to establish or retain a service broadly represents a return to 2002 levels.  As is currently the position, a Remote Area Grant is payable for eligible children for whom no transport service is available.</P>
        <P>An annual charge for eligible primary pupils will be introduced from the commencement of the 2011/12 school year. This charge is set at &euro;50 per pupil with a maximum family charge of &euro;110 for primary pupils. The charge of &euro;50 represents some 5% recoupment of the actual cost. Pupils with valid medical cards will be exempt from this charge. This charge is being introduced to ensure that school transport services are fully utilised in an efficient and cost effective manner.</P>
        <P>It is essential to stress that the wider context within which all these changes are taking place, is a situation of the most serious financial difficulties. Under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of &euro;17 million on the school transport budget and these measures are an integral part of this.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 229 and 249 together.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post-primary schools for special educational needs supports. This includes the allocation of resource teaching hours to schools as well as the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required and the discontinuation of such classes where the need no longer exists.</P>
        <P>The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such supports.</P>
        <P>In respect of special classes, schools are required to observe Department policy in enrolling children to these classes. This includes having a professional assessment confirming that the child&rsquo;s attainment levels meet the Department&rsquo;s criteria and a recommendation for special class placement. Schools are eligible for resources for special classes when the pupils enrolled meet the Department&rsquo;s criteria.</P>
        <P>Schools are required to liaise with their local SENO in the context of any proposed placements in such classes. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.</P>
        <P>In respect of resource teaching support, Circular 37/2011 provides information to schools regarding the arrangements which are being put in place for the 2011/12 school year for the allocation of Resource Teaching hours for children with assessed special educational needs. The NCSE are now in the process of notifying schools of their allocations for the coming school year.</P>

Due to commercial sensitivities pertaining to site acquisitions generally it is not my Department&rsquo;s policy to provide details of the purchase cost of sites recently acquired as it could jeopardise ongoing site acquisitions.</P>

This number is 10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts. This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number. It also represents continual increases in the number of SNAs over recent years. It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will probably be aware that, currently, there are four student grant schemes administered by 66 grant awarding bodies (local authorities and VECs) on my Department&rsquo;s behalf. However, earlier this year, the Student Support Act became law. This enables the consolidation of the four existing schemes into a single unified scheme.</P>
        <P>As a consequence, a fundamental review of the schemes was necessary together with the formulation of secondary legislation. This process is nearing completion and I expect to be able to publish the new scheme shortly.</P>
        <P>While the publication of the scheme will be a number of weeks later than last year, this is still considerably ahead of the publication date in previous years.  I hope the Deputy will appreciate that this was unavoidable in view of the considerable additional work that had to be undertaken beyond the norm this year.  Despite earlier publication of the schemes, one of the principal reasons for delays in the processing of applications is that many students still wait until very late in the process, frequently only after a CAO offer is made, to apply for a grant.  My Department will continue to use a range of channels such as the USI, Institute of Guidance Counsellors and CAO etc. to encourage students to apply early.  Every effort will be made in the grant awarding authorities to process grant applications in a timely manner once they have been received.</P>

	<P>The rate of entry for Higher Level Maths in the Leaving Certificate 2011 is 0.05% lower than that pertaining in 2010. While the overall trend is downwards, too much significance cannot be read into a change of this order.  Normally, around 20% of students who apply to sit Mathematics at Higher Level in the Leaving Certificate actually sit the examination at a lower level. </P>
        <P>A major programme of reform in Mathematics is under way in all second level schools since September last, building on the experience of 24 schools which began the programme in 2008.  Project Maths is designed to encourage better understanding of mathematics, to reinforce its practical relevance to everyday life, and to ensure better curriculum continuity across the system.  A key objective is to improve attainment levels in Maths and to encourage more students to take the subject at higher level.  The programme is supported by a comprehensive investment in professional development for teachers which will run to at least 2013.  Only students in the 24 schools will sit a Leaving Certificate examination in 2011 in the Project Maths programme.  However, experience of these schools in the Leaving Certificate in 2010 showed a modest increase in the proportion who sat the subject at Higher Level, 18.7% compared with 16.0% nationally.</P>
        <P>Higher education institutions have collectively agreed to operate a bonus points scheme for Higher Level Mathematics for a four year trial period from 2012 to 2015 inclusive, with a review in 2014.  A bonus of 25 points will be allocated to students who achieve a grade D3 or above in LC Higher Level mathematics.  This pilot scheme has been specifically designed with the objective of maximizing the numbers of Leaving Cert students who study for and sit the Higher Level maths examinations, and in particular of reducing the numbers of students who might drop down from Higher to Ordinary Level during the senior cycle.</P>
        <P>I also intend to publish a National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy shortly which will provide a continuum of measures designed to improve performance in these critical areas.  The NCCA will shortly advise me on reforms in junior cycle which are designed to address curriculum overload and rote learning, and promote creativity and innovation.  In addition, I have also asked higher education institutions to examine the scope for reform of the CAO points system to overcome some of its negative backwash effects on senior cycle students&rsquo; learning.</P><Col N="420"/>
        <P>Taken together, these initiatives are intended to improve attainment in Mathematics and increase the numbers of students taking Higher Level.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 to 254, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>Broadcasting media organisations, including undertakings involved in commercial radio, are subject to the licensing requirements of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, including in relation to issues such as diversity and plurality of ownership.  Policy responsibility in this area lies with my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and I have no direct function in the matter.</P>
        <P>Mergers between media undertakings, whether or not such undertakings are involved in print or broadcast media, are subject to regulatory control.  The Competition Act 2002 requires that media mergers be notified to the Competition Authority (which is independent in the exercising of its statutory functions) to determine if the merger will result in a significant lessening of competition. The Competition Act also requires media mergers to be notified to me as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  If the Competition Authority decides that there will be a significant lessening of competition, then the merger cannot go ahead.  If there is no significant lessening of competition, the Act requires that I, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Inno<Col N="421"/>vation, in deciding whether or not to approve such mergers, or to approve them subject to conditions, have to have regard to certain relevant criteria, including the impact of the merger on the extent to which ownership or control of media businesses in the State is spread amongst individuals and other undertakings.</P>
        <P>The Advisory Group on Media Mergers, which was established in 2008, was requested to review the current legislative framework relating to the public interest aspects of media mergers in Ireland.

	<P>Broadcasting legislation regulates aspects of the ownership of broadcasting entities through the imposition of licensing requirements.  Competition legislation imposes a public interest consideration in instances of mergers of media undertakings: however, these latter regulatory controls do not apply to media businesses involved in the provision of audio-visual material over the Internet.</P>
        <P>The Advisory Group on Media Mergers, which was established in 2008, was requested to review the current legislative framework relating to the public interest aspects of media mergers in Ireland.  The Group&rsquo;s Report, which was published in 2009, and the eleven recommendations contained therein were considered in the context of a wider review of the operation and implementation of the Competition Act 2002.  Included in these recommendations was one recommending the removal of the exemption of undertakings involved in the provision of audio-visual material over the Internet from the media merger provisions of competition law.</P>
        <P>I will be seeking Government approval shortly for legislation arising, <i>inter alia</i>, from this review, including the possibility of extending the public interest criteria for media mergers to certain aspects of the operations of undertakings involved in the provision of audio-visual material over the Internet as recommended by the Advisory Group on Media Mergers.</P>

	<P>The Central Statistics Office publishes indices of consumer prices, including the EU Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is accepted as the best method of comparing consumer prices across the European Union.  The most recent Harmonised Index has shown that consumer prices in Ireland rose by 1.5% in the twelve months to April 2011 as compared with rises of 3.2% in the rest of the community and 4.5% in our nearest neighbour the UK for the same period.  Indeed the Index has shown that prices continue to rise faster in every other country of the European Union than Ireland. </P>
        <P>Insofar as the sectors mentioned in the question are concerned, the Deputy will be aware that the Competition Authority has published a number of reports resulting from studies it carried out on various sectors or professions since 2004.  The reports usually contain a suite of recommendations, aimed at improving competition in the relevant area and are addressed to the responsible Government Department or body.  Such reports have included the medical and legal professions.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for any proposals aimed at ending apparent restrictions on competition in a particular sector rests with the Minister with responsibility for that particular policy area.  For example, policy proposals concerning the legal and medical sectors are matters for my colleagues, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Health respectively.  I understand that both Ministers are working on proposals in respect of these sectors at present.</P>
        <P>Given the responsibility of my Department for competition policy in general, I will be reporting to Government shortly on the progress achieved by a number of Government Departments in the implementation of the Competition Authority recommendations and I will continue to urge my Government colleagues to ensure that everything is done to help improve competitiveness in their areas of responsibility.</P>
        <P>The Government is determined to ensure that the narrowing of differentials in prices with our competitors as evidenced in the CSO&rsquo;s recent returns will continue particularly in areas such as utility charges, professional fees, etc and thereby ensuring that the improvement in our relative cost competitiveness continues.</P>

        <Quest> his views that foreign food, clothing and furniture multiples are justified in describing the Irish Republic as treasure island in view of the lack of invigilation of their pricing policies which often place such companies Irish operations as their most profitable by far in the EU and OECD; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>These consumer price trends, which show Irish prices rising at a slower rate than other EU countries, reflect the efforts that are being taken by this Government to restore our national competitiveness, which is helping to reduce costs for business, obtain better value for money and provide for greater opportunities for job creation.  Notwithstanding the improvements in our relative competitiveness, costs continue to remain high in a number of areas.  The Government is, therefore, determined to continue the drive to restore national competitiveness, including in the area of price competitiveness, thereby supporting the continued return to economic growth and job creation.</P>

	<P>Job creation is central to our economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.  The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate both job creation and job retention. </P>
        <P>The Jobs Initiative includes measures designed to increase access to credit for viable SMEs through the introduction of a temporary partial loan guarantee scheme, as well as the development of a Microfinance Fund; lowering costs for employers by halving employers PRSI for jobs paying up to &euro;356 per week; and providing a much needed boost for tourism and retail through the abolition of the travel tax and the reduction in targeted VAT from 13.5% to 9%.  These measures will stimulate the business environment across all Regions, including the South-East.</P>
        <P>In relation to the State Development agencies under the aegis of my Department &mdash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, and the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) are continuing to drive and promote enterprise development, and consequently employment creation in the South East Region.  According to the latest figures available, there are more than 32,000 people employed in agency-assisted companies in the South East Region and almost 6,500 in companies supported by the CEBs operating in the Region.</P>
        <P>In terms of facilitating job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s innovation capability at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and Third Level institutions.  So far this year, the agency has paid out almost &euro;4.2m in support for companies, entrepreneurs and Third Level institutes in the South East Region.</P>
        <P>Attracting investment and employment opportunities to the South East is a high priority for IDA Ireland.  The agency is continuing to vigorously promote the region to potential new investors and there has been an increased level of interest expressed in the South East Region this year from potential investors.  One announcement for the South East Region this year will create 50 new jobs in Waterford.  Also, jobs announced for the Region over the past couple of years continue to come on stream.  As well as marketing the region for new Greenfield investment, IDA continues to work with existing clients to broaden their mandate in Ireland and to continue to re-invest in their sites within the Region.  While we are operating in a very difficult economic environment, there are still investment opportunities in global markets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During 2010, the CEBs operating in the South East Region paid almost &euro;1.8m in grant assistance to 196 clients.  This year, the CEBs in the South East Region have continued to support enterprise development through the provision of direct financial assistance and indirect assistance, such as management development, capability support and the development and delivery of activities to highlight and promote enterprise.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 and 268 together.</P>
        <P>I am very concerned about the job losses that have been announced and of the impact that they have had on the workers concerned and their families as well as the communities affected.</P>
        <P>I understand that Vodafone Ireland, which is not an IDA or EI client, has announced this as a part of a review of its European operations and which will also impact on its operations in other EU Member States.  I am advised, as part of this process, that the company has been in discussions with unions and its Irish Call Centre contract partner, Rigney Dolphin.  I am aware that Vodafone has decided that a portion of the existing contracted call centre operations in Dundalk and Dublin will be moved to other locations &mdash; Egypt and India &mdash; within the Vodafone Group and to other specialist contractors in Ireland.</P>
        <P>This decision will impact 45 Vodafone roles and 139 in Rigney Dolphin &mdash; the 139 staff are employed by Rigney Dolphin but are in-sourced to Vodafone and are based at its sites in Dublin and Dundalk.  I have been assured that Rigney Dolphin will work through the implications of the redundancies with their employees.</P>
        <P>I also understand that all impacted Vodafone employees will be offered the opportunity to transfer to alternative roles within Vodafone Ireland, and voluntary redundancy packages will be offered.  A consultation process is now underway with all Vodafone employees affected by the decision to finalise the alternatives available.  The changes to Vodafone Call Centre operations will take place in late 2011 and early 2012.</P>
        <P>Last week, my officials and Minister of State Sean Sherlock met with Vodafone.  The company explained that in the current market environment, cost efficiencies are a prerequisite so as to ensure their continued ability to compete in the Irish market where they employ over 1,000 people.  In particular, this includes being in a position to make major funding investments in Ireland that will be required in the future to compete in the market.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the State Development agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, as well as the Louth County Enterprise Board will continue to promote Dundalk and the surrounding area for industrial projects and enterprise development.</P>
        <P>Job creation is central to economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.  The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate both job creation and job retention.  The programmes supported by my Department and its agencies will be critical in achieving economic growth through promoting the export potential of enterprise in Ireland and driving our Smart Economy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265, 273, 275 and 276 together.</P>
        <P>The overall finding of the Report of the Review of Employment Regulations Orders and Registered Employment Agreement Wage Setting Mechanisms was that the basic framework of the current JLC/REA regulatory system requires radical overhaul so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.</P>
        <P>The report of the Independent Review does not recommend, nor have I proposed, specific adjustments in wage rates for the sectors covered by JLCs / REAs.</P>
        <P>Together with the decision to restore the National Minimum Wage to &euro;8.65 per hour, the decision to reform the Joint Labour Committee structure represents a significant commitment by the Government to the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers in the economy.</P>
        <P>However, we need to ensure that statutory wage fixing mechanisms work effectively and efficiently and that they do not have a negative impact on economic performance and employment levels.</P>
        <P>The sectors and occupations where the greatest job losses have occurred in the economy generally coincide with the sectors where the minimum wage/sectoral agreements are most prevalent.  In the past three years, there has been a 60 per cent loss of employment in construction and 15 per cent in the retail and wholesale sectors.  While demand in these sectors is clearly a key factor, labour costs represent a relatively high proportion of total output costs in these locally traded sectors.</P>
        <P>I am convinced, however, that the JLC system must be made more responsive and become fit for purpose in the context of a modern economy.  The benefits of retaining these sectoral wage-setting mechanisms cannot be outweighed by economic and competitiveness penalties incurred as a consequence of a lack of responsiveness, coherence and precision in both EROs and REAs.  The report of the Independent Review, which was undertaken in line with the EU/ECB/IMF programme of support for Ireland, highlights the deficiencies in these mechanisms.  It is now time to signal that decisive action will be taken to remove them.</P>
        <P>The available evidence suggests that rates of pay in key sectors of the economy covered by JLCs have increased at a faster pace when compared to, for example, the National Minimum Wage.  In many cases, JLCs cover the very sectors that are experiencing some of the greatest competitive pressures, including in the hospitality sector, which is central to our ambitions to regain Ireland&rsquo;s position as a top tourist destination.  Comparable wage rates in the UK and Northern Ireland add further weight to the compelling case for reform.</P>
        <P>I am anxious to pursue the agenda for radical overhaul of the ERO/ REA system as a matter of urgency, including proposals dealt with in the report and other issues raised by the report.  To this end, I have set out an outline of my proposals for that agenda to the Social Partners, and these have already been the subject of discussion with the Construction Industry Federation, IBEC and ICTU.  I have also heard the views of other stakeholder bodies whose members are covered by our statutory wage setting mechanisms.</P><Col N="427"/>
        <P>In accordance with the terms of the EU/IMF programme, discussions have also taken place with the Commission Services in this regard.</P>
        <P>These discussions afforded me the opportunity to hear at first hand the views of the main representative bodies of employers and trade unions on how a meaningful and overdue reform might be implemented in these wage-setting mechanisms, which affect key sectors of our economy, in order to protect existing jobs and encourage employment growth.</P>
        <P>Discussions with relevant parties have concluded and I will be submitting a final action plan for consideration by Government before the end of the month.</P>
        <P>The detailed plan will implement far-reaching reforms of the current system including making any legislative changes that may be necessary.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> the steps that National Employment Rights Authority is taking to address the issue of exploitation of workers who are employed as au pairs and live-in childminders, many of whom are here on student visas and are more vulnerable to being exploited. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The commonly accepted position regarding &ldquo;au pairs&rdquo; is that of a young person who chooses to help look after the children of a host family and carry out light housekeeping duties. The au pair is given room and board and is typically paid weekly &ldquo;pocket-money&rdquo; and gains experience of a new culture while also improving his or her foreign language skills. </P>
        <P>There is no specific regulatory framework covering &ldquo;au pairs&rdquo; in place in Ireland.  Therefore, their legal status will depend on the circumstances of each individual Au Pair/Sponsor relationship.  Au Pairs may or may not be considered as employees within the provisions of Irish employment law depending on the terms and conditions, which apply to the relationship with the sponsor family. The relationship could also be construed to be in the form of a house/family guest receiving out of pocket expenses, an internship or a work experience programme.</P>
        <P>Any complaints received by NERA regarding &ldquo;au pairs&rdquo; will initially be examined using the provisions of the &lsquo;Code of Practice Determining the Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals&rsquo; in order to determine the employment status of the relationship.  Where the employment status of such individuals cannot be clarified or is disputed, the employer or employee in dispute may be directed to make a request in writing for a ruling to Scope Section of the Dept. of Social Protection or this may be done by NERA.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all workers employed on an employer-employee basis in Ireland.  The Protection of Employees (Part-Time) Work Act, 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation applies to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment in another person&rsquo;s home, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under law as all other workers.</P>
        <P>There is a Code of Practice for Protecting Persons Employed in Other People&rsquo;s Homes. The code:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Sets out certain employment rights and protections for persons employed in other people&rsquo;s homes; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Encourages good practice and compliance with the law concerning the employment of persons in other people&rsquo;s homes; and</P><Col N="428"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Increases awareness of the application of relevant legislation and Codes of Practice with regard to the sector to which this Code applies.</P>
        <P>NERA seeks to secure compliance with employment law in relation to domestic workers through the provision of education and awareness, inspection of employers and enforcement where necessary. NERA also investigates complaints received.</P>
        <P>NERA is currently undertaking a focussed pilot programme examining the level of compliance in the domestic worker sector.  A key element of this programme is the provision of information to both employers and employees and where breaches of employment legislation are detected, NERA assists the employer in question to become complaint.  If employers refuse or fail to become compliant, the necessary enforcement activity, including prosecution will be initiated.</P>
        <P>Where people have concerns that workers may be exploited or receiving less than their statutory entitlement the matter should be reported to NERA for investigation.</P>

        <Quest> the initiatives in place and the progress achieved in finding a replacement enterprise for a business (details supplied) in County Roscommon. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Job creation is central to our economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core. The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate both job creation and job retention. On a national basis, the Jobs Initiative announced on 10 May focuses our limited resources on measures that offer the greatest potential for expansion and employment creation in the domestic economy. The Initiative has a significant focus on tourism, and the reduction in the VAT Rate along with the abolition of the travel tax will provide an important stimulus to tourism businesses in County Roscommon and the Country as a whole.</P>
        <P>In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland (EI) activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and Third Level institutions.  At present, there are over 60 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Co. Roscommon, employing almost 1,200 people and in 2010 the agency approved over &euro;1.5m for client companies in the county.</P>
        <P>The agency has also approved financial support for a total of five community Enterprise Centres in Co. Roscommon.  These centres are located in Arigna, Ballaghaderreen, Boyle, Castlerea and Roscommon Town.</P>
        <P>As regards the closure of the factory referred to, in 2006, I am informed that Enterprise Ireland has been monitoring the situation closely and even though this is a particularly difficult time for the food industry, the agency is continuing to actively pursue a replacement enterprise for these particular premises.  I have been advised also that the company has advertised the premises for sale.</P>
        <P>The creation of jobs in Roscommon is also supported by the activities of the Roscommon CEB through a series of programmes and both financial and non-financial assistance are available to a project promoter.  In 2010, Roscommon CEB provided over &euro;340,000 to 16 projects <Col N="429"/>and assisted more than 500 people in their training and mentoring programmes.  During 2011, the Board has continued to support enterprise development in Boyle and throughout the County and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development. In relation to potential Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) based job creation for the area, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for Roscommon is to promote the County as part of an integrated Midlands Region.  In line with the National Spatial Strategy, IDA is committed to marketing the County town of Roscommon as a location for FDI.  To this end, IDA Ireland works closely with educational institutions in the Region, in developing the best fit between their programs and the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county.  At present, there are six IDA Ireland supported companies in Roscommon employing approximately 755 people.</P>

	<P>My Department participates in the scheme known as the Travel Pass Scheme or Tax Saver Commuter Ticket Scheme, which encourages staff to use public transport. This scheme allows staff to purchase an annual travel pass for their preferred mode of public transport and to pay for the ticket over twelve months by salary sacrifice. Savings to staff arise because tickets are not subject to tax or PRSI. The Department advertises the scheme to all staff by office notice each year. Two hundred and five staff members availed of the scheme this year.</P>
        <P>The Department also participates in the Cycle to Work Scheme, which, although not directly related to the use of public transport, does encourage staff to cycle to and from work. Apart from improved health and fitness levels, cycling helps to reduce traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s policy on travel and subsistence recognizes that public transport is normally the most economic means of transport available and should be availed of by staff travelling on official business wherever possible.

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the recent jobs losses which have occurred are as a result of the restructuring process which is going on in industry in Ireland and around the world. While some jobs in Ireland have been phased out as these activities become uneconomic in an Irish context, operations remain in Ireland and we hope that other higher-value jobs can be added as time goes on.  Manufacturing is the bedrock on which the growth in Ireland&rsquo;s FDI was founded. While manufacturing is also in transition, it has been a significant segment of the  IDA portfolio and it will continue to remain so.  Higher technological investment and higher value products will be the hallmark of future manufacturing operations in Ireland.  The sector will be characterised by increased international competition and enhanced output volumes due to investments in technology and automation. These <Col N="431"/>operations will be knowledge, capital and skills intensive, characterised by a participative innovative culture where management and staff continuously collaborate to drive innovation, productivity, agility, learning and adaptability.  Globally, manufacturing jobs, as a percentage of total employment, will continue to decrease, even in lower cost locations.</P>
        <P>In March 2010, IDA published its strategy for the forthcoming decade, Horizon 2020.  This presents their view of how the environment in which they operate will change over the next ten years, and the opportunities for FDI created by global trends.  Horizon 2020 sets out IDA&rsquo;s targets for the 5-year period to 2014 as well as the direction IDA will take in the pursuit of these goals.    The investment targets for this strategy include the creation of 105,000 new jobs in Ireland from the period 2010-2014 with 50% of these investments to be based in locations outside of Dublin and Cork.</P>
        <P>IDA&rsquo;s strategy includes winning as many new jobs as possible each year and giving equal priority to maintaining existing jobs. The Agency recognises that jobs losses occur every year for a variety of reasons including changing competitiveness, competition from sister sites, product and technology lifecycles or global location rationalisation as a result of mergers and acquisitions.</P>
        <P>To address the need to maintain jobs in Ireland, IDA is actively encouraging its clients to strongly engage in transformation initiatives, and is assisting them in programmes to improve company-wide competitiveness; enhance use of new technologies; grow the skills of the business; engage in research, development and innovation; develop new business processes; make company operations more energy efficient.</P>
        <P>2010 saw IDA win a number of high-value RD&amp;I projects for Ireland with over &euro;500 million in new RD&amp;I investment secured.  RD&amp;I plays a strategic role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s FDI landscape embedding existing employment and setting the groundwork for increased future employment.  Some of the companies that announced RD&amp;I investments in 2010 were: IBM (Smarter Cities) Dublin, United Technologies Cork, HP Galway, PAS Technologies Cork, Analog Limerick, Luminson Galway, and Covidien Galway.</P>

The department does not hold statistics on a county by county basis for processing times for disability allowance applications.  To be eligible for disability allowance, a claimant must (inter alia) satisfy a medical assessment, a means test and be habitually resident in the state.</P>
        <P>The processing time for individual disability allowance claims may vary in accordance with their relative complexity in terms of the three main criteria listed above.  Certain claims have to be referred to social welfare inspectors for means investigation and this can add to the overall processing times. These claims are often complex and can take time to investigate.  In addition, factors outside the department&rsquo;s control can have an impact, for example, the supply of relevant information by the customer, employers or other third parties.</P>
        <P>The measures taken to improve processing times for disability allowance claims include increasing the number of claims which are desk assessed for means purposes and reducing the numbers being sent to Social Welfare Inspectors (SWIs).  Since August 2009 all claims are being desk assessed by the Medical Assessors thus obviating the need to call claimants for in-person medical examinations. Since November 2010, all medical reports for new disability allowance claims are being scanned to make processing of medical assessments more efficient.  The scheme is scheduled to go on a new IT platform later this year, as part of Department&rsquo;s business transformation programme which should improve processing times and further enhance customer service.</P>
        <P>Customers waiting on a decision on their disability allowance claim, who have urgent income support needs, can apply for the means tested supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) from their local community welfare officer.</P>

	<P>The pension rights of scheme members are protected through trust law and by provisions in the Pensions Act 1990 as amended.</P>
        <P>As supplementary pension schemes are usually established under irrevocable trust, the assets of the scheme are legally separate from the assets of the employer and are not available to any other creditors where the employer becomes insolvent.   Under trust law, trustees of occupational pension schemes have the principal responsibility for ensuring that the entitlements of the members are adequately protected and that they receive the pensions due to them.</P>
        <P>In addition to the safeguards provided by trust law, the Pensions Act 1990 provides for the regulation of pensions schemes in Ireland.  Under the Pensions Act, defined benefit (DB) pension schemes must meet a minimum funding standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up.</P>
        <P>Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard, the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years. The Pensions Board can allow a scheme up to ten years to meet the standard in certain circumstances.</P>
        <P>Should a scheme be wound up by its trustees, the Pensions Act 1990 (as amended) specifies how scheme assets are prioritised.  In short, schemes first prioritise benefits that have accrued to members by way of additional voluntary contribution or transfer of rights from another scheme.  Benefits being paid to retired members come next in the priority list, followed by benefits to current and deferred members of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The issue of guarantees and the security of pension funds was raised in the Green Paper on Pensions which was published in October 2007. A public consultation process followed the publication of the Green Paper and was completed in May 2008. In March 2010 the National Pensions Framework was launched.  This framework set out plans for the reform of the Irish pensions system.</P>
        <P>The issue of a pension protection type mechanism was considered as part of this process to provide protection for defined benefit pension scheme members in the event that their scheme is wound up with a shortfall. While both the UK and the US have such a mechanism, and these were examined, there are a number of reasons why a pension protection fund did not form part of the measures in the National Pensions Framework and why it is not intended to introduce such a measure.  The relatively small size of the pensions industry in Ireland means that the risk-sharing and costs involved would be high, particularly at a time when  pension schemes are already dealing with significant challenges.  Imposing such additional costs could lead to DB closures.  It imposes a retrospective penalty on employers who have set up a pension scheme <Col N="435"/>on a voluntary basis and may confer a competitive advantage on those who have made no provision for their employees.  It can lead to unintended consequences: e.g. under funding of pensions in advance of liquidation; riskier investment strategies; increasing pension benefits rather than wages in companies at risk; early retirement of directors taking substantial benefits. Stronger companies could end up cross-subsidising the weakest. It is prone to economic cycles: in a downturn, it is exposed to significant demands which it may not be able to meet.    It imposes a high regulatory burden and is administratively complex and costly.</P>
        <P>In a situation where a Pension Protection Fund was introduced and in the event of any shortfall, it is likely that the Government would be expected to intervene and bear the fund deficit.</P>
        <P>However, the framework recognised the difficulties facing DB schemes and emphasised that &ldquo;<i>further measures must be put in place to ensure that regulatory provision underpins a realisable pension promise and provides that the funding levels required to achieve the core pension expectation of scheme members can be delivered&rdquo;.</i>    More specifically, the framework committed to keep the funding standard under review and also suggested a new design for DB schemes.</P>
        <P>An implementation group under the auspices of the steering group of the National Pensions Framework has been charged with the development of a new DB model. This work has included consultations with the pension industry, employers and trade unions.  I will be bringing forward proposals for this new DB model shortly.</P>

	<P>In order to qualify for domiciliary care allowance a child must have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age. This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living. The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</P>
        <P>The application process operated by the Department involves the submission of a detailed statement by the parent or guardian of the child; a detailed medical assessment by the child&rsquo;s general practitioner; and any other relevant evidence available from qualified experts who have examined the child. This evidence is then assessed by designated Departmental Medical Assessors who have received special training in the area of child disability.</P>
        <P>In reviewing the medical evidence and written reports the Medical Assessor is required to make a determination as to whether the information contained in the application demonstrates that the child requires substantial continuous additional care and attention.

	<P>The Government supports and encourages people to make provision for an adequate income in retirement. It does this through the provision of a State pension (contributory) which is currently 33% approx. of the gross average industrial earnings and through generous tax relief on supplementary pension savings.</P>
        <P>It is important that an individual&rsquo;s pension savings is invested wisely and that charges incurred in the administration of a pension scheme are minimised.  The Government recognises the difficulty that people can have in understanding the various charges that can arise and how these charges are applied.  In this regard, I have requested the Implementation Group for the National Pensions Framework to examine options to bring simplification and transparency to the issue of pension charges. This group is chaired by my Department and includes a number of officials from the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Pensions Board. Following the outcome of this work, I will bring forward regulations to increase the transparency of pension charges, if appropriate.</P>

	<P>On 1 January 2011, the Department assumed responsibility for making redundancy payments from the Social Insurance Fund. There are two types of redundancy payment made from the fund i.e. rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a lump sum claim in respect of the individual concerned has been processed and payment has issued in the last week.</P>

	<P>The free travel scheme permits free travel on most CIE public transport services in all counties, Luas and a range of services offered by over 90 private operators in various parts of the country.  There are 15 private operators based in county Donegal participating in the scheme. Free travel is also available on cross border journeys between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  In addition, customers aged 66 years and over can travel for free on journeys within Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The free travel scheme was provided at an annual cost to the exchequer of some &euro;74 million in 2010.  Expenditure on this scheme has been frozen at 2010 levels in line with the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014.  Payments under the scheme are made on the basis of fares foregone and are not calculated using average transport costs per customer.</P><Col N="440"/>
        <P>In addition to the free travel scheme, the Department pays an annual contribution of &euro;1.5 million to the Rural Transport Programme. The aim of this programme is to encourage innovative community based initiatives to provide transport services in rural areas with a view to addressing the issue of social exclusion caused by lack of access to transport.<b> </b> Route analysis and provision of transport services is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Social Protection I do not have a role in the administration of individual cases in regard to the operation of the Community Employment (CE) programme. The administration of individual cases under CE is a day-to-day matter for F&Aacute;S as part of its responsibility under the Labour Services Act, 1987, as amended by Part 3 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2010.     </P>
        <P>I am advised by F&Aacute;S that extensions of a CE placement have to be requested a minimum of 8 weeks before the participant&rsquo;s proposed finish date by the CE Project Supervisor. Once an extension application is received by the local F&Aacute;S office, the F&Aacute;S Development Officer decides whether the extra year&rsquo;s placement is the most suitable and cost effective measure to assist the client in gaining employment. Clients who are deemed job-ready by the Supervisor are not extended in order to free up the place for another client. If no request for an extension is made then the person must leave the scheme and re-qualify under the published eligibility rules for any further participation on the CE scheme.</P>

	<P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  The role of money advisors is to help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors.   </P>
        <P>There are 52 independent MABS companies operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country with national support provided by the MABS NDL.  In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at www.mabs.ie.  Some 90% of clients presenting to MABS are assisted through the telephone helpline, which provides assisted self-help to ensure clients take steps to assess and address their situation.</P>
        <P>The focus of MABS is in ensuring clients get the level of support they need and as such client assessments and effective case management are important components of the overall approach.  During any waiting period, clients are assessed and those in need of immediate assistance are given a priority appointment, others are provided with assisted self-help to ensure that they have taken steps to assess their situation and if appropriate they are supported to take holding action with their creditors.  In this context MABS highlights the importance of <Col N="441"/>creditors proactively working with their customers to resolve arrears difficulties at an early stage.</P>
        <P>The Citizens Information Board (CIB), who has responsibility for MABS, is aware of the increased client demand for MABS services and the growing complexity of cases being dealt with by money advisors, particularly in relation to mortgage debt and multiple debt situations.   The CIB are currently reviewing the processes being used by MABS companies with a view to reducing waiting times, taking account of service capacity across the network of companies.  The staffing issues for individual MABS companies are being considered in this context and in the context of the increased demand for services throughout the country, and the financial resources available.</P>
        <P>In 2010, the Citizens Information Board (CIB) allocated a total budget of some &euro;18.2m for the delivery of money advice and budgeting services and this figure was increased to &euro;18.3m in 2011.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the resources made available to the Citizens Information Board and the strong management support provided by CIB to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service will ensure that services are delivered effectively.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Any suspected illegality in relation to the registration of births should be reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as there is a number of offences provided for under Section 69 of the Civil Registration Act 2004. In particular, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to section 69(3) which provides that a person who gives to a registrar particulars or information which he or she knows to be false or misleading is guilty of an offence. A person guilty of an offence under subsection (3) of section 69 shall be liable (a) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both, or (b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.</P>
        <P>The position in relation to an investigation is that the Registrar General has powers of enquiry under section 65 of the Civil Registration Act 2004. Section 65 provides that the Registrar General may conduct enquiries to ascertain if a birth has occurred and if it has, whether it is registered and if it is registered, whether it is registered correctly. If the Deputy has information in relation to a specific birth, the matter should be referred to the Registrar General for consideration under these provisions. I would point out that, while the Registrar General has powers to investigate specific events which come to his attention, he does not have a general power of investigation under the Civil Registration Act 2004.</P>

	<P>The F&Aacute;S Traveller Strategy aims to improve its labour market provision for travellers. Fundamental to the achievement of the recommendations of the Strategy is that networks be maintained or enhanced with representatives of travellers and F&Aacute;S to create links and manage expectations between cultures.</P>
        <P>Under the Strategy F&Aacute;S Employment Services and the Local Employment Services (LES) are responsible for strengthening guidance provision for travellers.  Travellers continue to be a priority target group for the LES and are specified as such in annual contracts. A total of 289 self &mdash; declared travellers registered with F&Aacute;S Employment Services in 2009. In addition under the Strategy with a view to strengthening the F&Aacute;S remit for responding to the training and employment needs of travellers, travellers   continue to be a priority group for Community Employment participation. A total of 75 travellers availed of CE in 2010.</P>
        <P>The F&Aacute;S Special Initiative for Travellers is an active labour market initiative which aims to deliver practical approaches to redressing the imbalance in traveller unemployment, supports travellers already engaged in the traveller economy, and provides a special training fund to address the training needs of adult travellers. The funding is used exclusively to support projects emerging from the County Development Boards (CDBs) Inter Agency Strategies for members of the travelling community, by seeking to enhance local implementation and delivery of employment support to travellers.</P>
        <P>In 2010 13 projects were approved in CDB areas in Counties Meath, Monaghan, Waterford, Wicklow, Tipperary, Laois, Galway, Donegal, Sligo, Cork, Clare and Dublin. A total of 602 travellers engaged in the programme, 38 secured employment, 9 enterprises were established, and 66 travellers underwent training.</P>

	<P>The Citizens Information Board (CIB) operates under the aegis of the Department and is responsible for supporting the provision of information, advice and advocacy on social services and for the Money, Advice and Budgeting Service.  The board of the Citizens Information Board is also responsible for furnishing advice, information and assistance to me in relation to the development of any aspect of social services.  In addition, and upon request, the Board is also required to design schemes relating to social services to address needs identified by me as Minister.  </P>
        <P>A member of the D&aacute;il participates in the making of laws for the State.  Those same laws govern the services which the Board provides to individuals and to me as Minister. I consider it inappropriate that these functions are carried out by a Board containing a member of the legislature.  Such functions are essentially functions of the executive branch of government and their exercise by a member of the legislative branch is incompatible with the doctrine of the separation of powers.</P>
        <P>Therefore, it is my view that the Deputy in question&rsquo;s simultaneous membership of the Board and as an elected representative of the D&aacute;il compromises the effective performance of the Board. In addition, I also consider it inappropriate for a board member to be in receipt of <Col N="444"/>remuneration in respect of board membership as well as remuneration in respect of membership of the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I have sought to address my concerns in the governing legislation of the Citizens Information Board through amendments proposed in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011 which will, in future, prohibit a person nominated as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament<b> </b>  from being eligible to retain their position as a member of the Board.  Such amendments reflect those already contained in other state body governing legislation.</P>
        <P>I have written to the Deputy twice, outlining my concerns and seeking his resignation.  The Deputy has responded stating that he will not be resigning from the board.</P>
        <P>In view of this, I will now consider termination of the Deputy&rsquo;s membership of the Board invoking the provisions of the Comhairle Act 2000.</P>

	<P>The Department operates a travel pass scheme encouraging staff members to use public transport in lieu of car transport. The travel pass scheme was introduced in 2002 under the terms and conditions set down by the Department of Finance and has been made available to the staff of my Department since then.  Under arrangements agreed with the Revenue Commissioners, it allows employees to forego salary to the value of the travel pass, thus reducing individual liability for income tax and PRSI.  Some 356 staff members currently avail of the scheme.  Official travel by staff members is continually monitored to ensure that such travel is kept to the minimum commensurate with the need for them to effectively perform their functions.  Where feasible, staff members use public transport when travelling on official business.</P>

	<P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  The role of money advisers is to help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors.</P>
        <P>There are 52 independent MABS companies operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country, with national support provided by the MABS NDL.  In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at www.mabs.ie.  Some 90% of clients presenting to MABS are assisted through the telephone helpline, which provides assisted self-help to ensure clients take steps to assess and address their situation.</P>
        <P>The focus of MABS is in ensuring clients get the level of support they need and as such client assessments and effective case management are important components of the overall approach.  During any waiting period, clients are assessed and those in need of immediate assistance are given a priority appointment, others are provided with assisted self-help to ensure that they have taken steps to assess their situation and if appropriate they are supported to take holding action with their creditors.  In this context MABS highlights the importance of creditors proactively working with their customers to resolve arrears difficulties at an early stage.</P>
        <P>In 2010, the Citizens Information Board (CIB) allocated a total budget of some &euro;18.2m for the delivery of money advice and budgeting services and this figure was increased to &euro;18.3m in 2011.  As well as funding, the CIB also provides management support to ensure services are delivered effectively.  The Board, of which you are currently a member, is keenly aware of the increased client demand for money advice services and the growing complexity of cases being dealt with by money advisors, particularly in relation to mortgage debt and multiple debt situations.</P>
        <P>As you will also be aware the Board are currently reviewing the processes being used by MABS companies with a view to reducing waiting times, taking account of service capacity across the network of companies.  The staffing issues are being considered in this context and in the context of proposals in relation to non-judicial debt settlement arrangements.   A position paper in relation to these proposals and their implications for MABS has been requested and is currently being finalised by the Board of CIB.  On receipt, I will give due consideration to the Board&rsquo;s submission.</P>

Free travel is also available on cross border journeys between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  In addition, customers aged 66 years and over can travel for free on journeys within Northern Ireland.  The free travel scheme was provided at an annual cost to the exchequer of some &euro;74 million in 2010.  Expenditure on this scheme has been frozen at 2010 levels in line with the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014.  The number of private operators based per county and details of the amounts paid under the free travel scheme are as follows.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work.  This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable.  Self-employed people are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.75%, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers are not insured for short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s payments &mdash; these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P.  This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions applicable to self-employed contributors.   A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.  There are no plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers.  Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context.  Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance. They can apply for the means-tested Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year.  In the current climate account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  It is accepted that future earnings may be lower than those of previous years and this is factored in projecting future earnings, with account being taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Fuel allowance is now payable for 32 weeks and for the 2010/2011 season will benefit over 375,000 people at an aggregate cost of &euro;255 million.  The payment rate is now &euro;20 per week or &euro;23.90 for recipients living in designated smokeless areas.  In addition, electricity and gas allowances under the household benefits package, are payable throughout the year to over 390,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households towards their heating, light and cooking costs at an estimated overall scheme cost of &euro;382 m in 2011.</P>
        <P>There would be a number of difficulties in paying the fuel allowance as a lump sum for some recipients while others receive it as part of their weekly payment.  If the payment were given in advance as a lump sum, there could be significant over-payments if a recipient&rsquo;s circumstances were to change during the payment season.  If it were paid in arrears, it obviously would create further budgeting difficulties.  Many oil companies provide facilities for making payment <Col N="450"/>by monthly instalment over a period of time which allows people to plan and budget for fuel expenses.  I am satisfied that this arrangement is sufficient to meet the needs of our customers.</P>

	<P>The Department of Social Protection funds the rural social scheme (RSS) and the community employment programme (CE).  The purpose of the RSS is to provide income support for farmers and fisherpersons who have an entitlement to specified social welfare payments.  Persons are engaged for 19&frac12; hours per week to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  The scheme currently provides work opportunities for around 2,600 men and women and 130 supervisory staff.  The scheme is delivered by local development companies in rural areas who will be able to advise on available and future opportunities.  Part-time farmers may also be eligible to participate on CE if they meet the relevant criteria.  F&Aacute;S is best placed to advise on individual circumstances and local opportunities that arise on CE schemes.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social Protection   </askee>
        <Quest>   the steps she will take to alleviate hardship caused arising from long delays associated with the processing of various social welfare payments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.      </Quest>
        <QRef>[15614/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Every effort is made to decide on the entitlement of any individual person as close to their eligibility date as possible. However, <Col N="456"/>there are cases where delays will be experienced, this can occur because of a delay within the Department in processing the claims or a delay on behalf of the customer in submitting information. </P>
        <P>Processing times vary across schemes because of both the volume of applications and the differing qualification criteria. For example, means assessments are required for all of the social assistance schemes; medical examinations are required for some of the illness related schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence conditions. In the case of the insurance-based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, one of the main impacts on current service delivery has been the increase in the Live Register. In this context, the Department has introduced a range of process improvement initiatives regarding claims for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. One of the most significant initiatives, aimed at reducing queuing times and waiting times, involves the customer attending their local office by appointment at which time the claim is taken and decided. Process improvements have resulted in a significant reduction in the number and proportion of all claims awaiting a decision. For example, there were 33,591 jobseeker claims awaiting a decision on 4  June 2011 equating to 7% of the total claim-load. This compares favourably to 5  June 2010 when 46,879 claims or 9% of claim-load were awaiting decision and 74,553 claims or 16% of claim-load in June 2009.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers. All scheme areas in the Department are subject to continuous business process improvement supported by modern technology, the potential of which is continuously harnessed and applied to maximum effect.</P>
        <P>The plans to integrate the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive into my Department together with the employment and other services of F&Aacute;S, and functions transferred from other Departments represent significant milestones in business transformation and will provide the basis for a new model of service delivery in my Department. This will ensure that our services and resources are organised to deliver effective, more timely, case management based, income and employment support services to our customer base. In situations where customers find themselves suffering financial hardship while awaiting such a decision, the facility to receive Supplementary Welfare Allowance, funded by the Department and administered by the Community Welfare Service, is available. More than 95% of basic SWA applications are decided on and paid within a week.</P>

	<P>The Department has a  broad-ranging and comprehensive control strategy. The emphasis is to minimise risks of fraud and eliminate incorrect payments. Ensuring that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department.</P>
        <P>The Department has in the last number of years been engaged in data matching with other Government Departments and public bodies for control purposes.  Data matching is viewed as a very efficient and effective mechanism to target control-related activity. Since 1997, the Department matches Revenue Commencement of Employment data against jobseekers data <Col N="457"/>held by the Department on a monthly basis. Where matches exist employers are contacted and based on the information received from employers possible overlaps are identified and are referred for investigation.</P>
        <P>In 2010 1,221,734 records of commencement of employment were received from the Revenue Commissioners and 74,961 were matched with data held by the Department.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to review the operation of the rent supplement scheme with a view to introducing a code of conduct for rent supplement eligibility similar to that which operates for local authority tenants. </P>
        <P>The purpose of this review is to ensure that tenants who are receiving long term support from the State under the rent supplement scheme are subject to the same type of anti-social behaviour regime as local authority tenants. The most appropriate way for this to happen is for local authorities to take over responsible for meeting the accommodation needs of these individuals. My Department is currently working with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to achieving this goal.</P>

	<P>The Department has a  broad-ranging and comprehensive control strategy. The emphasis is to minimise risks of fraud and eliminate incorrect payments. Ensuring that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department.</P>
        <P>Control activity is focused on prevention of fraud and error from the very first point of contact with customers i.e. claim application stage. Vetting cases at this stage is the most cost effective mechanism of reducing losses through fraud and error in social welfare schemes. All staff involved in administering schemes are aware of and understand the Department&rsquo;s strategy in relation to control of fraud, abuse and error. Every staff member in the Department is responsible for the prevention of fraud and error.</P>
        <P>Measures to control fraud and abuse include desk reviews of claim papers, home visits, the issue of mail-shots to selected customers, database checking, medical reviews in the case of illness payments etc. Controls are exercised at both the initial claim stage and at subsequent stages during the claim life cycle. Claims are reviewed on a regular and targeted basis. Means tested payments are reviewed at certain intervals or when there are indications that changes in circumstances have not been reported to the Department. Those in receipt of illness payments are called for a medical examination by the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors.</P>
        <P>Customers in receipt of jobseeker payments are vetted and checked on an ongoing basis to verify continued compliance with such requirements as being available for and genuinely seek<Col N="458"/>ing employment. Social welfare schemes share many of the same eligibility and risk factors.  For example, in many schemes entitlement is affected by proof of identity, income/ assets, residency or relationship /marital status. Risk profiling is an important vetting tool because it enables the Department to prioritise and focus resources on those areas that are most vulnerable to fraud or abuse.</P>
        <P>This Department uses risk profiling and data matching to identify high-risk schemes and high-risk customers within schemes.  Examples include fraud and error surveys, targeted control projects, links with Northern Ireland/ U.K. and extensive data-matching. Each tool is used to risk profile beneficiaries that need on-going review for continuing eligibility.  The results impact on policies in place for targeting fraud and error in the schemes.</P>
        <P>Additionally, in some schemes a control screening tool is used that scores cases, both at time of application and after review, for the likelihood of overpayments.  Cases that score high for potential risk of overpayment are then referred for review or investigation on a regular basis. Preventing someone, who is not eligible for payment, from receiving payment is more advantageous than identifying them after the fact because resources do not need to be spent later trying to recover improper payments.  Controls have been very focused on ensuring applications meet the requirements for the scheme and on-going training is given to all staff about the importance of control measures.</P>

	<P>The Department of Social Protection funds the provision of work experience and work placements under a number of different programmes and through a number of different agencies.  The work placement programme has provision for 7,000 work experience places and is delivered by F&Aacute;S.  Community employment provides 22,300 places, the majority of which are considered to be work experience and is delivered by F&Aacute;S through community based project promoters.  The new T&uacute;s &mdash; community work placement initiatives &mdash; has begun to roll-out nationally and will be delivered through the network of local development companies.  This initiative will provided 5,000 work placements and work experience places over the coming months.  The position remains unchanged with respect to the number of placements available in February and today.  Under the newly announced jobs&rsquo; initiative, an additional 5,000 places will become available on a new internship programme from the 1st July.</P>
        <P>For completeness, the number of places approved on the rural social scheme is 2,600 and an estimated 2,700 people are supported in employment under the community services programme.  The F&Aacute;S Jobs Initiative programme, which is closed to new entrants provides full time employment support to 1,303 individuals who are over 35 years of age and have been unemployed for at least 5 years. While these latter measures do not provide work experience, they are important sources of income support and service supports funded by the Department.</P>

	<P>This Government is committed to tackling Ireland&rsquo;s economic crisis in a way that is fair, balanced, and which recognises the need for social solidarity. The appropriate level of overall expenditure by my Department will be considered in the context of Budget 2012 and subsequent Budgets. This consideration will be informed by the commitment in the Programme for Government to maintain social welfare rates. </P>
        <P>Sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for future economic stability and growth, as well as being a prerequisite for maintaining and developing our social protection system. To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy. This Government believes it is appropriate, in order to enhance international credibility, to stick to the aggregate adjustment as set out in the National Recovery Plan for the combined period 2011- 2012. Accordingly, there will be an ongoing requirement to curtail expenditure in 2012 and in later years. This is necessary for many reasons, not least so that we can continue to make social welfare payments at appropriate levels, sustaining social cohesion and treating people with dignity.</P>
        <P>The priority of this Government is to get our economy moving, restore confidence, fix our banking system and support the protection and creation of jobs. The success of our economic plans will lay the foundation for the rest of our agenda for change. The recently announced Jobs Initiative is the first step in our recovery strategy and includes a number of initiatives which will be administered by my Department including the introduction of a new National Internship Scheme.  In addition, the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, 2010, currently before the D&aacute;il, provides for the halving of the lower rate of employer PRSI thereby making it cheaper for employers both to take on and retain workers and thereby reduce unemployment.</P>
        <P>There are considerable challenges ahead including the need to protect, as far as possible, the key income supports and services operated by my Department, including the levels of support provided to the various groups mentioned by the Deputy. This process will be informed by the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure which will be completed over the summer. The findings of the Review will then be available to the Government and will feed into its discussions on possible changes to schemes and services generally.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the All-Ireland Traveller Health Study, September 2010, was jointly funded by the Department of Health, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland and the Health Services Executive. I understand that the study was conducted by University College Dublin with the participation of the Travelling community.</P>
        <P>The National Museum of Ireland already has a display on the Tinsmith, one of the Traveller trades, as an integral part of its permanent exhibition.  This exhibition is on display at the National Museum of Ireland&rsquo;s Museum of Country Life in Turlough Park, Co Mayo.  In addition, to coincide with Traveller Focus Week in December 2007, the Museum unveiled a display on Traveller life in Ireland using a variety of objects from the Museum&rsquo;s collections.  Initially conceived as a temporary display, this exhibition became part of the Museum&rsquo;s permanent exhibition. Included in this exhibition is a specially commissioned barrel top wagon, which went on display in the Museum grounds.  This was the culmination of a two-year project undertaken by East Mayo Traveller Interagency Forum to make the wagon, providing Traveller men with trade and craft skills which were traditionally part of Traveller culture, in order to help lead to future employment. The National Museum continues to engage with the traveller community and I understand that representatives of Pavee Point Traveller Centre were involved as part of its focus group assisting in the development of the Museum&rsquo;s Access Policy.</P><Col N="462"/>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that decisions on the exhibition programme at the National Museum are not within my statutory remit.</P>

	<P>I am advised that water levels on the River Shannon are controlled by the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) and Waterways Ireland.  The ESB controls the outflows from Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg, as empowered by the various Electricity Supply Acts.  The sluices at Athlone Lock, at the outfall of Lough Ree, are operated by Waterways Ireland staff under the direction of the <Col N="463"/>ESB.  I should also add that Waterways Ireland controls the intermediate weir and sluice controls at Jamestown, Roosky, Tarmonbarry and Meelick for navigation purposes.  </P>
        <P>The criteria for Waterways Ireland is to ensure a minimum level for navigation along each stretch of the Shannon Navigation and, once that level is attained, to operate the sluices to minimise the threat of flooding.  When all sluices are open in the aftermath of large rainfall amounts, Waterways Ireland has no further control on water levels until they recede back to the minimum navigation requirement.  I am advised that the ESB and Waterways Ireland fully co-operate and constantly exchange data on forecasts and levels in order to manage the system within their statutory parameters.</P>

	<P>Section 42 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides, inter alia, for codes governing the standards and practice of broadcasters, encompassing the issues raised by the Deputy concerning editorial independence within broadcast media.  In addition, Part 4 of the 2009 Act makes provision for the preparation and implementation of codes of practice in relation to complaints handling and for a complaints process for cases where, inter alia, a broadcaster is considered to have failed to have complied with a Broadcasting Code.</P>
        <P>The Broadcasting Act 2009 assigns these functions to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, an independent regulatory body, including the role to investigate and adjudicate cases where complaints are made and, accordingly, I have no function in the matter.</P>
        <P>Additionally, the European Communities (Audiovisual Media Services) Regulations 2010 requires that on-demand audiovisual media services or programmes that are sponsored or contain product placement shall ensure that their content shall in no circumstances be influenced in such a way as to affect the editorial independence of the media service provider.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that this legislative framework is sufficient to provide the appropriate level of regulatory oversight in this area.</P>
        <P>Editorial independence within written and online media, by which I mean newspapers and online news media, other than to the extent mentioned above, are not within the remit of my Department and accordingly I have no function in these matters.</P>

	<P>The regulation of the wholesale mobile voice call termination market is a matter for the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  </P>
        <P>I am anxious to ensure that mobile termination rates (MTRs) charged by Irish service providers are in line with those charged elsewhere in Europe and that Irish citizens and businesses benefit from the lowest call costs possible.  Following regulatory intervention by ComReg in this market, commitments have been obtained from the main Irish mobile network operators to reduce their MTRs such that maximum Irish MTRs would be approximate to the European average &mdash; details of these commitments are publicly available in Information Notice 10/82  published on ComReg&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Building on previous decreases, the latest reductions in MTRs take effect from 1 July next, with the blended average MTRs reducing by approximately 21% on the rates which applied in the previous six months.  These latest reductions will continue to ensure that Irish average MTRs are in line with the European average.</P>
        <P>I understand that a further review by ComReg of the wholesale mobile voice call termination market is currently underway and ComReg will consult on its preliminary findings later this year, including the imposition of any appropriate wholesale price control and other regulatory obligations.</P>

	<P>There are twenty-one exploration licences and five licensing options active in the Irish offshore.  Exploration activities under these authorisations are ongoing and subject to the performance of agreed work programmes including detailed reporting and the release of exploration data and evaluation reports to my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department has approved two seismic surveys to date in 2011 and a decision on a third is expected shortly.  In relation to drilling, my Department is aware that plans are being advanced for exploration/appraisal drilling in the Irish offshore, although no application for drilling approval has been received to date this year.  I would expect that over the next few months greater certainty will emerge in relation to potential drilling in 2011 and 2012.</P>
        <P>A total of 15 applications were received by the closing date for the 2011 Atlantic Margin Licensing Round and evaluation of these applications is underway.  The Round is deliberately structured to attract new exploration companies to Ireland and also aims to encourage companies to look at areas of the Irish offshore where little data currently exists and as a consequence, little is known of the potential prospectivity of these areas.  The licensing round is expected to bring a new momentum to the level of exploration activity offshore Ireland.</P>

	<P>The 1975 terms were introduced at a time of great optimism that Ireland had significant, undiscovered, reserves of oil and gas and would be the next North Sea.  The terms reflected this optimism and provided for State participation, royalties, production bonuses and the then prevailing corporation tax rate of 50%.  Unfortunately, with only four commercial finds of natural gas in Irish waters to date, the optimism of the 1970s has proved to be unfounded.</P>
        <P>Ireland competes with other countries, both in Europe and much further afield, to attract mobile international exploration investment.  The revisions to the licensing terms since 1975 have reflected this reality and have sought to incentivise exploration in the Irish offshore.  While I will keep the licensing terms, both fiscal and non-fiscal, under review in light of relevant future developments, at this point in time I believe that the focus should be on attracting a larger share of mobile international exploration investment to Ireland, to increase the chances of new commercial discoveries being made.</P>

	<P>Ireland has ambitious plans to increase the deployment of renewable energy technologies over the next decade with targets set to achieve 40% of our electricity, 12% of our heating and cooling requirements, and 10% of our transport fuels from renewable sources by 2020.  These targets are commensurate with Ireland&rsquo;s binding EU target of 16% of all energy from renewable sources by 2020.</P>
        <P>Ireland submitted a National Renewable Energy Action Plan to the European Commission last year which sets out the overall roadmap for achieving the 2020 target.  The plan was finalised after both an industry and a full public consultation.</P>
        <P>Currently there is around 1,750 Mw of renewable capacity built and operational on the Irish electricity grid.  There is a further 1,100 Mw of capacity with signed connection offers in place and the Gate 3 process, which contains the next batch of connections, some 4,000 Mw of capacity, is currently being processed by EirGrid and ESB Networks for Grid Connection offers.  The latest EirGrid forecasts show that we need around 4,600 Mw of renewable capacity operational by 2020 to deliver our 40% target.</P>
        <P>The vast majority of this capacity is onshore wind, with some 800 Mw of offshore wind contained in the Gate 3 process.  Wave technology is still at the research, development and demonstration stage.</P>

	<P>The Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff scheme known as REFIT was introduced in 2006 for certain categories of renewable energy, including onshore wind.  Since then the tariffs have been increasing, where applicable, by the annual consumer price index. REFIT is based around 15 year Power Purchase Agreements between generators and suppliers which provide developers with the necessary certainty required to finance their projects.  The scheme is funded through a Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy, which is paid for by all electricity consumers. Adjustments are by way of indexation annually, by the annual increase, if any, in the consumer price <Col N="470"/>index in Ireland.  The resulting reference prices for 2010 and 2011 per megawatt hour  are provided, for information, in the following table.</P>

        <P>Officials from my Department are currently in negotiation with the European Commission on State Aid clearance to continue to offer REFIT for the new renewable energy projects in Gate 3.  The rates of tariff it is proposed to offer are the same as for the original scheme.</P>
        <P>The sector shows strong interest from developers willing to invest in renewable electricity in Ireland and developers continue to participate in REFIT.  I have no plans to increase the REFIT rates.</P>
        <P>As regards the 15 year Power Purchase Agreements, the timeframe involved is a deliberate design feature, which was put in place so that developers could recoup their investment over 15 years.  Given that the scheme is funded through the PSO, a shorter payback time would lead to increased upfront pressure on electricity consumers.  I therefore have no plans to change this feature of the scheme.</P>

	<P>Energy security is currently high on the international and EU agenda as the global energy market <Col N="471"/>becomes subject to volatility and high prices as a result of geo-political events and natural disasters.  While Ireland is a peripheral energy market, we remained largely insulated from the shocks of the Russia/Ukraine gas crisis of 2009 and have not experienced supply disruption as a result of the recent tragic events in Japan and the ongoing turmoil in North Africa.  Ireland is nonetheless working within the EU and the International Energy Agency (IEA) to ensure energy security of supply.</P>
        <P>Energy emergency planning is a priority for my Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the energy industry.  In the context also of overall national emergency planning, arrangements have been put in place to deal with a serious disruption to energy supplies, working also with Northern Ireland, the UK and with the EU and IEA.</P>
        <P>With regard to electricity and gas, there are well established emergency plans in place.  Given the importance of gas for Ireland&rsquo;s electricity generation, the Commission for Energy Regulation and my Department work closely together with EirGrid, ESB Networks, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Networks and the power generation sector to ensure that these emergency plans are fully coordinated.  Joint electricity and gas emergency exercises are carried out on an annual basis.  This is in addition to the routine testing of plans and emergency training that is done by the electricity and gas system operators on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>The focus of these plans is, first and foremost, to maintain the safety and integrity of the networks in the event of a serious disruption.  They are also designed to ensure that supply is maintained for as long as possible and that hardship to domestic and vulnerable customers is, to the extent possible, minimised.</P>
        <P>In respect of a possible disruption of oil supplies, Ireland through the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), maintains its national strategic oil reserves fully in accordance with the IEA and European Union 90 day obligations.  The IEA, of which Ireland is a founding member, stands ready, as always, to take actions to maintain energy security of supply in the event of a major disruption.</P>
        <P>My Department and NORA work together on an ongoing basis with all the relevant stakeholders in developing contingency arrangements in the event of a major oil disruption.</P>

	<P>The Single Electricity Market (SEM) is the wholesale electricity market for the island of Ireland, regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the Utility Regulator in Belfast.  It has been operational since November 2007, when the trading of wholesale electricity in Ireland and Northern Ireland on an All-Island basis commenced, underpinned by parallel legislation in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The decision making body which governs the market is the SEM Committee, consisting of the CER, the Utility Regulator as well as an independent member (who also has a deputy), with each entity having one vote.</P>
        <P>The type of market in place in Ireland under SEM is a gross pool market.  Accordingly, generation costs are set in the SEM by means of the gross pool market into which all electricity generated or imported onto the island of Ireland must be sold, and from which all wholesale electricity for consumption or export from the island of Ireland must be purchased.  In general, conventional generators bid their short run marginal costs into the SEM on a half hourly basis in accordance with the SEM Bidding Code of Practice.</P>
        <P>These costs include operating, fuel and carbon costs.  These costs may vary on a half hourly basis for each generator and will vary between generators, even those using the same generating method and/or fuel.  Fixed labour costs are generally not bid into the pool but are paid for through the gross profits that generators receive in the market.  Fluctuations in the internationally traded price of fossil fuels have a particular impact on costs for fossil fuel generators.</P><Col N="473"/>
        <P>The bidding structure of the gross pool market provides an incentive to generators to invest in more efficient generation technology.  All generators in SEM, regardless of generation method or fuel type, also receive capacity payments which are designed to cover generators&rsquo; long run costs as well as to encourage new investment in capacity for security of supply.  A background to SEM, how it works and how it benefits customers across the island is provided in a factsheet by CER, which is available on its website, www.cer.ie.</P>
        <P>Investment in grid infrastructure is a matter for EirGrid in respect of the transmission network and ESB Networks in the case of the distribution network.  Generators only own their own connection assets.  The extent of allowable costs, which may be passed onto electricity consumers in respect of grid investment and maintenance, is regulated and rigorously overseen by the CER and subject to a full scale review every five years.</P>

	<P>The oversight and operation of the Single Electricity Market is the statutory responsibility of the Single Electricity Market Committee (which comprises the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the Northern Ireland Utility Regulator as well as an independent Member) and the Single Market Operator EirGrid and SONI.</P>
        <P>I would refer the Deputy to a selection of data in the public domain in response to the detailed technical questions raised.  The total amount of fossil fuel generating capacity in the Single Electricity Market (SEM) together with the amount of fossil fuel flexible generation is outlined in the SONI/Eirgrid <i>All-Island Generation Capacity Statement 2011-2020</i> .  The amount of the fossil fuel flexible plant in the Gate 3 licensing programme is available in the CER Direction on Conventional Offer Issuance Criteria and Matters Related to Gate 3 (CER/09/191).  Further detail about Gate 3 is available on the CER website: www.cer.ie.</P>
        <P>The amount of fossil fuel generation capacity, whether flexible or non-flexible, in the least cost portfolio of the All Island Grid Study   is contained in that document.  The study contains the results of various scenarios, including the amount of electricity generated from fossil fuel plant.  The economic assumptions underlying these scenarios can be compared with the current economic situation. Forecasts for electricity outputs from various conventional fuel types and from renewable generation are modelled and analysed for the years up to and including 2020 in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) publication <i>Energy Forecasts for Ireland to 2020</i> .</P>
        <P>Apart from the SEAI forecasts above, other reports have also estimated electricity generation output from fossil fuels and the mean or unit cost of electricity produced from fossil fuel and other sources, for years up to 2035 at the latest.  They include the documents referenced above, recent ESRI studies, the 2010 P&ouml;yry report for EirGrid on <i>Low Carbon Generation Options for the All-Island Market </i>and the all-island TSO Facilitation of Renewables Studies. <Col N="474"/> All reports referred to above are available through the links above and on the relevant Agencies&rsquo; websites.</P>

	<P>The Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff scheme known as REFIT was introduced in 2006 for certain categories of renewable energy, including onshore wind.  REFIT is based around 15 year Power Purchase Agreements between generators and suppliers which provide developers with the necessary certainty required to finance their projects.  The scheme is funded through a Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy, which is paid for by all electricity consumers.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department are currently finalising negotiations with the European Commission in relation to State Aid clearance for continuation of the REFIT Scheme for the new renewable energy projects in Gate 3.  The objective is to continue the REFIT Scheme on the same basis as the existing REFIT scheme.  There are no plans to increase the rate of REFIT.</P>
        <P>As regards the 15 year Power Purchase Agreements, the timeframe was established so that developers could have the certainty of recouping their investment over 15 years.  Given that the scheme is funded through the PSO, any shorter payback time could lead to increased costs on electricity consumers and no change is proposed.</P>

	<P>Ireland remains critically dependent on imported fossil fuels, particularly oil and natural gas.  This dependency underlines the immediate and long term imperatives of enhancing energy security, mitigation of price volatility and increasing energy sustainability.  National energy policy objectives are in line with overall EU policy objectives and are informed by the ongoing analytical work of the International Energy Agency (IEA) on all aspects of energy supply including the Agency&rsquo;s short, medium and long term prognoses for global oil and gas supply.</P>
        <P>In line with the Programme for Government I am committed to delivering on national energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes which are aimed at moving the economy away from reliance on imported, carbon intensive fossil fuels, which increasingly display significant price volatility and working spikes in prices.  Delivery on these commitments will support energy competitiveness and security as well as employment and economic activity.  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme and the Electric Vehicle Programme are both designed to reduce the over reliance of the transport sector on imported oil in the longer term.</P>
        <P>In respect of short term oil crisis measures Ireland maintains its national strategic oil reserves fully in accordance with its IEA and EU obligations.  The IEA, of which Ireland is a founding member, has recently affirmed that in the event of a major oil supply disruption it stands ready, as always, to take actions to maintain supplies for its Member Countries.</P>

        <P>I receive a report from the ESB under Section 10 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 1961 (No 2 of 1961) on an annual basis, which advises me on the management of fisheries under its jurisdiction, including the Ballyshannon Hatchery.  As is the case with all ESB Fisheries, the Ballyshannon Hatchery is managed in consultation with Inland Fisheries Ireland, the Marine Institute and my Department.  ESB propagates salmon in the hatchery to support the restoration of the wild salmon in the Erne system whose migratory patterns may be interrupted by the dams at Cathleen&rsquo;s Fall and Cliff power stations.</P>
        <P>On the matter of catching hatchery reared (fin-clipped) salmon to which the Deputy is referring, I understand that according to scientific advice tendered by the Standing Scientific Committee, hatchery-bred and wild fish could not be safely separated using draft nets without unsustainable mortality to wild stocks.  It would not therefore be possible to allow the harvest proposal suggested by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>In February of this year, following a detailed evaluation of applications received in the 2010 onshore licensing competition, my Department offered onshore Petroleum Licensing Options to three companies over parts of the North West Carboniferous Basin and the Clare Basin.  The Licensing Options are designed to allow the companies assess the natural gas potential of their acreage largely based on desktop studies of existing data from previous petroleum exploration activity.  The Licensing Options specifically exclude exploration drilling but may include shallow geological sampling.</P>
        <P>Exploration activity under these authorisations is at an early stage and there is no certainty that it will lead to applications for follow-on exploration licences that would be required before exploration wells could be drilled.  In the event hydraulic fracturing was envisaged as part of a possible future exploration or production programme, then that activity would be subject to an environmental impact assessment, including an appropriate public consultation phase.</P>

        <P>There is a comprehensive range of measures in place to underpin the role of housing authorities and approved housing bodies towards achieving the ambitious objective of eliminating long term homelessness and the need to sleep rough.  My Department&rsquo;s funding provision for running costs of homeless accommodation and related services for 2011 is &euro;53.413 million, which together with 10% provided from local authorities own resources, brings the total funding to &euro;58.75m in 2011.  This level of funding will enable the provision of sufficient bed capacity on a nightly basis to accommodate all those in need of emergency accommodation, including related outreach services, delivering on the commitment to eliminate the need for homeless persons to sleep rough.  This funding also means that there will be no reduction in the provision of front-line accommodation and support services in 2011 and that the delivery of homeless action plans under the auspices of the nine regional homeless fora across the country can be maintained.</P><Col N="477"/>

	<P>In response to the downturn in the housing market and the prevailing economic climate in 2008, Dublin City Council suspended its PPP programme, which included a proposal for the regeneration of St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens.  In the absence of PPP alternatives, and with the support of my Department, the City Council established a multi-disciplinary Special Housing Taskforce to examine all options with regard to the future regeneration of the six former PPP projects, which included St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Dominick Street, St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens, Croke Villas, and Dolphin House and, in particular, to examine options to fast-track the relocation of households to facilitate future regeneration.  </P>
        <P>The Special Housing Taskforce initially prioritised three areas for regeneration &mdash; St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street. Last autumn, my Department approved the City Council&rsquo;s first phase redevelopment at St Michael&rsquo;s Estate, with Exchequer funding of &euro;5.8 million being provided for the social housing element.  Outline proposals for O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street have also been agreed with my Department.</P>
        <P>A preliminary report outlining possible options for the redevelopment of St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens was received in my Department in March 2011 and my Department is currently working with the City Council to progress this and other regeneration proposals.  In order to advance this project in accordance with the criteria laid down for regeneration funding, the City Council will be required to prepare a master plan that gives consideration to social and economic regeneration in addition to physical improvements.  This holistic approach is fundamental in building and supporting sustainable, stable communities.</P>
        <P>To date, my Department has provided funding of some &euro;4.44 million to support the City Council&rsquo;s planning and relocation initiatives at St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens.  Future funding will be made available within the context of City Council&rsquo;s overall regeneration programme and the Exchequer provision for regeneration.</P>

	<P>The developer of any development, including a residential development, is statutorily required to complete the development in accordance with the terms of the planning permission.  A development which has not been completed in accordance with the planning permission is unauthorised development.  Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authorities, who have substantial enforcement powers and obligations under the legislation.</P><Col N="479"/>
        <P>A planning authority may issue an enforcement notice, non-compliance with which is an offence, in connection with an unauthorised development, requiring such steps as the authority considers necessary to be taken within a specified period.  If an enforcement notice is not complied with the planning authority may itself take the specified steps and recover the expense incurred in doing so.  A planning authority may seek a court order requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.  A planning authority may also refuse permission to any developer who has substantially failed to comply with a previous planning permission.</P>
        <P>The Planning Acts also place clear statutory obligations on planning authorities in   relation to unauthorised development.  A planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development, or in relation to any other unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development).  There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued or a court order should be sought, under section 160 of the 2000 Act.  Where a planning authority establishes, following an investigation, that unauthorised development (other than development that is of a trivial or minor nature) has been or is being carried out, and the person who has carried out the development has not proceeded to remedy the position, then the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice or seek a court order, unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.  The above provisions apply to all residential developments, whether or not they are to be managed by a management company.</P>
        <P>Insofar as the taking in charge of residential developments is concerned, Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that, where an estate is completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the planning permission (and any conditions attached to the permission), the planning authority must initiate taking in charge procedures as soon as possible following a request to do so by the developer or by the majority of the owners.  Similarly, where an estate has not been completed to the standard outlined in the planning permission and the planning authority has not taken enforcement action within the appropriate period, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must initiate taking in charge procedures if requested to do so by the owners of the units concerned.  The decision as whether an estate should be taken in charge is ultimately one for the elected members of the planning authority.</P>
        <P>Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have failed or the planning authority has not taken enforcement action.  Planning authorities were also specifically empowered in 2010 Act to take in charge part of an estate, or some but not all of the facilities in an estate.</P>

	<P>Directors of Service, under the direction of the County or City Manager, play an important role as the heads of significant service areas across the full range of public services provided by local government.  The salary scale for Directors of Service, with effect from 1 January 2010, ranges from &euro;90,453 to &euro;106,900.</P>
        <P>The Report of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group recommended that over time the number of Directors of Service in local authorities be reduced by at least 20%.  In the period from 1 January, 2010 to March 2011 the number of Directors has reduced by 4.5%.  The reduction in the period from December 2008 to March 2011 is 14.5%.  I am satisfied that the number of Directors of Service is reducing in line with the Group&rsquo;s recommendation and I will be keeping the matter under review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 398, 411 and 423 to 425, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>On 8 June 2011, I published the General Scheme of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011.  In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment significantly to reform political funding in Ireland, this Bill will implement commitments in the Programme for Government and recommendations made in the Moriarty Tribunal Report Into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment that: &ldquo;Public funding for political parties will be tied to the level of participation by women as candidates those parties achieve&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The General Scheme includes provision for a requirement that to qualify for full State funding under Part III of the Electoral Act 1997 a qualified political party will have to have at least 30% women candidates and at least 30% men candidates at the next General Election.  This is to rise to 40% after seven years.  Half of every payment to a qualified political party is to be made contingent on meeting these new requirements.  The relevant draft Heads of the Bill to provide for these new arrangements are set out in Part 5 of the General Scheme, as published.</P>
        <P>Section 18 of the Electoral Act 1997 specifies the purposes to which the funding provided to a qualified political party under Part III of the Act shall be used, and provides that payments shall not be applied to expenses incurred at an election.  The funding is applied, <i>inter alia</i> , to the general conduct and management of the party&rsquo;s affairs and the lawful pursuit by it of any of its objectives.</P>
        <P>I have received the advice of the Attorney General in respect of the provisions in Part 5 of the General Scheme of the Bill and I do not envisage constitutional difficulties arising.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 399 and 421 together.</P><Col N="483"/>
        <P>In addressing the legacy of the electronic voting project, my priority is to see that the equipment is disposed of as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Task Force that was established to oversee the cessation of the project to consider proposals for the disposal of the equipment, with a view towards immediately progressing arrangements.  The Task Force met on 12 April 2011, and the necessary preliminary and background work to enable the disposal of the equipment to proceed is currently underway.  This is to be completed as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach, with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of cost possible in the circumstances, consistent with environmental and other obligations.</P>
        <P>The detailed contractual and other arrangements for the storage of the electronic voting equipment were put in place by Returning Officers.  Responsibility for the security and safe storage of manual voting electoral materials (such as ballot boxes, stamping instruments and stationery) has been and continues to be a matter for the Returning Officers, who are statutorily responsible for conducting the polls.  Accordingly, similar responsibility was assigned to Returning Officers to make the necessary arrangements in relation to the storage of the electronic voting machines and equipment.  Electronic voting equipment was originally stored at 25 local premises.  In 2007, over 60% of the machines (4,762 in total) were moved from 12 local storage locations to a central facility at Gormanston Army Camp.  One-off costs associated with the movement of these machines were &euro;328,363.21.<b>  </b>There are no ongoing rental costs in respect of the use of this property.  Costs of &euro;552.83 were incurred in 2009 in respect of equipment to monitor the environmental storage conditions at the Gormanston premises.  A further 14 machines are held in the Custom House.</P>
        <P>The remaining machines are stored at 13 local premises that were originally identified by Returning Officers for this purpose. It is intended that all machines will be removed from their present locations when arrangements for disposal are implemented.  Work on termination of local lease arrangements is proceeding in this context.</P>
        <P>Based on the figures received in my Department from Returning Officers, the total costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment (including the cost of rent, insurance, service charges, rates, heating, etc.) are set out in the following table.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide an outline of the work of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committees and the Traveller accommodation unit within his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment; Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC) was established, on a statutory basis, on 29 April 1999 under sections 19 and 20 of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998. The fourth NTACC was appointed on 22 April 2010 for a period of three years.  </P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the Committee are to advise the Minister in relation to:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />any general matter concerning accommodation for Travellers;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />any matter referred to it by the Minister;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the most appropriate measures for improving, at local level, consultation with, and participation of, Travellers in the provision and management of accommodation;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />general matters concerning the preparation, adequacy, implementation and co-ordination of Traveller accommodation programmes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The work of the NTACC is detailed in its annual reports, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library and on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.   The NTACC Annual Report for 2010 is currently being finalised.</P>
        <P>The Traveller Accommodation Unit (TAU) of my Department is responsible for maintaining an effective framework of policy and legislation in relation to Traveller accommodation. The unit is also tasked with overseeing the implementation, through local authorities, of effective Traveller accommodation programmes and providing funding for appropriate and high-quality Traveller specific accommodation. The TAU provides executive and secretarial support for the NTACC, engages with a number of cross-Departmental groups addressing Traveller issues and fulfils various reporting requirements to United Nations and European Union fora.</P>

        <QRef>[15129/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment; Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Local authorities have a wide and effective range of powers to deal with unauthorised Traveller encampments.  The principal powers of local authorities to deal <Col N="488"/>with the unauthorised placing of temporary dwellings on public property, under legislation coming within the ambit of my Department, are contained in the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1948 and Section 10 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, as amended by Section 32 of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and Section 21 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002. The initiation of action under these pieces of legislation is a matter for each local authority.</P>
        <P>The relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 concerning entering and occupying land without consent or the bringing of any object onto such land are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</P>
        <P>While I have no current plans to amend the aforementioned powers available to local authorities, I will continue to keep the effectiveness of these powers under review.</P>

	<P>Sections of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 dealing with social housing support, and related Social Housing Assessment Regulations, 2011, were commenced on 1 April 2011. A new standard procedure for assessing applicants for social housing was introduced in every housing authority.  </P>
        <P>One of the important provisions of the new regulations is that a household need only apply to one housing authority for the purpose of determining whether or not they have a housing need.  The idea behind the new arrangements is to streamline the process of applying for social housing support, both for the applicant and the local authority, while at the same time allowing <Col N="489"/>a reasonable level of choice to households as to the areas in which they would like to receive social housing support.</P>
        <P>A household may apply to the housing authority for the functional area</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />where it normally resides &mdash; this would include a household residing in rented accommodation, or</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />where it has a local connection.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In accordance with the Regulations a local connection can be established if the applicant or a member of the household;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />has lived in the area for a continuous 5 year period previously;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />is employed in the area or within 15 km of the area;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />is in full-time education, or attending specialist medical care in the area;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />has a relative living in the area for 2 years or longer.</P>
        <P FLI="0">&ldquo;Relative&rdquo; of a member of the household is defined in the Regulations as a parent, adult child or sibling and may include another relative, such as a step-parent, grandparent, grandchild, aunt or uncle, who has close links with the household member in the form of commitment or dependence.</P>
        <P>A household may then specify up to three areas of choice in any housing authority in the county.  At least one of these choices must be in the functional area of the housing authority of application.   Therefore, a household living in, or having a local connection with, a town council area, may make a single application to that town council for housing support in the town, but on that application may also express its choice to live in areas within the wider administrative county council area.  Alternatively, a household living in, or having a local connection with, the county area may choose to apply to the county council, but also express areas of choice within the town council areas in the county.  Eligible households will appear on the waiting lists of each of the authorities where they have expressed areas of choice.</P>
        <P>The four Dublin housing authorities of Dublin City, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin are considered as one county for this purpose, as are North and South Tipperary.  I have previously announced my intention of extending this single support application area arrangement to the other four city/county areas of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, and will be making Regulations shortly in this regard.</P>
        <P>A housing authority may also decide at its discretion to accept a household who does not meet these residence or local connection criteria. In this case, the household may only express areas of choice within the functional area of that particular housing authority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Since October 2008, my Department has participated in the Workplace Travel Plan as part of <Col N="490"/>the Dublin Transportation Office&rsquo;s One Small Step<i></i>  campaign, with the aim of encouraging greater staff use of sustainable transport options when travelling to and from work, and ensuring that, where practicable, staff opt for sustainable transport options when conducting business on behalf of the Department.</P>
        <P>Under the Plan, the Department is committed to:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />encouraging a change of attitudes and behaviours, where possible, around travel options to and from work;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />reducing the reliance on the car as a means of transport to and from work and promoting, where possible, the healthier, sustainable options of walking or cycling for all or part of the journey;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />reducing the carbon footprint of the Department by reducing carbon emissions from staff car usage in the context of their work;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />promoting the use of public transport to cut down on emissions and traffic.</P>
        <P FLI="0">To help achieve these aims, my Department has implemented the Cycle-to-Work Scheme and the Travel Pass Scheme whereby staff can obtain a bicycle and/or safety equipment or an annual bus/rail pass, respectively.  The Department has also participated in the &ldquo;In Town without My Car Day&rdquo;   event on 22 September each year, with the car park at my Department&rsquo;s offices in the Custom House closed to all but disabled staff.</P>
        <P>In the context of official travel, it is Departmental policy that public transport should be used wherever possible, where it is deemed necessary to travel for business purposes.  Staff are only permitted to hire taxies or to use their cars to travel to and from meetings where no suitable public transport (e.g., train or bus) is available, where public transport is available only at equal or greater expense or where the use of public transport would result in the loss of official time which it is necessary to avoid.  Staff travelling between Departmental offices, where public transport options are available, may claim the costs of travel on the basis of public transport rates (bus/train) only.</P>

	<P>There is no specific scheme operating in my Department to which a community group can apply for National Lottery funding to support a community centre. </P>
        <P>My Department currently operates two Programmes which have a National Lottery funded element; these are the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) and the Scheme for National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector.  Both provide for current funding only and do not, therefore, provide for the type of initiative in question.</P>
        <P>However, under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 funding of &euro;427m is available for allocation to qualifying projects up to the end of 2013.  One of the objectives of the RDP is to identify and provide appropriate amenity and leisure facilities to local communi<Col N="491"/>ties not otherwise available to them. Accordingly, in this context it may be possible to obtain funding for a project of the nature referred to in the question under the RDP.</P>
        <P>For purposes of implementing Axes 3 &amp; 4 of the Rural Development Programme (RDP), the following areas are excluded:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The City Council boundaries of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The Borough Council boundaries of Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford</P>

        <P FLI="0">There are 36 Local Action Groups contracted, on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding. Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with Departmental operating rules and EU regulations. Contact details for these groups can be found on the website of the National Rural Network at www.nrn.ie.</P>

I have advised local authorities that a consultant&rsquo;s report is not essential in all cases where applicants have a medical condition or disability which impacts on their housing needs.  However, an appropriate written report from a qualified medical or paramedical professional must always be submitted.  This is required both to identify and certify the medical condition or disability involved and also to ensure that suitable accommodation is provided for the household concerned.</P>

        <P>The improvement in the quality of drinking water continues to be a key element of my Department&rsquo;s water services capital programme.

My Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &euro;800m in relation to water supply infrastructure.

	<P>In 2008, there were 8,151 waste enforcement notices issued and 695 prosecutions initiated under the Waste Management Acts. Overall, this represents a very significant quantum of enforcement, consistent with the findings of the Office of Environmental Enforcement&rsquo;s report Focus on Environmental Enforcement in Ireland, covering the period 2006 to 2008, which indicates that the handling of waste-related complaints has significantly improved.  More up-to-date information in relation to numbers of enforcement actions may be available from individual local authorities.</P>
        <P>The most recently available statistics in respect of the Litter Pollution Act indicate that in 2009, 3,074 prosecutions were initiated and 22,830 on-the-spot fines were issued. The Litter Pollution Act also requires that local authorities have in place litter management plans, which must be reviewed every three years, and sets out a range of matters which must be incorporated into these plans. These individual plans are available on the local authorities&rsquo; websites. The National Litter Pollution Monitoring System Report for 2009, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and on www.litter.ie  , indicated an ongoing improvement in litter levels across the country; I intend to publish the 2010 report shortly.</P>
        <P>In general, I am satisfied with the adequacy and appropriateness of the enforcement powers available under the Waste Management Acts and the maximum penalties of a fine of up to &euro;15m and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years for waste-related offences.  The Litter Pollution Act provides for penalties for offences ranging from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction, to a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment. While I have no immediate plans for legislative change in these matters I am keeping the performance in both areas under regular review, particularly in terms of the effectiveness of enforcement.  In that context, I will also be considering the relevant recommendations in the report of the EPA Review Group which I have recently published and which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.environ.ie .</P>

        <P>My Department has recouped a total of &euro;3,003,967 to date to Dublin City Council in support of the phased renovation of the training facility.  In the latest phases, the City Council has undertaken restoration work on the main building, and has converted and restored the former Chapel, which is now being used as the main auditorium and training facility. The Council has also recently completed enabling/demolition works on the site.</P>
        <P>Further development proposed by Dublin City Council at the O&rsquo;Brien Institute includes an upgrade of the student and instructor facilities, and the provision of modern canteen facilities on the site. The City Council also plans to design and build a further purpose-built training building on the site. Other works proposed include provision of enhanced energy conservation measures and the upgrade of the electrical system.</P>
        <P>In common with other capital programmes, my Department has commenced a Capital Expenditure Review of the fire services capital programme to include all projects in receipt of funding under the programme. Further investment to support the redevelopment of the O&rsquo;Brien Institute will be considered within the current constraints on the fire services capital programme and will have regard to the Capital Expenditure Review, the priorities of Dublin City Council, the level of investment to date and the totality of demands from fire authorities countrywide for the limited funding available.</P>

	<P>I propose the take Questions Nos. 426, 429 and 430 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland recognises the right of States to determine their own energy mix, including whether or not to develop nuclear power.  It is our expectation that, where a State chooses to develop a nuclear power industry, this will be done in line with the highest international standards with respect to safety and environmental protection.  Safety must be the first priority for all existing or planned nuclear facilities.</P>
        <P>With regard to Sellafield, the Government continues to bring pressure to bear on the UK authorities through a number of channels to decommission and close the existing Sellafield reprocessing plant on the basis that it poses an unacceptable risk. In addition to the reprocessing activities conducted there, Sellafield is the location of a large inventory of radioactive waste which will require active management by the UK authorities for many years into the future. From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, it is important that this waste inventory be managed as safely as possible and that any hazard or risk it poses be reduced as a matter of priority.</P>
        <P>I took the opportunity to raise Irish concerns in relation to Sellafield with the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Chris Huhne, when I met him on 26 March 2011 in the margins of an Informal Council of EU Environment Ministers.  In our discussion, while I acknowledged the ongoing constructive dialogue between the Irish and UK authorities on nuclear safety issues, I re-iterated the concerns of the Irish Government in relation to Sellafield.  Against the background of recent events at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan, I emphasised the importance of the Ireland/UK Bilateral Notification Agreement in place for the early notification of nuclear accidents or incidents. I also expressed the view that Sellafield should be covered by the &ldquo;stress testing&rdquo; arrangements for nuclear plants in the EU which were agreed by EU leaders at the European Council on the 24/25 March.</P>
        <P>Secretary of State Huhne acknowledged the Irish Government&rsquo;s concerns and indicated his Government&rsquo;s continued support for the ongoing constructive engagement between Ireland and the UK on nuclear-related matters.  He also confirmed that the UK will be participating in the development of the proposed &lsquo;stress test&rsquo; to ensure that the robustness of the safety arrangements at nuclear facilities, including Sellafield, are challenged and improved where necessary in light of events in Japan.</P>
        <P>This commitment to apply the stress testing regime to Sellafield was recently reconfirmed by the UK after the European Commission and the European Nuclear Safety Regulators&rsquo; Group (ENSREG) announced their agreement on  25 May 2011 on the scope and modalities for a comprehensive risk and safety assessment of EU nuclear power plants.</P>

        <Quest> if he will consider introducing a differential rates scheme for all local authorities that will ensure profitable multinationals will pay considerable more in rates than small <Col N="498"/>local businesses as part of a job creation programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  </P>
        <P>I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration in my Department. However, I have no immediate plans to conduct a review of the rating system generally.</P>
        <P>Local authorities play a central role in supporting economic development and enterprise at local level. They do this in a number of ways including through their capital and current budgets, economic planning and development and the provision of goods and services as well as community infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Business Support Units or similar arrangements have been put in place in all county and city councils. These Units provide a dedicated one-stop-shop approach for businesses in areas such as planning, water services and roads. In addition, the local government led County/City Development Boards are engaged in economic development and the promotion of enterprise in their areas.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government provides for an expanded role for local authorities in local enterprise and community development. This in turn will assist in maximising the impact of investment to produce jobs at local level.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> the reason farmers who buy plastics for silage and pay the levy for recycling when buying are being charged again when the plastic is being picked up for recycling. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>A successful Producer Responsibility Initiative has been in operation since 1997 in relation to farm film/silage bale wrap.  Producers &mdash; manufacturers and importers &mdash; pay a levy of &euro;127 per tonne of farm plastic placed on the market to a compliance scheme, the Irish Farm Films Producers Group<i></i>  (IFFPG), who in turn have been required to meet targets for the recovery and recycling of farm plastic.  IFFPG members placed 13,262 tonnes of farm film/silage bale wrap on the market during 2010 while 19,864 tonnes was collected by IFFPG for recycling.  </P>
        <P>In the period up to 2005, demand for the service provided by IFFPG grew to exceed the capacity of the scheme.  Consideration was given in early 2006, by my Department, in consultation with various stakeholders including farming organisations, to various mechanisms to address the need to ensure that sufficient resources were available to the scheme to meet future demand for collections while at the same time dealing fairly with accumulations of farm plastics on farms across the country.  Following these consultations, the then Minister announced in May 2006 that IFFPG could derive an additional income from weight-based collection charges.</P>
        <P>This was aimed at improving the operational efficiency of the scheme by incentivising the presentation of clean, dry plastic by farmers.  The effect of the introduction of a charge has been to ensure that the availability of collections of farm plastics can match demand on an <Col N="499"/>ongoing basis and to improve the quality of the material being collected.  In addition, IFFPG also introduced a labelling system to improve traceability of levied plastic which supports compliance with the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, with each label bearing a unique number.</P>
        <P>In order to address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic on farms in 2005, designated facilities were provided on a temporary basis by local authorities where farmers could deposit stockpiled farm plastic free of charge.  These once-off free collections allowed farmers the opportunity to deposit any accumulated plastic purchased under the terms of the original scheme, which was based upon free collections.</P>
        <P>The operation of temporary bring facilities proved popular with farmers and, in consultation with stakeholders, the IFFPG have now developed a calendar of collections nationwide where farmers can deposit bale wrap and silage wrap.  These collections have been in operation since 2008. Farmyard collections are still available from IFFPG but as they are more expensive to operate they involve a higher charge.</P>
        <P>While farm plastics deposited at temporary bring sites are weight-based they are subsidised through the levy on producers where evidence is produced by the farmer that the levy has been paid (i.e. on production of a valid label code).  Higher collection fees apply to farmers who cannot provide a unique label reference; consequently, any farmer who sources farm film/silage bale wrap from outside the State or from non-compliant producers has to pay higher waste management costs.</P>
        <P>The enhancements to the scheme, including the use of temporary collection points, the introduction of weight based charges and the development of a new labelling system to support compliance, were introduced at the behest of the scheme and with the support of farmers and the Irish Farmers Association.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government commits to the development of a coherent national waste policy, adhering to the waste hierarchy, which will aim to minimise waste disposal in landfill and maximise recovery. I am prioritising this commitment, as I am anxious to provide early regulatory certainty, in the form of both policy and legislation, to ensure that the necessary actions and investments are progressed to achieve those aims.</P>
        <P>While the issue of appropriate waste infrastructure is a matter, in the first instance, for determination by local authorities through their Regional Waste Management Plans, we must ensure that a range of infrastructure is available to treat the waste we generate in an environmentally appropriate manner. That process of infrastructural diversification must be guided not by a fixation in favour of or against any particular process or technology, but by a policy approach, consistent with the waste hierarchy, which creates the space within which the range of appropriate infrastructure that we need can be brought forward. It is my intention to complete the policy development process by the end of this year.</P>

        <P>I should add that the Criminal Justice Act 1993 (as amended by section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006) provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions may, where it appears to him that a sentence imposed by a court for a crime on indictment is unduly lenient, apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review the sentence.

	<P>It is my understanding that ten institutions were operated by four religious congregations during the period referred to by the Deputy. They were established to provide a &ldquo;refuge&rdquo; or place of asylum for vulnerable women.  The laundries were established within the institutions to provide the funding for the operation of the refuges. They were privately run institutions and publically available records do not provide any type of comprehensive account of the conditions in which they operated.  One such institution was used for a period for female remand prisoners pursuant to the 1960 Criminal Justice Act.</P>

	<P>The Criminal Justice Act 1960 provided that a person between 16 and 21 years of age who had been charged with criminal offences may be committed to custody to a remand institution (other than a prison) whose use for this purpose has been approved by the Minister.  One Magdalen Institution was approved <Col N="501"/>as a remand centre for young women who were aged between 16 and 21 years of age.  That was St Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s Asylum, Lower Sean McDermott Street, Dublin 1. <b></b>The use by the courts of this institution for remand had therefore a statutory basis.  Prior to 1960, the only option to the courts was to remand women to Mountjoy female prison.</P>
        <P>The Probation of Offenders Act, 1907 allows a court to discharge conditionally a person found to have committed a crime in lieu of imposing a prison sentence.  Such a person if not of good behaviour within a period not exceeding 3 years may be recalled for sentencing.

This was provided for in the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One Magdalen institution was approved as a remand centre for young women who were aged between 16 and 21 years of age.  That was St Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s Asylum, Lower Sean McDermott Street, Dublin 1.  Prior to the 1960 Act, the only option open to the courts was to remand women to Mountjoy female prison.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 437, 438 and 443 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is my understanding that ten institutions were operated by four religious congregations. They were established to provide a &ldquo;refuge&rdquo; or place of asylum for vulnerable women.  The laundries were established within the institutions to provide the funding for the operation of the refuges. They were privately run institutions and publicly available records do not provide any type of comprehensive account of the conditions in which they operated.</P>
        <P>One such institution was used for a period for female remand prisoners pursuant to the 1960 Criminal Justice Act. While I have no information at this time of a provision whereby women giving birth to a second child outside marriage at a mother and baby home could be transferred directly to a Magdalen institution, I believe however that it is essential to fully establish the true facts and circumstances relating to these institutions.  To this end, the Deputy will be aware that the Government decided on a number of actions following its meeting yesterday.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 439 and 440 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Justice and Equality did not pay any general capitation grants to Magdalen laundries for the confinement of problem girls.  An arrangement was made with one institution, St Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s Asylum, Lower Sean McDermott Street, Dublin 1., pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act 1960 for its use as a remand centre for young women who were aged between 16 and 21 years of age who were charged with criminal offences. Arrangements were made to ensure that those remanded were to have the same rights and privileges as provided for remand prisoners in the 1947 Prison Rules Part III, and that they would be visited from time to time by a Probation Officer and by the Superintendent of Prisons.  However I cannot confirm what visits were made.   From the limited records available, I understand that payments were made in respect of persons so remanded.  It appears that as regards this institution payments were also made for persons referred there under the Probation of Offenders Act 1907.  An inter Departmental committee is being set up to establish the full extent of State involvement with Magdalen institutions.</P>

	<P>The position is that the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009 provides for the establishment of the Property Services Regulatory Authority to control and supervise providers of property services, including auctioneers, and to improve standards in the provision of those services. </P>
        <P>The statutory powers of the new Authority will include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />issuing and renewing licences for property services providers;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />specifying and enforcing qualification requirements, including levels of education, training and experience, and other requirements such as minimum levels of professional indemnity insurance, for the issue and renewal of licences;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />specifying and enforcing ethical standards to be observed in the provision of property services;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />publishing codes of practice, or approving codes drawn up by other bodies, for the purpose of setting standards for the provision of property services;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />investigating complaints against licensees and imposing a range of sanctions in cases of improper conduct.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Bill will also prohibit licensees from quoting estimated sales prices which are less than the advised market value of the property, i.e. the reasonable estimate, at the time of the valuation, of the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer in an arm&rsquo;s length transaction after proper marketing where both parties act knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.  Where the advised market value is expressed as a price range, the difference between the upper and lower limits of the price range cannot exceed 10 percent. It may however be adjusted with the written consent of the vendor to take account of prevailing market conditions.</P><Col N="504"/>
        <P>The Bill provides that it will be an offence in future for a person who offers property for sale by auction to bid at the auction or to procure, authorise or permit another person to bid on his or her behalf.  It will also be improper conduct for a licensee knowingly to accept such a bid.  Where it is established that a vendor has bid for his or her own property, or arranged for another person to do so, the purchaser may refuse to complete the contract for sale without incurring any civil liability.  Where property is sold by private treaty rather than by auction, the licensee will be required to keep a record of all offers received including conditional acceptances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Finally, the Bill provides that a licensee acting for a vendor may not provide a financial service to an intending purchaser of the property without the prior written consent of both parties.  The Bill has already been passed by the Seanad and is currently awaiting D&aacute;il Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in August, 2010.  The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>In that context, as I outlined in response to Parliamentary Question Number 69 of 7 April last, I can inform the Deputy that I have initiated steps within my Department to provide for speedier processing of applications to bring about a substantial reduction in the processing timescale.  These new arrangements will be publicly announced in the coming days.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>

        <P>In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement strategies to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks, and use advanced analytical and intelligence methods to facilitate targeted operations to enable early intervention and prevention of such crimes.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na use a multi-agency approach, whereby the National Units from National Support Services such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda Technical Bureau are used to combat serious crime.

	<P>Combating serious and organised crime continues to be a key priority of the European Union in the development of an area of freedom, security and justice.  </P>
        <P>The Stockholm Programme &mdash; An Open and Secure Europe Serving and Protecting Citizens, is the key strategic document setting out guidelines for legislative and operational planning within the area of freedom, security and justice for the period 2010-2014.  The Programme includes a number of strategic goals in combating serious and organised crime including the adoption of an organised crime strategy, within the framework of the Internal Security Strategy, and the setting of priorities in crime policy against which the Union will deploy the tools available to it.</P>
        <P>Ireland welcomed the Stockholm Programme at the time of its adoption and continues to support the implementation of this five year work programme for the Justice and Home Affairs area.  In 2010 the Internal Security Strategy was adopted setting out the challenges, principles and guidelines for how to deal with emerging threats and to increase Europe&rsquo;s security.  The Strategy called upon the Commission to propose actions for implementing the Strategy and a Commission communication, the EU Internal Security Strategy in Action, was published at the end of 2010.  Included in the Commission communication are a number of actions aimed at disrupting international crime networks together with a timeframe for their development during the period 2010 to 2014.</P>
        <P>At the most recent Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting, my European colleagues and I, adopted Council Conclusions on setting the European Union&rsquo;s priorities for the fight against organised crime between 2011 and 2013.  These Conclusions facilitate further work on the creation and implementation of an EU policy cycle for organised and serious international crime for the period 2011 to 2013.  The policy cycle will allow the Union to focus on those threats and challenges that need specific attention and to develop an approach to tackle and monitor these threats and challenges.</P>
        <P>All of these measures represent significant progress in implementing the priorities set out in the Stockholm Programme.  That said, there remains a significant body of work to be progressed and significant challenges to be met in tackling organised crime at European Union level.  These <Col N="507"/>matters are reflected in the various work programmes and action plans of the EU institutions which outline further initiatives to be developed in the coming years.</P>
        <P>I am fully supportive of the strategy that the European Union has adopted in  the Stockholm Programme and of the practical measures for international cooperation arising from that Programme which provide real and added value to the Community in tackling international serious and organised crime.  In representing Ireland at European level I will continue to support and, where the opportunity arises, advance initiatives that will serve the Union well in its fight against organised crime.</P>
        <P>From an Irish perspective, I am particularly mindful of the success that we have had in this jurisdiction in tackling the proceeds of crime through the setting up of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I strongly believe that the Union can build on this type of model to ensure effective co-operation on the confiscation of assets within the Union and I propose to do all I can to advance that with my European colleagues.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 452 and 453 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they continue to be actively involved in monitoring potential radical elements and engaging with communities in order to prevent a rise in extremism.  The Garda maintain close and regular contact with their EU and other international counterparts in this regard.</P>
        <P>The prevention of violent extremism is an important aspect of ongoing work taking place at EU level, both in the context of the EU&rsquo;s Counter Terrorism Strategy and in the context of the EU&rsquo;s legal framework to combat racism and xenophobia.  Ireland plays a full and active role, in co-operation with our EU counterparts, in the range of actions taking place.  In addition the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 contains significant legislative measures to counter the threat posed by terrorist groups.  In particular, the Act contains provision for the imposition of enhanced sentences for persons found guilty of terrorist offences.</P>
        <P>There are other, community based, initiatives which are designed to promote positive communication with various groups in our society.  An important aspect of the Garda approach is a community policing engagement with minority communities.  The Garda Racial, Intercultural and Diversity Office oversees the implementation of the Garda Diversity Strategy 2009 &mdash; 2012.  The Intercultural and Diversity Office consults at a national and local level with minority communities.  This constant consultation with minority communities is a key strategy to building trust within those communities and ensuring that communication is facilitated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This consultation is monitored through the Garda Ethnic Liaison Officer network.  The role of the Ethnic Liaison Officers includes interacting on a regular basis with representatives from ethnic minority groups and hard to reach groups.  Each Garda Division has a number of appointed Ethnic Liaison Officers, who receive targeted training for the role.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice and Equality</askee>
        <Quest> if he will provide details of the average time it takes the Irish Immigration and Naturalisation Service to process applications for asylum and citizenship; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of citizenship, as I outlined in response to Parliamentary Question Number 69 of 7 April last, I can inform the Deputy that I have initiated steps within my Department to provide for speedier processing of applications for citizenship to bring about a substantial reduction in the processing timescale which currently averages 25 months.  These new arrangements will be publicly announced in the coming days. </P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  In relation to applications for refugee status in the State these are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality on whether such status should be granted.</P>
        <P>During 2010, the median processing time for asylum applications by the ORAC was 6 to 7 weeks from the date of application in the case of prioritised applications, and 9 weeks from the date of application in the case of non-prioritised applications.  The median processing times for RAT appeals in 2010 was 33 weeks in the case of substantive appeals (cases involving an oral hearing) and 9 weeks in the case of accelerated appeals (appeals on the papers).  I would point out that some cases can take significantly longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues, non-availability of interpreters or because of judicial review proceedings.</P>
        <P>All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.  For the sake of completeness, I should also state that persons who are refused a declaration under Section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) enter what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; process which generally has two elements to it; an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process.</P>
        <P>The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive given that where an application for subsidiary protection is lodged in addition to representations for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the subsidiary protection application must be considered first to assess whether the applicant has an identifiable need for international protection.  The investigation of such applications requires a fresh examination of the entire asylum file, the documentation and country of origin information submitted in support of the application, as well as an examination of objective, reputable, up to date country of origin information before a conclusion can be arrived at as to whether or not the applicant is likely to be exposed to &lsquo;serious harm&rsquo; if returned to his/her country of origin.</P>
        <P>Where such an application is refused, consideration must then be given to the case in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), at which point the Minister must make a decision whether or not to make a deportation order in respect of the person.  All of this must be done in strict compliance with the Constitution, together with relevant international law including the European Convention on Human Rights.  It will be seen <Col N="509"/>that these are not quick or easy decisions to make and, given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.</P>
        <P>I have taken steps to speed up the processing of these applications by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies primarily.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 which provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements.  This re-organisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more &lsquo;straight forward&rsquo; and timely fashion. The Deputy is probably aware that I am currently developing a number of amendments to the Bill before commencing Committee Stage which I hope to be in a position to do in the near future.</P>

	<P>The matter of an EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies has been a priority of the Hungarian Presidency of the EU. A decision has been taken that all Member States are to produce a National Roma Integration Strategy by the end of 2011.  The Communication from the Commission includes a definition of the term &lsquo;Roma&rsquo;, similar to other political documents of the EU Parliament and the European Council, and reads: &ldquo;an umbrella which includes groups of people who have more or less similar cultural characteristics, such as Sinti, Travellers, Kal&eacute;, Gens du voyage, etc. whether sedentary or not&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Framework, as it applies to Ireland, will deal in the main with the Irish Traveller population. We already have policies in place for Travellers in relation to the areas mentioned in the Strategy &mdash; education, employment, health care and housing. I am satisfied, therefore, that we already have measures in place to meet the requirements of the proposed Framework. Consultation in relation to the Strategy has already begun in my Department through the High Level Group on Travellers.</P>

	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision.  Persons in the asylum process are not entitled to access social welfare supports, including rent supplement, and are therefore not entitled to State-funded private accommodation.  The basic needs of such persons are met through the direct provision system which provides full board accommodation and certain ancillary services.</P>
        <P>The family referred to in the details supplied are currently availing of direct provision accommodation at Eyre Powell accommodation centre, Newbridge, Co. Kildare.  It is open to the family to seek a transfer to alternative direct provision accommodation.  This family did make such a transfer application in January 2010 to RIA but turned down the offer of alternative accommodation.  If they wish to apply again for a transfer, they may do so using the transfer request form available from the accommodation centre manager which should be sent to RIA, PO Box 11487, Dublin 2.</P>
        <P>In the interest of completeness, I will outline the residency positions of the four members of this family i.e. the father, mother and two young children. All were the subject of individual asylum applications.  Arising from the refusal of their individual asylum applications, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the father, mother and older child were notified by letters dated 14th August, 2008 and 27th July, 2008, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.</P>
        <P>They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against them.  In addition, they were notified of their respective entitlements to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  The same three family members submitted applications for Subsidiary Protection and, following consideration of these applications, it was determined that the persons concerned <Col N="514"/>were not eligible for Subsidiary Protection.  The persons concerned were notified of these decisions by separate letters dated 23rd February, 2010.</P>
        <P>The cases of these three family members were then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement and all representations made were considered before decisions were arrived at.  Deportation Orders were made in respect of these three family members and these Orders were served by registered post dated 1st March, 2010.  These communications advised the three family members of the legal requirement that they &lsquo;present&rsquo; at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on a specified date in order to make arrangements for their deportation from the State.  As persons subject of a Deportation Order, these three family members are required to adhere to any residency or reporting requirements placed on them by the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>
        <P>The fourth family member, an infant born in February 2009, had an application for asylum made on her behalf in May, 2009.  Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, she was, by letter dated 4th November, 2010, advised of the options open to her, to be exercised within 15 working days, which were to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.

	<P>Drug treatment courts can make an important contribution as a restorative justice measure but international studies also indicate that they need to evolve and develop on an ongoing basis.  My Department carried out a review of the Dublin Drug Treatment Court which was published in May 2010 and identified particular issues to be addressed in terms of the court&rsquo;s management and operation.  As a result of that review an Advisory Committee was established which has met regularly to progress matters and to monitor the implementation of the recommendations in the Report with the aim of improving the programme&rsquo;s throughput and effectiveness.</P>
        <P>The aim is to develop the potential of the Drug Treatment Court but to do so in line with the international experience by continually reviewing the effectiveness of the programme to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and, if it is doing so, to continue to expand the use of the Drug Treatment Court as an alternative to prison.  A further review of the Drug Treatment Court is to be conducted in 2012.</P>

        <P>As I outlined in response to Parliamentary Question Number 69 of 7 April last, I can inform the Deputy that I have initiated steps within my Department to provide for speedier processing of applications for citizenship to bring about a substantial reduction in the processing timescale.  These new arrangements will be publicly announced in the coming days.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>

	<P>My Department and agencies staffed by it, administer a number of schemes which promote the use of sustainable transport to and from the workplace. For example there are currently 286 people participating in the Travel Pass Scheme. This scheme was introduced as part of Government policy to encourage greater use of public transport. Under arrangements agreed with the Revenue Commissioners, it allows staff to forego salary to the value of the travel pass, thus reducing individual liability for income tax and PRSI. The recently introduced &lsquo;Cycle to Work&rsquo; Scheme has also proven very popular, with 241 people already participating. </P>
        <P>In relation to official travel, my Department acts in accordance with the instructions governing the payment of travelling and subsistence allowances in the civil service as a whole. In so doing officials in my Department are encouraged to use public transport when travelling on Departmental business. For example, in the case of an officer who uses his own car where public transport could have been used, without detriment to the public interest, the amount allowed for the officer&rsquo;s own car in respect of mileage allowance must not exceed the cost of public transport (including that of passengers whose travelling expenses would be payable from public funds).</P>

Section 101 <Col N="518"/>of that Act provides that if the Ombudsman Commission is of the opinion that the conduct under investigation may constitute an offence by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it shall send a copy of the investigation file to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP ) together with any recommendations that appear to it to be appropriate.

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the UN Committee against Torture (UNCAT) issued its concluding observations on Monday 6 June following Ireland&rsquo;s first examination in Geneva last month under Article 19 of the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.   </P>
        <P>The Committee in its statement acknowledged Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to engage with them in a constructive manner and indeed commended Ireland for significant progress in recent years in a number of areas such as the prevention of domestic violence and human trafficking.  Its concluding observations cover a wide range of areas from prison conditions to the total prohibition of corporal punishment, the Magdalen Laundries, the follow up to the Ryan Report and the processing of applications for refugee status, all of which impact on the remit of several Government Departments.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with my cabinet colleagues, the Deputy can be assured that I will closely examine the concluding observations and recommendations of the Committee.  The Government will also in due course communicate with the Committee about the points raised.</P>
        <P>As regards the Committee&rsquo;s observations on prison facilities, I might add that measures are already being taken to address these issues and improve conditions in our prisons.  The Programme for Government contains several commitments aimed at alleviating overcrowding, upgrading and improving facilities including in-cell sanitation, and to consider alternatives to custody which are available and can be used. On taking up office, I established a committee to review the Thornton project, to examine the need for adequate prison accommodation and to consider alternatives to custody.  The Committee is due to report by 1 July and I look forward to considering their views.</P>
        <P>Moreover, I previously informed the House that I intend to bring forward amendments to the Prison Rules, 2007 which will address issues raised by the Committee and the Inspector of Prisons in the areas of complaint investigation, health care and deaths in custody.</P><Col N="519"/>
        <P>One of the first Bills I brought before this House was the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Bill.  It will require judges to consider imposing Community Service in any case where the appropriate sentence would otherwise be a custodial one of up to 12 months imprisonment.  I have also asked my officials to look at a scheme where suitable long term prisoners might have the last period of their custodial sentence replaced by a form of Community Service.</P>
        <P>On the Magdalen Laundries, the Committee &ldquo;recommended that the State should institute prompt, independent, and thorough investigations into all allegations of torture, and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that were allegedly committed in the Magdalen Laundries and, in appropriate cases, prosecute and punish the perpetrators with penalties commensurate with the gravity of the offences committed, and ensure that all victims obtain redress and have an enforceable right to compensation including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible&rdquo;.</P>

        <P>This upper age limit of 35 was set having regard to equality legislation and also took into account the following criteria:</P>
        <P>(1) The cost of training</P>
        <P>(2) The need for recruits to serve for a sufficient period of time as full members of the service to recoup this cost.</P>
        <P>(3) The operational requirements of the service in terms of having an age profile appropriate to the physical demands placed on members in the course of their duty.</P>
        <P>Consideration is being given to changing the upper age limit, in limited circumstances, in a way which would be beneficial to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

        <P>Public bodies are already under clear statutory and constitutional obligations in relation to the treatment of individuals from a human rights and equality perspective.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The UN Committee against Torture (UNCAT) issued its concluding observations on Monday 6 June following Ireland&rsquo;s first examination in Geneva last month under Article 19 of the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  The Committee in its statement acknowledged Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to engage with them in a constructive manner and indeed commended Ireland for significant progress in recent years in a number of areas such as the prevention of domestic violence and human trafficking.  Its concluding observations cover a wide range of areas from prison conditions to the total prohibition of corporal punishment, the Magdalen Laundries, the follow-up of the Ryan Report and the processing of applications for refugee status, all of which impact on the remit of several Government Departments.</P>
        <P>Specifically, in relation to the Magdalen Laundries, the Committee &ldquo;recommended that the State should institute prompt, independent, and thorough investigations into all allegations of torture, and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that were allegedly committed in the Magdalen Laundries and, in appropriate cases, prosecute and punish the perpetrators with penalties commensurate with the gravity of the offences committed, and ensure that all victims obtain redress and have an enforceable right to compensation including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The position is that Part 8 (Chapter 1) of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 has updated the law concerning the acquisition of easements based on recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. Section 35 of the Act, which entered into operation on 1 December 2009, provides that easements shall be acquired at law by prescription only on registration in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds of a court order under that section.</P>
        <P>Late last year the Law Society made a submission to my Department containing proposals to amend the 2009 Act with a view to simplifying the procedures for registering easements acquired by prescription. During subsequent discussions involving my Department, the Law Society and the Property Registration Authority, agreement was reached on the outline of a draft scheme whereby the Authority would be empowered to register such easements without <Col N="522"/>a court order under section 35 of the 2009 Act on being satisfied that the claim had been substantiated.</P>
        <P>In order to give statutory effect to the proposed scheme, amendments to the Registration of Title Act 1964 and the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 will be required. I intend therefore to include the necessary amendments to both Acts in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which, subject to Government approval, will be published shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 481 and 488 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the use of a skimming device in relation to debit and credit cards or ATM cards will amount to offences under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  In addition, a person who uses a credit or debit card which has been skimmed may be committing a number of offences under the 2001 Act.</P>
        <P>The number of incidents involving card skimming recorded on the Garda PULSE system for the period 2007 to 9 June 2011 is set out in the table below. These figures do indicate an increase in the number of recorded incidents for the year 2011 (up to 9 June 2011) when compared with the previous two years.</P>
        <P>In January this year An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na put the crime reduction/prevention initiative &lsquo;Operation &lsquo;Glint&rsquo; into place, under the direction and control of the Assistant Commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Region. While the principal aim of Operation Glint is to disrupt the activities of those involved in ATM fraud, it also serves to alert the public to the use of skimming devices by criminals.</P>
        <P>Following the roll-out of this initiative, a large number of skimming devices were seized resulting in a number of arrests and, in particular, the arrest of a number of transient organised criminals whose cases are currently before the courts.</P>
        <P>This initiative has since been introduced in other Garda Regions nationwide.</P>
        <P>I am also advised that the increase in ATM fraud is also being addressed by the introduction of security measures by the financial institutions. Incidents of so-called &lsquo;skimming&rsquo; are reported to the Irish Payment Card Services Organisation by relevant financial institutions. These incidents are then reported to, and circulated by, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>This type of criminal activity is also being addressed through several forums including the Hi-Tech Crime Forum and the ATM Fraud Forum. The Hi-Tech Crime Forum is comprised of representatives of the banking institutions, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, internet service providers, the Irish Payment Card Services Organisation and other stakeholders as deemed appropriate. The ATM Fraud Forum, which is comprised of representatives of the various financial institutions and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is chaired by the Irish Payment Card Services Organisation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board (LAB) has general procedures in place for applying for legal services and a person wishing to apply for legal services must complete an application form and submit it to a Law Centre. While an applicant is generally required to vouch his or her income this should not be necessary in the case of persons in custody. The Law Centre, on receipt of the application, then determines whether the case falls within its categories of prioritised matters, and if it does, a solicitor is appointed to take instructions from the applicant as a matter of urgency.  An applicant who does not fall within a prioritised category is placed on what is effectively a waiting list and is dealt with in due course.</P>
        <P>In the case of an applicant who is serving time in prison, the solicitor normally attends the prison for the purpose of taking instruction.  An applicant is required to pay a legal advice contribution and this is &euro;10 in the case of one who is serving time in prison.  In the event that court representation is required, the applicant is generally required to pay an additional &euro;40.  However, the contribution can be waived on the basis of hardship and the &euro;40 fee is generally waived in certain types of case, e.g. the defence of proceedings on foot of Part IV of the Child Care Act 1991, for persons imprisoned.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might also wish to note that in response to concerns expressed about the capacity of applicants serving time in prison to speedily access legal services for the purpose of defending proceedings on foot of Part IV of the Child Care Act 1991 (one of the priority categories as referred to above), the LAB recently wrote to prison governors outlining the process of applying for legal aid and enclosing legal aid application forms.</P>

        <P>I am advised that  the General Secretary of the RDFRA made a submission to Military Conciliation and Arbitration Section of the Defence Forces highlighting their concerns.  Under  Defence Force Regulation (DFR) R5,  the Deputy Chief of Staff (Sp) can issue Administrative Instructions laying down the procedures and administrative arrangements regarding dress for members of the Reserve.  This is a matter for the military authorities in the first instance.</P>

	<P>Ireland is currently contributing 218 Defence Forces personnel to 11 different missions throughout the world. Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement below.    </P>
        <P>The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed, are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), the EU-led operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo.  Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the EU, OSCE and NATO.</P>
        <P>With regard to the deployment to UNIFIL, an advance party of 47 personnel of the 104th Infantry Battalion, together with a work party of 42 personnel, deployed to southern Lebanon on 30 May 2011.  The main body of the Battalion is scheduled to deploy to UNIFIL at the end <Col N="527"/>of this month when the work party will return.  In July 2011, Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to Operation ALTHEA will reduce from 44 personnel to 7 personnel.</P>
        <P>When the UNIFIL contingent is fully deployed and the reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to Operation ALTHEA takes effect, the total number of personnel deployed overseas will amount to approximately 540.  This represents a significant contribution to international peacekeeping operations and the obligations Ireland has assumed through its membership of the UN.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 493 to 497, inclusive, together.    </P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 114 of the Defence Act provides that any member of the Defence Forces, who considers himself to have been wronged in any matter, may make a complaint and have it investigated and redressed.  Where the wrong is proven, redress is offered to the complainant.  In the event that the complainant is unhappy with the result of an investigation or with the proposed redress, the matter is referred to the General Officer Commanding and, if that does not resolve the issue, to the Chief of Staff.  If the complainant is still unhappy then they can have their complaint forwarded to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the military authorities that in the period since 2006, 187 complaints were made by two individual members of the Air Corps against superior officers.  No other complaints were made against superior officers in the Air Corps.  The military authorities have further advised that all complaints made under section 114 of the Defence Act 1954 are dealt with in accordance with the complaints procedures laid down under Chapter 2 of Administrative Instructions A7.</P>
        <P>In relation to the suggestion that reports of investigations into complaints being returned to the investigating officer, the military authorities advise that in and around 2003 the then Complaints Investigation Officer reported on such an incident but that no further such incidents have been reported in the intervening period.</P><Col N="529"/>
        <P>I understand that complaints have been submitted against one Unit Commander who has been selected for promotion.  Such promotions are dealt with in accordance with standard agreed procedures and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in such matters.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy refers to a report from 2006; if the Deputy provides me with the specific details of the case in question I will be happy to provide him with details of the action taken on foot of the report.</P>

The specific information as to the total number involved is not available in my Department.  Holders of Defence Forces pensions are not required to inform my Department of any employment, public sector or otherwise, obtained subsequent to leaving the Defence Forces.  In these respects, my understanding is that they are treated no differently to other public service pensioners generally.  </P>

        <Quest> the contacts he has had with his European counterparts in relation to the mutant E. coli outbreak, which has caused numerous deaths and serious illness in Germany; the progress that has been made in identifying the source of this problem; the actions he will take to prevent the spread of the bacteria here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The E. coli outbreak in Germany was discussed at the Informal Council of Agriculture Ministers in Hungary on 31 May.  I also attended an emergency meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg on Tuesday 7   June.  The meeting was called to deal with the food safety and market implications resulting from the E. coli outbreak.</P>
        <P>Since that meeting, I, and my Department officials, have continued to maintain close contact with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and with our European counterparts to review the situation.</P>
        <P>On Friday 10 June, the German authorities confirmed that they had identified &ldquo;with great probability&rdquo; sprouts, grown in Germany, as the source of the virulent EHEC infection.  Furthermore, they announced that, as a consequence, the warning against the consumption of tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce was being rescinded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The German authorities confirmed on Sunday 12 June, that laboratory results of sprouts tested positive for the outbreak strain of <i>E. coli </i>(VTEC) O104:H4.  Last week, the German authorities had closed down the production plant in question and the sprouts from the plant were withdrawn from the market.  Following the sampling of sprouts obtained from a household infected with the <i>E. Coli </i>strain, the German authorities are of the opinion that it can be <Col N="531"/>assumed with a very high probability that the <i>E. coli </i>  outbreak is attributable, more particularly to the consumption of sprouts.</P>
        <P>None of the sprouts from this production plant were exported from Germany.</P>
        <P>The German Federal Minister for Health, Daniel Bahr, believes there is optimism that the epidemic may soon be over as the number of <i>E. coli</i>   cases has now, it is believed peaked.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, there have been no reported cases of human illness associated with the German outbreak strain of <i>E. coli </i>  (VTEC) O104:H4.</P>
        <P>I, and my Department officials, are maintaining regular contact with our European counterparts and are continuing to review the situation.  In addition, we are in constant contact with the FSAI, which is responsible for protecting public health and consumer interests in the area of food safety and hygiene, and which also continues to monitor the situation.</P>

	<P>Further to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 315 of 24 May 2011, in assessing eligibility for payment under the Income Supplement scheme, the eligibility criterion which requires that more than 10% of animals must be removed under the scheme is calculated by reference to the total number of animals, including calves, presented by the herdowner at the herd test.  In the letter notifying him to test, the herdowner was advised of the age profile of animals which must be presented for testing and the onus is on him to follow those instructions.  Any calves presented for the test, regardless of age, were included in the calculation. Animals deceased prior to the date of the relevant test were not included in the calculation.</P>

	<P>The Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) was introduced to give farmers the opportunity to participate in a scheme which rewards actions that benefit the environment.  The AEOS scheme that I announced on April 6 was launched following an extensive review of the previous year&rsquo;s scheme <Col N="532"/>involving both internal and external stakeholders.  The 2011 scheme closed to applications on 17 May.  The applications received are being assessed at present and the level of participation will be determined by the aggregate cost of the plans submitted and the number of applications that can be accommodated within the funding available.  Any further participation in the scheme in future years and any adjustment to the existing scheme will be considered in the context of the Expenditure Review and Estimates process. </P>

	<P>My Department, in the context of delivering the Direct Payment Schemes, is required to carry out on-the-spot inspections on a number of farms covering such issues as eligibility under the Scheme, com<Col N="533"/>pliance with EU legislation in the areas of the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health and ensuring that the farm is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition.</P>
        <P>A minimum of 5% of Scheme applicants are required to be inspected under the eligibility rule. These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area held by the farmer and to ensure there are no overlapping claims or duplicate claims. Up to two-thirds of these inspections are carried out without a farm visit and using the technique of remote sensing.</P>
        <P>The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom the Statutory Management Requirements or GAEC apply. However, at least 3% of producers must be inspected under the Bovine and Ovine Animal Identification and Registration requirements. For Bovine checks in 2011 this constitutes a reduction of 2% from previous years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is in regular contact with the European Commission with a view to simplification of the Direct Payments Scheme requirements. In this connection the European Commission, in consultation with Member States, undertook a full review of the cross-compliance regime. The following issues were covered in the conclusions:</P>
        <P LI="2">Tolerance for minor non-compliance</P>
        <P LI="2">Introduction of a &ldquo;de minimis&rdquo; rule for penalties</P>
        <P LI="2">Harmonisation of control rates</P>
        <P LI="2">Advance notice of Inspections</P>
        <P LI="2">Reviewing the &ldquo;10 month rule&rdquo;</P>
        <P LI="2">Making better use of the results of existing controls in the context of risk analysis for cross-compliance.</P>
        <P LI="2">Phasing in of cross-compliance for new Member States operating the SAPS</P>
        <P FLI="0">Council and Commission Regulations are now in place implementing these new arrangements.</P>
        <P>In tandem with this my Department carried out a full review of the inspection arrangements for the Single Payment Scheme with a view to simplification of the arrangements (including paperwork) where possible while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements.</P>
        <P>While all inspections should be unannounced, the Department can give up to 14 days notice for land eligibility and cross-compliance inspections involving SMRs other than those related to animal identification and registration, food, feed, and animal welfare. For checks involving cattle identification and registration the maximum advance notice is 48 hours provided the Department is satisfied that the purpose of the inspection is not jeopardised. For SMRs dealing with feed, food and animal welfare no advance notice may be given.</P>
        <P>My Department is required to ensure that the control environment established under cross-compliance is robust and meets with regulatory and audit requirements.</P>

	<P>I recognise the merits of discussion groups as a vehicle for transferring technology. In this regard, I would urge all farmers to avail of the extremely valuable information emerging from Teagasc, ICBF and from the Teagasc / IFJ Better Farm Beef Programme and to participate where possible in discussion groups or other collaborative initiatives which can assist farmers in making their enterprises more efficient and in improving margins.</P>
        <P>Insofar as providing a financial stimulus to encourage participation in beef or sheep discussion groups is concerned, the realities of the public finances mean that difficult choices will have to be made when it comes to allocating scarce Exchequer resources. Like other Ministers, I am faced with a number of financial challenges at present but I can assure the deputy that my approach to determining spending priorities will be informed by the need to ensure that scarce public resources are utilised to best effect to facilitate the development of the beef, sheep and other agri-food sectors.</P>
        <P>There has, of course, been significant public investment in the beef and sheep sector in recent years through the Farm Waste Management Scheme, the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme and the Capital Investment Scheme for the beef and sheepmeat processing industry.</P>
        <P>I am fully aware of the significant benefits of the current discussion group mechanism in the dairy sector. However, I should point out that this scheme is funded entirely from unspent EU Single Farm Payment Funds, which have been fully allocated at this stage.</P>

Where this is not possible an explanation must be provided and where it is clear that public transport could have been used, the amount to be allowed for private vehicle use must not exceed the cost of public transport.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The full list of meat establishments approved by my Department under the European Communities (Food and Feed Hygiene) Regulations 2009 (S.I. No. 432 of 2009) may be found in the appendix to this reply. It is also available at this link on my Department&rsquo;s website:</P>
        <P>http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/foodsafetyconsumerissues/daffapprovedestablishments/</P>
        <P>The list on the website includes details of the approved activities and species for each plant.</P>
        <P>Animal identification systems in place differ, depending on the species of animal, and the methodology of checks at each slaughter establishment will vary accordingly. Electronic scanners are used in bovine slaughtering establishments to scan passports. They may also be used in establishments slaughtering other species. However, their use is not a legal requirement for approval and visual checks are widely carried out. Commercial matters can be a factor in the decision as to which method is used.</P>
        <P>The role of the Department&rsquo;s veterinary staff at each type of slaughterhouse includes a range of checks to ensure that animals accepted for slaughter for human consumption are properly identified. Animals whose identity is not reasonably ascertainable are killed separately and declared unfit for human consumption.</P>
        <P>Under Regulation (EC) 853/2004, and in addition to the general traceability requirements of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, food business operators responsible for establishments that are subject to approval must ensure that all products of animal origin that they place on the market bear either a health mark or an identification mark.</P>
        <P>Additional information on the requirements and practices for identification of individual species is set out below.</P>
        <P>The bovine identification system comprises four elements &mdash; tagging; bovine passport; on-farm bovine herd registers; and a computerised database, the Animal Identification and Movement system (AIM). When a bovine animal is presented at a slaughter plant, the food business operator (FBO) electronically scans  the passport of each animal and reads each ear tag. Department staff then carry out verification checks on a proportion of animals, ensuring correlation <Col N="537"/>of the cards and the bovine animals. The tag number of each animal is submitted electronically to the AIM system prior to slaughter, to verify the origin and identity of the animal before it enters the food chain.</P>
        <P>Checks on sheep identity at meat plants are mostly visual, although some use is made of scanners. Sheep slaughterings are input to the AIM system.</P>
        <P>The National Pig Identification and Tracing System (NPITS) records all movements of pigs to factories. Identity checks on pigs at meat plants are usually done by visual examination of the slap mark on the skin of the animals, and identification is by herd basis rather than by individual pig.</P>
        <P>Each equine destined for slaughter must be accompanied by its horse passport. FBOs carry out checks on the horse against the markings on the passport to correlate the information. Department staff carry out additional checks prior to slaughter of the horse. Each horse is checked by scanner to ascertain if it has been microchipped and if so checks are carried out to ensure that the passport is valid for that horse.</P>
        <P>In the case of poultry, it is not a requirement to individually identify every bird, or to health mark the carcase. However, there remains a general requirement for the FBO and Department staff to be satisfied as to the origin of the flock before allowing slaughter of birds for human consumption.</P>

	<P>I understand that this parcel of land is subject to a trust set up in 1907 between the then landlord and trustees, one of whom was the landlord himself, to permit various persons to cut, make, spread and save, turf and depasture cattle sheep and horses on the trust estate.</P>
        <P>Provision was made in the trust document for the ongoing appointment of new trustees by the surviving or continuing trustees or trustee and where there was no surviving or continuing trustee competent or willing to act, trustees may be appointed by the Irish Land Commission. This is the only power given to the Commission by the trust deed.</P>
        <P>As successor to the Irish Land Commission, if there are no surviving or continuing trustees or trustee, I would be prepared to appoint trustees if agreed persons willing to act were nominated to my Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This trust was not set up under the Land Purchase Acts. Other trusts, particularly sports fields trusts were set up under the provisions of the 1903 Land Act, as extended, and in many cases in recent years these properties were transferred, at the trustees' request, to GAA Clubs for the benefit of the community.</P>

	<P>Under the EU regulatory requirements modulation funds must be spent exclusively on what are referred to as the new challenges. This means that Member States are limited in spending these funds to operations and activities relating to (a) climate change, (b) renewable energies, (c) water management, (d) biodiversity, (e) restructuring of the dairy sector and (f) innovation linked to activities under points (a) to (d). The effects to be achieved by the spending of modulation funds is also prescribed and must be directly connected with these areas.</P>
        <P>All Irish modulation funds have been allocated to the AEOS Scheme and this utilisation of the funds has been approved by the EU Commission. Even if modulation funds were available it would not be possible to fund a livestock mart having regard to the limitations on their use.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> if he will request his EU ministerial colleagues to address the wasteful practice of fish quota discards. </Quest>
        <QRef>[15250/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very concerned about the unacceptable practice of discarding fish at sea and I am fully committed to working both nationally and internationally to bring about an end to this practice. Commissioner Damanaki has placed discarding of fish high on her agenda for the Common Fisheries Policy reform <Col N="542"/>and at my meeting with her on the 14 of April made clear that I was committed to giving Ireland&rsquo;s support to assisting the Commissioner in identifying and implementing the appropriate measures to effectively address discards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At home I have taken a number of opportunities to discuss this complex subject with the Irish fishing industry. I am happy to say that it is also grappling with ways to reduce and ultimately eliminate discards and is currently engaging in trials on selective gears in the Celtic Sea haddock and whiting fisheries, with a view to bringing proposals to me in the next few weeks.  As soon as I receive these proposals from industry, I intend to bring these proposals to my French counterpart as a possible joint approach to the EU Commission as France and Ireland are the main players in these fisheries. If we are successful in agreeing new measures with France and secure EU Commission support, I would be prepared to promote their introduction at national level in both jurisdictions pending their adoption at EU level.</P>
        <P>Discarding has been receiving huge exposure across various international media, setting a negative picture of the global fishing industry. Decisive action is required in the short term, however, the problem is complex with many and at times disconnected factors impacting on it.  This level of complexity requires an approach, which recognises the multifaceted issues, the different dynamics of individual fisheries and areas and delivers real policies and change on a number of fronts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Any resolution will require the buy in of our fishermen and a significant behavioural shift will be required from them to successfully eliminate discards. Without this change in operational patterns there will be a real danger that whatever new legislation is introduced will only succeed in pushing discarding further &ldquo;underground&rdquo; and this would worsen the current data situation and not deal with the problem. Discards were a high priority in Ireland&rsquo;s formal submission on the CFP Review forwarded last year, which argued for a fishery specific approach involving remedial actions to reduce or eliminate discards involving changes to fishing gear and fishing practices.  It focused on the development of a strong industry, science and gear technology partnership to best equip our fleets for their specific needs. It also promoted the development of a Code of Practice to incentivise best practice.</P>
        <P>My preference is for a clear policy to eliminate discards, backed up by unambiguous and appropriate technical measures and supports which can demonstrably achieve the stated policy goal. To my mind, there has been little elaboration on the suite of measures and supports that will be necessary.  This is undermining the discussion to date.</P>
        <P>One of the possible measures being looked at is the concept of catch quota management which involves landing all catches of targeted stocks and recording the landings against quota. There are pilot schemes up and running in some Member States and I await the outcome of those, though it is already clear to me that any move in this direction would have to be over a reasonable timeframe, provide some adjustment in quota to take account of the increased landings and be on a voluntary basis in the first instance.  This approach is technical and requires a significant capital investment in equipment and human resources which will have to be facilitated by financial support from the EU if it is to become a reality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From an national perspective in addition to the industry led trials in the Celtic Sea already mentioned, Ireland is preparing a project proposal for the Biologically Sensitive Area (BSA) of the South and West coasts of Ireland, with a view to developing clear management objectives for the area, with a strong focus on the elimination of discards in the key Hake, Monk and Megrim fisheries. I hope to submit this project to Commissioner Damanaki as soon as possible. If acceptable it will require further negotiations with my colleagues in the UK, Spain and France. The overall objective is to develop a regionalised plan agreed by ourselves, France, the <Col N="543"/>UK and Spain setting out appropriate measures to meet stringent conservation objectives for the area. It could be a roadmap for other programmes to deal with the discard issue across Europe.</P>
        <P>On discussions and moves to address the discards problem generally, I fully intend, over the course of the negotiations on CFP reform to engage with my EU Ministerial Colleagues to bring this wasteful practice to an end.</P>

        <Quest> the total amount of envisaged savings from cuts to agri-environment options scheme payments for disadvantaged areas and in designated areas in 2011 and in 2012; and if in view of the lower than forecasted take up of the AEOS scheme for 2011 he will re-examine the decision. </Quest>

	<P>There are no cuts in Agri-Environment Option Scheme (AEOS) payments to farmers in disadvantaged area or designated areas in 2011 or 2012.</P>
        <P>At the time of the launch of AEOS in 2010, a commitment was made to seek Commission approval for a number of amendments to the scheme, including an increase in the rate of payment for Natura land from &euro;75/ha, which was announced for the scheme, to &euro;150/ha. The Department sought the increase and was in negotiations with the Commission on this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 6 April 2011, I announced the opening of AEOS for receipt of applications in 2011 with an overall funding allocation of &euro;25 million per annum and a maximum payment to farmers of &euro;4,000 per annum.  The funding for the scheme had to be found within the expenditure ceilings for my Department as set out in the National Recovery Plan, 2011-2014 and I was faced with very difficult choices in deciding between competing priorities in the allocation funds to AEOS <Col N="544"/>and on the terms and conditions of the scheme. In the circumstances and in order to maximise the number of applicants who could be accommodated in the scheme, I decided that the rate of payment for Natura or designated land would be &euro;75/ha.</P>
        <P>The AEOS application received are being evaluated at present and the numbers of participants that can be accepted and the overall cost of the scheme in 2011 and subsequent years have yet to be determined. Irrespective of the final outcome in relation to the 2011 applications, the budgetary constraints and pressures remain and, in aggregate terms, the demands will continue to exceed the funds available. Accordingly, the question of savings on AEOS does not arise. Nevertheless, I am conducting an extensive review of all expenditure by my Department and once this is completed, I will review issues associated with AEOS, including the matter of the payments to farmers with designated land.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 525 and 528 together.</P>
        <P>Regulation (EC) 999/2001 as amended by regulation (EC) 727/2007 requires the annual testing of both sheep presented for human consumption and fallen sheep over 18 months of age.</P>
        <P>In 2007 the Commission adopted a level of testing for future years at a minimum annual sample of 10,000 sheep slaughtered for human consumption and 10,000 fallen sheep aged over 18 months.</P>
        <P>This testing regime was directed at Countries where the population of ewes and ewe lambs put to the ram exceeds 750,000. This change substantially reduced the testing requirement from previous years when 41,677 and 26,970 healthy sheep were tested respectively in 2006 and 2007.</P>
        <P>The testing requirements as set down by the EU are kept under review.</P>
        <P>The scrapie surveillance programme is financed by my Department. In turn this expenditure is recouped almost in its entirety from the EU. With regard to the fee imposed at meat factories my Department does not levy any charges against processors in respect of scrapie testing and any such charges that may be levied by the processors for such testing is a commercial matter between the processor and the farmer.</P>

	<P>The Foal Levy Scheme was introduced in 2000 on a statutory basis. The Levy is payable by all breeders whose foals are born and registered in Ireland. The rate of the levy is calculated by reference to the advertised value of the nomination fee of the stallion. There are six levy rate bands. The setting of the rates of the levy and the distribution of the funds is decided by the Board of Horse Racing Ireland based on the advice of its Foal Levy Committee which  includes representatives of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders&rsquo; Association (ITBA) and the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association (IFA).</P>
        <P>The proceeds of the levy are used by Horse racing Ireland to help fund the Irish Equine Centre, the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association and Irish Thoroughbred Marketing. These organisations provide key support structures to the Irish thoroughbred breeding industry.</P>

        <P>It is not the policy of the National Education Welfare Board or my Department to make available data on absenteeism in individual schools or in schools in a particular local area due to concerns about the way such information may be used to create school league tables.</P>
        <P>The underlying problems that militate against children and young people benefiting from education and reaching their potential are multifaceted and diverse and often the first indicator to these problems can be poor attendance and participation in school. Early interventions are key to reversing many of the underlying issues. Efforts have been greatly intensified in recent years to support and keep more young people in school so that they gain real benefits from their education experience.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NEWB has a responsibility to promote regular attendance at school and has adopted a multifaceted approach to meet this obligation, including raising awareness of the importance of school attendance among the community, providing information to parents, families and schools, commissioning research and disseminating findings, organising local and national campaigns in cooperation with schools and statutory and non-statutory agencies and contributing to policy formulation on education and related matters.</P><Col N="547"/>
        <P>While responsibility for the NEWB has transferred to my Department, the two Departments will work together to ensure that the services in the NEWB, including the SCP, HSCL and the EWS will have a renewed focus to more effectively target and support all children at risk.</P>

	<P>The Family Support Agency is responsible for the provision of family mediation to separating couples in Ireland. The Family Mediation Service is a free service which enables couples, married and non-married, who have decided to separate or divorce to negotiate the terms of their separation or divorce with the help of a trained mediator. The Family Mediation Service currently has 16 offices countrywide. </P>
        <P>A decision has been made, in principle, that the Family Mediation Service (FMS) will transfer from the Agency to the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence. This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to facilitate the use of mediation in family disputes in order to speed up the legal process, reduce costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings.  The detailed arrangements for the transfer of the FMS will be progressed in consultation with the Agency and other stakeholders.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Family Support Agency to compile the detailed information on rents paid in respect of the Family Mediation Service offices for each of the years requested and to forward it directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 535 and 536 together.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board is the statutory body with responsibility for school attendance. The Board compiles statistics based on attendance returns, at the end of each school year. The findings from these reports help to identify trends in school attendance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question on student absenteeism in the Dublin North-West constituency, I am informed that data in the format requested are not available on the basis of constituency breakdown. There are, however, data available for Co. Dublin in respect of the 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2008/09 school years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Analysis of these data indicates that 13.9%, 14.8% and 16.3% of primary pupils were absent for more than 20 days during the 2006/07, 2007/08, and 2008/09 school years respectively. The <Col N="548"/>figure for post-primary pupils was 18.3%, 19.6% and 18.8% for 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2008/09 respectively.</P>
        <P>The NEWB has issued information leaflets to parents, and run public awareness campaigns to raise the profile of school attendance. It also operates an Education Helpline to provide information on attendance and related matters.</P>
        <P>To provide for a single, more focussed structure at local, regional, and national levels, the remit of the National Educational Welfare Board was expanded to bring the Home School Community Liaison, the School Completion Programme, the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers and National Educational Welfare Service under one common management team.</P>
        <P>The School Completion Programme includes attendance tracking as one of its main preventative strategies. HSCL Coordinators work with parents to promote school attendance. These services are available to all schools participating in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the Action Plan for educational inclusion.</P>
        <P>This integrated approach is part of the government&rsquo;s overall approach to Transforming Public Services and will significantly benefit service delivery to children and their families and assist schools in meeting the challenges they face in tackling poor attendance and early school leaving.</P>

	<P>The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) 2000-2006 and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) 2006-2010,  have been implemented by the Childcare Directorate which is now part of my Department.  St. Canice&rsquo;s Community Action Ltd./The Learning Tree Childcare Centre, which is located in the Fr McGrath Centre, has been supported under both EOCP and NCIP initiatives.  </P><Col N="549"/>
        <P>Under the EOCP the service was approved a total of &euro;428,440 in capital grant funding  for the development of its childcare facility.  An EOCP staffing grant approved for the service from May 2001 and amounted to &euro;661,987.  In January 2008, with the conclusion of the EOCP, the staffing grant scheme was replaced by the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) under the NCIP.</P>
        <P>Under the CCSS, community services were required to make an annual return to the Childcare Directorate which recorded the actual level of disadvantage among parents using the service and the level of service being used.  The funding provided to services was passed on to qualifying parents in the form of reduced childcare fees.  To assist services to adapt to the new funding arrangements, transitional arrangements were put in place which guaranteed minimum payments, at gradually reducing levels, during 2008-2010.  In addition to subvention funding under the CCSS, the service in question received transitional funding of &euro;58,414 in 2008.  During 2008-2010, the service received subvention funding amounting to &euro;501,211.</P>
        <P>In September 2010, the transitional provisions under the CCSS ended and the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme was introduced in its place. The CCS continues to provide support to community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents. I understand that the service in question has been approved CCS funding of &euro;263,354 for the period September 2010 to August 2011.</P>
        <P>In addition, the service is participating in the Community Education and Training Support (CETS) programme  which was introduced in September 2010, replacing two previous childcare support schemes implemented by FAS and the VECs.  Under this programme, the Childcare Directorate of this Department pays a weekly capitation fee of &euro;170 to services for each contracted place and qualifying students and trainees can avail of these as free childcare places.  I understand that the Learning Tree was approved funding of &euro;40,280 in December 2010 under this programme.</P>
        <P>My Department also has responsibility for the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides a free pre-school year for eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  The service in question is also participating in this programme and has received a total of &euro;19,285 in funding for the school year which commenced in September 2010.</P>
        <P>Information relating to the number of staff employed in childcare facilities is not available to my Department.</P>

	<P>I will supply the information in relation to the level of funding granted to the project directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Following an evaluation in 2009 of the project to which the Deputy refers, it was decided to integrate the project with the School Completion Programme, as both projects share the same objectives and aims.

The aim and rationale for the Integrated Service is to provide more effective services for children who have difficulties participating in school; improved engagement with other agencies and services working with children and families; more effective policy making with an increased <Col N="551"/>emphasis on planning, outcome measurement and the gathering of evidence on the impact of interventions.</P>

	<P>Staff engaged on official travel are required to avail of public transport where possible and to use taxis and private transport only where no suitable public transport is available.  My Department will encourage the use of public transport by staff travelling to work by facilitating the Travel Pass Scheme (through which staff purchase annual public transport tickets, paid for by salary deductions) which is available to all staff who wish to avail of it. We also encourage staff to cycle to work by facilitating the purchase of suitable bicycles under the &lsquo;Cycle to Work&rsquo; Scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 543 and 544 together.</P>
        <P>As previously advised to the Deputy in answer to his PQ dated the 7th of June 2011, under the Children Act, 2001 a &ldquo;private foster care arrangement&rdquo; means any arrangement or undertaking whereby a child is for more than 14 days in the full time care, for reward or otherwise, of a person other than his or her parent or guardian, a person cohabiting with a parent or guardian or a relative. The person arranging or undertaking a private foster care arrangement shall give notice to the HSE not less than thirty days before the placement or in cases of  an unforeseen emergency, by both the person making the arrangement and the person undertaking the arrangement  as soon as practicable and not more than 14 days after the placement. These children are not in the care of the State and the HSE does not make these private foster care arrangements with relatives.</P><Col N="552"/>
        <P>The HSE ensures that the person undertaking the arrangement is complying with his or her duty to take all reasonable measures to safeguard the child&rsquo;s health, safety and welfare. In cases where the HSE believes that such measures are not being taken, it may apply to the District Court for a supervision order, to take the child into the care of the State or the return of the child to his or her parents or guardian, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Where a child is in the care of the State, the HSE will, where possible, place a child in foster care.  In the first instance, the HSE will seek a suitable relative or person known to the child to provide relative care. Relative carers go through an assessment and approval, in a similar way to general foster carers. The child is allocated a social worker who visits regularly and a Care Plan is developed and reviewed regularly based on the needs and wishes of the child. Currently foster/relative care services are provided directly by the HSE or by private foster care agencies on behalf of the HSE.</P>
        <P>My Office has asked the HSE to provide the information in relation to notifications received on private foster care arrangements directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Funding (YPFSF) of my Department was established in 1998 to assist in the development of preventative strategies/initiatives in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. </P>
        <P Just="Left">To date, the focus of the YPFSF has been on the areas worst affected by drugs, that is the 14 Local Drugs Task Force Areas (12 in Dublin, Bray and Cork) and in Galway, Limerick and Waterford Cities and Carlow Town. Since 1998, nearly &euro;180m has been allocated under the Fund for both capital and services projects. In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, in March 2008 it was announced that the Fund was being expanded to 4 additional towns &mdash; Arklow, Athlone, Dundalk and Wexford.</P>
        <P>The intention to expand the Fund to further areas would bring with it a requirement for capital funding. Given the uncertainty surrounding the fiscal environment, coupled with the fact that capital funding for the YPFSF has dropped from &euro;4.92 million in 2008 to an allocation of &euro;0.8 million for 2011, any further plans for expansion are currently on hold. In this context,  it is unlikely that there will be scope to expand the Fund to cover additional towns for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2010 the Director of the Office of Clinical Strategy and Programmes in the HSE met the Irish Consultant Neurologists&rsquo; Association <Col N="554"/>(Neurology Faculty) to discuss how best to move neurological services forward in Ireland. Following discussions it was agreed to appoint a number of Neurologists to lead three key national programmes, giving neurological care a major focus in the HSE. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The first programme deals with neurology out-patient departments and aims to provide standardised care for neurology patients and to increase access so that patients will not wait more than 30 days for an appointment.  The programme will establish referral guidelines and encourage the increased use of neurolink.</P>
        <P>The second programme deals with epilepsy services and aims to introduce rapid access clinics to assist with admission avoidance and reduce the number of attendances to emergency departments.</P>
        <P>The third programme deals with stroke services and aims to establish robust clinical governance systems for stroke care, including local stroke teams and regional stroke networks.</P>
        <P>The setting up of these programmes shows the importance that the HSE gives to neurological care and its commitment to improving access to neurological services.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the HSE has emphasised to my Department that all national programmes, including those concentrating on neurology, will have a focus on patient advocacy. These inter-related programmes aim to improve service quality, effectiveness and patient access and to ensure that patient care is provided in the service setting most appropriate to individuals&rsquo; needs.    I believe that the clinical programmes being developed by the HSE are vital to ensuring the most appropriate organisation of acute services.</P>
        <P>I welcome the action plan for neurological care by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, which emphasises the importance of neurological care and raises many issues that these Neurology programmes will address, including a comprehensive plan for improving neurological care including acute services and increasing staffing.</P>
        <P>In addition the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2011 includes a commitment to target people waiting for a neurology out-patient appointment, appoint a national clinical lead for neuro-rehabilitation and establish an implementation structure and develop an implementation plan for neuro-rehabilitation.</P>

	<P>There is a standard form of agreement between individual General Practitioners (GPs) and the HSE for the provision of services to medical card and GP visit card holders.  Such agreements are contingent <Col N="555"/>upon an agreement between the Minister and the Irish Medical Organisation which has itself been varied on a number of occasions over the years, by agreement between the parties.</P>
        <P>In summary, the agreement requires GPs to provide all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a GP and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which GPs cannot reasonably be expected to possess.  Under the Programme for Government, it is intended to develop a new contractual framework which will be more suited to current needs and will facilitate the planned development of Primary Care Services.</P>

This Government places great importance on the policies and practical reforms we are implementing to ensure patient safety and quality-assured health services.  Quality care and patient safety comes first for all residents of nursing homes, no matter what type of home.  In this regard, it is important to have effective mechanisms to maintain and enhance public confidence in the delivery of quality residential care.  The Health Act, 2007 provides this, with a regime designed to protect residents through an independent inspection and registration system. The primary legislation also defines what a designated centre is and the definition includes the care homes the Deputy refers to.</P>
        <P>All nursing homes for older people are subject to the same core standards in relation to quality and safety.  I am sure the Deputy will agree lessons have to be learned from the well publicised incidents in nursing homes.</P>
        <P>The Minister has no plans, at present, to amend the definition of nursing homes as set out in primary legislation.  However, the Department is currently reviewing the Health Act, 2007 (Care and Welfare Regulations of Residents in Designated Centres) Regulations 2009.  These regulations set out detailed requirements regarding, amongst other things, staffing and environmental considerations for all nursing homes. The nature and status of the care homes the Deputy is referring to will be borne in mind in the context of the review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 572 and 573 together.</P>
        <P>Health care Association Infections (HCAIs) continue to be a challenge for health care systems worldwide.  Ireland is not unique in this regard and tackling HCAIs here continues to be a priority for the Government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).</P>
        <P>Good infection control practices includes adherence to standard precautions when caring for all patients and using transmission based precautions when appropriate (for example, if a patient has diarrhoea, the patient should be cared for with contact precautions).  Standard precautions includes hand hygiene (using alcohol hand rub or antiseptic soap) as specified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) 5 moments of hand hygiene and appropriate environmental and equipment cleaning/decontamination.</P>
        <P>The professional advice received by officials of my Department is that the wearing of white coats and ties are personal rather than infection control matters.  Standard professional practice includes regular laundering of white coats as with any item of personal clothing and if wearing a neck tie, when examining a patient to tuck the tie into the shirt (between buttons) to avoid it draping over the patient.</P>
        <P>Recently published reports indicate that there is no scientific evidence that a bare below the elbows policy reduces contamination on health care workers hands.  However, common sense would dictate that hands are easier to clean if sleeves are shorter rather than longer (rolled up or short sleeves).</P>
        <P>Irish hand hygiene guidelines recommend that in preparation for hand hygiene, all wrist and hand jewellery (except plain wedding bands) must be removed and that shirts should have short or turn up sleeves.  Standard practice is that if a person is wearing long sleeves, in order for hands to be effectively decontaminated the sleeves must be rolled up before hand hygiene.  The recent WHO Hand Hygiene Day on 5 May built on the successful &ldquo;WHO Clean Care is Safer Care&rdquo;<b> </b>campaign to galvanise hand hygiene at the point of patient care, thus helping to reduce the spread of HCAIs.  As part of the day&rsquo;s actions, health care facilities world wide demonstrated their continued commitment by signing up to the global movement and undertaking and sharing locally driven activities on hand hygiene improvements at the point of patient care.  I am pleased to state that as of 3rd May, some 85 HSE health care facilities had signed up to the initiative which demonstrates Irish health care personnel&rsquo;s commitment to the control and eradication of HCAIs.</P>
        <P>I note the decrease of 40% in the number of MRSA cases reported between 2006 and 2009, and the fact that preliminary figures for 2010 indicate that this downward trend is continuing.  I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of health care Associated Infections and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2008 consultants&rsquo; contract includes measures to strengthen the management, monitoring and control of activity in hospitals with a view to ensuring that the level of consultant private practice within public hospitals does not exceed the permitted ratio &mdash; 20% for new consultants, up to 30% for those who had such a level previously.  The HSE in conjunction with the ESRI has introduced a range of new measurement systems in order to meet the requirements of the contract.</P>
        <P>Since January 2009 each consultant is issued with a monthly public/private mix measurement report.  This documents the consultant&rsquo;s activity in relation to inpatient, daycase, outpatient and diagnostic activity over the previous three months.  The contract provides that the employer may require the consultant to remit monies in respect of any private practice excess to a research and study fund.</P>
        <P>At this juncture the focus of the HSE is on consultants who have been identified as engaging in as much as 50% private activity despite the passing of both the 9 month period allowed for resolution of the issue in the Contract and substantial additional periods of time for remittance of private fees. In January the HSE wrote to these consultants informing them that if they did not remit the required amount they would be required to cease private practice in respect of any segment of practice where they are in excess of the ratio specified in their contracts.  It also advised them that as employer it would reserve the right  to invoke the Disciplinary Procedure specified at Appendix II of the Contract.  The more detailed information sought by the Deputy is not readily available.  However I have asked the Health Service Executive to supply this information to me and I will forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Our health services, as with all health systems, require managers and administrators to run effectively and staff in the grades mentioned are essential in this regard.  As well as senior managers, there are a large number of staff in the Management/Administrative category who are of direct service to the public including consultants&rsquo; secretaries, out-patient department personnel and medical records staff as well as other essential non-front-line staff in payroll, human resource management, IT, staff fulfilling legislative and information requirements and service managers.  However we need to maintain a tight control on the number of managers and administrative staff in the health service. This is necessary to ensure that we have streamlined and effective structures and also to enable staffing resources to be focused to the maximum extent on front-line patient care.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the Health Service Executive involved the abolition of the health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and a number of other statutory bodies in the health sector and the transfer of functions and staff into the new national organisation.    Certain functions and staff also transferred from the Department of Health and Children to the HSE.  The HSE has absorbed a further eight bodies since 2005, as part of the continued rationalisation of State bodies.</P>
        <P>After the HSE&rsquo;s establishment it was necessary to ensure that services continued to be provided and that necessary management and administrative functions were discharged while new regional and national structures were developed and put in place.  As the HSE established new national-level functions and the regional structures underpinning these, appointments were made to the senior management positions involved.</P>
        <P>One of the objectives of the Employment Control Frameworks in the health sector has been to limit the number of staff in management and administration  posts. However the focus is not just on limiting numbers; the current Framework specifically provides for the creation of a range of front-line posts in different professions, such as social workers, speech and language therapists and physiotherapists, notwithstanding the general moratorium in recruitment across the public services.  It is important to note that the recent Voluntary Early Retirement/Voluntary Redundancy schemes resulted in a reduction of 2,025 staff or 1,626 WTE in health employment from the beginning of 2011. These targeted schemes resulted in 1,348 (1,079 WTE) fewer staff in the management/administration category.</P>
        <P>However I note that the CEO of the HSE has indicated in the HSE&rsquo;s Annual Report 2010 that significant challenges remain in terms of achieving integrated and cohesive management in the HSE.  It continues to be my view that, in addressing these issues, the numbers of senior management posts and administrative posts in the health sector generally need to be kept under review and that front-line services are protected as far as possible. Consideration is being given to a new voluntary scheme.</P>

	<P>The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) commissioned two reports in early 2010 on the framework for the delivery of family risk assessment clinics and associated genetic services for patients at risk of hereditary breast and colorectal cancer.  The reports are intended to assist with the organisation and development of an integrated cancer control and screening service for those with an inherited familial predisposition to these cancers and were submitted to the National Cancer Control Programme in February, 2010. </P>
        <P>The NCSS was subsumed into the HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) in April, 2010.  The NCCP is examining the reports in the context of developing an appropriate service to manage familial and hereditary cancer.   The NCCP will prioritise familial cancer in its Corporate Plan 2011 &mdash; 2013.    In the meantime, anyone with concerns about cancer should contact their GP, who will advise on the most appropriate action to be taken.</P>

	<P>My Department does not have plans to develop a national strategy on Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease.  From a disability perspective, the focus of any health or personal social service support is to facilitate full participation in the social and economic life of the community.  The extent and description of the supports required must be consistent with the person&rsquo;s individual needs.  The focus of health service provision for people with a disability is not a medical diagnosis.  The Disability Act 2005 provides for, among other things, an individual assessment of need, a person centred service statement and the provision of individualised supports.  This policy moves away from the provision of segregated, health-based, group services for people with a disability.</P>
        <P>As such, when policies, strategies and action plans are in development in relation to persons with a disability, people with many conditions, including Parkinson&rsquo;s, are included.</P>

	<P>Prior to the introduction of the point of sale advertising prohibitions provided for under the Public Health Tobacco Acts 2002 -2004, representatives of the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) sought a meeting with the Department to explore the possibilities of an exemption from the advertising ban.  Following the meeting, the DAA  submitted a proposal to the then Minister that they believed was still within the spirit of the legislation.  The DAA, in their submission to the Minister, cited competition from UK airports as one of the reasons why an exemption should be considered for duty free premises.  The proposal was considered by the then Minister and on foot of this, a proposal was put to the Government to amend the legislation. </P>
        <P>Section 33 of the Public Health Tobacco Acts 2002-2004 originally prohibited the advertisement of tobacco products in all retail premises; however, the legislation was amended in 2009 to provide an exemption for &ldquo;duty free premises&rdquo; whereby they would be allowed to have on permanent display, a pictorial list of the tobacco products sold in their outlets.  The exemption from the point of sale retail prohibition requested by the DAA was provided for in respect of all duty free premises.</P>

	<P>Under the General Medical Services (GMS) contract, a general practitioner (GP) is expected to provide his/her patients who hold medical cards or GP visit cards with all proper and necessary treatment of a kind generally undertaken by a GP.  Where blood tests form part of the investigation and necessary treatment of patients&rsquo; symptoms or conditions, these should be provided free of charge to medical card and GP visit card holders.  The HSE also points out that, in many GP surgeries, it is the practice nurse who takes blood samples.  The HSE significantly subsidises the cost of employing practice nurses.</P>
        <P>The HSE has recently reported to my officials that it has received approximately 30 formal complaints regarding GPs charging GMS patients for blood tests and there have also been a significant number of queries to the HSE&rsquo;s National Information Line about this issue.  Formal complaints will be dealt with through the HSE&rsquo;s Consumer Affairs Service.</P>
        <P>I have requested the HSE to write to GPs pointing out their obligations under their contract in this regard.  In the meantime, I would invite patients to follow up with the HSE if they believe they are being wrongly charged.</P>

	<P>Staff engaged on official travel are required to avail of public transport where possible and to use taxis and private transport only where no suitable public transport is available.  My Department directly encourages the use of public transport by staff travelling to work by facilitating the Travel Pass Scheme (through which staff purchase annual public transport tickets, paid for by salary deductions) which is available to all staff who wish to avail of it.</P>
        <P>We also encourage staff to cycle to work by facilitating the purchase of suitable bicycles under the &lsquo;Cycle to Work&rsquo; Scheme.</P>

In the interim, I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the Executive for reply.</P>
        <P>The scheduling of patients for hospital treatment is a matter for the consultant concerned in each case and is determined on the basis of clinical need.  Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant involved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 632, 634 and 636 together.</P>
        <P>Arising from the findings of the Study a sub-group of the Traveller Health Advisory Committee met and agreed priority areas for action.  These are: Mental Health; Suicide; Men&rsquo;s Health; Addiction/Alcohol; Domestic Violence; Diabetes and Cardiovascular Health.  Existing resources allocated to Traveller health will be focused towards addressing these priority areas.</P>
        <P>The recommendations in the Study also identify that the poor health status of Travellers is the result of the various social determinants which impact on health outcomes; for example education and environment which may in turn be further impacted on by stereotypes which surround Travellers.  Addressing these challenges will require cross sectoral action in addition to the health sector to address.  The National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee and the High Level Group on Traveller Issues are the cross sectoral groups which will have a primary role to play in facilitating these issues going forward.</P>
        <P>The Equality Authority, as part of its remit to promote equality, has been working with community and voluntary organisations to implement a strategy to combat stereotyping.  In this context, the Authority is supporting Galway Traveller Movement to implement a project to facilitate dialogue between key decision-makers and representatives of the Traveller community on challenging stereotypical attitudes towards each other with a view to improving service delivery to Travellers.</P>

	<P>Ireland was represented by the Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU and by the Health Attach&eacute; at the EPSCO Health Council in Luxembourg on 6 June, at which the E-coli outbreak was discussed.  Commissioner Dalli provided an update on the situation and reported that the Commission was in daily communication with food safety and public health authorities and outlined that a priority was to identify the source of the contamination.  The importance of strong coordination at EU level was also stressed.  Member States expressed solidarity with Germany and the other countries affected by the outbreak.  There was a call for better coordination of messages to the public.  The importance of basing alert statements on evidence was stressed though it was acknowledged that it is not always easy to choose between acting as soon as possible, at the risk of spreading mistaken information, or waiting to have reliable information before taking action, at the risk of seeing the epidemic spread still further.  There was also an extraordinary meeting of Agriculture Council on 7 June which dealt exclusively with the E-coli situation.</P>
        <P>The recent E-coli outbreak in Germany continues to be the subject of meetings between the food control authorities in all the EU Member States including the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Commission and the World Health Organisation Office for Europe.  These meetings have been taking place on an almost daily basis since the outbreak was declared.   In addition detailed information is circulated through the EU&rsquo;s Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, for which the FSAI is the national contact point in Ireland.</P>
        <P>An important  aspect of this outbreak is that  those who were  ill or tragically died were in Germany or  had a history of recent travel to Germany.  There have been no cases in Ireland and the specific strain of E-coli has not been found here.  The problem was clearly one relating to contamination of food in Germany and this has since been confirmed by the Authorities in Germany, who have traced the contamination to a local producer of organic sprouted seeds, and linked consumption of those sprouts to those who fell ill.  Laboratory tests have since isolated the outbreak strain of <i>E. coli </i>  (VTEC) O104:H4 in the sprouts from the implicated local producer.  The implicated production plant is now closed and none of the organic seed sprouts from this plant were exported from Germany.</P><Col N="579"/>
        <P>The FSAI  are providing regular briefings to my Department and are providing public information on its website and are dealing with numerous queries from the print press and other media.  I am satisfied that they have managed the incident and are continuing to do so in an effective and proportionate manner.</P>
        <P>The FSAI are continuing to monitor the situation and will provide updates to my Department as necessary.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government published in March 2011 has committed to completing and implementing the National Positive Aging Strategy so that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives.  It is being developed within the constraints posed by the present fiscal situation.  It is not the intention that it will propose new service developments; rather it will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.  It is envisaged that the Strategy will set out a common framework for the development of operational plans by Government Departments clearly setting out their objectives relating to older people, as well as the development of ongoing mechanisms designed to monitor progress and identify challenges facing older people in the future.</P>
        <P>Development of the Strategy is being assisted by a Cross-Departmental Group (CDG), comprised of officials from 11 Government Departments, the Central Statistics Office and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and is chaired by the Director of the Office for Older People.  An NGO Liaison Group comprising representatives of twelve national-level non-governmental organisations with an interest in older people&rsquo;s issues has been established under an independent chair.</P>
        <P>Research has been commissioned on national strategies for older people in other jurisdictions.  The Strategy will also take cognisance of other strategies and policy documents developed in Ireland over the past decade, and the strategy will be underpinned by the <i>UN Principles for Older Persons,</i> the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s <i>Active Aging: A Policy Framework</i> (2002), and the <i>Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging</i>   (2002).</P>
        <P>The development of the Strategy will also be informed by information gained through a public consultation process.  A call for written submissions was issued in June 2009 and 190 submissions were received from a broad range of stakeholders.  Following the written consultation process, a series of nine consultation meetings was held from March to May 2010.  These meetings, attended by approx 1200 people, were held in Cork, Sligo, Galway, Kildare, Wexford, Newcastle West, Dundalk, Dublin and Athlone.  Meetings were also held in April 2010 with groups representing vulnerable and marginalised older people.  A round-table meeting was also held with stakeholders involved in the Louth Age Friendly County Initiative with a view to learning more about the approaches taken in relation to older people&rsquo;s issues in County Louth.</P>
        <P>A report on the consultation process to highlight issues which older people and service providers raised was finalised and published on 22 November 2010.  The report also outlines other relevant background information.</P>
        <P>Work on the preparation of the Strategy and the development of monitoring and review structures and processes are on-going in consultation with the groups listed above. The publication of the Strategy is expected in the latter half of 2011.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to change the nursing home scheme to ensure that the same participation criteria applies to elderly members of the farming community as to other citizens in terms of financial contribution from the value of their family home. </Quest>
        <QRef>[15113/11]</QRef>
      </Qst><Col N="581"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, individuals contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 5% of the value of any assets per annum towards their cost of care.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The scheme includes a safeguard that nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.</P>
        <P>An individual&rsquo;s principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the 15% or three year cap.  It means that individuals pay a 5% contribution based on their principal residence for a maximum of three years regardless of the time they spend in nursing home care.  After 3 years, even if an individual is still in long-term nursing home care, they will not pay any further contribution based on the principal residence.  This three year cap applies regardless of whether an individual chooses to opt for the loan or not.  The intention of this three year cap is to protect the family home.</P>
        <P>The three year cap also extends to farms and businesses in circumstances where:</P>
        <P LI="1">i. the person has suffered a sudden illness or disability which causes them to need long-term nursing home care, and</P>
        <P LI="1">ii. the person or their partner was actively engaged in the daily management of the farm or business up until the time of the sudden illness or disability,</P>
        <P LI="1">and</P>
        <P LI="1">iii. a family successor certifies that he or she will continue the management of the farm or business.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the case of couples, the measure applies where the applicant suffered a sudden and unforeseen illness and either or both members of the couple have been engaged in the running of the family farm or business.  This stipulation is in keeping with the key principle of joint assessment of couples.</P>
        <P>The three year cap was extended to farms and businesses at Report Stage in the D&aacute;il because a number of Deputies and farming interest groups, expressed concern, at both Second and Committee Stages, about the treatment of farms under the legislation.  In particular, there was concern about the potential impact of the 5% annual contribution on the sustainability of family farms and businesses, specifically, in situations where care is required from an early age and for a prolonged period.</P>
        <P>This measure is intended to ensure the financial sustainability of farms and businesses in cases where a person suffered a sudden illness and did not have an opportunity to put appropriate succession arrangements in place. It affords additional protection because it ensures that a person&rsquo;s maximum contribution is fully quantifiable.</P>
        <P>If a farm or business has been transferred more than five years prior to an individual&rsquo;s application for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, the asset will not be taken into account at all in the course of the financial assessment.  The Minister for Health does not propose to review the legislation at present. Individuals in possession of such assets may already avail of the three year cap where they have not had an opportunity to put succession arrangements in place.  In contrast, the 5% contribution based on assets other than the principal residence or farms and businesses that meet the criteria outlined above is ongoing for the duration of the individual&rsquo;s time in long-term nursing home care.</P>

        <P>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects, including the N14 and the N56 roads, are matters for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.</P>
        <P>Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s questions to the NRA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</P>

	<P>Prior to 3 December, 2009, Ministerial approval was sought for increases in standard single fares by CIE and by the Railway Procurement Agency(RPA) in the case of Luas fares.</P>
        <P>In October 2007, the CIE companies applied for a fares increase of 8-10% to cover increased operating costs and the provision of additional services.  The RPA sought an increase of 4.15% in Luas fares to cover additional costs and to offset the cost of their asset renewals programme.  Ministerial approval was granted for an average 5% increase in CIE fares and 4.15% increase in Luas fares with effect from 1 January, 2008.</P>
        <P>In September, 2008 CIE submitted an application for a 20% fare increase due to a decline in the Group&rsquo;s finances as a result of increasing fuel, labour and other costs, the loss of fuel duty rebate and changing demand for services.  The RPA  also applied for an average 6.1% increase in fares in the light of declining passenger numbers and to provide for longer term <Col N="584"/>assets replacement costs.  In December, 2008 an average 10% fare increase was approved for CIE and an average 6% increase was approved in respect of Luas fares, with immediate effect.</P>
        <P>There were no fare increases sought or granted in 2009.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 659, 660, 663 and 665 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies may be aware, there is a recognition within the Programme for Government of the importance of the Rural Transport Programme.  Specifically the Programme states that &ldquo;the rural transport network is vital for rural communities as a reliable and sustainable transport service.  We will maintain and extend the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) with other local transport services as much as is practicable.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>With regard to the current position, over &euro;10 million is being provided for RTP in 2011.  Thirty-six rural community transport groups around the country are being funded under the Programme and are working towards maximising coverage in their operational areas having regard to local public transport service needs and the availability of resources.  The Free Travel Scheme of the Department of Social Protection applies to all services operated under the Rural Transport Programme.</P>
        <P>However, I understand that charges are being applied to certain rural transport services in County Donegal which are not open to the general public.  Those services are not provided under my Department&rsquo;s Rural Transport Programme but are operated under contract with the Health Services Executive (HSE).</P>
        <P>Pobal administers the RTP on behalf of my Department and is responsible, among other things, for allocating funds to individual rural community transport groups from funding provided by my Department.  Neither I nor my Department have any role in relation to the day-to-day management issues pertaining to the Programme or in allocating funds to particular groups.</P>
        <P>A Value for Money and Policy Review of the Rural Transport Programme was commissioned by the previous government and has now been completed. I have just received a copy of the  Review Report  which  I intend to publish later this year following consideration by Government.</P>

	<P>Decisions regarding the location and operation of taxi ranks on public roads, as well as funding for the provision of taxi ranks, are primarily matters for the relevant local authority.  Under section 84 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended, a local authority is empowered to make by-laws in respect of the places at which taxis may stand for hire.  The making of such by-laws is a reserved function of a local authority.  The National Transport Authority (NTA) is a statutory body responsible for the regulation of the taxi sector under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.  With regard to taxi ranks, the NTA&rsquo;s responsibility relates to the issue of guidance on the planning, design and provision of taxi ranks aimed at improving taxi services to the public, better designed pick-up locations for taxi operators and greater integration of taxi services with the wider public transport system.</P>

	<P>Grant aid for urgently required safety works at Donegal Airport including replacement of the airport&rsquo;s localiser system (instrument landing system) and the reconfiguration and overlay of the airport&rsquo;s runway is currently being provided by my Department to the airport.  I understand this work is well under way and should be completed within the next few months.  As Donegal Airport is a private company, any future plans for the further upgrading of the airport are a matter for the airport management.  As decided by Government last week, in the light of the current financial crisis, capital funding will only be provided for necessary safety and security related work at the regional airports in the coming years.  A tender process for the renewal of the PSO air services contracts for the Donegal to Dublin and Kerry to Dublin routes was launched on 3 May 2011.  It is anticipated that new contracts for a period of three years will be put in place by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government recently announced a comprehensive review of capital spending which is now under way.  The review will examine capital proposals across all sectors of the economy to establish a set of priority projects and programmes that will support economic recovery and provide new employment opportunities.  The results will form the basis of a new National Development Plan.  The preparation of the new framework requires my Department to review all existing projects and programmes.  The review will also take account of new funding realities.  A major priority will be to ensure funding to protect and maintain investment made to date and to maintain high safety standards.  This will of necessity restrict the funding for new projects, with only those offering the highest return having any prospect of being prioritised.  As part of the review process, all agencies funded by my Department have been asked to make submissions supporting their programmes and setting priorities in a scenario of reduced allocations.  Submissions have recently been received from the National Transport Authority, the Railway Procurement Agency and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in relation to public transport projects.  These submissions are being examined by my officials and they will inform my Department&rsquo;s conclusions on  the capital review.  I will not speculate on the outcome of the review.  However, I have already said that, given the funding constraints and the uncertainty about the available of private funding for major Irish infrastructure projects,  it is likely that only one of the major Dublin area projects can proceed in the period to 2016.  I will be seeking to try and secure that outcome if possible.</P>

It is open to any organisation with a suitable project to apply for funding under any future round of the sports capital programme.  Information on the sports capital programme, including the most recently used application form and guidelines, are available on the Department&rsquo;s, website <i>www.dttas.ie</i>.
